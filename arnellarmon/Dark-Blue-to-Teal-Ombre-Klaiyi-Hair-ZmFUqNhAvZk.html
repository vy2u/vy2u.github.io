its hair color
most of my snapchat a lot of you guys
like it it's kind of shocking to me then
I'm really with it kinda because
sometimes I wake up on my damn I want to
do this hair color today and I'll post
this horror I think it's really cool but
I ever only interested in because I
understand that I everyone wants to walk
around blue tail hair but according to
my snapchat a lotta guys like it so I'm
having to be filming this because um I
don't know you just never know what
people like and what they don't like
but you guys like this this is a dark
blue - teal ombre
I hope my camera's picking up on this
color I'm sitting in my living room
right if I'm mcafee to get natural
Lighting's you guys see what the hair
looks like in natural lighting because
of my studio the lights almost
completely washed him out and so um I
was gonna film in there so before I talk
about how that this color I'm topic it's
terribly fast they must say fast me fast
I'm anything bad to say Milo you're
being so good anyways this hair is from
this coming right here I'm inserted so
I'm not gonna Bears myself I don't know
how to say the name don't my little ears
he's he just wants attention um but I
don't know how to say the name so I'm
answering it now they said look out
child now like I'm freaking baby
yaki get him he wants your attention
don't let me on the bed please get the
little cover that's in his crate and
take it and let it gonna fit
Hey ears the ears wants attention he
wants attention he wants up did Jun what
are you doing I'm filming dude got you
some energy goddess oh say my ears it's
great time for the ears say my ears
anyways before I was interrupted this
hair is from and this coming right here
I don't across her name I want to see it
like clay clay I click I don't know I
really don't know but I inserted so
that's all you need to know now this
Sydney four bundles a loose weight and
this what it looks like I have one more
bundle left and they sent me a frontal
now the frontals Brazilian but there is
Brazilian hair but the frontals body
wave where is where the bundles are
loose wave I guess they didn't have a
loose wave front toes soft okay it's
cool if I want little swig to send me a
body a frontal it really doesn't matter
once you like dine style and you really
can't tell the difference and so this
one was good natural state I'm gonna
what I'm showing how I got the hair and
you guys will see with the bundles of
I've unravel because it looks slightly
different unraveled but this hair is
really nice I did that is bundle because
I didn't wanna buy more hair dye hair is
expensive and I simply didn't know how
to buy more to die more hair and so I
just made the hair dye work for the
three bundles and the frontal cuz if you
are friends with a family length you
have you really only need three bundles
and you have like 30 inches of hair you
probably need four bundles but if you
have
anything short and that you really just
need three and so I wasn't it always
sometimes I'm just kind of you I didn't
need it which I didn't now as far as my
thoughtfulness hair I have another
necklace a whatsoever
this hair died very easily this hair
bleached very easily
it didn't get super blond which I will
take know that it didn't get super blond
I know if I were to process it more
probably would have got more blond I
just don't want damaged it too much I
didn't live super well but it did bleach
well enough for me to put this color in
it so that's cool with me I've
experienced no Shetty no tingling which
I I don't expect from body wave wave
hair the only time I expect some
tangling and some slightly Chinese when
I have curly hair if the hair isn't
curly it should not be tangling in order
to not be shedding if it does and that's
a problem but I'm experiencing no shaggy
no tingling I'm ruining my wave so let
me stop but I got the next aim of the
hair it colored you well as you can see
gave me no issues whatsoever in my mouth
and I'm yeah I'm hair it has a really
nice luster to it as you see I have no
oil in his hair so it has a very nice
natural shine and yeah I have nothing
interesting whatsoever I know it's kind
of boring I feel like people during the
reviews they want some type of
controversy but I haven't anything to
say so
it's all up to the color so let me scoot
over because I'm actually going to
insert what I'm doing while I'm talking
because I fill this whole entire process
I didn't fill myself leach in the bundle
is not a reason for that that was
intentional it's because I always show
ourself bleaching hair so I thought it I
don't want to become too repetitive I
don't know I just I do the same thing
each time and what I'm gonna do is I'll
just insert links down below of my other
hair tutorials where I did show myself
bleach my hair so see what I'm doing but
it's the boss it's so simple so I showed
myself dying some of the frontal I am
meant to record myself dying a bundle I
don't know what the wrong back whose
sworn film that part but I didn't which
is so weird so I'm just going to talk
while show you guys I'm doing so it just
makes more sense until it's more helpful
so first things first two dyes I use to
get the dark blue color
they're by age beautiful your friends at
Sally's it's weird because your products
aren't that like oh what is that like
these boxes like I've seen it at Sally's
and I on I could go towards them you
wouldn't expect these to be a certain I
thought he's a bit Brown you know
anything I thought it'd be like lame but
feel look closely says dark blue and
darkest blue and Sybok is a few months
ago so I thought okay maybe I'll use in
one day which I did and I in a mix these
two now you don't need both these dyes
after Diana's hair and learn you don't
need both of these I would recommend
just getting the darkness blue or if you
want a slightly lighter the dark blue
but it's really not huge difference at
all
but if you have three bundles of frontal
you will need two boxes so if you want
to get both colors you can but you don't
need both colors if that makes sense now
before the tips of this hair I've mixed
a lot of dye I'm gonna take us a day I
use them tell you guys dye that you
really need I just like me
you just never know what you come up
with and so I use this ion color
brilliance brights aqua hair dye and so
with this aqua hair dye I also mixed in
this clover color this is the color that
you will need it's by a door and has
green tint to it and that helped me get
this teal color right here
you will need this color and that also
makes two indigo blue if you don't want
have to go to Sally's which I mean you
will fee to the dark blue so let me now
say that you could mix these two colors
together and you will get you know
something close to this however I don't
like ion dyes um I've learned that I'm
not a huge fan of using the door guys
alone because I don't think they're
super pigmented if you have like
platinum blonde hair then these are
great however view bleached hair that
you haven't toned it just I don't know
they're not my favorite dyes ever they
have a lot of colors but there's a way
you have to work with them to get them
to really be bright and so that's why I
mixed with this one because this one I
knew this will show up but mix all three
these together really got me the pygmy
and the color that I was going for and
so I would recommend these three if you
like this teal color and so in this
little clip I'm gonna insert if I
haven't inserted already I'm just
showing you guys me dye my frontal I
started to do the frontal first because
I never shown myself dyeing my frontal
so I always show myself deine the
bundles well front holds it's harder it
takes a long time because you depart in
between each of those section not make
sure you don't get down release and it's
just very tedious it's kind of annoying
that the bundles the super duper breeds
it's super easy it's not weird at all
so what you do is you leader just with a
dark color on the roots and
then you put the same color at the tip
color on the tips now if you wanted this
seamless flawless opera effect all you
have to do is instead of like some
people I notice when they have that
those choppy hombres wears like color
line color it's because I think they're
not bringing bull fusing the two
together and so when you put the dark
color first and a light color mix the
light color dark color together don't be
scared for the two to touch because
that's how you get the most seamless
like ombre you can think of and so
that's like the tip I would give is to
make sure you're mixing them so that way
it just flows perfectly together
like this right here and that's pretty
much it um I hate myself for not showing
myself diet but a little bit I thought
that would have been a little more
helpful however I did talk on this video
so hopefully my talking helped you know
I showed you guys what you guys need all
of you listen up below I'll probably put
some links the only thing is so now I
don't like getting links from Sally's
because they're very very long and I
just think that makes what the
description box looks look kind of like
floppy so the links are too long you
won't be there however if I can find
short links I will insert the links if
not just and certain names and
everything and what store it got them at
but that's pretty much it if you guys um
I post this video because a lot of us
like on snapchat a lot who were asking
hey did you feel this process yes I
thrown as much as I can I really hope
that the clip I did include was as
helpful as possible if you did find this
video helpful if you liked it give me a
thumbs up and subscribe all the details
to this hair and everything will be down
below like always and um if you have any
other colors you guys want me to try or
you know just test out if physic hair
color you want to but you're not sure
how to get it you can always tell me and
I can
you know I don't mind going on spending
the money by this stuff to try to figure
out how to get that color and I'll film
it and I'd be actually filming show like
the whole process and everything and I'm
hopefully tilted somewhat I don't mind
trying any color because I love colors
I'm not afraid of any colors so if you
have any recommendations just comment
down below and that's pretty much it you
guys hope history this video like I said
thumbs up subscribe all that good stuff
