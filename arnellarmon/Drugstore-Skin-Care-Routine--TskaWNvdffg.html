drugstore skincare routine I've accident
using all drugstore products from
skincare routine like the last prior
Phil last month now and laughs you have
an acne offense tutorial or this routine
so that's what I'm going to do alright
so first I'm gonna take my face wash
which is the clean clear morning burst I
know you guys have prized seen us before
because it's something that everybody
loves and I know why not like this
Clemson because like it says on the
bottle it wakes you up they're not just
trying to sell you the product it is
very true whenever I use this makes
people alert I think it's a little beads
it's just something about it that's very
very fresh now I've been using this I've
been using this since I was probably
like 15 16
now I stopped and I started using my
philosophy purity my philosophy and I
also use this one tar cleanser you know
I got a little bit she got a little
high-end but then I was like I was
shopping at Walmart and I was like I
want to buy this again just to see if it
still works just as good as I remember
it working I just want me I like using
planters that just gets rid of my makeup
I don't use cleansers for any like type
of treatment
I like this cleanse it because it does
have salicylic acid and any type of acne
treatment which I don't need a lot of
cleansers they have different skin
treatments and I feel like if you have
pretty average skin or normal skin I
feel like you should stay away from
cleansers that have different treatments
in it because you technically be treat
sup that's not there um darn you
airplane
it was color ruin my videos they just
racks me it's very annoying alright I'll
wait
so gone
all right basically my theory on
cleansers moisturizers is don't treat
things that you know they don't even be
treated now it's cool to get
moisturizers and stuff like that that
are proactive like say you want to
prevent lines and wrinkles and it's okay
to use moisturizers that are can prevent
that but you're getting a cleanser
that's for acne and you don't have acne
you could potentially be making your
skin worse so that's just my theory and
I'm sticking to it
all right now with this cleanser I like
using my baby planet spin brush now yes
I'm still missing the back if you see my
last can care routine you know that now
this isn't drugstore so it's totally
optional I'm choosing because it's what
I use um honestly this brush I like
because it makes my skin feel more clean
it really like gets in there but it's
not you won't die if you don't have it I
just I recommend it but you won't die
that's all I'm gonna say
now in my last video and relaxing hair
video I was using this brush head I've
since switched to well it's all white
can't see it this look this little
spongy brush head I like this one much
more in my last video you guys know i
said i will use this brush every single
day oh it's like like it's a little too
harsh i don't think it's necessary to
use every single day exercise switch to
this brush head i am able to use every
single day because this one's way more
it's like it's for sensitive skin it's
way more gentle and i just i like it way
better than this one because this one
because it's like plastic it's easy to
clean whereas this one it's harder to
clean you know your foundation gets in
it i don't know because even my
foundations off the bottom of it it's
hard to clean or this one it's easy to
clean so overall this one wins and
that's why I've been using so just
knowing that I know a lot of people who
use this brush they use other brush head
and it's cool to use that I just believe
you have more sensitive skin like I do
this brush is better with this brush
heads better so just saying I do have a
cold for this brush so Appling
description must be lower probably I'll
edit in this video but like I said it's
not a brush that you won't die without
it it's just if you want a deeper
cleansing cleaning cleansing whatever if
you want just gonna get your clean I
would recommend the brush like I said
you won't die and I won't be
mad at you your skin money value I mean
they have a lot of little brushes like
this types like this one because I've
had it I've been using them for like
over a year now
they last every a long time like they
have a lot of different parts like this
at Walmart's like that and I try one
before but they don't last that long
like they break down on you and it's
like okay that's annoying but this one
I've had it this one has been through a
lot as you can tell like this should be
going through so much I was dropping in
the shower I leave on the shower floor I
don't know how the part where the
batteries I don't know how it has
arrested out let me out cheeks myself
but I just go around it and I avoid the
eye area for the most part I did not
believe in putting spin brushes around
your eyes tech like this the air the
skin around your eye area is very
sensitive and delicate and I don't think
it needs any extra tension or any
pulling around that area so I avoid my
eye area and use my fingers for that if
I'm wearing eye shadow gotta get them
nose
hate my nose well like not my nose but I
hate that like my pores on my nose but
I've been using pork strips that I will
show you this video they actually work
and they feel good okay by the way this
has two settings I use a slower roll and
I collect the faster ones too intense
for me and I don't need all that so I
don't rinse my face and I'll be right
back okay
so I rinse my face I'm gonna pet in a
little bit mm-hmm just dry me okay now
we're onto my face mask own oh one thing
i noticed that when i use this brush
head versus the other one my skin is
less red afterwards um just sayin
so that means it's obvious that it's
much more sensitive it's much more
gentle because with this brush head I
like it you know I would enjoin it but I
did notice that my skin would be a
little red and I think that was sign
that was maybe a little too harsh for me
so just putting it out there now I'm
going to do mask I'm gonna do to this
comes a mask
kinda we'll see I'm going to use this
Noxzema classic clean original deep
cleans in matte a original deep
cleansing mask I'm pretty sure you've
heard of it if you had heard of any
price smelt it because it has like the
best smell ever
oh my god oh this masks been my life for
a long time because something my mom
used to use is she got like the big jar
and this is back when I didn't even
understand sin care and I would put it
on and I'm like a little mom it
something like this little tingly and I
didn't understand it
um I didn't even needed you know I
didn't know I didn't need it but now I
do because I wear makeup and all that
extra stuff in my face so I need deep
cleansing so I'm just gonna put that on
my skin and I'm gonna avoid the nose
area because I'm gonna put like a poor
strip
Roseanna was called a port yeah a
deep-clean deep ocean revenues so hey
I'm close
Santa Claus has been real I can't be I
used to believe in that guy oh my god
if you're a young kid and you just heard
that like unhear he's real I'm so sorry
I did not want to crush your dreams or
anything but yeah like think about it
think about that that logic Santa Claus
he's a heavier guy you know can he real
this lease that even fit down a chimney
who would even go down a chimney with
all those presents like why not just go
through a window or a door like if you
really think about the concept of Santa
Claus our parents were like they were
really like finessing us man like for my
nose I'm using these be your or B or e
to sound fancier deep cleansing poor
strips
I've been using the heavy strips dry up
lip it comes with eight and I have like
three left so I've used them like five
times if math serves me correctly this
is the fifth time I didn't go to college
um so I've been using these and I love
them now I'm not gonna say they blow my
mind away let oh my god no pores at all
no that's like unrealistic I'm I feel
like with pores once you have them
they're kind of there you could just
minimize them um but I that's what this
does it minimize my pores so what you
need to do is you got to wet that area
first with some water I have like a
little jar water right here so look it's
big you know it's like mistake if you
don't wet it first and then let me make
sure I'm doing this right
I got it wrong the first time I did it
you peel it off the thingie thank you oh
yeah you have to break it a little bit
I totally forgot to do that then you put
it on the news
yeah I totally did that right cool
I did it wrong the first time I did it I
look at the picture and this is what it
says to do now let me finish clean that
face mount any part I missed boom my
face is tingly but in a good way
now I tried doing these no strips with
one old mass like this little sheet mass
upon your face doesn't work cuz this
although you need to have a wet when you
put it on it needs to be the dry if you
have a mask on top of it it won't dry
and the stuff I stuck to my nose so if
you ever wondered if that works it
doesn't well I'm going to do is one wait
for this to dry I'm just going to
massage it to my skin because it's not
necessarily a mask it's like a deep
cleansing cream although you could use
it as a mask it's more salt like you
want to move aside to make sure it's
really cleaning your skin but I don't
need to leave it on that long because
I've already used my little spa brush so
my skin has already gone a deep
cleansing this just for extra power my
skin's are breaking out a little bit
lately so I'm going extra but with this
stuff I don't use it every single day I
use it probably once a week you don't
need it then like I use it based on what
I needed like I I like to use that at
minimum once a week just to me just to
my skin a deep cleansing and because of
the smell and how it feels it so gives
you like a spa type treatment but when
it comes to face mask
I don't think there's any rules now I
mean you don't think you want to do it
every single day that's the big
excessive but you want to do it if you
feel like your skin is it just only
grows or if it's breaking out or you
just feel like I gotta clean this thing
so that's what I do so I'm gonna rub
this in for about five minutes just give
just get a little massage and I'm going
to rinse that off and then I'm going to
take this off have to leave this on for
at least 10 minutes so I'm going to just
be massaging and I'll be right back ok
so I went ahead and rinsed off that
cleansing cream a my mask but this is
the ready to be peeled off um tight now
this is ready is when it feels hard but
it the edges are still a little wet I
like I wet them a little bit when I
rinsed off my face so I'm not just leave
it alone I'm let it dry a little more
cuz what I gotta do next this won't be
in the way so I like crazy I know the
next thing I do is I use this bio oil it
I pretty much use it to help either my
skin tone a minute to get rid of scars
now I've been using it oh my god you're
like half empty I kind of like to know
like three months now
yeah but I also spilled a little bit of
it my ice price feel like a little bit
because I I'm kind of lazy sometimes if
I do it at night I'm too lazy to close
the top so I'll just like and I'll just
leave it and one night kind of spilled
but it's okay cuz it's only $11 at
Walmart oh by the way all the prices of
everything I'm using will be in the
description box or the link so don't
worry about all of that I got you but
this is eleven dollars they have a
bigger bottle for 20 not think about I
practiced about that bottle but at the
time I was privy and cheap which is why
I got this bottle so ill work this last
pretty long it's oil and you don't need
that much when you put it on so I'm
pretty good it's supposed to help
improve the appearance of scars stretch
marks uneven skin tone age skin it's
supposed to help all that now I mainly
got it from my scars like the big scars
I have it's not guaranteed to make them
go away but I did read the reviews on
Amazon and it's pretty much almost all
good reviews so I thought I would just
try and finish the bottle and see my
results I've noticed that it helped my
skin
tell me more even because I do use it on
my face um
I during the day I just kind of like
spot treat and I only put on like my
scars but at night I will put on my
whole entire face all reason why don't
do that during the days because it's oil
and I don't want to give schools on my
skin during the day except like a fill
it could feel a little heavy although
this oil isn't heavy I just stay away
from doing all that I leave me very
little I don't I'm already like halfway
to the bottle but I let her just get it
and I like putting a little bit my
fingertip and then I put it on the scar
yeah this scar man spilled me since I
was four years old and I'm 21 how many
years that's 17 for those of us
wondering I got this scar pretty much I
ran into a door um I'll find my sister
over our crowns I'm saying markers as
crayons I don't like seeing crayons
crayons markers okay she thought that I
had our markers which I didn't there
were my markers and she took them and
she's running away from me and I'm
chasing her and our kitchen had a door
that blocked our kitchen from the back
room and the door was like it wasn't at
Dorian's like a big wooden slab so as
she was running she closed that wooden
slab behind her and I was writing so
fast it couldn't stop and I ran right
into that wood and it pretty much not
two holes into my head it was like
they're two gaps like it was a little
hole right here and her bigger hole up
here so I had to get stitches to close
with those holes it was disgusting like
I remember after it happened I felt kind
of dizzy and I was like I went to the
stove because on our stove it had like a
little me reflection I remember seeing
those two holes and oh my god
Oh makes me more oh god it's gross see
about it like two holes in my head and I
remember like I was like I was so
confused I was four I just I vividly
remember seen the holes majendie no dude
I remember my mom was so pissed and I
remember getting stitches was like the
worst thing ever because like it's right
on my eyes so I'm laying and I see this
needle going but directly by my eye and
I kept moving so they had to pretty much
put me in like a body bag type thing to
restrain me and it was just a horrible
experience I got a cool Barbie doll for
it but was it worth it no it wasn't and
I'm not happy about it but hopefully
this gets rid of it enough for my stats
stories so I take the most time on this
scar because the biggest one so I kind
of really massage and work it in I feel
like it's pointless to put a treatment
on unless your massages
stain when you're giving yourself like a
hot oil treatment you like massage and
you kind of like massage it into your
scalp right so same concept I just try
to massage it in to make sure it's
really finished that penetrating you I
hate that word matrix pan China mess in
the right way and I just rub that in BAM
now this should be ready to be taken off
it's not I'm ripping it off it feels
really hard though oh yeah ah ouch oh
shoot oh I feel kind of good seed all
these little residues that's annoying Oh
we had a clean nose y'all Madhu's my
face is clean men nose is pure hair I
have hair everywhere if you if you don't
like hair don't date someone who wears
wigs and weaves because I have hair I
want to give an example with girls but
it's hair everywhere
alright so now it's time for moisturizer
now I'm pretty sure you've heard of pons
before now this is kinda like pond but
the equate version it is yeah it's like
ponds but equate version it's dry skin
cream um why did I buy let's see why did
I buy the equate version I think I was
just being extra cheap that day I love
ponds I've used ponds by like three
times ponds is awesome
but when you see equate it it's like
pretty much the same thing and you can
save three dollars that's what I did and
because I've used ponds in the past and
I've used this one they're kind of a dam
they are the same thing it works just as
good to me so if I could get the same
thing it's saved like three dollars
that's what I'm going to do so you
honestly need very little this I take it
from the top and I like it like that
much and then I just moisturize my skin
with it now if your skin is kind of oily
don't use this because this is extremely
moisturizing and I don't think that song
or the skin needs at this kind of
moisturizer it's extremely moisturizing
extremely but if your skin is really oh
my god I'm so soft and your skin is
pretty dry this is the bomb Bob calm
yeah I love this stuff another like four
dollars and there was like you know what
screw you pawns no I'd take that back
but pot is like I'd be like six or seven
dollars and I'm just like
I just don't like spending money if
there's a way to save I will do it if
there's a way I'll do it I'm not gonna
spend money I don't need to spin you
know yeah I just brought it into my skin
what I learned with this moisturizer you
have to really rub it in if you just
like put it on like okay BAM I'm done it
kind of sits on top of your skin because
very very hydrating and very very
moisturizing it's kind of thick a little
bit like it's it doesn't feel thick but
it feels thick on the skin because it's
very very very very moisturizing so I
learned that when you rub it in you feel
it less on the skin if that makes sense
um if you don't rub it in you'll feel it
on your skin and I don't think you want
to that's kind of annoying so bring it
down to my neck so I'm not dry down
there
and see we want look normal with my hair
like this yeah that's pretty much it for
this routine I've got a lot of requests
on it so I finally decide to sit down
and do it I hope it was helpful um hope
you learned something if you have any
questions just ask below and I'll answer
them and I'll see you guys my next video
although I don't know what I want to do
next I have no idea if you have ideas
let me know and I'll do it but until
then I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
