got done filming this look for a guy
it's like drugstores slash affordable
makeup products cuz like not everything
I got from the drugstore but still kind
of cheap so yeah that's why this wasn't
easy by thank him oh oh wait pause I
have to say this I did not use drugstore
stuff on my eyebrows now I did try where
where you go right through it somewhere
so I did try to do dressed your eyebrows
but with this stuff
snicks brow gel pad it 4-1 outs in the
shade espresso but I hate it
okay it's not a hundred percent for Babu
and you're used to in assassin Beverly
Hills everything is horrible
to be completely honest with you guys I
filmed this look like three times and at
first I was using this and I was like
this is horrible and like I don't want
get them to buy this even if it is eight
dollars compared to eighteen dollars
which is the dipbrow this much em its
costs eighteen so even though it's a ten
dollar difference it's quality okay but
that's long as you can use it like isn't
drugstore cuz like I'm not gonna tell
gonna buy this sorry I said to be
honest with you guys okay like I feel
like some and I know for a fact some
drugstore tutorials in order to like
follow the rules and use odd drugstore
prospero products they use they develop
people use stuff and it's like they'll
only use it for that video and never
using this sucks so it's like
they're using it and the aunt comes out
nice um
and during the video you're like oh I'm
gonna go buy it and then you buy it it's
trash like for example on the first of
my film I use this powder miss Ella
GoPro powder and yeah I made it look
nice but it'll absolutely horrible like
the flashback was horrible um
and I was like okay I could either post
this video and make them think this
powder is cool or just do it over and
just use a better power that cost a
little bit more money and I was like I'm
gonna do my make wall over there's no
way I'm going to include a pot in a
video that I know that sucks so yeah
that's why um I'm picky when it comes to
products because I'm not that tell you
guys hey guys go buy this product it's
cheap when it sucks like no no cuz I'd
be pissed off so I'm good at that to me
so I don't wanna piss anybody off but um
hope you guys enjoy this tutorial I'll
see you guys my next one and yeah thanks
for watching so far please subscribe if
you haven't already not gonna force you
though I'm just gonna say you probably
should I'm not gonna force your anything
but oh my god bye I love to see you at
the next video my camera's about to show
me off anyways that's a sign I'm talking
too much so so first I'm going to start
off by using my morphe Jaclyn hill
palette I'm gonna get this like orange a
yellow shade and I'm going to use that
shade is just a base um you know I
always start off with a Collider shade
and then I'm going to take this slightly
darker shade that has a little more
Brown it I'm going to start putting it
towards the crease area
and then I'm going to take this like
purpley pinkish shade I'm going to put
that in my crease
and then I'm going to mix that shade
with a slightly darker purplish shade
and I'm going to put that in my crease
to deepen it
and then take two more shades deep my
crease even more I know it looks light
and that's only because the lighting was
kind of bad at that angle but those
shades are darker than the ones I used
before
it was quite hard for me to blend these
shades onto my eyelids some eyelets are
pretty dry and I didn't have a good
primer because I don't have a good
drugstore one but anyways after that I'm
going to use these two shades this
pinkish a and this like golden orange
shade and I'm going to mix those
together
I applied liquid sugar by eye candy
first on my lid to kind of help with um
you know you know like when I have
hooded lids the shimmer is always
transferred to like where your crease
areas which is very annoying so I just
put that liquid sugar and hopes to help
that from transferring to my crease this
part of me forever as well um which I
only have kept in the video so I just
learn from my mistakes get a good primer
I thought oh I could do this Ronnie lid
primer and then I realized wow you need
primer so when I was finally satisfied
my eyes I got my la girl Pro primer
that's flash everywhere I don't know
what that was about that was kind of
funny I was like what the heck but
anyways if I used to pry my skin I use
this before and I think it works pretty
well as a primer
poor foundation needs the Maybelline fit
me foundation the do + smooth this is my
favorite drugstore foundation if you
guys fall Manish gram you guys know that
I've been using this for a while now
I've also tried the matte + poreless and
the original formula as well I could
literally testify that they all are
awesome especially for the price it's
only like 5 to 6 dollars so it's
definitely worth it I would definitely
recommend to everyone try this
foundation I think it's amazing I'm just
going to put that out there now to
highlight / conceal I'm uses la girl Pro
concealer now these concealers are my
favorite drugstore concealers buy will
say they do have weird sometimes and I'm
pretty sure that anyone who has owned
these concealers knows that sometimes
they have like some type of water like
liquid in them I'm not sure what that's
about and is sometimes they can become
very grainy and I think it's because
maybe there's separate in the tube so
what I learn is that it's good to warm
up the tube first or even warm up the
product wallets on your skin it'll get
rid of all those grains so yeah if you
have problems with this concealer then I
would definitely try you know warming it
up before you use it because yeah this
concealer has a mind of its own but it's
amazing but it has a mind of its own
so to contour me to use another la girl
Pro concealer this is a she to think
like something Coco I'll name Willa
shades in the description box users are
always asking me for my shades but you
want to know something that I notice
whenever I let people know my shapes and
products when I go to buy the prawns
again it's all gone and like shoot I
promise you guys I don't know dude like
whenever I mention a product I'll tell
ya this where I got it from this the
shade literally look out go back and
it'll be all gone and I'd be like well
like I did not know that people were
going to actually buy it
contouring my nose takes so long I don't
have a natural bridge and so it's like
got to make one I've considered getting
a nose job before even though I like my
nose I got totally love it I just like I
want to be able to freakin contour it
cuz it's fun but maybe look I'm learning
that like you know I should just keep my
nose my natural one now summarize I'm
using my banana powder by Ben Nye now
this isn't drugstore but it is
affordable it's only like $15 and I know
they move like whoa that's pretty
expensive but it's much better than
drugstore setting powders and it lasts
forever literally if you own this
product you know this stuff lasts
forever and then I set my entire face
using my Maybelline fit me foundation
powder I didn't show we don't know how
to get cut out but that's how I'm using
set my face
I'm demo I go back to my palette and
just finish my eyes first I take that
purplish shade I used earlier um you
know to put underneath my lash line I'm
gonna mix it with this peach shade just
to kind of diffuse a little bit and then
they took a darker shade for the outer
corners just deepen it a little bit
and so to go over my contour amuses
black radiance foundation powder I've
used this before in my videos you guys
know I love this dump only five dollars
in this stuff lasts forever for blush
I'm using this pink blush like what's
that called black opal and then for
highlight I'm using this Ruby kisses
highlighter it's like an all-over face
bronzer but I'm using as a highlight
because I think it's very beautiful and
glowing I'm just putting it on my entire
cheek then I'm going to put my lashes on
off-camera and I'm using their Ardell
whispies I'm going to wipe off whatever
I had on my lips and then line them with
this kiss New York roasted coffee lip
liner and then today on my lips I'm
using colour-pop cosmetics I know it's
not drugstore but it damn mirrors I wish
colour-pop was in stores oh my god that
would be freaking life-changing I
probably broke but first I'm going to
take runge which is like a nice soft
brown and I'm going to mix it with Kido
which is like a nice pink sheer just to
have like a natural nude lip
and so after that I'm down the look I
think this look came out really nice to
be all affordable slash drugstore
products and I really hope you guys
liked it as far as like more videos go
let me know what you guys want to see
start filming more for you guys
