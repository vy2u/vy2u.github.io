the updated review on this hair as well
as the little hair shop I use um I've
got Sean how many people are interested
in that liquid hair chocolate using the
initial video from this hair this hair
is from dye hair 7 7 7 is almost
understand I don't know I'm seeing right
or not absolutely right here but I'm a
lot more interested in hair chalk and so
I was ok to update give you like boom
you didn't hear it so just liquid hair
chopped wash up well see it's still in
the hair in a nose I wanna shout now I
know look we can bottle I will begin
with a special shampoo Brad let's see if
I sit on labels I don't know what's
going on alright so maybe I don't know
it says instant fashion color color
lasts an average of two shampoos this is
the pen out party applied and frosted
hair whatever that means
I just know that I mean you think that
he's fat in the sink and you like we're
trying to rub it out it would come out
like you want to come out but maybe the
being ready have to do a few walks for
it to come out I mean that would smell
it and follow I just know that I could
ship this out in his business budge now
that's also good and backing that's a
good thing because you know that I mean
the bottle small this is microphone or
proponent on the bottle small so it's
like you buy the bottle for eight
dollars seven dollars so like when you
do an application when I did this first
time and like took a much half the
bottle examine your little they're a lot
but if it stays in your hair after few
shampoos it's coming it's worth it but
that it's bad because then you put in
your natural hair or you put in some
hair that you don't want to be in this
without long you kind of wash it out as
well coming out it's kind of annoying to
get to kind of wait for it to slowly
fade out so it's like temporary success
it's like not coming will convert excuse
and you want to get off and try to
scrape it off it's not coming off and
yet like scrape it your skin if you're
good irritating that's kind of like the
liver job anyways enough this hair off I
don't wanna say about it because I
haven't had any problems with it
I will say the limit hair shop the shop
it changed texture the hair because if
you see right here because I was putting
really high from the top layer not
underneath if you see right here it's
like the curls are cool but they're more
with looser curls but then when I lift
this up on social there is no where I
live it up and show underneath the curls
are much more described and I want it
around the whole head that's the liquid
stuff to come out so I mean the curls
are my own business a little Shetty
obviously anyone would have talks with
curls when I first up the tactics
because it was different than other
curly hair I've got it's a game where
you give up hair and kind of look good
or bad is you kind of know these things
but um yeah I love this wig to bar you
the last day when I first put it on he
goes swimming at that I'm like you know
I like it yeah kind of you know you know
guys I kind of have something live in
here talking my hair right now I'm going
to speed it up I just want to see if I
put on top of this because it's like if
I would be step up this I would want to
be cool and I want to be even a cool
color
and I bought this and now when I know
that it doesn't come out easy at it
being temporary was a temporary intent
so yeah but um I don't want to this
other hair of mine because I don't want
to have to deal with me I didn't wash it
out so I'm going to quickly put this
purple ribbon here talking a little
slice and I'll come right back
all right moment the right here really
fast now I made it separate
well one thing right before I forget you
mention it I did my burnt feel with your
hair chopped I got some on my chest and
I will say from memory
it was commerce with y'all my skin let
it one wanted to unwrap it off what I
thought it was I thought it was gone but
it was ask the video I feel like the
next day I got and she's still my chest
but you can't scrub it off so try to be
on your skin but um another thing is
that I see that a colored more pigmented
when your hair is lighter because it's
purple in the hair chalk I bought the
big day upon my bronze one so I know
what to try and prevent um
a lesson for aliens video and I like
instance to shot of her she wanted to
she's really cool additionally five
limitless and she use a purple hair Chou
Enlai : I forgot I had one when you bit
but I'm noticing her video
it was starter and so I think the darker
because she didn't have the bronze or
blondish hair chopped first
so it's darker so I am learning that if
you want the silver hair shop to be more
vibrant maybe you ask the broad one
first this essentially makes her hair
looks bleep and then you put the other
color on top to make it more pigmented
if that makes sense at all because I
watched your video a turn with one of
the darker purple just who super pretty
as won an existing scar I can provide
but this waiver I probably eat I think
because I had to light a color first
that's like a tip if you want like you
know make it brighter but else yeah
another thing I didn't will drive just
afterwards because like I said the
double chain the texture of the hair I
don't want to dry it out so grab the
blow-dry hand me is hot on the let air
dry is all right kind of dry and it is
like I mean it's not going to come off
in my hand so I'm not air dry so let's
minimize how much it dries the hair out
you were beautiful
I listed under this code about you guys
as yourself
just look at your talk to this school I
have to miss attend but your patience
luckily for me I own a lot of hair so me
doing this it's kind of a panel tricks
if I don't want to color in the switch
to another wig however all that your
preference and your patience um if you
want to be in here go for it I know come
back back from here because when I watch
natural I was her girder down when I
watched her it is Sandra here forever so
I mean it critical down natural hair I
just it didn't come out of a hair like
with one loss I expected to that's
pretty much math review now you're still
here I want to get some middle-aged hair
though and I'm going to wait to you I
took a screenshot for names I wouldn't
forget that word hi David
Shekinah Campbell and you're a be wait
messages for Twitter it will pick you
blur crown I didn't want to give you
three bundles and I'm so comfy right oh
for sure bundled up I wouldn't do it
away this is straight frontal this
straight here only because you have more
options you like someone to want with it
and I will expose your picture and
thought maybe you'd like Street here
open up wrong but the front working inch
in the bundles are 18 16 to 20 the
standard Medellin so when you watch this
video which I hope you do if if you will
because a few common money to build
quite often um via me or comment or
reach out to me Miami unit Sebring over
there Guinea rise enough to do the hair
but that's what the video um you guys I
know this hair
aren't any heritage Bari life I know we
could hair because I have wigs that
aren't good to do we will say that we
need to go so inviting life to make your
life even more I left over here chop a
letter says it's not going to wash out
immediately just worrying you but I
think it's worth $1 being bad at two
station hair the longer they like that
hairspray stuff and I'll hire spray off
you guys know I also have a hair of a
tutorial on permanent purple hair come
up to paint it for that I deal with this
