if you renew welcome i'm marinelle and
your own down with a fail okay I'm
trying to all the new oh my god don't
spit him I'm trying to come with a new
intro
you know to but it's so hard you know I
wish I could just say felt but I'm not a
what's up to the person anyways I just
in the video on this hairstyle and and
tell my huge smile on my joy full
personality I'm very happy with it
um I am in love I think it looks super
cute like I don't know why I like it so
much honestly I went downstairs to
change to my little bodysuit and my
older sister she's on the couch and she
didn't walk going I should go home and
eat your hair oh let's cute actually set
that it kind of hide me up you know
because obviously when I don't I never
know what was good until someone else
tells me and so um I'm glad you two look
I'm like oh okay it's cool you know and
I won't be super different confidence
when it comes to like the hair and Todd
you're my mom or Alexis my sister and
they're all hyping me up and I'm little
ki I guess so yeah I feel miss um
Braden look ooh frontal where oh my god
it's beautiful
anyways I got this Harrison from Aldi
grape hair and you can follow my channel
for a while now I've done like this is
my third video for them and they are
like pretty much top three of my
favorite Alex trip companies um I never
have to issues with their hair at all ah
and yeah you don't ever look because you
know I want to be accurate so I'm going
to tell you guys the last time I tried
their hair but their hair is so nice I
can't explain it you'd have to like deal
with a lot of weave all the time to
really determine what's good and what's
not but the hair is so nice to me
alright so the first time I tried their
hair oh about six months ago sold
half a year ago that's half a year yeah
and I had a world bye-bye that was
supposed to go OK
ooh alright so I hacked their curly hair
7 months ago and I still wear it um that
kind of next to me I'm have my waist on
the floor um cuz I actually work the gay
tile inside the picture I'm wearing it
don't mind my boobies
folks on the hair that's hair and
wearing and the Colonel's like this
and you guys see how the curl just so
defined the natural looking and I
believe his hair twice which is wow so
shocked the curls were able to like you
know lift through that but ever since
ensign well my favorite wave is super
bouncy it just they have my favorite
curly hair um I try other good curly
hair and it's good but those are better
maybe my favorite to be honest but yeah
so I tried through straight hair like
five months ago and now I'm trying more
straight hair and this is 26 inches um
the shortest bundles 24 and then the
longest 26 and I got a 350 lights muscle
meaning goes all the way around my head
arm the only issues that the threesome
place frontal was too big from my hands
I've cut it in the middle and alter it
which sucks but honestly they're going
to experience almost companies most
companies are three to two ways bundles
quite big and I'm not suggesting you're
backing like I don't know if you'd
rather some be too small to base is too
small you can't wear it looks too big
it's kind of like you guys are like do a
little work to make it work so it's up
to you to determine if you are cool up
there or not but here this in addition
to lace frontal and all I did was we
stand not on the front part I don't
really do high ponytail so I need to
bleach the back and because it's too big
oh my um I'm sticking onto those because
it's too big I was not gonna do a
ponytail either but um yeah I did this
style I just wanted to do the cute
little Toro priming we never do these
I'm always doing like either hair dye
swirls or curly or like you know other
simple stuff but I feel like a lot of
people may like to style my sister like
this so that was enough for me to post
this video on my loom nothing bad about
the hair whatsoever
the reason my favorite end of straight
hair you just have to deal with hair on
the house word you have to be able pair
of the way I do to determine the
differences and although I have other
hair that's good when I touch those
bundles will the sim bundle Hanna my bed
um clearly my hair in my bed why test
that on the clay this phone is you could
tell the difference and but some of the
texture and the thickness of the hair
that makes it stand out and that makes
it really really nice quality and even
my friends and I
yesterday and you know she's off seeing
my weave on my bed and she likes like
this is some good at Heron she doesn't
even want to leave it she just held it
was good hair she wanted to fight with
it like damn you're ordered some because
it's really nice so nothing my talking I
don't forgot to reviews it because you
know for my channel you guys know I like
to share like that's the bottom line
I got nothing bad to say ever if I ever
had something Betsy of course I'll say
it why is the hair called part of it
tangling it doesn't a little tangling
that's cause it's super long you know
make sure it's brushed but it's not like
tingly Shetty you don't trust this well
in tingly words like mad it's ten you
like if I don't brush it for a while
it's hard for me to live where my
fingers doing but you guys see the ones
in the brush it's very easy very slowly
very ignorant fingers ooh it's all good
well that's room to off to say I have a
spit in shedding I would have noticed it
back home let's Aslan usually one here
 it just on my mouth for some reason
don't know why but I haven't noticed any
shedding if I don't let you guys know
I'm going to keep the wig like this in
the South you can see pictures of me
wearing this wig on quite soon but yeah
militias watching the video see how I
got this with a look and if you want to
do like this and me styling my list
frontal my lace wigs my legs everything
let me know if you enjoy this particular
video please give a thumbs up to
subscribe and I'll see you in my next
one
alright so here's the hair I hire a side
part at first year because I'm cyber
 person sometimes so right now I'm
just trying to part it to the best of my
abilities so that way the part the main
middle part is in the exact middle I
didn't get it right this time but I mean
it's whatever I still think it looks
nice now the reason why I'm doing this
on a Styrofoam head is because for
braided hairstyles on lace wigs it's
just easier when you do it on like a
little mannequin head now you can do it
on your actual head but the thing is
this okay so say you have the wig on
right and say you've laid them
everything and you have your little got
to be free spray it off and stuff and
then you're putting a lot of pressure on
it by braiding it that's going to make
it lift or even if you don't have a like
molded down just yet when you're
braiding is going to keep lifting is
annoying processes let's leave your
braiding backwards so if you're going to
do this kind of style definitely do it
on the mannequin head first and you'll
be good
Here I am just kind off a little excess
lace so I just saw that is a little
unnecessary and then I'm like putting in
little hairs out that I'm going to use
for my baby hair alright so then when I
just part it in the middle you know just
try and get the sections off so I'm
gonna do two little braids and I'm using
my mouth to hold for hair you know you
guys use what you got
alright and at mazes home I'm a free
awesome of the same to me I'm pretty
sure like summer better than others but
I don't use enough to know I just you
know buy it based on how it smells miss
less smells really good and own really
health because um it helps multi hair it
makes it easier to work with when it
dries it's almost like it was never any
product in there at all so I really love
foam okay so I'm do the first braid now
when you're doing great on a wig you
want to braid it like as if your brain
is single and you want to do that least
like two times you don't want to
initially start off like straight
cornrowing
you want to start braiding ends if you
bring a single and then you bring it
down and you connect to the other hair
because I've learned that when I breathe
it and I just started going straight
back the braid was less defined in the
front if that makes any sense at all so
I just braid all the way back and then
I'm going to just braid it all the way
down that way I mean I just want to long
little breathe so I'm going to braid it
until it gets to like kind of close to
the bottom and I'm going to tie it off
at a road man this is a very simple
style and I also because style to like
them because it kind of shows off you
know your talents you know because why
okay
I just breed in my wig like this is real
like it is even my hair and not no one's
going to know these things alright so
let's figure you know watching these
videos and gain all this help so it's
going to braid it to the very kind of
left end and then you get a clear oh man
I should have used black why didn't have
any so I use clear and that's pretty
much it on a plate this was really cute
hair charms I didn't have any though so
that kind of stuff
thanks laughter you debride the kind of
like cut the hairs in the front to kind
of like start by beating their process
but um this part coming in this it
wasn't necessary but I end up fixing the
baby here as well the actual weight was
on my head anyway so you don't have to
this part it can makes a little easier
but I end up like altering Xavier's
anyways I just put foam on them you know
just kind of like move them because I've
seen people do this before and I thought
I'd try it and so I take the wig off the
star from head and then I'm going to put
it on my head I already have my little
ones being called wig caps on and I'm
going to use some powder to kind just
like tint the front part of the lace and
also the actually cap itself so it looks
more like my scalp and I put the wig on
and I just to my head and I'm yeah we're
just going to work on this
all right so I noticed it was a little
strand I shouldn't have been like in one
of the braids so I kind of mess up the
braid a little bit to pull that strand
out cause really bothering me but you
know what it's fine I just cut off like
a little piece I was in the way and now
I'm going to just kind of like with my
baby hairs back my hair lines so anyways
don't I go a little too forward because
I could never completely covered in hair
no matter how much I try
brides have to deal with them so here I
am just clamped my baby hairs um it's so
hard for sexy baby heroes because like
you want to meet thin till it's
natural-looking but then it's like a
view over plug you kind of start the
whole process over it's very annoying
that I mean you get the hang of it I've
C been doing for a while like right now
I laid them and they were to stick and I
left there alone for a few seconds but I
end up going back and fixing them oh my
god you guys my cast is making so much
noise downstairs I'm actually kind of
Concerned I've heard a big bang I don't
know what they're doing cats are crazy
guys like toddlers anyways um here's my
favorite part of this video and that's
when I can feel the actual parts because
they were looking a little orangie and
they weren't looking super defined so I
just got concealer from mac it's like in
W 35 and I just put in the parts and it
made it look so much better like I know
you're probably watching this like okay
like that looks kind of weird but then I
fixed it and so now I'm gonna go back
and kind of like go back over my baby
hairs because they are bothering me so
you know add to 6-pin
so after this my baby hairs the hair
sprain was complete if you guys like the
style please let me know like I like it
I don't wanna be the only one so if you
like it let me know oh yeah I got a
brush perfected but it's a much done so
I'm yeah if you liked it please give a
thumbs up and please subscribe and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
