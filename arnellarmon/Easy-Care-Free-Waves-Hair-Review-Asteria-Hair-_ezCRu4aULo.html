new welcome so this would be a quick
hair review I get tears in one area here
who I'm pronouncing that right I'm gonna
show you guys if I solid I mean honestly
after you do some reviews you don't know
what to do anymore so hopefully this is
entertaining now I'm good color it's
beautiful and I won't serve pictures of
what this looks like outside because
this code actually difference in
Romanian and I did try to film this I
did and I have the proof crystal on my
memory card but it'll just shambles okay
like I had to Dinah's have so many times
to get the exact color I want to get it
because some of the bundles I let the
bleach on long and I wanted to so it
became lighter than what other bundles
so my guys are two different colors in
shambles but if you know the video I
have where I dyed my hair this red color
officer a clip of the video right here
it's essentially the same thing
I just double dieded because when I got
that red color minutes ago disconcerted
I mix what a purple and pink guy cause
ball to the color and being that red so
I said same thing with this it's just I
did it twice so it was look more like a
deeper red because you know the picture
is pretty similar this deeper so if you
really want to I get this color I'll
just go to that tutorial and then do it
twice or make some more purple in order
to get this color but um yeah I'm just
going to show muscles on my hair and
during the process of me Solomon I'll be
doing my Glen silver and tell my review
on the terrace I've been wearing his
hair for last three days and I kind of
feel for it I have some negative some
positives or whatever so just keep
watching the video if you want to learn
more about there and I think about it
and if you like this video please give a
thumbs up
oh and you want to make look which I
like it let me know I didn't feel like
my first I've done them look like this
before but these I want to see how I did
this let me know and I'll record it and
yeah let's get on go into hair before I
curl the hair I'm going to brush it out
now just past my review I didn't notice
that this hair does tengo a little and
you kind of see as I'm brush my hair but
it's not like super easy like you kind
of see that a the brush isn't gliding to
the hair as easy as it typically does
the hair does tangle little but I
you think it's because I bleached my
hair hyung Zabuza hair I was here once
but I didn't deep condition the hair or
really conditioning after I bleach it so
I think that's why that there is a few
tangles and the tangles are like in the
nape area like in the back part of the
head and so that is one thing I noticed
that surprisingly even though the hair
did tank a little bit it hasn't been
shedding and I definitely will notice
Aviles shedding because I mean the hair
is a very distinct color so that's
something I'll definitely see but I
haven't really experienced shedding with
the tear at all I just experienced
little tangling and that's pretty much
about it
the frontal was a little hard to work
with so they sent me a lace frontal and
three bundles and the frontal was too
big for my head and now kind of
frustrating so I had to kind of like cut
the frontal so the frontal doesn't even
go to my ears it kind of goes to where
the end of my eyebrow stop is that's
like the best way I can explain it but -
those two minor issues the Harrison
personally fine I mean it's easy to curl
it holds it probably nicely now the
curls I'm doing in this video
I want to do like very big curls and
super loose waves that's why I'm
sectioning big pieces I usually want to
walk on my hair i section small pieces
places like tight curls but I want it
like big red waves so I'm sectioning big
pieces I'm just curling it and I'm
literally leaving the wand on a hair for
me like five seconds I'm not trying to
get super defined curls at all a time
waswas messy like I didn't really put
too much effort into my hair almost like
maybe as if I like braid it into the
braid self that's can I was going for
now if the hair took the bleach very
very well and it took it pretty fast I
didn't take it super super fast but it
took it fast enough to where I was able
to bleach multiple bundles at a time but
I didn't have to rush and stop and
because I'm on pair it was like process
too fast where you can't even finish
bleaching the whole bundle before yes I
printed out and stopped the processing
but one bundled in Italy success the
other one so F individual C and you kind
of see it now that the bundles at the
top look lighter than the bottom that's
at the bottom bundle it didn't bleed
just fast as the two bundles in the
frontal that I use and that's why the
hair guy was kind of different and
that's I was referring to the begin
that was kind of hard to get this color
because the whole bleaching process of
content the fold let me overall the hair
sister bleached in I mean I think the
color looks really nice
yeah I'm solution watching trova hair
it's pretty simple honestly like I was
kind of tractor while filming this I
mean I cut off the course all distracted
I was texting listen music I had a burn
in my face but if you're focused you can
just sound about like 10 minutes based
on how big the sections are like if you
want the curls to last longer than a day
or two then you're going to want to
leave the wand on the hair longer and
you're going to want to do smaller
sections for the curls are tighter so
they take longer to loosen up but I mean
for like a simple one day style quick
10-minute style this is a good style
because I'm taking big sections and I'm
like leave them on the lawn for a few
seconds and then I'm just moving on so
yeah I would let you guys watch this
I've already summer view I mean I feel
like today I will be wearing this way
again because I really like this color
like it looks beautiful
but I'm now but you have liked this
video and I'll check back in towards the
end of the video
wait I lied this is where I burn my face
look out I do a slow-motion look how
like the want literally just tap my face
I'm going to show you guys what it looks
like now I'm going to cert a picture I
post on snap look how bad that burned my
face from that one little tap and even
now I'm wearing makeup and I tried to
cover in color front and you can still
see it it sucks because when it happened
I am NOT think it did damage like I knew
it burned but I mean I thought like I
had foundation on it was going to
protect my skin and I did not think
styles and happen but or in the video
you speed in my face so being read in
that part and then by that night it left
at big black months anyway so much red
like
it's on that I don't trilling my hair I
run my fingers through it I'm gonna take
the brush and I'm just gonna brush
through because I mean I thought the
curls will to define I really wanted to
just be like big loose ways and so yeah
that looked really cute like I like
these kind of styles I am really a fan
of messy looking hairstyles I don't know
why of course like they have to be neat
messy like I have to make them look a
mess I like when hairstyles look like I
haven't put that much effort into this
and so I feel like that style is like
this tile and see you see demo mark on
my face it's already happening okay
anyways this is the finished look I hope
you guys enjoyed this i'ma show you guys
what the tips of the hair looked like
you know very nice loose waves and you'd
see that bottom bundles of dark is my
broad kept one and shown this part I was
really knowing but just look at the hair
focus on that and if you enjoyed this
