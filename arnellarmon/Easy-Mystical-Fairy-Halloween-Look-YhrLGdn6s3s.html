D hydrating locket primer I'm just gonna
place that and pause my hand and spread
that all over my face then I'm going to
take my Kat Von D locket foundation I'm
gonna place that on this corvex brush
I'm going to buff that into my skin day
afterwards I'm gonna get a Beauty
Blender and like go back over my face to
make sure that everything's all smooth
and seamless
and find um blendy I'm taking my Kat Von
D lock concealer and I'm just going to
place ad underneath my eyes on my
forehead on my chin above my Cupid's bow
and on the bridge of my nose
so once I'm done flying that concealer
I'm just gonna blend out with my Beauty
Blender and then to go back in to
contour
so the cons when taking a stick
Foundation and SS Beverly Hills in the
shade espresso and I'm going to contour
my cheekbones I'm going to kind of
contour and carve it upwards kind of
make my cheeks look more rounder and you
guys are see I kind of go back and I
redo this part because I felt like it
wasn't intense enough but on a contour
the sides of my nose because I want to
make my nose look slimmer then I'm gonna
contour around my forehead a little bit
also above my Cupid's bow to kind of
make my I guess my Cupid's bow look more
defined and then also on my jawline to
make my face look slimmer I'm also a
contour underneath my bottom lip and I
learned that what this does is it makes
your bottom lip look more pouty and it
kind of makes it look bigger
not that I need that I just really like
the pouty effect it gives me you see how
it already makes it look bigger so yeah
if you have like I don't know
lips which I'm assuming a lot of people
do and you watch your bob lip to look
more plump if you contour underneath it
it makes it create like a shadow so it
makes them look bigger than what they
already are anyways it's a prior where I
kind of blending out that contour and I
felt like it wasn't what I wanted to be
so I went back over it and I drew more
contour lines on my cheekbone because I
want to be perfect
by the way I like quadrupled sped up
this part um only because this took the
longest part you know me bleed on my
contour this is honestly why I never
come to my newest it takes very long I
just feel like for Halloween it's cool
to kind of come to your face in
different ways than you typically do to
kind of change your features a little
bit to match the character you're trying
to portray so that's why I spent so much
time contouring my nose it looks like
pretty fun it's just my nose kind of
hard to contour because my bridge
doesn't really stick out I have to
really work on creating one so yeah yeah
and you could totally skip this part if
you want to though
now to set the place I could see that
I'm taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm just going to set like I
normally set and then after that I'm
going to do one eye off-camera and I'll
be back to the other eye
so I decide to keep my eyebrows really
natural so I use this precisely my brow
pencil by benefit and I literally just
lightly fill my brows take me like less
than a minute to do this I just kind of
follow my natural brow shape sigh when I
think of theories I don't think of like
super intense brows I think a pretty
natural brow so that's what I did
so to prime eyelid I'm using my lemonade
prayer my benefit like always I'm gonna
place on my eye and then after I do that
I'm going to set on top of that with my
translucent powder
so the first shadow I'm using is really
soft green shadow by make a big don't
worry the name would be below I'm gonna
use that as a base I'm gonna place that
all over my lid
and I'm taking another mazing shadow
called dirty martini I know this one
gets like my favorite color and I'm
gonna place that on outer corner of my
lid or grease whatever place an outer
corner and just a deep in that green a
little bit not take another make a big
shadow I'm not sure of the name it
really show up on camera but it's kinda
like a metallic frosty green uh it's
like yeah I mean you could kind of see
what it looks like and I place on my lid
and I just buff it out with a blender
brush now I'm taking this purpley pink
color and I'm going to place that
underneath my lash line and I focus on
my lash line but then I kind of drag it
out towards Timmy where you would put a
wing but I do it you know underneath my
lash line you guys see I'm talking about
so once I'm done with that I take this
white eyeliner by colour-pop it was kind
of irritating my eyes but honestly
whenever I put a liner my waterline it's
always annoying but yeah just put that
my why line to make my eyes appear a
little bigger so now it's face time to
first end my face he means the powder
always used as soft focus powder black
radiance and I'm just going to buff that
into my skin and dust away the powder
underneath my eyes
so the comte I'm using this hoola
bronzer my benefit and first I'm
defining my nose contour just a little
bit and I'm gonna go and define my cheek
contour although it's already pretty pop
and you guys see how the way I contour
make my cheeks look more round they look
more rounded that's what I was going for
so for blasphemies a soft pink blush by
a makeup geek and it's called puppy love
just a very soft Pete pink um but
honestly I forget the blush like I said
we'll wait I didn't include my intro
because way too long this look I really
improvised the whole thing I didn't
really have a plan I really do not know
where I was going with this look at all
so after I put this blush on I realized
I kind of wanted to do like a more
purpley blush push so um I pretty much
went over where I put the pink blush
with the same shadow I use underneath my
lash line and I kind of brought it up to
my temples I just want to look very very
blushed out
do you guys probably think that my
shadow looks different on each eye and
that's only because um the eye that's
facing towards the camera is getting
more light so it looks lighter so the
other eye looks a little darker
based on the angle but don't worry
they're the same or they're at least
like a 90% similar so when I was done
blush I need to figure out how to make
this look like more fairy like and this
what I came up with I pretty much
scraped some shadow from the purplish
out on the green shadow and mixed it
with dirt line and I drew dots like
around my eye now you can't necessarily
see the dots they just create more
dimension beneath the glitter if that
makes sense but you can totally skip
this step if you don't want to do it or
if you don't have duraline but yeah
pretty simple I just drew a whole bunch
of dots and I even take a white eyeliner
and draw Mourdock I thought it created
more dimension
now for the fun part take this glitter
and it's pretty large glitter so it's
easier to get off your skin I didn't
want to use smaller glitter and I get
this hydrating mist by hard candy I use
this one because it's like more of a
sticky spray and I just get my fingers
and I just pretty much dab on my skin
and this pretty much helps the glitter
stick to the skin um now if a court of
course if you rub it on your face some
of the glitter will fall off but for the
most part this keeps the glitter on my
skin without it being too glued on
because I did not want that and by the
way this glitter is very very easy to
wash off so I wash my face it like yeah
it was super easy to get off my skin now
time for lips I'm taking this plum lip
liner by Ofra no after lining my lips I
realized that I forgot to put my scare
on one of my eyes because I peed on my
place something is off here so I kind of
pause my lips and I go in add mascara
which you guys will see in one second
and to make my lash look a little more
cool I'm taking this white eyeliner I'm
just kind of placing it on top of my
lash a little bit and a little bit
underneath my lash I don't know why I
just like how it looked
Hey so back to lips so I finished lining
my lips I was pretty much already done
and so I'm gonna take this lipstick by
dry cosmetics caught in shin Tay in chat
yeah I don't know it's the collateral
dupe that and I literally just kind of
like brushed some with my finger top my
lips I didn't want really bold lipstick
I kind of want to flush a color so yeah
I just Python my finger I just rubbed it
all over my lips now you guys I almost
forgot highlight I don't know what do I
do in my life so I took this moon
I think it's called moon moonlight
moonlight little cabañas a smiley Hills
and I place this purple shade then we're
all named I'll name the name below I
just I couldn't show it on my camera
because it was too bright and it
wouldn't show up my camera anyways I
placed that purple shade the purple
highlighter shade on top of where I had
the glitter and also kind of brown it
down to my cheeks and I kind of used it
as a little bit of blush too as you can
see some of the glitter fell out just
maybe like one two three maybe four
pieces but that's that's okay because it
means I still have laid on my face by
the way do not lie my closure or my
edges in this video I literally just do
on this wig for the purpose to have hair
in the video okay I was a shambles you
can see my shave side do not mind me
okay just let me be in shambles for like
once in my life
so now for a little body glow I'm taking
this glow up liquid illuminator by Jade
Ava Beauty these were sent to me there's
like three different shades there's one
that's more golden I'm using this one
because of the look I'm going for you
know it's like more fairy more silvery
you know what I'm saying so I literally
just get that and I place it all over my
shoulders and my arms will pretty much
the parts that are gonna be in pictures
and I'm gonna take the glow kit again
the moonlight glow kid and I'm going to
highlight my collarbones with a little
bit of powder and that's how I make my
shoulder bones pop my pictures grandma
if you're watching this know I didn't
lose weight this is why I look so skinny
in my videos I'm highlighting my
collarbones my grand watching my video
she says oh my god or no god so skinny
and she saw scared I'm my eating I'm
eating a lot I just say tacos grandma
anyways now it's time for me to do my
hair alright BAM did my hair put a
floral crown net inside of my lips to be
a little glossy so I got this old-school
a smacks lip gloss and I just put that
on my lips and that was pretty much it
