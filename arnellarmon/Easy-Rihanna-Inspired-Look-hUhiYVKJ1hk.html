inspired by Rihanna's makeup look at the
diamond ball I think this was December's
Hensel yesterday and now as I said it
was inspired meaning this is not the
exact look I just tried to like someone
recreated but put my own soft twist on
it
so first I turned my lid using the
lemonade color corrector pen by benefit
then I go over my lid looks just like a
soft cream color I use orange soda bite
on this after Beverly Hills I'm gonna go
over that with the shade Morocco which
like a burnt orange color and I'm also
gonna add just like brighter shade from
my morphe palette just to kind of
brighten that orange look up now I'm
going to apply a white shadow on my lid
and on top of that I'm gonna play a
highlighter I actually use champagne pop
on top because there and I highlight
this shimmery white lid so that sort of
trying to go for and that's pretty much
it for the eye shadow I kept it really
simple really natural we still got the
point and then I went in and I added a
little wing now guys I didn't mess up on
this but rather than cutting it out and
you could see like I'm just at this
I showed you guys how I fix my wings
when I do mess up so when I messed up I
just get concealed on a brush when I
carve around the wing and then I just
wipe it away with a q-tip so you can't
tell that there's concealer there and of
course either that you just want to fix
the shadow that you wiped away
so after that i popped some lashes i it
was onto my face and our first time kind
of color correcting with this yellow
concealer by mac and just place that
under my iron I'm gonna blend that out
and so after that I going with another
concealer she actually conceals last
highlight and I'm using this studio
finish concealer vs the pro longer
because it kind of wants to be a little
more cleaning I don't know why I came
out much softer than it does when you
met the longer and that's her what I was
going for
now time to contour now you guys will
notice in this video that I did kind of
highlight and contour more than I
typically do like I contour my nose and
my keep it so on this I even hide on my
forehead and that's just stuff I
typically never do but I'll tell you why
I did it
so I can to my nose to let me define it
a little bit and I contour my Cupid's
bow because I know Briana has a really
strong like comet it keep it slow and I
really wanted that look I love that look
so I tried to recreate that part and
then I kind of hide under my forehead
just to bring it a little forward you
know just to make my face just over up
here a little brighter now as I was
everything I realize that it properly
blend out that contour by my nose and I
honestly mean to undelete this whole
thing but then I realized you know no
one's perfect I'm still learning as a
makeup artist so I thought you know why
not keep it in there you know just so
you guys can grow with me and like you
know I just don't want to like edit out
any of my mistakes you know because I
don't want to make I'm perfect at this
when I know that I'm not I'm still
learning a lot after I get done boy now
all those creams gonna set my concealer
with my banana powder by Ben Nye and
with the studio finish concealer by Mac
you have to set it really well because
it is super creamy and it will crease
unfortunately and then to intensify the
contour you just place banana powder
right underneath where you put a contour
cream and I'll make it look like mega
define
and I just let it sit for a few seconds
and I just brush it and blend it all
away
okay so after you blend it all away
you're going to want to go over your
contour with the power to intensify even
more time just one time my mom sees me
right at contour like raised that day
and she goes I know it looks like you're
dying and I'm just like mom that's what
I was going for you know you don't think
you're dying but the point was my
cheekbones which chisel like crazy that
day anyway so I put on my blush put on
some highlight so now into the lips
first i line my lips using this at these
hug Rose Brown by NYX
just this warm Brown lip liner and I try
to really carve out my Cupid's bow so it
looks really define the Kyrie on his
looks but I need I think I think I did a
pretty good job but I don't think dude
there's no one who can have lips like
Rihanna okay and it's just not fair it's
not right but it's like then we go over
that using Lolita by Kat Von D
after that I'm gonna ply a little bit of
gloss it's hoola by benefit just in the
middle my lips just create a little more
shine because we're on a hat and
sunshine to our lips but not too much
and here is the final look I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial it was very
simple and easy to do just like most of
my tutorials have been and if you love
me you would become a subbies so yeah
