you're new welcome today's video is
going to be a spring inspired makeup
look it is going to be this look right
here which is very springy with the pop
of color so if you'd like to see how I
got it
the katay to watch this video cuz I'm
gonna show you how in the most simple
way okay so to start off I'm gonna pry
my skin use this NARS radiant primer of
course choose a primer that fits your
skin type the best if you have oily skin
using mattifying primer if you have dry
skin needs a hydrating primer I have
normal skin so I'm able to really really
be kind of flexible the primer I use so
I chose this primer because it's radiant
I like the way it smells it feels good
it's very lightweight and it seems to
keep my makeup on all day cuz it's like
my third or fourth time using it and
every time I use it my makeup lasts all
day long so she's the best primer for
you but just the one I chose so if
foundation I'm going to use this NARS
natural radiant longer foundation it is
very similar to share globe but after
using it a few times I do see the
difference share clothes is just a
little more like light weight I love
them both you guys know like I'm an
artist and but this foundation blends to
my skin perfectly I am the shape Tahoe
and it's like my perfect shade if you
ask me it looks a little maybe it's
slightly too dark when I first put it on
but once I blend it out and like said it
it's perfect it's literally like my
go-to foundation so I blended it out
with a Tarte sponge and now to conceal
I'm gonna use the NARS creamy radiant
concealer or radiant creamy concealer
and I'm using the shade biscuit I want
to buy the shade lighter than this one
to give myself more of a highlight
because this one although it looks like
when I apply it after I blend it out you
it's supernatural
I mean it's super natural but you guys
know I like a brighter highlight it
looks so I do want to buy a shade
lighter than this but this is gonna work
for now and to blend them out I'm going
to use this morphe sponge which is like
perfect for concealer because it has a
really nice point to it so it gets
really like you know in the crevices of
my eye and something to put that out and
then we're gonna move on to setting
so to set my under eye I'm taking
Patrick's Powder by Mac this is in their
collaboration of Patrick Starr I love
this powder has like a nice pink tint to
it so it really brides it under eye and
so first I put a very thin layer to set
the concealer in place and if I'm not
doing eye shadow I'll leave it as is but
because I am do an eye shadow I'm going
to put another layer of powder on top
that way too you know to catch the
fallout I just like to set it first so
it's not cakey it's like a little tip or
a little trick that I use so I don't
look off crazy so now time for my eyes
I'm going to pry my lid using the same
NARS concealer I'm just gonna buff that
out with this brush that I have from BH
Cosmetics it's a wanted like your sets
like a really bright pink set so I'm
just gonna buff that out so the
eyeshadow palette I'm gonna be using
today is the Nicole conceal lil x violet
Voss palette and I'm gonna circle the
shades I'm using as a base I'm using
Bayesian bra which are pretty much my
skin tone once blended out and so I'm
gonna use that to set the concealer that
way when I apply eyeshadow on top it
actually sticks and splint smoothly
without you know looking kind of crazy
and then once I have my base down I'm
going to take these two shades one is
called pizza and when it's called blue
and I'm gonna pack it on my outer crease
first and then blend it in words but I'm
just going to like blend until I feel
like it looks what I'm going for
I didn't really know I was going for I
kind of just you know created look on
the spot I typically do one eye
off-camera than the other eye on but I
want to channel my self to you know do a
look on camera because I'm trying to
really get better eye shadow so I could
do more tutorials so I'm just blowing
that out you know increasing the color
until I you know I think it looks right
then at these two darker shades one is
called Mars and when it's called hey
girl and I'm gonna focus that on the
outer crease and time blend it in words
I think that the other shadows and just
blend until it looks good enough
so I decided I wanted like a lighter lid
so I'm taking some concealer with the
flat brush and I'm going to you know put
some concealer on my lid just so I can
you know clean up that eye shadow and
then I'm going to use a few lighter
shades from a palette in order to you
know make my lid look lit so I'm gonna
use three shades I'm going to use Zozo
NYC and Daisy Daisy more towards the end
because it's creamier shade in NYC
towards the front because it's white and
then Zozo all on top of it puts the
shimmer you don't have to do all this is
just what I did and then I'm just gonna
you know use the same brush that I use
in the shadow earlier and I'm just going
to make sure the light isn't too harsh
it looks diffused and blended so now for
my lower lash line I'm gonna take these
three shadows with makeup geek it is
dragonfly Fuji and pixie dust there are
just different shades of green one is
more teal than the other but because I'm
mixing with the green instead of
actually showing up at steel is just
gonna intensify the green I'm already
using I do that a lot like say I'm using
like a purple shade I'll mix a pink in
because some somehow the pink shades
were like intensify the purple so I
figured to do that with the green and it
worked because the shades Fuji and pixie
dust they were a little too like lion
green for me and I just wanted the green
to just be a little more intense than it
was and so you know I just mix those
three shelves together to get the color
that I was going for
to intensify that I look I'm going to
take this mint eyeliner by makeup geek
it's a mint shade but it doesn't too
minty against other greens I feel like
he made the look perfect exactly not
going for kind of made my eyes a little
watery except a little too much John
that's cool I just blend it out with
your brush to make sure it looks you
know clean and neat and um that's pretty
much it for the eye look and I'm gonna
go and do my eyebrows off camera and
then I'll be back to finish the rest of
my face
so to set my entire face I'm using my
Sephora micro smooth powder I'm in the
shade tan this pot is pretty awesome I
don't use my Studio Fix anymore ever
solos have roasted me so I'm going to
use that with this really big fluffy
brush by morphe I forget the name but
it'll be down below this like my
favorite brush to set my face with ever
sicilus showed me so I'm just gonna set
my entire face with that and then after
I set I am going to bronze my skin using
hotel heiress by Tarte this is a really
nice warm bronzer I use it to kind of
contour but it's mainly a bronzer
contouring you use more of a cooler
shade this is just you know more to make
me look a little bronze and snatch my
cheeks a little bit so that's I'm gonna
use and then after that I am going to
use blush this blush palette is from
NARS I'm using this corner shade which
is like a really peachy type rosy shade
and I'm just going to know blend that in
to the bronzer so it all looks you know
fillol isn't put together so to
highlight taking this new brett moon
rock x morphe palette and i'm using
these two circle shades right here one
is more champagne e while one is like
more bright this highlight palette it's
really really bright though like I
didn't think it would be so pigmented
but it is and so I highlight my
cheekbones I highlight above my left
brow bones
I don't do both just one then I put a
little blush on my nose kind of like how
that looks and gives like a more flushed
appearance and then I put highlight on
top of that and that's pretty much it
for highlight and so before I did my
mascara I'm gonna set my face and using
the pixie setting this this is infused
with rose water and green tea it smells
really good it's very refreshing and so
I'm just gonna drench my skin and back
and then after I set my face you know
while I'm waiting for it to dry I'm
gonna go in and you know like fix my
brows a little bit because I felt like
they looked a little too faded in the
front and then we're gonna move on to
mascara
I lied
before my scare I'm gonna just highlight
my inner eye area my little flaps I told
you forgot I did that but I'm happy I
did it cuz I feel like it made my eyes
look more brighter and then I highlight
underneath my brow bone which also makes
my browsing more clean and intense and
now I'm gonna use mascara I'm using this
one by Lancome this is called a Monsur
big this mascara is really really nice I
feel like this bail didn't do it justice
though I don't know it's trip because
it's made my lash looked better before
but nevertheless the really great
mascara I did not want to use falsies so
I use this mascara instead so I knew
that it would give my lashes a lot of
length and it'll make them look very
bold and dark and so you know put that
on and then we're gonna move on to the
lips
Sofer lips I'm using these to gloss by
colour-pop and collaboration with Ellery
one shade is steelo which is this
lighter pink shade and the shimmery
shade is called net up and so I'm gonna
put steelo on my lips first and net on
top just to add a little more of a
shimmer this gloss is pretty thick
they're not sticky though um the the
consistency is different I personally
like it it's not too sticky but it's not
too thin either and then to define my
lips a little bit I'm going to you know
add a little bit of chestnut lip out of
my Mac just towards the corners and all
my Cupid's bow I'm not gonna put too
much though to where you could tell my
lips are lying because I wasn't going to
that look I just want a little more
definition and then after I do my lips
that pretty much completes the look this
is a very simple and easy look I feel
like anyone can do it if you just have a
little patience just gonna clean up the
lip liner just a little bit and I'm done
so if you enjoyed this video or if you
