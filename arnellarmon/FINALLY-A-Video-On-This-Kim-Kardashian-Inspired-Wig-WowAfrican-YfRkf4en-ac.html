is going to be on this Kim K inspired
wig I'm making this video the same guide
in reviews so that's why the backdrop is
the same but I knew a lot of people want
to know about this wig and of course
I've to make a video about it so here it
is
all right so here's a wig first I
bleached some nuts now you guys would
see me use that knife this is Toigo my
idea um I was watching youtuber and I
hope I'm saying her name right I hope
this her name I'm pretty sure it's
Chrissy bails but not I'll just like
it's her like her name on a screen or
I'll put her channel in the description
box to look for that but I saw her do
this and I was like wow that's so genius
you guys she makes really really great
video so definitely check her out but I
had to try it and it's so much easier
than using a brush so she kind of saved
my life when it comes to bleaching my
frontal so first I'm just bleaching the
frontal part this is a three six lady's
front toll meaning it's a frontal in the
back frontal in the front
I like tracks in the middle so I
bleached that and I slipped my hair back
now I'm putting my wig cap and I'm gonna
speed this part up okay wait really fast
I really don't want any comments about
the druze in my arm you guys I got so
many comments like that my last video
saying oh my gosh she getting beat I
would never like I put his hands on me I
have low iron I'm bruised very easily if
you fall I'm at snapchat for a while
I've clearly shown snaps um bruises on
my legs I had hella bruises at once I
came out nowhere only way close bruises
so it was really annoying I understand
people care and I appreciate that but it
was like borderline offenses that people
would even think I'm the kind of person
that would let so put their hands on me
if anyone knows me they knew that would
not fly I'd be in jail um so I just to
clarify that I couldn't really defend
myself too much with my last video
because the video was already posted so
I wasn't able to talk about it but I'm
like if I had bruises from getting
abused I'm pretty sure it in every
single video I wouldn't be wearing short
sleeve shirts to show them off like I'm
pretty sure I'd them anyways back to the
video I am strain the hair trying to get
its life flatter because I didn't see
and the bangs wow that color they didn't
see if the bangs there it was too fat I
was not diggin that um so I had to keep
flattering it till I just make it lay as
flat as possible because it just was not
looking how I want to look then I got
this bed head like straightening cream
and I put on top of that try to make it
lay flat again but then seeing this wig
it's like in the front it's very very
high and I kept we don't like that I got
it to work at the end but I just feel
like because my personal
look if you're gonna stick this may work
for you but my hair is really thin and
my edges are really thin so when I have
wigs I have high density in the front it
just makes it hard for me to make it
look natural because my edges and the
perimeter of my hair is just very thin
but I'm Here I am just putting
concealing the part I'm just doing kind
of what I always do my wig videos um
I've had learned some new techniques
Beru coz some thought looks to be better
but I'm just trying to make this wig
look as natural as possible because I
really want to wear it that particular
day and I'm on set after this video it's
funny because in this video I almost
didn't like the wig I almost was just
like okay it's not worth it but I've
worn his wig a couple of times after
this video and actually really really
nice like I like the wig a lot it's so
easy just kind of put on like once you
like customizing the first time after
that it's so much easier to just work
with it so ivory like this with a lot
after I did what I could I put a scarf
on and never put the scarf on that's
when I went and I did my makeup and then
I'm gonna be back and I won't be doing a
voiceover anymore I'm actually gonna be
talking cuz I filmed this parks I told
you we got this plan so um I'm flesh off
and just watching the rest of this video
alright so I did my makeup I'm coming to
videos at once it wasn't in plan this
way but I reviewed it my the video
review that contour and had kick thingy
by Kim and let's just say it needs to be
its own second video so this hair um
the wind itself it's not bad the only
thing I'm really not liking is this part
I thought the part needs to be longer
no one's heart just stops like right
there so I'm going to try to make it
long one thing as the hair just kind of
stops right here so I'm going to try to
like make it as long as possible because
no one's part of just kind of just
stopped like that you know it kind of
usually goes a little further back and I
think that's even a way that it's a wig
is that the part is so short you guys
should have seen it before you even
worked with it I act I show them to get
the video but it looks so like fake in
my opinion so you have to customize this
way if you get it you have to I feel
like I feel like I need a bit scared
right here and the front part of the
hair because I can't think I over
plucked a little bit right here so I'm
just take its immense care on a brush
and fixing my part because I definitely
it overcooked just a tad bit so that's a
quick and easy fix you just get my
scared you get like a small brush and
you just brush up Murray feel like you
need you need to you guys did I mean
something looks off I'm going to make
this part longer by curving it and I'm
gonna make this work because I'm going
somewhere to get my little bad take my
flat iron and force this to go back
because this part needs to be longer or
it's going to go away that's like and I
don't like the density up here I really
don't I thought I liked my hands look
thinner I just feel it looks better on
me but I'm pretty sure on their side
I'll double check and I'll either link
it listed on the lower in the comment
section I feel like you can control it
then see like you have a option if it
was to do city you want with my tweezers
but secondly make users oh no my love
I thought it looks more realistic now
now that there's actual like part
talking behind my ear pull a little bit
of hair out on the side look to fake but
this is so my edges are already out so
I'm gonna press it out I'm showing it so
it's kind of freaky gonna first up flake
out before I eating more gel so I look
bad and leave me I just hope that makes
a little better
yeah a little better huh please say yes
because I'm not having the most
confidence right now
I thought that to me look much
better-looking my tripping if someone
was off the whole time and I feel like
now it's making a little more sense
still on my favorite but I doubt the
thing I just made it look better than
what I look like
yeah hell anymore now Excel anymore now
I actually kind of liked it more ah deal
with some edges I mean actually the
concept all right well I'm just on the
leg honestly I'm so exhausted if you
watch I don't know in the order that
closest video and the most thing apart
posts my review on the head of the
contrast expert um but I'm honestly like
after reviewing that product and it's
been a really little party post before
this one it kind of changed my whole
energy because I'm kind of so mad that I
Spit money on that but I think I
finished this winning my thing looks
really nice I like the wig at first
honestly for it that it's the edge thing
I was kind of like oh I'm not really
filling in it but it's all you need some
edges and you're fine so I'm feeling
more happy now that my hair is looking
you know more appropriate or more my
style
I had more blue lace wig reviews coming
up soon stay tuned for that and put this
hair texture is so nice and it's so soft
I could tell that it is not mixed with
any plastic hair now of course I'm gonna
go outside and see how I react so
sometimes hair I feel really soft inside
and then you get outside the humidity
you know extra what it should it changed
the texture of it and so I'm going to go
outside and you know speech how it's you
know look in I mean how it reacts to the
weather and the elements but I like how
it looks right now I'm actually kind of
excited to go put on my outfit a little
cute so I'll go ahead and do this little
league review be sure to watch my other
regime it's once's like I said this week
from where can all get you something
down below and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
