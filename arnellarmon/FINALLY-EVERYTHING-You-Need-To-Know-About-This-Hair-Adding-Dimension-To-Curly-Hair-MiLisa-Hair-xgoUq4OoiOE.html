new welcome so I just look for an app
and feel really refreshed but these
lights are killing me so this can be
really quick intro as quick as I can
make it I want to do a quick video on
where I got this hair as well as how I
got this color I know this color doesn't
seem you know spectacular what not
however I really like it a lot it's not
on braid although it looks on braid it's
not actually went through and like
individually highlighted certain pieces
I was going for a very specific look I
tried to bleach my hair recently well I
didn't write to my stylist attempted to
and I would attest stranded in Oregon
I'm Lucy dye my hair black however I
wanted to lighten my hair a little bit
to add more dimension because I notice
with curly hair yes it looks nice when
it's like one solid color however when
you add highlights it gives more
dimension it just looks more full than
nicer so I try just my hair didn't work
so when I made this wig I pretty much
did to it what I want to do to my real
hair and so I highlighted certain parts
now this wig was very easy to make I
made it out of three bundles and a
closure I know it may look like it's a
front opens and so flat but this is a
closure it's just the way I make my wigs
now which I do have to do up to the
video on that I don't curse my wigs
but yeah I metelitsa been laying very
very flat because the way I make them
now and so I got sent three bundles 20
22 24 this hair goes all the way down
through my waistline all the way down
there and then my closure is 18 inches
which I like because it kind of gives me
more of a layered look I don't know this
until but I don't like when Heroes is
just straight long like all one length I
like with a different list I think it
makes it more natural and so as far as
my pros and cons as hair I will go up
with a hundred videos because intros and
super long just not recommending this
hair I'm just assured if I do
I think it's sooo manageable which is
like the number one thing I'll say and
you guys have a notice I'm wearing this
wig
single dates I made and it just it's
just so like I don't know I just like it
a lot and so if you want to see how I
styled this cuz actually just show how I
stalled it right now the hair has no
product in it but the first day I filmed
everything I did put product in it and
out insert pictures of what it looks
like with product however this hair does
not eat product at all if you little I
recommend using product just to keep the
moisture in there because although it's
not damaged typically speaking when you
bleach hair it's cool when you first
reach it then after a while the blue
starts to catch up to it so I was
definitely said to keep his hair
moisturize just today I just didn't like
doing it so it has no approximate at all
but I do show you guys what products I
would use in it if I'd worked for
products in it so if you want to see how
stylist hair as well as got this color
can you watch this video and all the
links to the hair will be down below
alright so here's the hair in its
natural state I made a wig and now this
look was a concept on its own granted
the ends glow thin I would have cut
those off but I like to this looked
however I want to ask him dimension to
it so I started to part the hair in
sections I parted off one half of the
hair on its oldest side and then the
other half I did that in two sections
and you gotta see me doing this but I'm
only gonna show myself do one side on
camera because X took a little bit some
time a lot of patience so anyways for
products I'm gonna use this iron cutter
bleach it was not showing up that one my
camera but it's bleach I'm gonna take 45
developer as well as 10 now this to make
a difference you really don't have to do
this I just thought that some parts will
be lighter than the other based on
developer I use however I didn't notice
a difference so I don't think it's
necessary by both developers you're cool
with just 40 or on so even 30 it depends
on how light you want it
however i'm you know i do what i did so
i made my mixtures and i'm literally
just taking like just random strands you
know i didn't put too much thought into
this because sometimes i feel like when
you put too much thought into things
that's how you mess up so i'm i didn't
put too much stock to this I'm just
grabbing random strands you know coing
it with bleach massaging with the glove
and I'm that's literally it and I just
parked grab a strand government strand
random random random and um yeah I'm
will just wash this because I don't feel
like it's necessary for me to talk some
leader the same thing before I go quick
pros and cons the only will
honestly pros it's super manageable the
hair is really nice luster to it not in
this clip but what I had originally got
the hair had a really nice luster to it
I feel like the hairs very just bouncy
just full I just I have nothing about to
say about it besides the only con I will
say is that when I bleached the hair I
did notice shedding and after I rinse
the bleach out I will say that I think
it's actually my fault because I didn't
condition it I just washed it with
purple shampoo and I didn't condition it
so it wasn't it had some tangles in the
front which you guys will see when I'm
brushing it out but other than that I
have nothing bad to say I would totally
recommend this hair I've I mean I've
been wearing it uh how many days has it
been
it hasn't too long um so I don't know if
the hair will dry out of me I don't see
that happening however it does of course
I'll let you guys know but as of now I
would recommend it because I've had no
problems with it I don't wear the wig
every single day since I made it and
it's one of my favorites I mean I I
can't I really can't think of anything
bad to say or you know anything they'll
make me think like who maybe I shouldn't
recommend this hair you know what I mean
so I don't you guys watch me do this and
then I'll check back in once I'm done
with this process
so just to say this um after I put the
bleach in I let it sit for like 40
minutes I actually wouldn't I add
another video while it it's it so I let
it sit for a cool little time I didn't
have to but I did and after I let it sit
I just washed it with purple shampoo to
Conte tone so it wasn't too brassy
although it's still into being warm it
wasn't orange II and then I rinse it all
out and now to apply the product I'm
using my Carol's Daughter form on
combing cream I know I showed it really
quick in the clip I didn't get it in
camera enough but don't worry a little
if you didn't catch it but that's all
I'm putting his hair I did not want to
put too much product in his hair because
I didn't feel like it was necessary and
I just want to see how this hair acted
as close to its naturalness as possible
and I took my Denman brush which was
great for curly hair and I just brushed
and tangled that and these curls are so
nice like uh I loved it it just yeah I
had a really great experience to this
hair so after I brushed it out I just
added some more of that foreign wanna
comb and cream to make sure that the
hair was completely coated with that and
I'm yeah this process was really simple
so after I'd brush the product through
I'm gonna take my diffuser because I did
not feel like waiting for this hair to
dry like air dry I live left this hair
dry before like after this video maybe a
couple days after and when I air dries
it is beautiful because woods of fusers
you're gonna get frizz I don't know why
he just do well it's air dry it was so
just soft and shiny on its own and had
no product you know it's beautiful but I
just air dried and I got kind of use
like a microfiber micro fiber towel to
get some of the wetness out cousin take
me forever so I just you know diffuse
that I let it sit in air dry for like 10
minutes I'm trying to cover my face cut
like a hot mess and this one looks like
after I like you know I kind of diffused
it and when the air dry it's not
completely dry but it was dry enough for
me to put on my head and to be
comfortable and not soaked and so I'm an
insert some clips of what it look like
that day so you can see what the hair
looks like with product in it so it
looks cool you know
oh nice and one night I posted on my
Instagram story so you've probably seen
it I was filling myself this hair I'm
not gonna lie it was looking moisturize
it looked really natural I loved it a
lot and here is the hair without product
it doesn't look too much different than
the hair with product which is why I
said it is a neat products however
because I bleached his hair
I'd recommend putting products in here
but you bleached at least product I'll
keep it moisturized and keep it you know
soft and whatnot so yeah if you enjoyed
this video be sure to give a thumbs up
please subscribe and I'll miss about you
guys I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
