video actually excited about it came out
way well I knew I was gonna you know do
a little damaged by it illegal to come
this nice so um hacked his wig I did a
video already using this hair why should
I be very quick and easy waves although
like the way to look nice I thought this
would look better I really really really
love how to make this way but I feel
like this is one of my put up with the
word I construct this well wig I
construct this wig really nice since I
super took my time on it I don't know I
had to differently like I know I did
something differently I just forget what
I did whatever I did I really make this
really nicely it fits perfectly
but tonight and glued down to my head it
just lays super flat it nicely and so I
wanted to give this with a little more
spice and so I'm gonna call this video
from like from boring or from basic to
bombshells I think it's a super
bombshell waves and so I haven't done
this out of my area because I really
want you to see the difference the hair
itself is already nice as it is but look
at how nice this looks you guys like you
can't tell me this doesn't look better
this is like a look but this is nice it
looks so shiny so full of bodys so just
bombshell like and so you want to see my
gothic see you watch this video I have
to do this right now so you guys will
see this side done in my slow most I
just didn't want to do it before I get
this intro because I want you guys to
lose a difference this hairs from
stariha hair I really love in her a lot
I have no complaints I have no family no
shady no none of that this hair is super
easy to cut and style it curls super
super nicely especially for it coming to
me
as straight bundles if you don't watch
my channel and you guys know I take me
like trillion here I can see the body
wave already kind of curly because the
curls are super to find love with this
hair being naturally straight and it
curly like this like that's really good
in my opinion at least so if you wanna
see how I go from basic to bond show to
you watch this video if you want to
purchase hair all the links and
everything will be down below if you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
and subscribe and I'll see you guys
there's here my mouth all right so
here's the air and it's like not natural
state because this is like curls or
waves that were like dropped for my
previous video so I'm gonna showing you
guys a hair you know we're just looking
like how the lint in that hair so that's
you know dust it off and so I'm gonna
just start by cutting I start in the
front and I can't just drag this
scissors along the hair and that's gonna
make the hair at the ends a little
frizzy but that's cool you know don't
worry about that and I can't even
necessarily explain exactly what I'm
doing it's more I think when you kind of
have to watch and it's honestly practice
cuz I've been doing this since I was 16
um yeah since I started wearing weave
like 15 16 because I didn't like how
like wigs and weaves or you know bundles
I don't like how they looked when they
were just straight like all one Lynne
because I feel like that looks more
unrealistic first is what you have like
you know a little more layers and body
and just different lens I feel like that
just looks more natural and just flows
better and so I've been doing this for a
while it takes practice but all I'm
doing is cutting like diagonally and
like grabbing these different pieces I
start for the top layer and I try to
make sure like although they're
different lengths Lyn's whatever it's
kind of even I don't know if that makes
sense
I didn't speed this part up too much you
guys see what I'm doing but you know I'm
pretty much just cutting layers you know
I'm grabbing random pieces if a piece I
grab is connect to a piece are a cut I
just use the piece already cut as a
guideline and I just cut layers and cut
layers until I feel like I cut enough
and I don't want to take too much length
on this hair either so I didn't make it
much shorter than what it was naturally
as you can see right here I didn't make
it too much shorter I just really wanted
to add a lot of body because when I
curled this hair the first time in my
previous video on how to do quick and
easy waves
I thought the waves look nice but they
kind of were flat because the hair is so
long and it was kind of weighing it down
and so I wanted the curls to just have
more body just more life to them and you
can get that by pretty much cutting
random pieces
aka layers I'm not gonna call this a
layering video though cuz I'm not a
professional and I don't want to get
dragged so so once I've done cutting I'm
gonna take my flat iron and I am going
to curl the hair now I you just I've
used as flattering Dammann every single
video and there's so many different type
of curls and waves
do with this cuz it's so skinny you
could do very like big waves you can do
SuperDuper tight waves because it's so
skinny and you could like you know take
very small pieces and so first I am
taking pretty bigger pieces to kind of
get the main curl pattern going and then
once I take big pieces you know kind of
curl a majority of the hair I go back in
and I go back over some pieces and I
kind of just really defined those curls
to make it just like look look like how
it did in the begin the video beautiful
I love how it looks and so you know I
grab pieces on top I grab pieces from
the bottom I'm literally gonna rounded
pieces and then once I kind of feel like
I have like a general look going I go
back and I make those curls just more
defined you know very simple you guys
see how I'm just doing more tighter
curls now it's literally the easiest
thing to do and it's a trick because
once it's done it looks like a
professional did it but I'm not a
professional obviously and so I'm what I
like to do after I'm like you know done
kind of curling there's some straight
pieces because obviously because I'm
grabbing random pieces I'm not grabbing
every single piece of hair so I just go
through the hair and just pick out the
straight pieces and just recur those
pieces now obviously if you're doing
this on your real hair and you want to
take your time and like really take your
time because you don't want to like you
know just be going over your real hair
multiple times because this is a wig you
know these are bundles I didn't mind
and this is when I started really
feeling myself cause like oh wow like
this looks pretty good like man it looks
so good and the hair so freakin bouncy
and soft look at the luster even before
I put the shine spray in it which I'm
going to do in a second it's beautiful
like it makes no sense
all right so now I'm going to spray my
hair with this hairspray right she got
at Marshall does not pay full price I
don't I'm gonna spray this shine stuff
primers make a shiny house on some
Marshalls like I said we don't pay full
price over here and I'm just gonna like
you know add that to make this haircut
shiny and I did the other side
off-camera like I mentioned beginners
video and that is in this video so if
you enjoyed this you find a satisfying
to watch give this video a thumbs up

his hair be down below and I'll see you
