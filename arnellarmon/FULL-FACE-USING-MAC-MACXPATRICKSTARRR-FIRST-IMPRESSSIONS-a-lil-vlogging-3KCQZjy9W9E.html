Mac strobe cream and this in the shade
pink light why isn't my camera doing
this oh there it goes
this is the shape pink light it's like
it's like strobe cream which little
tinted that's enough for mobile facing
for foundation I think my Mac Studio
sculpt foundation I'm open to many lens
but my limbs of trip units not focusing
that fast but take this from da now this
is ranked favor from ditch my Mac it
actually is based on like the position
singing and how it looks on your skin
we're gonna bottom limit up but I
thought this isn't like the most
accurate sheet we'll ask my wart
it didn't look the best so let's see how
it looks today
so it can sound use this macro long can
see although this in the shade in c25 I
typically use 45 but lost in so this is
gonna be very light on me but I'm a fair
way to make it work
because I don't every through tools like
this only not to say where I have this
with my eye so we're just gonna like
make this work
all right tonight when I'm exhilarating
L it's time to go into the Patrick Starr
collaboration with Matt I love passion
are so much you guys actually my
favorite youtubers he's one of only two
brews that like does beauty is actually
entertaining this is no shoot other
youtubers of course another youtuber
loved the Patrick starters on some of my
favorites I have rewatched some videos
and I binge watch them it's still your
change is so funny so almost I was
crying in the first announced this like
massively dramatic Bob's like yes so you
do it so here's some books in so I just
super cute packaging has a little
message you like to read it screenshot
it I don't wanna wait oh I'm sorry
screenshot if you'd like to read it oh
man my lights
oh there those take screenshots now my
wreath is so the collection comes with
three lipsticks three glosses three lip
liners - I shadow palettes and a powder
I'm mainly excited that this powder
because it looks really good and I
always trust Patrick when it comes to
powder he's got made by heirs fun so I
was like yeah I want this the most and
then there's a little bit of lip
products everything one on the lips it
was as eyes I'm using powder right now
because I mean I'm excited about it and
yeah I also went to the event he threw
for this collection I don't know if I'm
gonna insert it now or thin to the video
but out inserts these little Clips right
in the video actually that's smarter but
anything really photos at the best
launch party different I've ever been to
literally and I've been to quite a few
like what influence would do you know
release elaboration and throws a party
and performs for you and does three
outfit changes anyone
so my first is powder online and those
had a pink tint to it
and I'm not gonna scare me cuz like you
know I'm more yellow so I wasn't sure
what's so fine I wasn't short they feel
like work the best for me
but it's so fine it's just going and do
it so I mean before I set my under eye
all blinged out a little bit and make
sure there's no creasing because that
can happen
it's so fine you guys
anyone take some bronzer it's so it
blends right into your skin
oh well indicated see paintin that
honestly yeah oh okay
wait pause I'm trying to touch it once
that blends with right into your skin
what's happening oh I got friggin fuzz
on my sponge yeah like I'm gonna go post
stuff okay right now let's do that
do you guys see that how some of the car
looks don't mind my little Creasy I knew
that was gonna happen
that obviously happens quite a bit when
I wait for a long whip you guys see how
the power you can't see any like pink
tint at all it doesn't look powdery or
cakey at all that's that's pretty legit
oh okay
now you guys know Alice set my concealer
and then I put it in a little air to
catch my eye shadow you guys I'm so like
okay wow great I'm like kind of bother
it's not bothered but a good way because
I like this powder a lot like it looks
so good now I have to go buy another one
and I've to go to the store it's gonna
be super busy because I was going to
sell out so I'm gonna buy another one to
talk to you I don't like whenever I find
a private eye Leigh
and this Allah this is only having me
like twice or once for the most part I
always buy another one even if the one I
have is new because I get so it's - how
is it that I already out I don't want to
run out even though my condo but I knew
it it needs to be there for me already I
do that with my NARS sheer glow I have
like four bottles in our shared will
because I don't even like to think about
running out and I think that's gonna be
this product for me I'm going I'm gonna
Milan this is my Patrick to you so ok so
now for the eyeshadow palettes which I'm
gonna use there's two and I did I
watched a video he did say that some of
these shades were already like made by
Mac and you create a few shades oh it's
a class thing covering it we know that
oh I scratched it oops oh you could see
more that she was color when you
actually open it a little okay so this
one's kind of warm in it she's nice I
scratched it you can see it lit right
one and this is quite warm too ah which
one I wanted to use I'm going to use
this one on because I always brush my
hand cover the frenemies I know what I
want to do with this so oh I love
honestly I love Becky's have four shades
because it makes Isla so easy so much
sugar you guys can do something super
quick super easy so I'm going to take
this one first and this is called soft
brown place it on Mondays and I'ma put
primer on because I have concealer on my
legs I usually like to sell my eyes I
can't on my lids chief so I choose as a
primer sometimes and I lost my um my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot
so I do oh just open the comment on
something I notice so when I take an
eyeshadow of course a little bit I show
comes on
this part dislike white part however
this is plastic so although you may
think because it's white packages they
get dirty fast it's not it's plastic so
you can just literally wipe it and clean
again I just maybe someone was wondering
I have to tell you because this is the
underlying you know brands than me like
white packaging and they weren't plastic
they were like not plastic and the
shadows stained the packaging and it's
like although you know that I was a
youtuber and I was gonna be showing the
package off to a camera for who to see
if you buy something you want to stay
nights you want to look nice and look
good so I think it's smart but they use
plastic packaging and I know I went back
to eat up anyways I'm just saying um ooh
I'm business you know sorry I'm saying
general I think it's smart that or in
general to just use plastic like don't
write one of the brush I'm using for the
base is the it's very collab with BH
Cosmetics and this is brush number six
and then I'm going to use this morphe in
b23 press to comment blinged it out to
make the lines look less harsh or the
shadow I should say so I'm putting most
of the color onto this brush and then
I'm just blend out with the morphe brush
because yeah that works how like you see
it you know great ski race and I'm
taking color I messed up I scratched it
retaken see and I am going to focus that
and this color is called Swiss chocolate
alright I'm into it it's common to it
and I'm going to focus that on the outer
crease this is also of my favorite more
people in Russia I think it's great it's
blending so nicely and it really just
helps drag the shadow and then it helps
like you know create like a more like a
diffuse look I love it it's honestly
it's like if you're beginner and I
travel if you're not the best
I feel like this brush just makes your
job so much easier I believe this brush
forever actually and I mention other
views before if I had it so long that I
come to rub the label off but now I know
it's the morphe in b23 brush use a code
go Rama this is good now I'm debating if
I kind of don't want to let me say this
like I'd almost like a lip on this and I
don't want to do one that's like her so
let me go and look I know she doesn't
know much later okay I think okay so
women James ever take this shade right
here I'm gonna place on my entire lid
actually
whoa let's start I'm gonna do it anyways
okay so now I'm going to eat I'm using
two brushes and I am take this
potentially so not took this brush from
BH Cosmetics and this is I don't know
the collection on my friend gave it to
me but this is verse number five I'm
gonna take the same share straight with
and brush it underneath my lower lash
line oh oh it's a shiny I hate it cool
now second thing I use and this shade is
called Swiss chocolate
I forgot to say last time I'm sorry
take that
cool now to the shade I into it put it
on top
pick a raccoon so now I'm taking more of
this powder to kind of help me clean it
up
clicking I brought that too far down I
don't want to look too bad communiy now
Miss uh my tag face is the mac studio
fix powder guys not was you sister for
my favorites to this bh cosmetics brush
this is the number two person and same
set as the I brush I was using we're
gonna get this powder flashback back
ties to it might a flashback I'm buying
two of them it is so smooth you know cuz
I I'm really so impressed by that powder
not stay right down Patrick's I can
handle when I saw it as a day like I
will they'll be cool for my skin tone
but like it is like that's a trip to me
like with the pink tone I think it'll
look good on my skin tone I wasn't
trying to guard this but I'm so happy
it looks good what you came to tell so
so I'm blushing wrong my face I'm uses
Mac blush and this is the sheet format
I'm used as a blush and a bronzer
so to highlight I'm gonna need to smack
Haleh this is a part of my collection
it's called here comes the joy here's
the face powder
it's opalescent so I'm use a highlighter
Keifer lips I have the reading and
options I want to use this liner in the
shade mahogany needs like a more of
darker line Rex I'm Doug eyes so like I
kinda wanna like stick to the dark even
glow board so mahogany took a look of
the mahogany color however so there's
three classes there's this pink one more
like a nudey pink with a brown undertone
and a red one I'm gonna keep this one
out too may use this one I won't be
using these two liners but one is red
it's brick and one is edge to edge and
it's like a pink they awkward the lip
colors stay that they have let's see
there's mom the star that musing option
there's Patrick move and then there is
she better work okay here's what I'll do
I'm just gonna create a bit okay so any
chance today have for some online use
mahogany
okay so now I'm going to Palm Patrick
blue this is that isn't that kind of
creamy though it is it for joining hmm
it says matter also sad my business will
turn it off okay
in the middle of the vimana started
she's so sweet and this is satin
so it's nice I wasn't mugged also top I
kind of like the Matt look
mmm but so now I need my brows I've let
my face it's like look at all cuz I
don't have any brows on something didn't
off carrots I want this bitch will be
too long and then I'll be back to finish
dressing my face so do my brows oh so I
look a little more normal now so before
I do mascara I'm going to torment sense
Brianna Kors me my thick split so cold
before my my scared me fix my eyes a
little bit bit since I kind of messed
them up when I just like the shadow
underneath is it really even
and why this palette I'm gonna take the
skull shape I didn't use earlier and put
it in my flaps all right
and from the other comment take this
shimmery sheet right here kinds of a
purple tint to it don't put them on top
now I'm just trying to clean up a dry
with my foundation powder
now from a scam using my Mac in extreme
mention and my bolded backlash it is
both
it's so dark
okay you guys to be honest I'm kind of
like getting anxiety with how cool this
is this is so not me so I'll take the
lipstick off ooh it's nicely but it's
like it's really too bold for me you
guys
like I'm just not used to it I can like
I'm not used to doing dark eyes and dark
lips I thought you look crazy like you
guys know me I'm not saying you look bad
it should not mean it's just not I can't
I'm gonna take edge to edge the finer
I'm gonna take mama star again then I'm
going to take she better work folks in
the morning middle kind of muted out and
try to tone it down make a little more
dude and then I'm gonna take the gloss
mon-star I understand dad my finger on
it
so I stir the glossy effect but it's
like there's one muted all right so now
I'm gonna do my hair I'm accident
Phillips ever video doing that because
I'm gonna curl it and assume the people
like how I wore my hair the night was
curled so I want to film a tutorial on
that and so if I say make it long as I'm
sure don't do little wide I'm gonna
thumb that been doing quick and I'll be
back to you guys my final thoughts on
this entire collection is stuff I guess
I wasn't cut my hair bites I do bun
really nice laid edges if you guys want
to be doing Halloween I just let me know
because I mean I've mental people in
Hanley leave anyways now before I give
my final thoughts on this collection we
have to do the flashback test so let's
do it let's get really close one two
nice you guys look like flawless
although I have a good cost my bottom
lip I should have so I my foundation a
little more right here but we're not
focus on that or folks on the other eye
I see no flashback now I'm gonna go on
my living room where there's not any
studio light to test light in there as
well because if let's do a light
sometimes makes you look more flaws and
you're they are I mean it's YouTube so
I'm gonna test the light over there and
have your back and I said I look
flawless
so this powder okay wait before this
balls need to save like I didn't use and
how much do you get let's see I'm gonna
compare this to my lower go see if how
to see how much you get because the low
mercy powdered lasts a very long time so
I'm gonna see if you can say I'm out
time the idea of how long it's gonna
last
wait how's that work old math okay so my
Laura Mercier powder is one out of 29
grams this one the petshop powder is one
out of it's 30 grams that means is going
to last a cool low minute okay sorry
Suja by take this is my all-time food
lovers I thought I promised you that I'd
have the same powder
it's allows me that almost a year at
least
yeah maybe yes I highly every place that
I've added this is like one gram boiler
is a powder oh wow so this password $34
whereas the mercy where it's 42 this is
no shape to learn where to get you know
you guys know I love my lord very rare
but this powder is really great in a
cost less and you came through the same
amount so so my thought process
collection one I love the powder if you
are we're gonna color if you were more
yellow tone and you saw the powder and
you thought what I thought when I first
saw it and you're like oh it looks a
little too red just get out of your mind
because I know it does look a little
more pinkish you guys see you can't see
the pink at all so I built one you guys
to be scared to purchase powder because
of the paint into it because I was
really
kind of try it however you guys I'm like
an example of that like I'm hella yellow
I hope we get a little bit you can see
you can all look there's no flashbacks
and powder it's my absolute favorite of
this entire collection the ice melt
optimizes well you see I Creek is very
soupy you look I love I should have to
have like four shades I've always been
if they have that because with less
shades in the palette the better on the
look on sounds backwards I think it
makes it easy to create a look I hate
when I review night type app that has a
lot of shades because what do I do and I
kind of easy gravity towards the same
colors anyway so I like the palette the
lip liners of course they're they're
like Mac lip liner quality so of course
the libraries are good it just depends
on the kind of color you want I
personally mahogany and almost on this
year I used the pink one although the
pink one and it showed too much on me I
did still see it I thought the people
look better if a little lighter
I took Miller I typically don't wear new
pink with buyers
anyway so I've limited mahogany and I
didn't use brick my breakfast already
she created my Mac and it's just like a
red shade like this
and so the lip liners are fine and so I
approve the lip liners i very cool if
you guys like Mac lip liners and you
like this color that you can't go wrong
because like I said it's the same
quality the lipsticks I do like Patrick
blue is a really beautiful red you guys
see me where I look I don't want to be
off and something do that to color
itself has do the fact I'm not used to
wearing dark eyes and dark with it's at
the same time however Patrick who is
nice because although it's Mac it's not
drying
you guys can kind of tell them the video
for some reason like what I think Matt I
think Ruby woo I hate say that Ruby move
red and he doesn't know you try to
remove you know that she's hella dry
it's a beautiful book super trying the
other two shades Mama's star and she
might work those two shades really nice
as well
out of all three the one I gravitate
towards the most is a mama star only
because I haven't got brown coming under
tone it's really like an i7
so I like the lipsticks and the gloss
you guys know I love gloss identify this
red gloss and I'm not a fan of red gloss
so I probably won't use this OP
highlight put this like in like a
giveaway power something's I know I
don't use red gloss I be able to do red
lips but definitely I read the classics
like like my looks really big and I flip
it just looks really intense so I'm not
gonna waste my class however the other
two glosses this she benomar class I
actually wore this to his party so let's
let me use it and the mama start glosses
very much as well and this was really
good on its own because Coggan nudie
cause but it's not to paint but it's not
too Brown so this is a nice gloss so
overall I love some tackle action oh my
favorite thing is the powder I know this
person oppressions to kind of see like
I'm just you know a super patrick star
spin but I am but if I didn't like
anything I would say so the only thing
that I'm not a fan of and that's kinda
not a fan in general are the red is the
red cloth I just simply wouldn't wear
that but the rest of question is pretty
simple it's like perfect for like the
everyday person you know you have your
pink nude you have no more like brownie
P Newlin I think then you have your two
simple eyeshadow palettes that have like
both warm softens RJ's to Cree both day
and night look so I think you did a
really good job with this first launch
at you know launching more products I
hope that's cheers I can't wait to see
them however I think that the best
product of this entire collection if
there's one problem you get is the
powder the lip color is like if you are
a super pack star fans go for it I'm not
going to say that I don't already own
cuz it's similar to this because I do
however this powder I don't own anything
like it it's not my Laura Mercier powder
flora seems a little more obviously
saying where Ashley it's nice but it's a
little more like it doesn't have a more
guilt into but
yellow-white it's not supertintin and
it's not it's fine that the past our
pattern to so I would say that as far as
only products go if your time figure out
what's a brush and spend your money on
maybe your budget II by the powder of
everything and then if you you know you
want to spend a little more I would go
for the gloss the eyeshadow palettes but
like I said I mean you guys know I get
some to my makeup so already half the
shades are so much of this but I will
have maybe like this powder which is why
I'm gonna buy another one so those are
my final impressions diamond hamsa say I
love Patrick about always supporting
what they use a great person on this the
and if I'm on Twitter if you want me to
whether you see I argue people all the
time but yeah that's a lot to say I'm
gonna insert some of the footage from
his party at the end in this video which
is like now and I will see you guys
later if you guys want my videos like
this if you guys want me to review more
stuff they just let me know and I will
do so and then yeah I'll see you guys in
every interview
there's literally
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
