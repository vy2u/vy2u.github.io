glad it's gonna dr. really really soon I
know I keep saying that but it's real I
actually to go like period anyways I
just got done filming this look it is
all jokes tour except of the brows
honestly I didn't even plan to do this
drugstore look I start off with the
drugstore primer Siri Siri I do not what
what is Siri doing she's saying
everything stop like you're so annoying
why don't what are you doing Terry I
didn't say your name well I just did
anyways I started using just a primer
and I was like maybe I should just keep
going with this and so that's what
happened but I always do my brows like
before I start filming that's why I
already done I used my benefit products
I'll link my bra tutorial my updated one
right here but I will link drugstore
products in the description box that I
personally like that I've used in other
videos if you really really really
really really want this to be our
drugstore I just I'm sorry okay but I
think this looks really pretty
it's I super bronzy and super like nicey
yet I don't know um my natural hair is
out I definitely know what to do with it
which is why I don't deal with it I know
it's growing it's my fluff got bigger
but like my fluff is really annoying and
I just I really do not like deal with my
real hair
alright know whenever I wear it a lot of
you guys say that you like it and like
oh keep it like that you guys understand
that like it just it's so wild it never
stays in one place it's like fluffy and
it just moves everywhere I just yeah I
don't like doing with it but I'm trying
to like make myself keep it out for at
least like three days at least you will
see where I'll go from there I got a
phone call
so I'm distracting I don't know where it
left off that but maybe that's a good
thing maybe I just need to stop talking
so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
look pretty simple super easy to do you
know go on my looks and I'll see you
guys in my next video I don't know what
my next phase gonna be though I know my
I know my how to start freelance kit
video is gonna come soon it's just that
I kind of quit freelancing so all my kid
is a con all over the place so I need to
put it back together before I make the
video but I would have soon for you guys
um if you have any good ideas let me
know down below if you liked the video
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and
I'll see you guys later
so first I take my shine control prior
by black route
I can't talk it's my Black Radiance
trucha black shouldn't you like a true
primer and I'm putting that all over my
face is Hotel mattify my face I've used
a couple times I think it works pretty
well
so that's what I'm using I'm on take my
Maybelline fit me foundation the matte
plus poreless after e-types the original
the du+ smooth the matte plus poreless
I've tried all three they all work
amazingly I would totally recommend this
foundation I bought it yeah yeah I've
tried all three I bought each one
probably like twice or three times each
because they're really cheap they're
like five dollars so yeah that's what
I'm using and I'm in the shade 330 which
a lot of people are in this shade cuz a
lot of times they don't have this shade
in stock but yeah I'm mushy 330 and I'm
gonna take a Beauty Blender I'm gonna
blend that all out
but for concealer I'm taking these like
duo conceal assess contour sticks by NYX
like okay you guys you guys see how my
light changed that's because I tried to
just think that Alyssa does and I like
tape the light to the back of my chair
to try make my backdrop glow but I
didn't know that I'm supposed to stay
still why doing that so the lighting chi
changes throughout the video cuz I can't
move my chair I'm just really trying to
improve the quality of my videos if you
guys haven't noticed the video is less
bright so let's end of my videos we look
it over exposed and I was like I don't
know what that means but I kind of like
tweaked my camera I think this looks
much better cuz you can really see the
true colors of everything I'm using I'm
talking a lot I'm just displaying a lot
but yeah don't mind the backdrop
changing I just didn't know that I
couldn't move but it won't happen again
anyways I use two shades of concealer I
had two sticks one of the sticks the
concealer RNA is a little too red and
one is a little too yellow so I mix them
to get my perfect tone and I just used
one of them Wow oh god I'll put the
names below but I just use one of them
that have the darker shade on the stick
to contour but don't worry all this will
be in the description box below
do not worry by the way I kind of cut
out clips of me blending so I realized I
do the same thing on both sides so why
not make the videos shorter for you guys
by cutting out some parts that I mean
technically don't need to be seen right
now I'm just gonna take some nany powder
and I'm going to set the places that I
highlight it so we're gonna do that
really really fast
it's time for I shadow I did one
off-camera
so first time take this Black Radiance
eyeshadow primer that they will be down
below and I'm just gonna blend that into
my eyelid and then I'm going to sound on
top of that use a banana powder just to
make sure everything blends smoothly on
my lid now I'm taking my soft focus
powder and milk chocolate I'm gonna use
that as a base you can use like that
kind of stuff as a base dude like just
because it's face powder does not mean
it can't go on your eyes I use blush on
my eyes all the time so yeah I'm just as
a base and then what am i doing next I
don't know oh yeah I'm taking this color
pop shadow it looks kind of great but
it's acts like an olive greenish color
and I'm just gonna use that I'm gonna
put a look all over my lids I got this
shadow as well as the other color pop
shadows I'm gonna use on the Doge
shopping app honestly guy that supposed
to bin give them a shout out
they don't even know I pick at this
video but this video isn't sponsored but
like I was putting in the shower a long
time ago cuz their app is really really
cool you could pretty much buy makeup
shoes like everything you'd buy on
different sites on one site I don't know
why I'm just not telling you guys about
this site it's like an app it's an app
but it's pretty much an app and you
could like say you want somebody Nike
and color pop in the same day you could
totally do that all in one transaction
on the app I'm just saying
anyways I took a gold pigment now I'm
taking this nyx pigment I'm not sure if
the shade name but it's kind of like a
like a light bronzy color I just want
top of that shadow to tone down the gold
is of the other shadow I put on umm yeah
I'm talking so much but all the names
are gonna be down below so oh I'm
dope guys already oh my god okay I hope
God got way too ahead of myself I was
talking even realize that I get the eyes
so fast
umm for my bottom lash line all I did
was take that same milk chocolate powder
I just put under my bottom lash line
that's all I did but now I'm taking
another black gradient soft focus powder
in the shade golden almond and just set
my face with that and I'm just taking
this morphe brush just to get on my eyes
and really really really get rid of that
powder you get to really kind of like
blend it out or else it will leave like
a ugly
flashback which nobody
now I'm taking that same milk chocolate
powder and I'm going to use it to
contour slash bronze my face up it's
powder so many uses I can't even show
you guys how I turn into a lipstick like
I used to do this thing where I would
make all my own lipsticks with different
shadows and stuff you guys want to be on
that let me know because I'm kind of
cool and I could show you later wait I
think that's like reddish bless blab
blush by black radiance and that's why
music for blush not for highlight I'm
using colourpop's
churro and it's got my god this stuff is
crazy it's crazy color pot hazard really
really really nice stuff like I wanted
it underrated but they're not but they
should be like they should be read it
more
almost done I'm using this loriel same
spray I'm gonna sit my face and then
when tries a little bit
I'm good put my mascara on which is one
by L'Oreal it's the voluminous original
and yeah I mean what do you do mascara
you put on your lashes so that's what
I'm doing
this is the part when like youtubers
start filling themselves you know they
look at the camera kind of smile like
this is all youtubers do this so now I'm
taking this lipliner my Black Radiance
this is really pretty brown shade and
I'm lining my lips cuz you do a lip
liner and I'm gonna take this other
lipstick by Black Radiance you guys
