new products um if you just want me on
snap you guys know I got the new Anasazi
foundations I got a lot of stuff for
makeup dang cosmetics sounds like maybe
I should make a video using these stuff
that I haven't used in videos before so
I came up with this look right here this
will so good does even transfer I don't
love this lipstick and this color I love
everything about it
it reminds me of a better version of
chili by Mac anyways umm do anything
else to say no that's pretty much about
it hope you guys like this look like my
braids I'm gonna take them out right now
because they're like messing up in the
back and they drive me nuts but um I
have a few videos planned I have a video
on how I style my natural hair coming up
I have a video on how I like bleach the
knots on my lace frontals on stuff like
more with videos more hair videos coming
up stay tuned for that and I'll see you
guys in the next video
the primary skin I'm useless mattifying
prior my cover of X Alyssa left it here
which you moved away and so I'm using it
um
the consistency is super super nice I
love that it's not silicone II and
annoying like most primers are and this
does keep your skin matte because I wore
it the other day and I promise you I
didn't get oily in my t-zone what so
ever so now I'm taking this anastacio
Beverly Hills stick foundation I
determined I'm the shade caramel caramel
however you want to see it it's
literally my perfect shade like when I
put it on I was literally like I was
tripping out because like dang dude
because like my foundations backing
trippy lately like for some reason the
foundation I have they've been looking a
little too red on me I'll never get to
tell my videos but I can tell and it's
been glug driving me nuts this one
literally is a perfect undertone it's
perfect and the consistency is awesome
it's super creamy but not too creamy so
if you have oily skin you can use this
if you have dry skin you use this well I
that's what I'm assuming based on the
consistency of it and yeah the coverage
is pretty nice it's like medium to full
but you could have to build it which is
what I'm doing right now I'm just like
you know put it in on places I want a
little more coverage on but yeah it
looks flawless Homme so not to contour
I'm taking another little stick
foundations and this is a shade walnut'
I totes
shade because it was deep but it also
kind of warm which I do not want a more
like a warm bronzy type of contour look
and so I just use that to contour by the
way all the brush I'm using are from
makeup addiction cosmetics they're also
new and they're so so so soft like
there's a point this video where like I
was playing blush on I just can't I want
to keep on putting the blush on because
I felt like a massage on my face that's
all soft their brushes are so those are
all the brush I'm using bt-dubs
so when I finally get up blending I'm
taking this Too Faced Born This Way
concealer Alissa also left this here now
a little first impression on this
concealer um on a scale of one to ten I
would radius six
I think the consistency is pretty cool
however when I put under my eye it kind
of made my under eyes tingle a little
bit and it had a weird like fragrance to
it as well I don't know it was just
something I didn't like about it like I
thought it blended out pretty well and I
thought it was very easy to blend you
know because it was like a pretty thin
consistency but is it my favorite no
will I use it a lot probably not um yeah
that's my take on it oh yeah and I skip
the part where blending on the second
side so I thought that was kind of an
unnecessary because you know I don't
know I just want to make this video a
little shorter not to set the place I
conceal it I'm uses cap on deep powder
now I use this in a video before however
I do not like it when do I didn't use in
the video I talked about it and this
allows more tant and I feel like this
powder way too ashy on me actually hated
it
but because my skin is kind of like
become more pale because winter and fall
is approaching I decided to give it up a
chance and it actually worked out much
better than it did when I was more tan
so I'm happy I gave another chance now
on to eyes first time primarily with
this Urban Decay primer potion I'm never
used in the video before honestly never
even uses primer this is my first time
using it and like I don't know like
three or four years
iseman was really really overrated but I
mean after used today actually works
pretty good
and so after I primed my lid I set my
lid with my translucent powder and I'm
taking this make up a dish Cosmetics
palette this is called vintage put the
shades custard cream and dirty brown and
just place that all of my lid as a base
so after blaming that I'm gonna take
this shade amber which is really pretty
orange shade and then I'm going to work
that kind of in my lid and then deep in
towards the crease area what I've
noticed about their matte shadows is
that the colors are really pigmented but
they're not too pigmented meaning you
could build up the color it's not like
one of those kind of shadows where you
immediately put it on and it's
automatically too dark these are colors
that you can definitely build up and you
just get more options out of them I'm
taking another other palettes called
flaming love I'm taking this shade
flaming kisses and I'm focused nat with
my crease area to kind of deepen that
color a bit
so now that same palette I'm getting
this shade called whisper I'm going to
use it to highlight my brow bone for my
lid I'm taking this shade called
enchanted this is also eye makeup
addiction cosmetics it's like a loose
pigment it's really pretty gold and I'm
going to use that with my liquid sugar
by eye candy cosmetics and I'm going to
place that all over my lid I'm going to
go back in with the first pile I started
with and the second one I use take the
orange and red shade and mix the two and
use that for underneath my lash line
so I have no new setting powder so this
one I'm using my holy grail soft focus
powder I'm just using that I'm trying
dust with a powder now the powder is
kind of give me issues that's one thing
I noticed by the Kat Von D powder
although it did make me look ashy and
casket ready this time it's so fine that
it almost sticks too well to the skin so
you really really really really really
have to buff it away and then you have
to freaking drench yourself in setting
spray to make sure you to get a powdery
look I think it's cool powder though
like over I liked it but it's very fine
so really really really it just sets
honestly and all her stuff it's really
heavy-duty stuff you know so for blush
taking this one by Tarte it's in the
shade seduce I'm just going to put that
on my cheeks and kind of work it where
I'm gonna put my contour I really like
doing that I like mixing my blush and
contour together so I look it just makes
my face look more carved and more
blended to contour I'm using my soft
focus powder the shade milk chocolate I
don't know why set apart a brain fart
but you guys don't always use this
powder
so to highlight taking this makeup
Edition cosmetics holy glow Volume one
I'm getting the shade sunkissed and pink
champagne and I'm going to highlight
with that and I eventually take the
shade while the shade did I grab I know
I end up acting on the shade oh I took
the shade golden beam and I added that
to my highlight just to make it pop even
more because honestly like these
highlighters are so pretty I really feel
like my camera did not do these
highlighters justice but if you follow
my snapchat you guys know what I'm
talking about they're super duper duper
duper pigmented and creamy
so before I put mascara on and my lashes
I'm getting this slay all day Saints
favorite draw cosmetics and this is the
shade I think like tea or some get
played down below
lonnis you guys I hate this one I you
said the peach one the peach one is my
absolute favorite but this one it burned
my eyes they made my eyes water um it
was messed up my concealer I just see
I'm fixing right now it was just way too
strong like this one my sister was so
she was like these ones that much
because when you inhale them they
totally give you like sort of an allergy
like I don't know man I don't know cuz
the peach one didn't do that but this
one did and I was not here for it so
after I got done being a baby if my
lashes on I use these one of my pinky
rose I'll put the name below but you
can't get it online you gonna get these
if you're like near Sacramento so I'm
sorry so now on to lips I'm taking this
black gradings brown lip liner and then
I'm going to use this liquid lipstick
that was sent to me by your closet one
hopefully this was called it'll be in
the description box below and it's just
like really nice deep orange perfect
fall liquid lipstick and so I'm going to
put that on right now the formula of
this look lipstick was really amazing
and I was actually kind of shocked by
the formula it was super opaque I only
get one like what's it called one layer
of it although I always go back over it
twice I only need it one layer as you
guys can see and it felt super
comfortable on the lips like I felt like
there was nothing on my lips like I
didn't feel dry difficult cracking it
felt perfect on my lips and the color
was like a bonus
let the liquid lipstick dry and this is
the finished look I really enjoyed doing
this look I thought it was super drip
pretty and I loved everything about it
now I had to go pon my favorite earrings
or take off my shirt to put tube top on
so I love showing my shoulders for some
reason I don't know why don't show you
guys my hair a little bit but that's
pretty much it
