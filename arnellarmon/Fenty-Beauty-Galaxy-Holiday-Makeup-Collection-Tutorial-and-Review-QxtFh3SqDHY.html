so if I look crazy and tired kindly we
just washed off my makeup because
earlier I filmed this look and it turned
out I press the record button I'm not
sure what that was about
so I hack them it all over outside just
film at night because I wanted to
another makeup look tomorrow I don't
like doing it the same it could look two
days in a row and so um we're just going
to do the makeup over so today here is
going to be on the fancy Holiday
Collection the galaxy collection same
thing I defy everything from the
collection but I bought enough to look
review a little bit everything so first
things first I bought the palette which
comes with 14 shades this palette has
been used multiple times already since I
bought it
meaning I clearly liked it it comes with
a variety shades or I have some blues a
purple pink gold green honestly it's
like the perfect shimmer palette to pair
with your favorite matte shadows and so
I had to purchase this next thing I
bought was one of the starlet lipsticks
and this is the shade supermoon I live
in I'm not a huge lipstick wearer
however I want to at least buy one then
to tell you guys you know my thoughts my
consistency you know how it looks so I
had to pick up that also bought three
lipsticks however only have two because
I left one at Ken's house when I
received on this video it was like a
first impressions video with he flawless
also on YouTube and yeah it didn't I'm
the best because we didn't know we were
doing his last number going up I left
when I his house so you should side with
me our space suit which is like my
favorite shade of the ones I bought it's
so perfect it's a good for everyday and
I just love how it looks on my lips and
I'll have gone the moon which is like a
little bit purpley however we define the
lips it's not
pigment as you think you could also wear
this every day as well if you know
you're more color type of person next I
purchased two liners I got this shade
alien bait which is a dark blue and I
also got the shade net turnt which is a
dark green and these liners are really
really cool because you put them on and
then once they dried down you get a
brush even your finger and you like
white on top of them and it releases
glitter and it's so cool so I had to
pick up these as well and that's all I
got I got a little bit of the entire
collection just I'll be able to do like
you know at least a cool livery for you
guys so let's just get started on my
base
alright so first my prime my skin with
the Finn tipo filter primer I love this
perm so much do not mind my nails I'm
sorry I broke one nail so they all had
to go and so after Berkman's collection
like I used I shop at least three or
four times I learned that it's best to
do your base face like your foundation
concealer and then you bake and then you
do the eye shadow and then you need to
rest to your face or if you have dry
skin you're not a fan baking to your
eyeshadow first and then the rest your
face because my first boom my nose ring
when I first flew this video I Prima's
in my base face and I didn't leave any
powder underneath to bake I just kind of
my base base I think it would be
difficult but I tell you it was fall out
like crazy and honoring my I was just so
sure Marie it was not flattery and so
this summer I'm gonna do things the
right way I did this thing method
earlier so I know this works so I just
do my primer my foundation my concealer
set with powder make sure I leave powder
underneath my eyes and then I will do my
that's what works for me but if you have
dry skin then you want do eyes first
that way you don't have powders together
you're neither your eyes cuz it'll just
dry them out more so foundation I'm
using the 50 Beauty foundation I'm in
the shade
370 and I also fit shade 340 note 330 as
well so interesting um someone I mixed
it to I feel like I'm already running
out of this I hope I'm not but I
got a little you know lighter when it
comes to weight so I'm not to buy
another one cuz this
my favorite it's stopping right here
I've used half the bottle I actually see
the line I'm use half the bottle I use
it like every single day and I'm going
to blend that out with my Tarte spun my
veggie sponge is dirty and I've got a
brand new one but I plan to give it away
so I'm not opening it I'm trying to be a
good person lending it out
alright so chickens am using this color
pop concealer I just started using these
Kenneth gave me like two of them and
they're so nice they're so nice and so
this in the shade tan 50 and I also I
was also given a lighter shade that way
it can be for my highlight you know
proof like this is like my exact color
so I'm gonna mix that with light 20 and
I'm just gonna put a couple strokes on
top of the concealer I already have just
to make it lighter
all right so now that I could still
explain it I'm going to set that with my
Laura Mercier translucent powder I hate
that I'm using this at night because I'm
just gonna wash my you know no I'm not
gonna use it because like I'm gonna wash
it off the night I value this this is
not cheap so go grab another powder
what sec alright instead my Laura murmur
I'm gonna use my RC amino color powder I
love this powder is whale so lies are
here man
I'm gonna use that because I don't want
waste my literacy powder the one thing I
did with this powder is like it's it
doesn't have a good actual top so like
where do you put it you took a little
bit my hand I'm joking I'm joking I'm
never done before my god
he just in looked like you know what
let's let's just keep going
so what not to do I to set it first I
love I always say this trick but like
you never know if someone just watching
me so they can learn I said it first is
that powder in then I go on top of the
layer because you don't wanna where's
Sam top your concealer it's like that's
how you get caked face so you said it
first that way this layer is sit on top
of a layer of powder so it does to stop
easier you and I'm singing
alright so now I'm gonna work my eyes to
prime my eyes I'm going to use this
matchstick and this isn't a shade french
vanilla it's like a it's kind of dirty
but it's just a plain yellow color has
my foundation on it I'm just gonna
brought down my lid alright so to do my
eyes I'm using these brushes I kiss both
oh they singing these breasts in order
to feature them in a video so I thought
you know - we'll use them now because
the brush set is not too big so because
I'm doing it kind of simple look I mean
might as well use them so it comes with
four eye brushes and three face brushes
I'm going to take this fluffy one right
here and for my matte shadows I'm going
to use this morphe 35o - palette to be
honest when I first saw this palette I
did not care for it come okay look just
like the 35o but it's actually so much
better and quality so much better
quality so if you have bought it you
should get some nice alright and the
reason I'm using this palette I might
first use this the 50 Beauty galaxy
palette I didn't use any mat underneath
because I want the chopper self to only
use shimmer and my look-look nights I'll
inserted however I expect I look more
clean if I do the mat underneath so
that's why I'm gonna do that so first
I'm going to take this shot right here
and I'm going to place that all over my
lid a prior to do translucent sheet
first okay this channel next a pretty
dark you guys see it's really pigmented
I didn't think it'll be that pigmented
but just place it on top until I my
lids nor sticky
now chromatin color I sure did oops
anything like this one orange
accidentally grabbed this color but I
mean you want me to tell the difference
we just back that to this hi cool all
right now I'm gonna grab these two
shapes right here
Bam Bam and this is for this palette if
I grab these two shapes I'm gonna go
into the galaxy palette I'm just gonna
focus these two shades on my outer
crease area and I'm slightly winging it
out and not too dramatic but I'm just
lightly winging it out do these shadows
so pigmented you guys like you could
trust me well period
but whatever comes to work these stuff
because I'm gonna fill it with them I do
not have a code I've explained it before
I just I got the paper like over a year
ago I just never feels it out I don't
like doing paperwork so I'm not
affiliated so I don't meet I'm not
getting paid or you know I don't have a
coupon code you know it's a lot of
people who have the coupon codes they be
gas and working by I feel like more if
it does have recently cast I feel like
they have really great quality shadows
that rushes honest they're some of the
best person I've ever used and I mean
hey I'm not gonna pay to say this so you
can trust what I'm saying more of these
really really nice especially this
palette this is way better 35 go 35
bills honestly overrated compared to
this this is alright so let's put that
down and let's go into the galaxy
palette now this beautiful thing I've
used it so much it's so beautiful and
loved it so much I just do it's nice
okay so I'm gonna take this flat brush
and I'm gonna do is I'm going to grab
this color right here oh god why can't
we take this color right here I'm gonna
pick some of the shadow off on the brush
yes see I'm going to spray
in a little bit so it sticks to my lid
and I like this pad comes a really big
mirror I always depreciate what a pallet
comes in a mirror when they don't I'm
like really you don't want to see
ourselves I mean I'm just gonna place
that all over my lid you guys see just
look so please II I just oh I love it
I love these shadows they're really
really nice they're really worth the
money
when I first saw this palette I was not
impressed as like you know well I didn't
say you but I'm not like a super show
person so I was like you know I don't
really pay I'm gonna buy this and I was
like you know I'm a youtuber I kind of
have to buy it to do my review and I'm
so happy I bought it but I first got a
swatch just like oh my god like this is
worth the hype is she having more hype
in fact then I'm going to take this
shade right here just to use more than
one in the palette and I'm going to
spray it only on two sprays I'm gonna
place that towards the inner corner of
my lady you see I'm doing there I just
want you guys to see these two of the
shimmers in this palette
my lid it's pretty hot alright so now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this
brush right here it's like kind of like
lip pencil II go back to my morphe
palette I'm gonna finish the eyes before
I just the powder up I'm gonna take
those two bright orange a that took
earlier I'm just pressing into it it's
so pigmented I hate saying those words
that just seems like legit YouTube
asking Stace
so pigmented and I'm just going to brush
that and I plan on going back and adding
um shimmer in my little tear duct area
if I wanted to at last that's something
I like to do laughs I just it just
gives like the look the final touch so
now I'm gonna finish off the rest of my
face I mostly use more affinity so I'll
include that in the video I won't cut
you out so send my time face I'm gonna
use this cream bronze finished by Black
Radiance
soft focus powder I'm gonna set my face
really fast with this big fluffy
foundation brush and while setting my
facing my desk I'll cut her off as well
Comfort you folks you look pretty nice
all right now to contour
I love these match sticks the lab
wording is that they work best when you
put them over powder it seems weird
right the cream with the cream to powder
and so I learn when they work best that
way so I'm going to take this contour
stick in the shade truffle and it is
just a cool brown shade like so and we
use it to contour I'm gonna take this
like angled brush and I just like will
rub it on the brush and rub into my
cheek est it it's like it's nice because
you could build it up you know it's not
too intense
it does look a very natural contour you
guys see what I mean I really like it a
lot
all right and now for blush I'm gonna
take chili mango which is this nice
orange shade right here
it has shimmer in it and I'm gonna do
the same thing I'm gonna scrub it on the
brush like so meet up with directly my
cheek just to seek time but you don't
want to like drag across your face you
go I'm like mess up your makeup so you
just dab it and then buff it out
like for blush I want to use my Moscow
Mule but I lost it so I keep alright so
for a woman to lose my voice I'm tired
for highly I'm gonna take hustla baby
which is this shape right heat wool
right here you guys can see this one
spray been used I'm gonna use that I
have a tip of my nose I finally give my
nose with subtle highlight but not too
intense let's see alright so now it's
time for eyeliner and kind of scared I
don't like doing eyeliner explicitly I'm
tired but I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna
use alien baby which is like a dark blue
one because it's pretty
those swings are really intense for me
you know what I'm gonna let them do them
make you to not clean this okay I almost
destroyed my eyes
come down so now off to do is I'm gonna
do my eyebrows and lashes off-camera and
I'll be back to do my lips and I'll get
my fellow locks
I know we think so uh yeah I had that
look I know that spell came up perfect
earlier I'll fix it re I'm gonna do my
eyebrows in eyelash on camera double
your lashes oh man I do my brows why
they let you know like that anyways now
we put some shimmer inside and my folks
I kind of almost want to do something
different
hmm yeah I already boring you know what
wait up
let's take this shade right here just
bluish shade let's see how that looks
put it right there
I like how it looks on him I did there
is no it's not like that that's pretty
different
that looks really pretty I like that
thing a lot then I'm going to take the
same shy user be my lid the paler shade
and put that on my brow bone very
highlighted yes that's intense
it's okay alright so now that's our face
and I'm using skinned anemia sangs
greatest the brighter one not getting
married but you asked all day you never
gonna wash this off
all right now number lips where's my
Mickey right here first things first
gonna need lip property half with a
napkin and will and my lips this over a
lip liner of the shape pull um it's not
got focus it's too small shape plumb my
first trance collection I did it without
lip liner and although it looks nice it
will look better with a lip liner just
add more definition to the lips if that
makes sense now if you're one of those
lucky people that you have a natural lip
line we're like the river on your mouth
is dark brown ha you don't have to do
this
no then you gotta do it so first take
the lipstick sterlet you guys see I used
earlier and I'm gonna place that on top
not interesting because when I first
uses lipstick I did not like it cuz I
thought it felt sticky but that's
because iyx washed it after I tried in
the gloss and so they were still gloss
residue on my lips so it made it feel
stickier than it was but it's not sticky
at all it's actually really creamy so
I'm happy I give this another chance
when I first tried it on I was like Gil
not like not you so let me take what is
a gloss ISM that put the dark one first
you guys see how what I mean like how
when you first put it on it looks super
pigmented but when you wrap it out it's
totally cool for every day but it
doesn't look extreme like you know what
I mean that pathetic gloss on top now
this glass prison a little sticky but
not too crazy it feels good I like it it
lasts a very long time boy this lost
multiple times it last the real time
before you need time Jeff so I'm here
for it alright sit on my face I'm doing
my hair really quick I have it in a
little bun zzzz yes it is straight in
somebody do a quick style that would
chain my shirt and I'll be back to take
out my thoughts of collection and do my
slowly alright so I did my hair I put on
this or whatever I do Mary definitely I
did it earlier because I just did not
wanted the same look again and I mean I
don't want my hair in my face as well
because I want to see the eyeshadow look
so this is the final look my final
thoughts are my products and which ones
I would for sure recommend a stove
action palette I'll for sure I recommend
that even if you're not even into
eyeshadow which I recommend because I
mean it just it'll get you to test your
creativity um it's really really nice to
this sparkly I think would be great in a
through head skin I think it's def worth
the money you get like once it 14 shades
I think it's totally worth that totally
there's no I'm nothing naked eye shadow
palette you'll see that you get fall out
but I mean it's it's a shimmer so that's
to be expecting a lot of shimmers get
ball outs anything is eyeliner I will
love if they make the eyeliner black
dunkey super cool oh the little looks
black you could tell them it's not black
at least watching my flow is I could
tell that like it looks lighter than
black so if they camera with this some
black that'd be awesome I'm appreciative
in cheek over the black liner and I know
the formula is gonna be great because
this one is great you have to mindful
that the people who are making fancy
beauty products are the same factory
they make cap on Dean you know Kat Von D
has good quality products so when it
when this came out I expected equality
because based on word base is being
produced I already knew the quality
great so the eyeliner quality is great
don't think you need it no I don't think
you need it I don't I mean once you like
to wear a green liner every single day
but then again if you have your basic
black liner then you're fine I don't
think it's something you need if you
want to have fun and play with new
products and yeah go get it but it's
nothing that you need a glosses
I love the losses a lot I liked the nude
one the most for my skin tone adjust for
my preference I like in nudie glosses so
I love that gloss it's totally worth it
do you need it no and you take the don't
need any gloss but what I recommend it
yes I think I look great in in any
collection I think it just it looks
really nice and you guys can see I just
whenever I wear I just want apologize I
want to just pile it on it on cuz just
it's so mesmerizing oh you guys should
see how it looks in person it just it
has like these nice little reflex
oh it's really really nice but it's not
something that you need if you want to
go for it it's a great product to
recommend it what else did I use oh the
lipstick the lipstick is nice I think
it's very lightweight it's not too heavy
not too sticky it's something you need
again no it's not some that you
absolutely need the only name is clutch
I think you absolutely need if you're a
makeup lovers eyeshadow palette that's
one thing I think that Haley you like to
make up this one that you need but I
mean all the props are good it's just a
matter but do you want to spend your
money on this is some
like you know you're gonna die without
this palette I love it like if I were to
break it I'd be heartbroken just
thinking about that makes me upset so
that's how I know something that I need
if I were to lose the gloss I'll be kind
of harbor I lost this gloss this one I
can live without but this one I would be
kind of heartbroken
the liner's I can live without them and
it lipstick I can live without that but
the I shop has been like the number one
thing if you buy anything the collection
get the palette it's totally worth it
this is limited edition um for my
knowledge so don't wait don't wait until
you see everyone else reviewing and
you're like oh my god does look cool
then you go by and it's gone don't be
that guy just buy it now it's actually
worth the money but overall I have
nothing negative to say about any of the
products whatsoever I just think that
all of them the one the number one I
would recommend section of palette and
those are my final thoughts I hope you
