alright hey guys watch my channel if
you're new welcome today's video is
going to be it's obvious in the title
about 50 Beauty this would be first
impressions and a review I'm gonna do my
makeup using the products so here's what
happen I ordered online when he released
and I think Rihanna's so called what she
did because most celebrities are awesome
most like friends they'll release a
product they only like a limited amount
out so it sells us super fast so people
like him rush to buy next time around
well Rihanna she like we made sure
everything was fully stocked and then
some and so I was on the site I have my
iPad on my phone I'm thinking this is
gonna sell out in a minute
literally and I got my stuff and I'm
okay wait like I'm still decided what's
going on I thought they're like no
cancel me out and in the next morning
woke up and I wouldn't decide I'm okay
like why aren't things sold out and this
is kind of weird and so I ordered pretty
much everything I haven't support back
and I hate I had two different orders so
I didn't paying $30 for one day shipping
so I call customer service I was like
hey like when will it get to me
should they should get to you by today
thing on my track and says it wasn't
gonna get to me until Monday and it
sounds like wait I really wanted me to
products now oh I make the videos I went
to Sephora and pretty much about
everything that I bought online in
Sephora and um yeah Here I am with the
videos so I'll show you guys right bot I
pretty much but just enough so I do a
full face I almost everything will not
everything everything but the lube
everything out you guys alright let's
start with I bought the sponge and the
sponge I might open the box
it's actually smaller than I thought it
would be well smaller ones looks like in
photos but actually softer then I
thought oh me too it's actually quite
soft it's not stiff or anything it's
very flexible I like the design of it
you guys see how it gets flat so I
thought that'd be good for blending but
it's way smaller than I thought it would
be
I'll get it I'll get my Tarte sponge to
show you guys the difference between
this size alright don't mind if I do my
sponges are dirty and this is a dried
tart spun usually when it's wet it's
much bigger but this
difference what accent look kind of
similar but this tells some super small
I guess I just look bigger in photos and
this is compared to a beauty lunar so I
mean it looks honest it looks cool I'm
gonna see what it's like when it's wet
cuz if it probably expands but it just
felt so small I thought was gonna be
bigger from photos anyways just a sponge
then I got a foundation and now online
in order to shake 3:30 and when I went
to support us watch it through 30
matched perfectly
but then when I want to go back to buy
some more stuff I was like I don't wanna
buy the same thing and I'm weird and so
I bought 370 and 370 looks good to 370
is like tan me whereas in 330 is like
sooo my pale me so I think that if you
were 333 70 who worked for you too if
you want to look a little more tan and
when I caught the representative on the
phone I just asked her like hey like
what if I got thrown four days she and
she goes to shave just so close to each
other that you can honestly make
multiple of them work for you so I think
it's pretty cool and then I got this
match shimmer stick and I got chili
mingles I thought it would be really
pretty blush it's like a shimmery orange
it almost reminds me of NARAS Taj Mahal
I used to have that blush those doors
for me anyways then I got this kilowatt
freestyle highlighter duo and this is
mean money and hustling baby so Briana
um so got this I'm gonna open in a
minute and then I got this invisible
blotting powder I'm using to set my
entire face then I got the printers I
thought okay like the primer prepares
for the foundation I got the gloss balm
and I retract this is so good and then I
got so much with my back to the side
I got trophy wife um it's out of the
package like I want to swatch it then I
got these over magnetic a lot strong oh
sorry I got these match sticks and I got
french vanilla wheat truffle and rum and
so let's get started so I'm like really
excited I this alright let's and I make
this wig specifically for this video
that I'm go with the vibe
all right let's put the primer on first
and I raised my brows I'm looking a
little thick but that's because when I
put my foundation on like I'm in Tony
now so this primer let's see smooth port
diffusing primer so it's saying that it
would be future forest extended makeup
we're already cool oh I like this
packaging so nice it's like a soft pink
honestly when I first saw the product I
was like a little it's similar to Kim
K's line but hopefully the quality is
better we're gonna find out
so the primer Phillip I like this primer
I mean I like the feel of it I like
primers I feel very moisturizing and
very like smooth creamy versus primers
that feel will it cut thicker mmm this
must be good huh it kind of feels a
little sticky but not in a bad way
hmm they rub them very easily okay
waffle you smoothie guys okay all right
I'm in there cuz I'll keep looking over
here and I want you guys to see what I'm
doing oh let's put it right in the
middle it works okay so it's already
dried down it feels pretty nice um yeah
looks pretty nice I'm trying to scribe
the texture of it I can't but it feels
interesting all right
funny time now I mean what this sponge
first I have my spray bottle I'm too
lazy to get up and go to the sink some
wet the sponge like so it expands it a
little bit but not too much but um I
think it's like braided usually when you
run a sponge out of the sink it gets
bigger but like I said
now for the foundation is a soft mat I'm
wondering if this foundation give people
with dry skin I'm I keep hearing that it
may not be the best option however I
don't know my skin is pretty normal
it gets dry sometimes that eczema but
for the most part of pretty normal I
don't really get super oily either so
yeah it's pretty average so we're gonna
see all right let's pump it out
actually the packaging alright now I'm
gonna see who put the foundation on with
her brush however um to be honest the
brush you didn't really like wow me I
was like okay I really really need these
so that's why I didn't buy them cuz they
just didn't look that um I mean they're
cool but I just absolutely brushes I
just didn't like I needed them we're
gonna run out with the sponge this bump
is soft I let this bunch yeah I like
this sponge almost reminds me the V
winner there's some a different shape of
course but you know how like a lot of
makeup ready to come with sponges and
they just they're usually stiff this
one's not I could actually blend up
Ignace which is a shocker cuz I first
saw the sponge oh my god I hope it's not
gonna go Steve hmm so this foundation
isn't looking super full coverage which
is a shocker it's almost like it's a
medium to fold but I'm thinking it's
buildable I cried do a second layer to
get that like super flawless finish
finish when I tried shade 330 sorry guys
I know you guys I'm gonna see my lace
why I try shade 330 and I put in and it
almost looked just like my skin it
didn't look like a have foundation on at
all um so yeah this foundation is pretty
it's kind of flawless like I mean it
doesn't it's not heavy it's not cakey it
dries down pretty fast
she heard of my fashion
this three days well this looks pretty
nice um wow it's so freakin mad I'm
trying to get foundation compared to I
now of course it's not gonna be the
exact same but the foundation that comes
to mind while I'm using this foundation
is the NARS the moment of super-long
name the weightless luminous you know
that foundation that's what this reminds
me of of course they'll have their
differences but that's like as far as
their like how its blending out in the
consistency and how its drying down it
reminds you that in our foundation Wow
look how flawless this nice okay good
see other time concealer time now I
bought two I bought french vanilla and
wheat these are heavy
I bought french vanilla as like a
highlight and heat as a concealed shade
so we'll just wait first now i swatched
these in stores and I'm not gonna lie
when i swatched them in stores I was not
really impressed by like that consisting
on them I was kind of cured see how they
blend out so we're gonna go for it but
um I'm hoping for good things cousins
don't i swatched it um the swatch is
smooth it was kind of patchy so let's
see how brings out that same sponge
okay it's agent blend up pretty easily
pretty nicely which is a good thing good
store I promise you guys are gonna
swatch it
I exist it's for girls like oh this
doesn't seem this smooth is yeah it
definitely doesn't seem the smoothest in
stores but right now it seems pretty
fine it's like it's creamy but it's not
too creamy
I can't imagine as creasing however
we're gonna see
all right Zeppelin now nicer than I
expected so let's do the it keeps but
they keep sticking to each other
that's so cool though I love that design
that's so cool
all right let's do the fridge vanilla to
highlight and this is a true highlight
shade alright so blend that out it's
looking pretty good aren't it like this
ability wait easier than I thought it
would and I love you why did you learn
that grade is because when i swatched uh
sephora i was kind of like oh but
what i'm really nice so let's company
back body Jesus
let's contour now with the shade truffle
well it's dark the consistency is weird
not weird but like I don't know I can't
explain I mean it's swatch just this one
swatch it's pretty nice huh it's not
like super creamy but then it's not
right right in the middle
this is a blade out smoothly as the
highlighting concealer but yes bleeding
out smoothly smoothly like almost wish I
almost which is a little more creamier
just a tad bit I don't even know if
these would be like the best for someone
with really dry skin it kind of blows it
away you can only see it
yeah it doesn't didn't let me greenness
um it's almost like you could win it so
hard by the time you're done you kind
almost went away and I want a nice
contour so I'm gonna go back in and yeah
Candice magna consistency by almost
which was a little to tap it more
creamer creamier I feel to be easier to
blend out I'm liking the foundation
though it's like not moving at odds it's
very matte it's very nice to like the
foundation alright so now let's use this
chili mango my hands dirty and this is a
really nice shimmery orange color you
could see it more in person it's not
really showing too much on camera but
it's a very bright orange and I want to
try to use that blush
this is kind of nice look at it that
blinged-out better than the contrary I
really like that I'm really good a lot
okay I just love this damn I could stick
them together I love that for some
reason all right um as far as rutting
goes I don't think I don't think you'll
go out swatch for you guys however I
don't think it's gonna go with what I'm
doing um so I probably won't using this
look but it's that one right there
it's just another highlight sure I can
try to figure out what I can do with it
if I come up with a way to integrate
into this look I'll use it to you
alright now let's set and meet the I am
used symbolism at so instant refresh on
the gold filter effect I don't think
that this was meant to sit in our face I
mean it's called a blotting powder
however I just want to use the ones our
line so I want to set my stuff that
Wow and it feels so smooth
I like that foundation I like the
foundation and it soon - it has
increased at all all right so want me to
the next I want to use that orange sheet
on my lid a little
that's what I'll do with rum what with
rum what I'll do I just I will do my
signature look well isn't my signature
yet I don't know that I'll take it on a
brush and put it right here I left
behind that right there so I think that
look nice right there it's not poppy how
I would expect it to pop so I'll try to
put like a powder on top how do I write
okay so I want a well I thought this
want to use this is ginger binge and
Moscow Mule open and it took this nice
pink this ha this highlight it's
beautiful I don't know if you guys to
see it's a really nice Sheen to it and
it's kind of pinkish then have like this
blush eat oh wow that's like that's
almost like NARS orgasm look better
okay how many is just a pink one I'm I
just put it let's see you I so I notice
when you dip the brush in it I do see
some kickback it's not crazy but I do
see it just to note that
it's really pretty you know oh that's
really pretty that is really pretty
oh god that's beautiful that is that is
really pretty guys sorry I know I'm so
annoying
I won't stop till it on my eyes to you
cuz I'm not only satisfied with the
storage on here
so I should keep it fluffy brush you and
I put this over orange I just I love the
sheen that this powder has other
I thought her prompts are no good and
I'm like three nights makeup kits I
thought they'll go really good at kids
just my opinion nemi's out of my lighter
the hustle baby and me money and news
hustle baby and so yeah a lot of it gets
picked up on the brush let's put out and
talk to highlight that's really nice
okay yeah I like these see I bought tofu
wife one cuz I saw you know a lot use it
 off Alyssa but I think it's almost
two goals for me I don't think I'm gonna
use it and it looks almost too glittery
my opinion so I put a highlight on its
tongue it down blue this would be so
pretty that's a little bit on my nose
almost always getting on me about my
nose highlight something do right she
says oh you had to use your finger this
pressed put too much give me runny nose
but she says to me eyes
nobody's moving this great problem to
uses other one get me show much and next
I'm just gonna turn the glass like
that's like the last product they have
um I'll swatch trophy wife are you guys
like it's here but it looks it's very uh
it's super golden you guys see that I
ran out of hand space it's really into
though coming on my home tattoo you look
it it's really pigmented but I usually
don't use gold highlights um we put a
little bit on just very little I'm
really scared
just put very little I'm not a gold
highlight tech person but just for
trying stuff I feel like a freaking
disco ball now just turn that down
all right now for gloss I'm gonna take
the gloss but you caught again binti
glow gloss bog if I'm gonna lick one
with this but you know oh this feels so
good
you guys know I'm a glass person you
guys know this it's been it's so much
money on glass and it's a good price for
gloss use the gloss iPilot buxom and
butter LONDON like $2,200 this one's
always I've been a little 1618 I know it
cheaper than the glass eye you'd advise
I was a little tripping prime I'm more
of these because just really nice a nice
smell to - all right so I'm gonna put on
some lashes and what else I'm missing uh
yeah but don't put some lashes that I'll
be right back to give you guys my final
thoughts all the products are just used
alright guys my lashes on but I like
something um I'll have some the gloss
cuz I don't know I I'm not used to it
being so new so what I'm gonna do
because I still want to use everything
her front line I take this contour stick
and a little rounder just darken it cuz
I'm used to like Browns sounds gonna a
little bit about this
not an entire lip the curling whining
them enemy while I'm at it let's use
Chittenango and let's add a little bit
out as well in the middle looks nice huh
and this put the gloss on top a little
more color
but I feel is boring we just possible
that you've lost very fun every day like
every day we're but I'm going for a look
so I want some color in my lips cool
easy alright lastly I forget what was I
gonna do Oh set my face forgot that it
was asked in 1080i setting spray I think
I'm on a blow on me and I feel like I
want tone it down use you like me have a
lot going on saying spray helps that
well I'm scared I haven't a love/hate
thing for a second spray
I hate put it on cuz I hate the feeling
I've been being so cold that love
playing on cuz it just does wonders for
your makeup I'm going
alright guys more thing that I'm done
I'm going to take this highlighter
actually did this earlier and I'm just
gonna put on top of work with that other
highlighted earlier that wasn't bright
enough for me put that on top to open up
my eyes highlighter right there I think
I overdo it
only because I used to always see people
you know how I like that I never thought
I could do it because my little fluffy
things are weird
but then I did it one day I forgot
myself do this I was watching some
tutorial and oh it isn't that bad
services that I should be doing it
well alright guys this is the finished
look if you made it to the end of this
video thank you so much for watching I'm
not used to doing like first impressions
video so sorry this a little long I was
just kind of talking that I go and just
expressing how I felt so if each product
I use the old data back from this line I
of course I was gonna buy
the shades and these stick things I
thought make no sense but that'll eat
use them but wasn't gonna buy all the
dresses either because they just
everybody think that I needed them um I
think the sponge did a really good job I
actually really liked the sponge I might
still use my tart sponge you know for
everyday makeup but this one is cool
overall I think Rihanna did a great job
her first launch I let's just go over
everything
I like the primer I love the foundation
it's a concealer highest it was nice the
contour stick was my least favorite so I
just felt it could be a little more
creamy it was a little on the drier side
that wasn't my favorite
I like the chili mango I think that
looks really nice it's still gonna see
it
I love the kilowatts those are amazing
trophy wife looks good
swatched I probably won't wear taupe
your wife too much I won cuz I look it's
a little too golden for my sis again I
can see it a little bit that I put on
but I can never imagine just wearing it
just without any other highlighter
because it's a little too golden for my
skin the lip gloss is nice it's great
for everyday wear it doesn't have too
much pigment to it so if you want it to
really pop I would recommend using the
lip liner and doing what I did and using
a shade of need to clean the gloss on
top and take over everything
why my powder is nice I don't think it's
meant to set your whole entire face but
let's see if it did give me some
flashback I'm gonna take the picture
right now
and insert it in the screen so this one
I'm looking like it's a hot flash back
no and I mean I feel like I can look
more tan I'm used to wearing bronzer
user doing foundation do bronze if I
didn't wear I like interfere with your
review however when I do wear these
products again I will add my other
products I usually use like my Tarte
bronze or the hotel heiress and I'll put
it around this perimeter because I
always look kind of like a shear and
around this area it looks great looks
like my color the match the foundation
perfect I think it past the flashback
test you guys let me know down below
making lace that's the review I like the
bread I think ground agreed
said I have nothing negative to say the
only thing I would say that the contour
stick could be a little more creamier i
was i can't assume what other ones feel
like however if the other contour shades
do kind of feel like this I think we
better feel just a little more creamier
but then again I don't know if they're
specifically just oily skin and I'll
have on the skin it may work better for
someone who does have more oily
moisturized skin I used to my personal
panthan they can be a little more
creamier and that's the only thing I
would say or like that I would fix or
not everything's fine so I'll let you
guys go now because what's review giving
other questions or comments just comment
down below if you enjoyed this a review
