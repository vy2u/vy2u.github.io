this one while concealer corrector and
I'm going to blend that all over my lid
with a fluffy brush I'm going to set on
top of that with my Laura Mercier powder
I start this video off with one eye
already done that way it's not too long
because this is a more detailed I look
so yeah then I'm gonna take this bird
orange e-type brown eye shadow I forget
the name I believe it's my makeup geek
and I'm going to use a fluffy brush or
blending brush to kind of like focus
that mainly towards my outer crease but
kind of going inwards but then I'm kind
of winging it out you kind of have to
watch a shadow show I'm doing then I'm
gonna take this primer by mica beauty
and I'm going to use that to kind of
carve out my crease area because I kind
of want to do like a cut crease type of
thing so I'm using that to carve it out
and I'm using it because it's like has a
sticky type consistency so it's not too
runny so it's very easy to like carve
and make neat lines and then I'm going
to set on top of that primary with my
Limor is a powder now I'm going to take
this color pop gel liner it's like this
baby blue type color and I'm gonna take
this liner brush by Sigma I believe and
I'm going to do a point as I called Oh a
week and after me my wing I'm going to
take the same liner I'm gonna do it in
line right underneath my brow not sure
what inspired this I just thought it was
kind of Festival II so that's why I did
it and it came out pretty nice to prime
my skin I'm going to use a spec
illuminator in the shade opal it's not
even a primer but with the foundation
I'm using you don't necessarily need a
primer because it's pretty thick if you
have like different skin issues I would
definitely recommend an actual primer
but my skin is pretty normal so I didn't
really need one and now I'm going to
take my Kat Von D lock-it foundation now
for an actual
estable I'm not quite sure if I'd
actually wear this foundation cuz it's
very heavy and I feel like throughout
the day it'll eventually cut cake up or
kind of separate what I'm just thinking
as far as Coachella weather cuz I went
last year so yeah I don't think I'd
actually wear this for actual festival
I've read something more lightweight but
still full coverage if I just decide to
use in this video because I haven't used
it in a while and I knew that I was
watching this make a book off once I was
done so I didn't want to use an actual
foundation that I like now for concealer
I'm using this one by Tarte forget the
name because I never use it
actually regretted using this one too
because this concealer really isn't the
best for underneath your eye because
it's kind of I cannot explain it it's
kind of oily and it's almost too creamy
um yeah that's why I never used under my
eyes but I decided to just do something
different I just want to like you know
try new things instead using the sample
concealer I always use but as you guys
see I went back to using the same when I
was use which is the Covenant Quan
sensual skin enhancer it's like my
all-time favorite concealer I try to
switch it up cuz I don't want to use the
same products in every single video but
this one just never fails me
then to set the place I can sail I'm
just taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and yeah I'm just gonna set
places that I applied concealer to set
my entire face and take my black reading
soft focus powder this using my favorite
setting powder it still is one of my
favorites I either use this or the Mac
Studio Fix this is a cheaper alternative
it really works just the same craving a
little better and I mean it's awesome
it's like five dollars price six depends
on where you go and then to contour my
face I'm using hoola bronze I'm a
benefit that's like the best bronzer
I've ever tried so I'm just gonna stick
to that now for blush I'm taking this
laura geller blush and the shape of
Piatt and just gonna you know put it on
my cheeks so I decided to put these
little like teal sauce keys above my
eyebrows to make it more festive Lee so
in order to do this all you need is a
lash glue you need to stress keys and
you need those little I don't know if
they're called but use them for nails
like you know little things you use to
pick up the jewels when you're doing
your nails done or when you're doing
your nails don't know what it's called
but that's what I used it's perfect all
you have to do is like lick the top a
little bit to kind of make it I don't
know the word anyway so you just need
one of those okay because trying to pick
these up with tweezers is almost
impossible and I mean it's always time
so just give one of these they're like a
dollar to dip it now where you go super
cheap so I just use that and lash glue
and noid supply these Sourav skis and I
got these two Rascals like at like Hobby
Lobby but you can get the same ones
probably at Walmart or what's the place
called Michaels or any like arts and
crafts store and you can use any color
but I use this because it kind of
matched my liner
our super highlight I almost used with
my Mac but then right after I put it on
I realized that I just got fit or were I
don't know today Aurora globe Kip -
Beverly Hills the one they just came out
with in the mail like a day or two
before this video and when you look at a
go kit it has like perfect colors for
like festival inspired looks or just any
looks they're like out of the ordinary
this is not like everyday type of little
kid I mean you guys see it has like a
blue highlighter a purple one so I
decided to be perfect for this look
because I mean I'm probably never gonna
use this outside of like festival looks
so yeah I decide to use the blue one
they had I kind of mix a blue one with
this like peachy shade they had in the
kit as well their names me down below
the line my lips I'm just taking this
basic brown lip liner by NYX and I'ma
keep my lips pretty simple honestly I
can't do the same lip look all the time
but that's cuz it looks good with every
single look I do and I just really love
gloss so after i line my lips just
slightly I'm taking this gloss by Mac
and I am sure they have the name is just
a basic gloss and I'm going to put that
all over my lips
I just love lip gloss um I don't know I
don't know when this started I know it
started out of nowhere cuz I used to
only like matte liquid lipsticks but now
I'm just a gloss person all my looks
pride all of summertime is just gonna be
gloss in my face I'm taking this new
same spray I just recently bought it's
like pixie um it just makes it glow so
that's why I got it I think it's like
fifteen dollars something that I decide
to use the same blue highlighter I used
and I decide to place it in the middle
of my lips just to give myself a more
different and unique look it didn't do
too much but it definitely made a
difference in the lip color
yeah I gotta continue to let my same
spray dry and this pretty much completes
the makeup look so yeah now I'm gonna go
do my hair and change my shirt and I'll
be right back alright so I just wanted
in my hair I'm filming two videos at
once
all over the place but I want to do it
make the book then the hair look both
festival inspired so that's why I'm
doing but yeah I hope you guys really
like this makeup look I really just make
a look I love to tell but I feel really
happy right now and the only times I
feel really really happy is when my
makeup looks really nice and I just like
how everything turned out usually when I
do my makeup it's very annoying cuz I
always mess up at one point and so like
I'll be filming a video that I mess up
on something and then it would just
destroy my whole filming career and I
just won't film for rest of the day
because I just like it makes me so
annoyed but this turned out perfect my
hair turned out really cute and
everything's going well
I'm super stressed currently life
because I leave for Europe in three days
so I'm trying to come as many videos as
possible so I don't an exact my channel
I'm gon come not to take my laptop I'm
really scared to take it I might take it
by my scared I don't like taking very
very valuable things when I travel cuz I
don't know I just I don't I don't want
to take it but um hopefully I film as
vehicle as possible and edit them on
time so you guys clean you know not be
