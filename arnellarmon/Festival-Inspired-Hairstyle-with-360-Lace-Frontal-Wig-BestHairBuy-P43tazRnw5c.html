welcome so I feel to videos like a two
part kind of video thing I filmed this
makeup look in one video and in this
hair look in another video now I know a
makeup and hair probably look out of the
ordinary and that's because it's like a
festival style hair makeup and I feel
like festivals specifically Shella are
so cool because you literally well I
don't see it literally you can kind of
like look like anything or pretty much
do whatever you want you gray or make it
however you want
honestly your hair however you want like
this may not be the best style I mean I
like it on me by pretty shiny a comment
saying suck the bag that's what people
need to do but I'm hoping it's many ways
winepress say is you could pretty much
wear your hair everyone where we're
gonna make you wanna wear it just be
creative and just cope with different
stuff like you've never done before and
just comb random stuff and it just all
looks good because everyone looks like
different but they all have their own
unique style I went to Coachella last
year and everyone was just interesting
but it was really cute because I mean
everyone was just doing their own thing
everyone's making was differently and
you know what I mean everything was
pretty cool so I had a lot of fun tell
me about this hair and makeup look now
this is the hair look I did the hair
separately because I want to review the
hair that I'm actually wearing so I'm
always gonna ask for hair I'm wearing so
I always try to include reviews in the
videos that I do so about this hair it's
Ross it really quick because I don't
have anything but to say it's my best
hair by they sent me a 360 lace frontal
and three bundles the lint and
everything I'll either put them on the
screen or somewhere down below and so I
made a quick lick out of that the wig
and it was super easy to make
I honestly although I'm not a huge fan
of 360 lace frontals only because
usually they're too big for my head I
just
this would sleep fit perfectly so let me
know let me know go there but most of
the time when I order them or where I
get Vincent to me they're always too big
and it's always complicated but this
would have to command perfectly so I
spoke too soon but I like them because
if you spend less time putting the
tracks on and you have to use less
tracks because the 3c lace frontal takes
up most of your head space anyways and
so yeah make this wig I was able to do
this style with that I'm dead
hair jet-black only because I'm tired
one beat like sometimes I just don't get
here at all but I don't know I just want
to jet black and I mean I think it looks
pretty cool even though my natural hair
kind of like sticks out and there it's
blond so it's kind of awkward sometimes
um I mean I like it
their hair honestly perfectly fine I
haven't any problems with it uh I
haven't uh sometimes I'll I don't want
to talk it tangling cuz that's not the
case it'll only tangle if I like you
don't brush it I'm kind of left in it
and I think most hair does that but I
really like the sweetness of this hair
it came in a body wave but it gets bone
straight and it feels very sleek um
that's not the best way I can explain it
but it feels very like look sleek like
very just smooth and I noticed this it's
not all hair I've worn has done this
that's what stand out to me but I'm not
even Ali everything's perfectly fine um
I customize my front toe a little bit by
it I cut some of the front to living by
bleaching the knots it's alright to do I
made a little bit baby hairs up front
the only thing differently I do about
this wig I thought I caught the lace too
soon I just feel like my hair lines
annoying and weird because somehow no
matter what wig I wear my hairs are
always sticking out on the side so I try
to cover it so I have none of my real
hair left out but never once not that
way and I really don't know what to do
at this point that's really prominent
hat oh no Matt everything's fine that's
like I'm talking a lot and you guys cry
just want to get to the video which is
me very simple very easy
I like this hairstyle look it's pretty
different honestly um whilst in this
video I didn't know where I was gonna go
with this um the other day I wore my
hair like this but mine is this braid
and it wasn't a ponytail so I just had
this braid right here to have my hair
down I thought it was really cute I have
to show you that right now since I mean
just happy not gonna affect anybody I'll
show you guys how I had it because I
mean you could also wear like this too
I just want to do something
my filming so although I think of my
little parade though I don't never
through my break but I have my hair like
where I just have one braid going to the
side and it was like this wow that's
kind of cuter than one do I had it that
way well at least you guys see it and
this you guys see that I did it that's
why freaking kid or huh
dun dun dun
alright well I'm doing the beginning
video so you guys see like if you don't
like the finish result of this style
retie behind you totally just do this
because this looks just as cute I just
want to do something different in this
fun and I have been trying to like
explore outside of my comfort zone hence
the makeup look I just wanted to do
something different so and I'm talking
I'm just really excited I'm hot and have
a lot of energy and I finished a whole
thing Jamba Juice which I never do
anyway if that's off-topic I hope it
doesn't in this video if you do please
give a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll
see you in my next one
alright so before I stop braiding the
hair I'm just gonna comb it out with the
comb really bad you guys see the hair is
very sleek very silky so I'm able to
just run through with the comb which not
all hair you can do that usually I use a
brush but with this hair is very just is
very easy to manage and easy to work
with so I'm probably on a little section
because I knew I didn't want all the
hair back and I wanted some type of bang
thing going on so I'm pouring out the
section I'm gonna leave out and then I'm
going to section out the part that I
plan to breathe
and now I'm just gonna break that part
um I don't really know how to explain
how to braid because I'm not even an
expert braider I'm pretty good at
braiding all myself but I don't know I
bet other people so yeah you're just
gonna just break the part going down
like following the angle or the
direction your bangs are going
yeah one sit down with that Bert you
want to get a rubberband and just tie
that off so it doesn't come apart
I know it's usually with extensions it's
harder to hold braids like you have to
tie it up at the end because you always
comes apart so I put my bangs to the
side you know to get them out the way
and I'm gonna go and breathe the other
side of my head so now I'm going to the
same day i don''t other side which is
part a little section to leave out and
this also helps cover any of my mistakes
I mean in my wig like I don't explain
like the edge of the lace if that makes
sense
and so I'm gonna part this one section
I'll flip it behind the other braid you
don't have make sure it's not in my way
and I'm gonna braid another little piece
pretty much going the opposite direction
of agree
so now I'm going to take both those
braids and bring them back in my head um
I really didn't have this style planned
so I would just try and do whatever I
thought looked pretty decent I thought
this looked pretty cool I like the
effect that it had and so I just tied
that up in the back put a rubber band
now I'm gonna take my flat iron and
conda's bumped a little ponytail going
inwards that way the hair isn't just
sticking up back there awkwardly and now
I'm just going to perfect my bang part I
had some flyaway so I'm gonna get this
foam stuff and a toothbrush and I'm just
going to use it to flatten it I like
using the foam stuff because it will
like hold the hair but it won't make it
stiffer anything and the product doesn't
build up so that's why I use that and
yeah just check out the hairstyle seen
what I like about it what could do
differently I decide to put like little
hair jewels in it cuz this is like a
festival inspired look and usually with
festival hairstyles you have to have
some type of bling now these jewels are
usually for dreads so they're a little
too big but what I learned about these
little like hair jewels the metal that's
used to make them and very flexible so
all you do is just like kind of like
open them and then use scissors to cut
them and they cut super easily so you
can adjust the size of them and so it's
too big you just cut a little piece off
and then it'll fit perfectly on your
hair
though after putting my hair jewels in
that's pretty much the finished look so
I'm gonna change my shirt so this video
makes more sense so it's more festively
and I'll get this into the video if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up
please subscribe if you're going to
Coachella leave the comment down below
cuz I'll be there weekend too and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
