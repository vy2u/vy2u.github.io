my matte rescue by benefit it's one of
their newest products it's a mattifying
gel and it also blurs your pores so if
you have really oily skin I would
definitely recommend trying this product
because it works awesome for me and I'm
just gonna really Pat that into my skin
around my nose where I get oily I do not
apply it to my entire face because I did
not get oily on my entire face
to pry my skin I'm using my cover
effects illuminating primer now your
primer is based on your skin type so if
your oily you're gonna want to use a
mattifying primer if you're dry ago I
use a hydrating primer
there's also primers that are
specifically for poor such as
professional eye benefit there's primers
that you know illuminates you the Abdo
or skin there's this really nice one
called radiance bronze by Laura Mercier
there's a lot of prime to choose from
just make sure you get one that's good
for your skin type
for foundation taking the L'Oreal
infallible foundation on this is a
mattifying foundation which is why I
chose to use illuminating primer because
I didn't want to look too matte so I
decided to use both together to kind of
get that in-between kind of look but
this foundation is great if you have
oily skin now I will recommend to other
foundations that I really really like
and that are good for beginners by the
way to apply my foundation I'm using a
Julius Place stippling brush my first
recommendation is a Mac face and body
now this foundation is perfect if you
never wear foundation before and you
want something that's very lightweight
but I will say it does not offer much
coverage whatsoever my second
recommendation is the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation and this
foundation is very pricey but what I
love about it is its full coverage and
if it was very lightweight so it's
perfect if you have like blemishes and
whatnot but you don't want to have heavy
foundation on this foundation is perfect
for that
now when applying your foundation you
want to make sure you really work into
the skin you also want to make sure you
bring it down your neck just a little
bit just to make sure it does not look
like you have a mask on especially if
your foundation shade isn't a hundred
percent perfect you know it doesn't
match your skin like completely you
wanna make sure you do that so to
conceal I'm using Barris and by bare
minerals this concealer is perfect for
beginners because as a very thin
consistency to it so it gives you a lot
of time to really work with it it
doesn't dry extremely fast so if you're
not you know the fastest blender this
conceal is perfect because you have a
lot of time to work with it and to play
around with it it's also very hydrating
so I would definitely recommend it to
someone who has drier skin another great
concealer I would recommend is the Mac
Pro Longwear but I will say that when I
first started makeup and I try to pull
along where it dried a little bit too
for me and because I wasn't that great
at blending and I wasn't that fast in a
goofy and a hot mess but if you have
oily skin Pro Longwear is definitely a
great concealer I would definitely
recommend it you just have to blend
pretty fast because it does dry really
fast now to highlight a contour i'm
using the cover FX contour kit now I
chose this kit because I really enjoyed
the contour shade I know it looks a mess
but it works amazingly the contour
shades pretty natural and I decided it
would be best to use that for this video
because of your beginner I'm pretty sure
you want a natural contour but you're
not worried for the people who want a
very intense contour I do show you a
trick to make your contour more intense
so to highlight you want to take a cream
shade that's about two shades lighter
than your foundation color now I'm
highlighting it underneath my eyes and
I'm doing a little triangle little
shapes and then I highlight the bridge
of my nose even though I don't really
have a bridge I made it work I highlight
my chin and I highlight under where I'm
gonna place a cream contour and that's
what's gonna make the contour a little
bit more intense I'm also going to
higher than my forehead a little bit now
if your forehead is pretty big which
mine is you might want to skip this step
but I just did it you know because I
want to show you guys how highlight
every part of your face and also high on
your forehead kind just brings
everything together but typically I do
not prefer time on my forehead because
it just makes it bigger but I'm also
gonna act on my forehead so you know no
worries oh and by the way all the
brushes I'm using are from Julia's place
I decided to use you know brushes that
often same brand so it'd be easier for
you guys to get them and plus I would
really really really recommend this
brush because these brushes are amazing
probably the best price I've used and
just to mention when you do contour you
want to use a shade that's two shades
darker than your foundation but if you
want a little more natural you can use a
shade that's maybe one shade darker than
your foundation which is this contour
shade I'm using right here
now cut tore my nose has always been a
little hard because I don't really have
a prominent bridge by learning that when
I put the lighter contour shade on my
nose first and then the darker shade it
definitely makes a huge difference and
it makes it easier for me you know to
kind of get what I'm going for if it
makes any sense at all so if you have a
nose that's pretty pretty like mine it's
kind of flat it doesn't really have big
bridge I would definitely recommend you
know putting the lighter shade first and
then placing the darker shade around the
lighter shade because it makes it so
much easier to create your little bridge
now I'm blending my life away with the
beauty blender sponge now a lot of
people use their sponges damp I do not I
don't know if that makes me weird I just
I feel like it works perfectly fine when
it's a little dry I just I just don't
like a dam and yeah I just don't like
he's maybe but his dam now when I blend
on my forehead contour and I'm going to
turn the sponge around and use the
fatter side because it just makes the
darker contour shade and a lot of
contrast rate blend together easily
if you doesn't see as you can see I'm
kind of going up and down to really get
those shades blended now I'm gonna blend
my cheek contour yeah this is like my
favorite part because I love to zlin my
cheeks
so yeah when I contour I really do
prefer to use warmer shades there are
some people who use like shades that are
you know really really dark because they
want like extra intense crazy contour
but you guys know me I'm naturally nelly
so I just I love warmth I love natural
you know what I mean
so to blend out my contour I'm using a
baby blender and yep I'm just gonna you
guys what you guys see what I'm doing
I'm just blending away and just blending
and blending and blending now honestly I
thought makeup is all about preference
if you want to leave your nose contour
looking like this right here you could
totally do that if you want you know
stronger nose or you could do like me
and just keep blending because I
although I did what my nose contoured I
didn't want to be like wrong does she be
a new nose I just want to be like oh she
defined her nose a little bit but it
still looks like her nose that's what I
was going for so before setting your
highlight you want to make sure you go
underneath your eyes and blend just a
little bit to make sure you have no
little creases and then you're gonna get
a banana powder which is like my
favorite powder in life and you're just
gonna get another Beauty Blender and
pack that underneath their eye to really
set that stuff
yeah guys I love me some mani powder
like it's like my favorite powder ever
dude ever okay so I'm put underneath my
eyes on the bridge of my nose and
underneath my place back cream contour
shade just to make my contour not too
crazy but I want you to know that I
contoured I want my cheeks to look like
I just I don't even know what I just did
I just want them to look very very nice
and chiseled and I'm gonna set the
highlight on my forehead as well and
then you're just gonna let this sit not
for 15 minutes maybe five just a little
bit just a little bit set my entire face
I'm using my mac mineralize skinfinish
powder now this powder is perfect for
beginners it's perfect for everyone okay
it just makes everything look so natural
and smooth and you don't have this
powder I'm telling you right now that
you need it because it's just amazing
okay just take my word for it
trust in me and you will succeed
if you wait now I'm toasting away that
banana powder cuz you know we can't
leave banana powder on our face you know
I look crazy
now to really get underneath my eyes and
really dust that powder way I'm gonna
get this awesome tapered brush from
jukka's plays which is like one my
favorite brushes from them and I'm gonna
really get out of there and make sure I
have no powder underneath my eyes
now to set my contour i'm gonna use this
soft focus finishing powder my black
radiance it is a foundation powder
because I noticed typically a lot of
times when companies have bronzers one
they cost more because they're calling a
bronzer and it has shimmer in it which
is gross if you're trying to contour
with it so I'm just gonna take that and
you know just go over where I place my
cream contour earlier now I made a
mistake
accidentally add a little too much but I
will show you how to fix that my friends
if you ever add too much bronzer or even
blush you're gonna get the same brush
views to apply your foundation powder
and you're not gonna add any extra
powder you're just gonna use the same
brush and you just go over it and defuse
those lines and you see it just made it
all right and I was happy about it
that's like my total tip it just yeah
it's amazing it's like it's an eraser or
something and I'm gonna go over my nose
contour it just a little bit you know
cuz I want my nose to look the same
now to brighten my highlight just a
little bit I'm gonna give my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit and get this
shade banana I'm just gonna lightly dust
underneath my eyes I'm gonna probably
about my nose and on my chin as you will
see me doing here
now with this shade man I honestly think
it's more for your skin tone because
when I put too much this stuff on I look
like that alik ass get ready I'm not
gonna lie but you know I learned that
when I put very very little on it just
brightens my my highlight just enough
and I'm totally fine
now go take that same shade I'm gonna
put a little bit underneath my contour
but I'm not gonna go all the way down
I'm gonna just keep it at the very you
know I don't know what just the very top
of my contour just to you know let you
guys know hate my contours right here
but you do not want to place the shade
underneath the entire freaking contour
line because then you'd be out here
looking crazy and I've seen people do it
it is not pretty so don't do it now type
the real highlighting I'm gonna use my
glow carrot man I saw scary Hills I'm
using the shades dripping and golden
bubbly not a hyper tips of my cheeks I'm
gonna have my nose a little bit my chin
and my Cupid's bow now as far as tips
when it comes to high light for
beginners I would just recommend getting
a highlight shirt that complements your
skin tone I will say to kind of go light
if you can you know it's cool to have a
really popping highlight but there is
such thing as too much highlight guys
and I seen it I'm at I seen this girl
who had so much highlight it looked like
she had like glued a mirror to her face
that's how high light she was and I
don't want any you guys look like that
so you can't go and teach the highlight
but please be mindful like just don't go
out and try purpose of blind people you
know it's wrong you know and not
everyone could afford classes so just
kind of like be be a little light on the
highlight it's mostly if you're new
don't go too crazy okay there's yeah now
for blush I'm using this one by Sigma I
like this blush because it's a mixture
between a peach and pink blushes like
this they're really good for people who
are more red that's one thing I learned
in Mac is when you wear red you want to
use a blush it's not too pink and not
too peach because it really helps
balance it out a good blush from Mac
that really helps the redness is blessed
called Melba I would definitely check it
out and if you have a more dark
complexion I would definitely check out
the blush raisin man that blushes fire
it is completely fire and I just I just
recommend to you guys like the best
watches ever
