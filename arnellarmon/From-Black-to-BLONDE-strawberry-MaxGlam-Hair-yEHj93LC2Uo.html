you're new welcome I'm right now I'm
trying to back these intro things so you
guys know who you're watching so yeah
for real
this is my channel um yeah I'm so
awkward I'm a weirdo uh this video is
going to be how I got this hair color
now I didn't know if it style this video
because I wants a blonde but since I'm
this kind of yellow but the bops I use
is like a strawberry blonde so I'm most
likely Tarlov video back um is this
Johnny blowin oh I can strawberry vibes
like in real life I feel like I get
strawberry hints um it looks pretty
yellow to me whatever the heck I like
the color and I'm pretty sure you guys
will like it too I haven't post on
Instagram I haven't debuted yet I posted
a little I do story sneak peak and I've
gotten a few good responses so I'm
assuming you guys like it and of course
I filmed how I got this color of course
and now it's this trim because this
color actually grew on me so I made this
wig I definitely ran everything and I
filmed myself trying on and is like a
final eclipse I'll show you guys I'll
insert some of them so you can see how
much I'm struggling because I really
wanted this to be a side part and if I
part this like so you guys will see the
wig isn't glued down by the way um I had
a side part and I made some of the roots
dark because I never I of course I have
I've had light hair before but I've
never had strictly light hair with no
dark roots so I started to do dark roots
but that wasn't looking good because my
edges looked kind of like off and so if
I do the middle part I was okay if you
have a middle part you have to keep the
roots like because I explained what I
was trying to do the dark roots and
wasn't looking good and so I cut the
roots like I just asked a little baby
hair soup and acting like it like it
isn't that bad when I first put it on I
was like oh snap
I've dyed his hair over my died over I'm
sure filming and then they're gonna be
confused cuz I okay what color we're
trying to get and it shouldn't be this
hard to get this color and it was just
all over the place
so I'm happiness grew on me I feel like
the reason why I'm not used to it cuz
I'd like I've had that's color similarly
list before but I had dark roots and
when you
dark roots with like any color you could
both if you put dark roots at any color
you could pretty much make any color
work as one ones the up dark roots you
can make the color work so it's very
hard to make just one color but notnot
like dark roots work but I like it so
this hair is from Max glam hair I have
the deets right here I have Brazilian by
the way so I got a most basic hair ever
it's sixteen eighteen twenty into the
twelve inch lace frontal I didn't cut it
so it's just going like right above my
nipple I've always represented to my
boobs let me stand up with you guys oh
it goes like right above 100 maybe like
an inch above my nipple where my nipples
it goes right here okay and I am five
three of that house I don't know the
Limpy now that I cut it but the longest
lip that got was a twenty inch and so my
thoughts on his hair I super like this
hair you guys it is so soft and nice for
how much I processed it I want to say I
like this hair like crazy and I told you
like crazy that I dyed it I did a lot to
his hair so I'm actually like quite
shocked that it still has bodies does
movement it's not dried on him dead I
meant to talk about that because I've
ever had with leeches hair each other
hair so I'm trying to fuse it to when
I'd lose his hair why I say I lift it up
damn it almost to a plant so I processed
this hair a lot with 45 developer and
everything and it took the bleach really
really well um I have experienced no
shedding I'm not giving any tangling
either as you guys can see I'm like
raping my hands through the hair and Wow
I have no hairs I have no hair do you
guys know I will show you guys when I
get the hairs
I have no shedding at all I'm trying to
one frosty like why didn't you Jenny I
have no Jenny whatsoever oh I see
strands like one strand after all that
breaking so I drew like this hair a lot
I love this color it grew on me it took
some time but I like it a lot now that
like I styled in everything a personal
straight when illustrated in look the
best by flood now that it's waving like
nice
I think it looks great and so I'm yeah
I'm nothing
save up his hair and bleach super easily
it's very easy to dye this hair very
easy style it I have no negative things
to say which is huh is kind of ring up
psyche easy finally slick one thing but
I have nothing that to say at all so if
you're interested person whose hair
which I would totally recommend if you
want to do this color specifically
because there here is great for that all
the links to everything will be down
below I militias watch this video see
how I got this color if you're
interested if you find this video
helpful or if you just like me
give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
alright so here's here in snatch of
states one show you guys when it came as
just about this frontal and I got four
bundles but I only bleached and diet
three at the bundles cuz I knew I would
only need three now first I'm going I'm
gonna work on the front tool I'm not
gonna show myself dying the bundles cuz
that took a long time so I'm just go to
the front tool because that's like the
most I mean that's all you need to see
so first I'm gonna get this ion powder
lighten their bleach it's my favorite
bleach the only doesn't work really
great but it does not have any like
dusty is to it and it has like a very
nice pleasant smell so it's not too
strong it won't you know make it coffin
choke and die you know it's great I love
it so I got like three scoops of that I
use a lot of it and then I'm gonna add
the 45 developer I used the matching
developer I like using like you know the
same like line of products I learned
that it works the best and so I'm I just
pour some developer in and I'm gonna mix
that up with a whisk and I'm going to
start applying it to the frontal
so this part is simple I'm going to lay
some foil underneath the frontal only
because I like to minimize my mess and
fall also helps the bleach process
faster so I always have full exciting
and wrapping it in foil so I'm just
going to fold down this little surface
and I'm using it is a kitchen aisle that
I bought from Ikea if you're wondering
and I paid $150 for it and it's cool
because I has two shells underneath so I
just put on my hair stuff on it and just
I feel like it'll make my hair dyeing
videos better tell me if you guys like
this angle better I just felt like you
know I want to like improve the quality
of my hair dyeing video so I thought
that this may help so I'm yeah let me
know if you like it but here I am just
applying the bleach I decide to move the
foil close in my way and so at first I
want to keep the roots dark but then
torsa and I just put the bleach like
everywhere and I decided to just go full
out blonde because I mean I always do
dark roots and I plug dark roots they're
just so easy I want to really see if I
could do like all blonde so um yeah I'm
just gonna apply the bleach I'm gonna
speed this part up and I'll check back
in once I start their tawny process
so I love this process usually a little
process to the foal gets hot and you'll
see you start to steam which takes like
20 30 minutes depending on how much
bleaching it and so I exaggerate when I
say I bleached a platinum this isn't
platinum it's more like yellow but it
still lifted very very well and so here
I'm taking this toner by Wella and this
is 0:50 it's like cool violet it's it's
gonna super total to hear you guys this
like you would use if you like brought
the hair to a platinum and you want it
the hair to be gray
this saccade toner you would use and so
for each bottle toner you need two parts
developer and I use 25 developer this by
Clairol and I just mixed it with a whisk
and then I'm going to apply to the front
tool it's very simple
so while doing this you'll see you a
toner our math we start to work now I
learn new things every single day and
like after I made this video I watching
more videos I just watch random people
and I found out that you could leave his
arm to the tone turns a dark purple I
just get scared
I never wanna overtone because then
it'll look purpley sorry my camera shaky
I was kind of being a little rough and I
the reason why it looks all bubbly and
water is cuz I was draining the water
out I didn't completely dry the frontal
but don't mind that it really doesn't
mean anything but yeah I didn't know
that you can leave this into a turned
dark purple so I'm gonna try that next
time and let you guys know how it works
for me I just I never want to over tone
but um yeah I'll try next time and I'll
show you guys how it comes out and so
after I did that I'm gonna take these
dyes I totally forgot the name of these
and I'm currently editing a like 12 so I
don't have the box next to me but
they'll be done below but there are
these Harold dyes that I found that
sally's I'm always buying random dice
from Sally's and it was like a it's like
a medium blonde medium like red blonde
like I want to go for a strawberry
blonde color so that's why I picked up
these box dyes they didn't do well
actually they did something they did
give me more of a blunder with like in
real life you can kind of see the
strawberry tins so I will say that these
box dyes worked but I mean I feel like
any blonde boxed I could have worked for
this because the hair really does look
super blonde you know you don't see too
much of the strawberry but I want to oh
my god the hair may look nice if I add
pink on top of it huh like maybe like
pink dye would makes a conditioner that
may look oh my god sorry I just toyed
thought something if I if I do it I'll
film it to show you guys how it comes
out but anyways um I just squeeze both
dyes in one is slightly darker than the
other because I thought this dye would
show up way more than it did so I was
into the got armoury effect but I
probably would've been better off with
one of these days anyways I mix the dye
with developer in order to activate it
and then you know I laid my fall down
and I just applied the dye to the
frontal it was pretty simple I thought
hey I think I'm moving this walks into
being the way I don't know why I kept
using the foil I actually it's pretty
cool the marble on this table is not
actually part of the table I bought this
like the Marmol you know little sticky
things I know what's called because
stick onto anything
and it's cool because I learned that
while dyeing hair that it does not stain
I can use any hair dye on this and it
won't stain so I think it's pretty cool
I'm just giving a tip in case like you
do videos too and you want to like you
know have something cool to dye your
hair on you can use this or you even if
you like dialetti hair at home you could
buy this little thing from Walmart cycle
Rolfe like five dollars and you put on
the surface and it doesn't get stained
so it's pretty cool anyways here I'm
just adding the dye onto the frontal
really making sure that all the dye gets
into it then after I dyed it I let it
sit and that was pretty much it you know
I made the wig I dried it this is the
original color I'm inserting clips from
the original video I filmed trying to
style this wig on camera it was a
complete fail you guys because I was
trying to do a side part and I'll show
you but here in this part you could see
the roots are a little bit on the redder
side so it did get some of the
strawberry hints to it so the dye did
work for the most part you could see
some of the redness in this lighting
I McKinney it looks really
really yellow I'm not sure that's about
I think it's my lighting but in this
specific lighting you could see the
strawberry blonde is so here's what the
wig looks like you know before I style
it and I'm gonna insert a clip of how it
looked like when I want to do a side
part and the side part would have been
an absolute concept however I couldn't I
didn't know what to do with my freaking
sideburns so that's why I'm doing a side
part because I just I didn't know what
to do with that so I'm doing him in a
part and then I want curling the hair
and this is a finished look it's
interesting that you can't see the red
tones in this part I'm really not sure
if that's about however I still like
this color I love this color it really
on me I hope you guys found this video
helpful and I hope it wasn't too hard to
follow along it was really simple and
you just bleached out and died really
simple and if you enjoyed this video or
found it helpful be sure to give it a
thumbs up and please subscribe and I'll
see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
