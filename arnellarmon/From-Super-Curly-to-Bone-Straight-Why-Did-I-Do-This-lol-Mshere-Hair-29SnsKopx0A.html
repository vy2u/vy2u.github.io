you're new welcome so today's video is a
mistake because I did not plan on
staying at this place training this hair
never taking the story okay so this flat
iron actually brought today you know you
guys knows a little kiosk at the mall
where like try this hair see my little
cool free hair serum then like buy the
flat iron to make strike tonight sell
you and I like stuff I don't curse
me where my channel um well I don't want
to say that finessed me because I Bobbi
was fired before and I like did before
however flick get Vanessa me this time
because like the guy I went to the booth
once my father and he straighten my hair
I was like this the flattered that use
like the testing her hair or different
ones that Excel because he goes oh yeah
this hair will take 20 minutes to fly to
my old thing you guys well I say this
this took me three hours not kidding I'm
like you're a damn liar I didn't change
trying to sell and what not having the
flags a really nice flattering however
I'm like twenty minutes like what their
and you know he made a comment that I
was like he goes yeah I've worked on the
Econo black hair because I've worked on
black hair live need to say some stuff
you say but I'm on the flatter he they
try to sell you if they ever tries to
sell you the flatter for anything more
than a hundred your ally they'll tell
you oh yeah it's usually three hundred
dollars but today I give to you 450 Wow
it's always gonna be that same deal
except um the same deal each time so
they tried the next you don't spend more
than like 150 some kind of garment
dollars but that was that was on him
many ways um this hair from Miss here
hair now it was super curly and actually
really really liked curly however I just
so many hair videos I'm I'm running out
of ideas and I didn't feel like dying
this hair either and so I was like you
know let me do from curly to bone Street
I went to this is like bone Street I
would say this is like whatever is next
to bone I just feel like if I straighten
this again tomorrow
like go over it it'll be super
a straight cut when you like straighten
super curly hair for the first time it
kinda gets that freaky look or maybe get
tough finesse to the flattering in this
video I use another product to I using
both to try to get as straight as
possible however I don't burn my hair
and so I just want to see if it's hair
and get straight this is so nice curly
and it sure did so I guess this is a
video of me stream this hair you know I
tell you guys my tips I'll tell us why
you should have like other good stuff if
you find it helpful if you find it
entertaining and we let me know no but I
spent 3 hours on this video for you guys
it is what turns it
it's 11:40 that's almost 12:00 that's
pretty late out of flight tomorrow so I
stayed up very late for you guys so you
guys can wait thumbs up they'll be
awesome yeah so you guys um don't mind
my hair dye stains my shirt all the hair
details everything we down low I made
this wick earlier today I made it so
fast because the bundles are curly I
can't put that many tracks in the wig so
to make our to make and I use 3 bundles
and a frontal but all that the specifics
and everything like what texture like
this don't be down below silages watch
the video like subscribe all that good
stuff and I'll see you guys later
so before I straighten the whole wig I
did to test strands in the front just to
kind of like see if this hair would get
straight in the first place and once I
realized that it did that's why I decide
it's you know straight the strain the
whole thing I just didn't want to like
start and like you know get excited
straighten the hair if it didn't get
straight so this I always do like test
strands before I commit to the entire
thing because I knew that although the
guy told me just take 20 minutes I knew
those Ally I didn't just take me a long
time so I had to be sure that like I was
ready for it
all right so be first during the ham and
use this kiss argan oil hair spray it's
a heat protectant I love how it smells
smells so freakin good so I'm gonna
spray it all in the hair and then I'm
gonna blow dry the hair now I did wash
conditioners hair before filming this
video so I learned that makes it easier
like when you're straight and curly hair
you want like wash conditioning and kind
of tangle it first which is what I'm
doing right here and then you blow-dry
that it makes it much easier to
straighten it at first I tried to
straighten the hair like I guess you
could say that's natural state but I
learned that like after like washing it
and conditioned it and made it's so much
easier so if you have like long curly
hair I'm very I'm am pretty sure you
know this just wash condition at first
detangle and then you blow-dry which is
what I'm doing right here I'm uses
blow-dryer from this brand called a mica
and it's pretty cool
so I blow dry all the hair and actually
like this look I think the hair is so
nice I wore to Jackie's brunch so from
Instagram and you saw those pictures
this is the hair I'm wearing in those
pictures and I got a few conference on
the hair so that is the hair now
although this hair was pretty tricky to
straighten it's because this hair was
processed to be curly so it's kind of
hard to like reverse that however
because his hair is meant to be curly
when you straighten it then you curl it
the curls hold longer and the curls are
so much nicer that's what I learned you
know from where this hair because I did
curl it I Jackie's event and so I
noticed that like it just it curls much
easier
however it's like it was so hard to get
it straight you guys like I don't know
if it's my flat iron I don't know like I
feel like maybe if I'd like a hot comb
or something more intense it would got
even more silky straight but yeah this
first time around it didn't get a silky
straight as I wanted to get but I do
know that if I were like flattered in
like multiple times maybe like two more
times I know it'll get straight like I
want it to however I don't want to
damage the curls gyri like this curl
patter and I plan on like you know
curling this wig again so I didn't want
to go I don't want to do too much you
know I don't want to damage the hair
burn it so I just strain it until I you
know realize that it was a straight it
could possibly get and then I just you
know left it alone
so after I straighten this half I'm
gonna take this argan oil I don't know
the brand I got it from it's caught
macadamia I got it from Burlington Coat
Factory and I just put that in the hair
and I'm gonna go over this with a blow
dryer because I noticed the hair it was
a little drew it maybe I wouldn't call
it dry I wouldn't call it dry it was
just a little poofy you know cuz it
didn't want to be silky straight so in
order to help this I just added some oil
then I blow dried it cut thought you
know that'll make it straighter because
I do this with my real hair sometimes
that seems to work so I applied that to
this and I think I think it made a
little difference I don't know if you
guys can tell but I think it made it
look better and so then I went and I
straighten the rest off camera because
it was taking me forever and I'm I
thought I was being pretty repetitive
you know it's kind of doing the same
thing and I didn't think this video
needs to be 30 minutes long although I
could have added more ads and got a
bigger check YouTube life but I don't
want to have to be here for like 30
minutes left near the same thing so I
cut out some parts I mean I'm literally
straining the hair and so now I was
trying to figure out our chains apart
the front on this wig is so nice I kind
of part it literally anywhere as you
guys can see but I just decided you know
keep it in middle parts like middle
parts are easier and they're just more
simple so I just I'd do that then I
decide to cut some layers in the hair
and now yes I usually fabric scissors I
lost my hair scissors do not judge me I
typically have my hair scissors but like
I said I lost them so I to use fabric
Susan were to cut my layers but I just
thought of the hair because so long it
being completely straight with no layers
it made it look less real so I feel like
layers definitely add more to like the
you know the illusion that's your actual
hair even though we all know it's not so
yeah now I'm going to put a little power
in the park so I thought the part was a
little orange II and the part actually
really great a person is all like this
wig look pale and ice on me which was a
shocker because I rushed or I made it
but it looked really good I realize the
frontal to you and I'm yeah I'm just
gonna keep perfecting the hair you know
going over with the Flatiron trying to
make it more soft I'm gonna add my
little baby hair suit which made this
look even better this way was so easy to
work with it was so easy to work with so
that is pretty much how I do it and I'm
when I'm done you know perfecting the
hair and doing other weird stuff I'm
gonna check back in with you guys
all right a nice so I spent three hours
stringing this hair um it does not look
the best but I also feel like it would
look better if I had makeup on I know
sometimes like my wigs or hair is almost
as good as it can look
without my full face beat but it's
almost Twilight night I'm not doing
makeup that's completely out or what I'm
going to do in order to kind of wanna
kind of like very natural waves I don't
like just braid this hair and I thought
that will kind of help like keep it
straight - but like it will look out the
necks of the wave so when I go to sleep
tonight keep his wig on because I use
the got to be glue on the yellow tube
and read some old is to my head so I'm
just gonna do two little braids and I
feel like when I wake up in the morning
I have really cute nice little ways yeah
cuz yeah I want this hair look nice in
the morning so I just braid it and I
think this will people do when they were
there straight anyways from what I
remember so BAM miss Frenchy Jesus
oh hey oh this is a really nice hair I
almost want to win it to see me get
sterling again I'm going to keep it
straight from her lease like a week
because I do not spent three hours
straight in his hair just to make it
curly again like I would be kind of
pissed if I did that to myself so I'm
gonna keep this straight for like a cool
little week and then we'll see if it's
curly again and I'll leave a comment
like in my comment section thingy down
below if you want up to have his hair
cut actually Mike's like girlfriend it's
super nice I think it so lucky with the
hair in unison I mean I've had a few bad
batches and you guys did not see out on
my channel I do plan on making a video
of I care I will put it recommend like I
think in this year just stay tuned for

backs I know I'd be negative

your money you guys were on our way back

do it I just don't want to come off as a
gun fashion companies or anything but
