means my flawless foundation routine
well full-coverage flawless Sunday's
routines hella coverage elevate that
much coverage but I like a lot of
coverage you know so I said assuming my
time green company love candy my bad I
pretty much have to make a book on in my
previous video the whole let's do that
thing again I've done this video yet
sharing also mad because I hadn't really
sticky lip gloss so whenever I was talk
in create streams and I kind of make
sure to do it again because I don't want
to have to film this over it is not
really appealing but I had just make
them look on in my previous video if
somebody along who liked it real shocked
because I didn't tell us all the time
but then when I do then I mean plain
annoying to the single over over over
and I'm like okay well then I'll be
familiar it's fun
so are they fun stuff it's located how
cool but I didn't kill us but oh my god
what are you wearing I'm just like it so
tasted like you guys are confusing me
but a lot of people live Facebook on my
last video so I thought okay you know
message do that the flawless foundation
routine actually what is but a flawless
foundation routine I just said that
twice is pretty much it is a lot going
on with the base and I knowing that like
these lashes the last show you mention
the video as well so um my talk too much
if you guys enjoy this video please give
it thumb up subscribe like I always say
and I think that's what I meant to say I
which is watching the video hopefully
watch always the end if you do comment a
yellow mochi some saline yellow and a
video on his hair will be up soon or
later so don't worry about I love it so
I hope I think you guys would love to so
just stay tuned for that it all see you
guys later alright first you had a
premise stand I use my joy cosmetics
daily repair treatment oil I love this
well because it's very lightweight it
kind of moisturize my skin and it helps
me whenever I put that's bigger
foundation I like to prep for the oil
first because ever call my primer it is
health spa baby Chicago's blended
smoothly especially the foundation
really thick and creamy the oil Kyle and
mixed with foundation to create like a
smoother base and so I apply oil
this applies can I use color effects
blurring primer going to kind of an
interesting I hit a little like primer
there this consistency because they're
very more tasty but this with the oil it
just blended so fast and so easily and
this primary image blurred on my pores
so it definitely gives me a more
flawless page when I put my foundation
on top the foundation uses Internet to
Meyers foundation I use two shades I use
to0 one and in oh six I don't know what
those mean but these are trees I used I
make sure you guys a difference what a
shape slightly darker and I'm one of
them and looks like a mess my skin
perfect legal I use our own it does not
look good so I decided to just mix the
two together get my perfect shade now I
could just be like Dumpty's on my hand
because seamless the foundation little
sticks tell if pump they break very
easily on these she acted to me the
whole entire collection because I was
struggling fighting my shade on her site
and so I noticed that lot of them
haven't broken little sticks and that's
fine I guess you could just be popular I
feel awful do that it's a little bit
inconvenient but the foundation is great
you guys it is extremely full coverage
it makes you look flawless it'll pretty
much cover a better thing I don't have
too much to cover by do have scars and
light eczema scars I like to cover up
and so you can help see in the videos of
my life is so bright I so kinda almost
washes them out with suggesting that
kind of I don't know but this foundation
covers pretty much every single blemish
so it's what my favorite I've never
recommended brand it is a huge shade
range
huge shade range so definitely check it
out on the link would be down below
know more about that I'm just going to
quickly blend that out I'll take in my
Tarte shape tape so Franklin take the
shade medium which it appears white when
I first around my face however once I
blend it out you can't really tell and
so I put that long
it's going to ask them and take the
shade fair and neutral which is like way
like that my skin tone but then when I
clip it on top of the other heart-shaped
page the shade medium it just is like
the perfect highlight shade it's not too
bright and so I just use two concealers
and I blend them out really really
nicely on because you don't want the
cake up
you'd use my Kevin smile concealer
however because it's super thick in the
nest I'm iris foundations really big - I
can't Travis - together when I first
worked foundation I make a mistake of
wearing my Kevin's conference be over
and it was really really cakey so with
the foundation you want to wear a light
weight to medium like kind of coverage
concealer so it's not too cakey because
you don't want too much product build-up
under your eyes
laughter I reckon my Laura Mercier
powder husband sofas and what I like to
do because Spanish is very heavy and
kind of very very heavy
I don't bake now you can bake if you
were a nice shadow however I just live
with very big foundations it's always a
risk when you bake because it is in
create cake that you don't want and so
what I do is I just take the powder and
I kind of blend into my skin to really
set it and bring it that's why I do I
don't want to sit on my face I don't
like big I don't pile it on I just
simply use to set my face
after I'm done you smashing my Sephora
Michael smooth powder in the shade Matt
tan and I pretty much as prep the powder
you know into my skin because this
foundation is really full coverage you
want to make sure you really retain it
because when I first wore it I don't
think I said it enough because I'd to
know there go out creasing that around
my nose or my mouth and so I just took
the powder and I really prepped it in
with my brush to make sure I completely
setting the foundation so that'll come
back to my stamping my Tarte bronzer
this is hotel heiress you have to kind
of light handed with this bronzer
however if you use the same brush you
use to apply a foundation powder it goes
on lighter than what it usually would go
on you know with another breath so I
just use the same brush I used to do my
foundation powder to put my bronzer on
so that once the bronze we applied to my
skin but it's not too harsh because I
want this to be like a everyday type of
natural look without natural you don't I
mean I want to be like super contour
anything crazy with so I didn't cream
contour blush take this corner Rosa or
powder by Sigma how next-gen is Oprah
highlight and shade blissful now this
Heather is so beautifully guys you
really need you don't need that much at
all if I want the prints to probably
look at this highlighter can do that
however because this more natural when I
applied the highlighter look she's much
at first I just blend it out to look
more seamless data less at my face the
hierarchic on just Falls to my skin and
it creates just kind of a natural plat
highlight you I'm you know anything too
crazy this is a great highlight
I was totally recommended unless you're
like a fuchsia darker than me that it
may appear to be a sheet my can't see
them through me but that's what I'm
doing
I pull my eyebrows my eyelids off camera
I use the proxies for my agarose be down
below the last time where my attention
to the box of my lights are too bright
in the box to light show up in the
camera but there are Lotus lashes and
it's collaboration with yards best was
another blogger these lashes are really
really nice all that info nor can we
down below by willfully recommend them
it's best if you have smaller eyes
because they don't fully drawn them out
they just give a really nice dramatic
effect without looking too crazy so
let's take in my matte lip liner in the
shade plum and then on top of that I'm
going to take this matte lip gloss and
I've seen that if i meanhow
out the label is off the - that's really
weird I will try to go online and see -
finding by the shades and may be a
little hard but it's pretty much like a
pink shade and it has gold iridescent to
it I'm so sorry it says label labels
nama gloss so I really can't tell you
guys but I'll try to find in a quite
online and I'll put down below if not
just it's a pink gloss and it has a gold
specks
alright guys going back sometimes with
this video it was kind of where do I was
over like wall filming by Henry they
were to see how the editing goes like
that I like it but this submission look
I really love snake looking guys
honestly what I'm not filming this what
takes me - Oh lashes I know my brows
super fast but the lashes it takes me
like 15 minutes maybe 20 but it's
definitely every variable that's not
word you know what I mean it's
definitely very easy to do so if you
