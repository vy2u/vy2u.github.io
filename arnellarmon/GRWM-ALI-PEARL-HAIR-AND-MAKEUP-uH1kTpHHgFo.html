Accord myself molding this wig down but
it took so long but I have a video that
I just recently posted on the same
method in which I'm all to this wig down
so I'll link it in this video or way on
the screen you'll be to find it so to
style this hair I'm just gonna like do
these really nice curls this hair is
from Ali pearl I've wore their hair many
times I'll insert pictures of when i was
wearing their hair and every see what i
wear their hair i get a lot of
compliments and comments and it's weird
because I've only ever dyed their hair
once for the most part you guys know I
die mostly here I get I don't dye the
hair because when I get it it just feels
so soft a commuter kind of bundles that
they just feel so good you didn't want
to mess with them you just want to keep
them as is that's I thought about these
bundles there is so silky and smooth and
I knew that they'll be easy to work with
and I knew the hair in itself will be
nice because Ali pearl I've never had a
bad experience with their hair so um I
just I'd end out of hair I just made the
wig you know I customized a frontal and
now I'm just putting these really big
curl this is like my favorite go-to
style when I don't want to put too much
effort into my hair but I do want to
look like I styled it you just kind of
like do these like random curls you
gotta see it kind of all comes together
and it looks so good so father's hair
I've experienced no shedding I will say
that this specific day that night I went
to a Halloween party and so I put the
hair like two little ponytails and I did
notice that I get some I got some minor
tangling which I mean it made sense
based on how I styled the hair so I
won't like you know count that as a con
but I am saying I did experience
untangling but other than that I've had
no problems no shedding the luster of
this hair is super nice as you guys can
see there's no product no oil no nothing
this hair and it has a really nice
natural shine to it and it's super easy
it's super manageable I love this hair a
part of me wants to dye this hair just
because I really love this wig and you
want to find a way that I love I kind of
like want to keep using it over and over
but I just it's something about the
color I know it's like a natural 1b
color it just looks so
in his shiny and just so healthy the
hair looks healthy I know that sounds
super random but like that's look the
best word I can used to describe it
the frontal is very easy to work with it
wasn't too big for my head I'd have to
cut it or customize anything like that
all I had to do was just like pluck the
front a little bit but the cut the
frontal actually came pre plucked so I
really didn't have to do much plucking
at all like I just plucked like around
the very front for the baby hairs but I
didn't have to customize it too much at
all to do is bleach the knots which took
about 40 minutes I used a 30 vom
developer and you know I let it sit and
that was it I have in four bundles the
hair is pretty long I believe it's like
26 inches so I'm having four bundles in
a frontal which is why the hair has so
much body it's just nice so here I am
I'm just perfecting a look I'm just
adding more curls where I feel like I
need to have curls you mainly want focus
on the top layer you don't really have
to curl the bottom too much because once
you curl the top layer you won't see the
bottom anyways but I'm just kind of
going for like a very like messy but
styled big curls like you guys see what
I'm doing here it's very sexy like I
don't like that word bye musing it's
very sexy like so interested in
purchasing this hair all the links and
everything we've done below alie pearl
is on Amazon which i think is pretty
cool Amazon it's much easier to shop for
hair and Amazon than it is an Aliexpress
so you will have a pleasant shopping
experience like I said all the links are
on the details you will need we down
below who looks so good and now let's
start on the makeup so first I'm gonna
take this Finn T Beauty primer I love
this primer a lot it's it's just so
simple but it does the job you know it
makes you mat gets rid of your oil
believe it or not I get oily so I'm
gonna take that I'm gonna prime my skin
using that and then I'm gonna use
affinity Beauty foundation as well I'm
gonna mix the two sheets I have only
cuspid I have only a less it cuz only
because when I have two of the same
foundations I will mix a shake I feel
like it makes it last longer so I have
the shade 370 and 330
both them look great on me by themselves
but I mean I just me
because I want them to last long as
possible I'm gonna how long the fin TBD
foundation will last any ways to consume
would take like heaven a quantum silver
this is super full-coverage super heavy
you need very little I just think it's
awesome it was $40 the old me probably
would have spent that much money on a
concealer however because it's last so
long it's gonna last me like at least
another year or two and no another two
years at least I mean by then I'll
probably get another one but when I tell
you you really need like I put too much
all the time so I think it's great I
wouldn't recommend it for someone who is
new at makeup because it's gonna be kind
of challenging you know you have to
really take your time blending it out
but it's awesome and it's great in your
freelance kit now to set that I'm using
my Chanel loose finishing powder I love
using this stuff I feel so bougie when I
use it you know good Stu Nell it's
awesome though I like it better than the
Laura Mercier powder only because it
leaves no flashback at all and you could
let it sit on your face for as long as
you want and when you dust it off it
comes off and there's no like white cast
whereas the Laura Mercier powder does
that occasionally so after I do that I'm
gluing I did when I have camera you guys
see it's so bold and brave and now I'm
gonna do this ISO to prime this lid I'm
taking the Mac Paint Pot soft ochre well
soft ochre Paint Pot I'm reading up the
screen and um I'm just going to blend
out my lid you have to blend it pretty
fast cuz it does dry down pretty fast
believe it or not I've learned that so
you know blend that out with your finger
to keep it warm now I'm gonna take this
glowed up into the Sun palette this was
sent to me and it's actually really nice
and I love the fact that whenever you
purchase a power any product in your
sight a portion of the proceeds Oh some
of the money goes to you know pets they
need homes and I love animals I love the
animal so how to support this this is
not sponsored by the way I just want you
to bail it and so I'm gonna take these
two like it's like a beige sheet a
lighter orange shade then I just pray
that that would take this dark orange
shade it just watch the screen I'm kind
of in shambles explaining this but I
wasn't sure what look I was going for it
first when I get my first eye until I
start to pass
the dark orange right on my lid I
realize how pigmented it was it was kind
of tricky making a stay but I'll show
you guys how I did that in a second so
now I'm gonna take my morphe 35o 2
palette it is awesome I can't believe
it's only $23 like that's it's almost so
cheap that you like kind of wonder like
what are they using this thing because
the quality's really nice like why would
they give to us for this price you know
what I mean it's really really nice so
yeah now time to make that orange color
pop so I'm gonna take my Mac mixing
medium as a base it is privileged I love
this stuff I use it whatever I have like
a really nice like lid color I'm gonna
put that on first I'm take that orange
shadow and I'm gonna pack it on my
finger you have to do this with a finger
you lose your brush to help but to start
off you want to ease your finger in
order to get like the most pigment so
I'm just pecking on it kind of like
reminds me of Cheetos know I watch this
video over but I loved this eye look and
when I post my Instagram LA you guys
left it to you so I'm really happy about
that so I wasn't sure what you guys
think so now time to finish off the face
we're gonna dust off that powder and
that fallout the dark orange shadow does
give you a lot of Fallout it does um but
it's cool cuz that's why we put powder
there so I set the entire face I'm using
my Mac Studio Fix powder I love this
stuff although I want to find a new
setting powder to use like I want to try
something new if you guys like no really
good setting powders then you haven't
seen me use it ready comment them down
below cuz I feel like I feel like I
don't know I just don't want anyone so
now for my eyes the bottom lid I'm gonna
use this joy cosmetics lip liner now I'm
this dick I make my eyes water a bit so
I would not recommend using this in your
waterline if you have sensitive eyes on
top I didn't take my deck of scarlet
palette I don't know the name of this
palette I it's not when you could just
go and buy however it has my favorite
purple shade which is why I use that and
then I'm gonna use like this smaller
brush to kind of put the purple shade
all underneath my lower lash line I was
kind of trying to match my back job
that's kind of how I figure out what I
want to do in my eyes and these colors
do remind me of Halloween video I'm over
Halloween but purple in orange that's
toll
we need so that's why I did it kind of
sort of
alright so now imma do my brows and then
we're gonna bronze our faces with our
Tarte cosmetics hotel Aires bronzer
super pigmented kind of maybe look a
little dead but anyways for blush I'm
taking my fin T Beauty Moscow Mule it's
like NARS orgasm but on steroids it's
like when you see nos orgasm it's like
what you want NARS orgasm to be in my
opinion at least anyways now for
highlight I made the mistake of using
these products now I'm messing this to
that product however I feel like it made
my makeup look more cakey than I want it
to look and that's why I put on top of a
powder I feel like this will work better
if my skin was more moisturized maybe it
could have looked better if I put on
after setting spray I don't know I just
feel like the old this kind of throw off
the overall makeup look because it made
it look like cakey in my opinion in real
life at least without facetune now I'm
going to take my Dior highlight and we
put on top this is $57 and my little
note I say it is not worth fifty seven
dollars it's not I have drugstore high
Levitz they're like eight dollars that
are better than this one however alisa
told me about it I like the highlight I
don't know I don't dislike it however it
just not worth $60 but um you know
usually all this tells me buy something
I just do it I don't think about it so I
use it because I mean I spend my money
on it so I kind of have to use it sorry
I'm scratching my nose alright so after
my highlight on I am going to set my
face using a mac fix+ this isn't a
setting spray I like it to set my face
it makes me glow makes a little dewy so
I may use that and then I'm going to
highlight my brow bone as well as my
little flaps so I'm gonna use the first
Ollie like jelly bean highlighter on my
brow bone and then I'm gonna put it in
like my eye corner and then I'm going to
put my do or hilar on top of that to set
it
now to mass care I mean you just bowled
and bat lash by Mac and I'm just gonna
put that on and then for my lashes I'm
using this one by glowed up cosmetics as
well I forget the name but I like me so
I put them off camera because you guys
don't want this video to be like 40
minutes do you my eye was irritating me
I was kind of know if I was feeling the
Luke I'm so excited I love them make a
little come together and so to line my
lips I'm using Mac plum lip liners on my
favorites I've been using out a lot now
that I've lost my cork lip liner I hate
that I lost cork you guys I really do
cuz Korkis of my favorites now oh
speaking of cork I'm using dose of
colors cork looks like my favorite nude
brown I love the shade this like my
second bottle of it bottle to whatever
they're called so I had to put that on
now this is wearing a mistake I added
this stupid it's not stupid I had this
blush and it was just like so
unnecessary
like it just why that's why they include
the name I don't want to talk about it
it'll be in the description box for lip
gloss I'm gonna use this Vincey Beauty
galaxy collection gloss I thought it'd
look really cool with this look which it
did and I just put that on top of cork I
didn't want to be boring and just do a
cork by itself fuck that's really boring
so stepping out of the comfort zone now
that it now I'm gonna like perfect my
hair because I feel like I want the
curls to be a little bigger so I'm just
going I think I just like playing this
wig I think that's why I'm doing this
however I want it more body you know so
I'm just going to fix my hair I pulled
out a little strand by the way and I'm
that's pretty much its if you guys
