you're new welcome boys got done so I'm
going to get ready with me I did both my
hair my makeup my hair is super simple
on you go through the video and this
native look actually had it on in my
previous video my is the glossy lip and
I don't even know if I mentioned that
but I said I was going to simmer for you
guys but a lot of comments saying that
you guys liked it and I liked it to you
I've been up with four times already
personable simple makeup look ever
now I want to do with my blond hair but
I actually filmed this makeup look like
three times twice my blonde hair and the
first time I asked me to redo all the
footage and a set time I stopped the
video just wasn't that great so I just
going over and switch my hair just
because now this hair is the best place
with back into a building before and I'm
going to insert I'm not going to forget
my inserts I always forget you guys and
I'm sorry but I'm not going to do it
because I have to come say I'm going to
do it and I'm like clean it sane so it
has to do it
so actually did a video for the before
and I use their bundles and I got some
blonde and their bundles are super did
with your own eyes I found the video
that they're super thick and very easy
to believe so I just want to try one
under wigs the rhythmically might um I'm
going to talk about here in the video
the only check out their wig was it got
a little fan fan but I don't I mean
that's so common it doesn't really annoy
me too much and what they're are super
thin actually into the video it just I
just had to cut it into this cute cut
right here I just don't know what was I
string the way the way came in body
weight so came with loose lady I
expected strange to see the quality hair
and what I've straightened I just knew
that this would look nice in this style
like literally like eyes vision it and
then I did it and it looked awesome so I
like I'd watch the video um it shouldn't
be too long videos I hope you stay to
watch the video in to see my slow-mo and
my reaction the facts of Beyonce's not
going to get closed Ella but found out
while I was filming flat for yelling I
just I don't want to think about it
anyways and watch the collection video
if you enjoyed please give a thumbs up
and if you don't enjoy it uh tell me why
anyway I guess because I don't know but
uh Ella tables video and if it is kinda
right please do so right now and I'll
see you man excellence
all right so I'm going to do my hair
first because the quickest and it'll be
easy to do now I kind of customize the
font part of this wig doesn't look so
good but it really didn't take much I
honestly just tweeze the front part to
kind of create the baby hair because
none of my real hair is left out click
was super easy to work with
it's a 360 lace front wig so it's laced
all the way around kinda like a three
six waist fun toy than this the middle
has the tracks that make sense I'm
showing you guys the ends right here
watching to cover my double chin to the
end on that bin um they're just not as
thick as I would liken in be and I mean
if you buy this wig and you keeping this
nap state the wavy it comes in then the
ends won't really matter because it
gives a really natural look let me
strain the hair I feel like with
straight hair I prefer the ends to be
stick so I decide to cut it out why when
I straighten my hair
based on just how to texture fill in how
the frontal area like had a lot of body
I just I'd envisioned this style will
this value guys seem to get a video I
just thought that it would look really
good so I'm just chopping to end off
super simple very easy and I'm doing I
was you I'd come just cut and somehow I
make it look decent enough to wear but
I'm just cut it pretty short and I'm
kind of leaving my bank area alone
finally i'ma let that part be longer
than the rest of the hair to create more
body in that style that I have I post
things on snapchat and everyone who
asked me what wig is is and what hair is
is and they don't even know that I'm
posting this video tonight but um yeah
where you can shoot
now I'm bumping the ends if I do when I
cut hair bump in that way just can't
really see my mistake because I'm a
professional slow and then I do make
mistakes but when I do I just flush it
in the came full so now I kind of cut
that second piece at an angle that way
my bangs are kind of angles kind of
create that baby look I'm really not
going to explain this is something that
you just have to watch and see by clumps
it's very very simple in this hair the
texture I love it like it looks so good
huh I don't know like the luster the
texture it just all looks very very
natural and just how the hair just
back I love it so that's really
different my hair very simple now
time-dimension face I'm taking my Laura
Mercier radiance bronze primer it's just
a bronzing primer and these at the pump
prime bronze slash prime my skin for
foundation taking the LA girl that le yo
yeah Ella and girl crow something
foundation I'm going to name the snow
it's compared to the making
representation so that's why I'm using
it and then I'm going to mix it with my
hourglass foundation now only because
I'm this La Jolla foundation I think
it's a little orange e for me and it
makes me look like almost too tan but
the Erika foundation I learned that
alone it's almost too light for me
because it's too light of a yellow so I
mix it together to get my perfect shade
it all worked out you have to do extra
blending because they're two totally
different system C so ice like blend
like a little harder to make the two
consistencies mix well and then extend
so I kind of took a long time to Lindy
that's why I like quadruple set this
part up but yeah I like to see manage
together I think it gives my perfect
color and it looks for lone wolf working
the blue do
so chicken still action cake mix like
conceal stick by when while they seems
to me back when they send me that pack
do the video for them and I'm just going
to use it and I love it it's like
they're contour stick gotta like but
it's concealer duh but it's so creamy
and it just blends so well and it's so
easy to apply because it comes out like
big jumbo stick I just he'll like it
like it's really really nice and I want
to go see you have more shades just cuz
I mean I just want them because I like
how they work but yeah I think this
looks really cool I don't know what
inspired when you use I think I just
gone out the car I should just tried
this and I'm happy I did because it is
awesome it is pretty darn cool and if
you have like a stewardess of one wall
near you I think try it because I mean
it's like super cheap so you can't
really like lose and
I think it's like $4 and works pretty
good the ass and they're talking i'ma
win it out and then I'll be are be
pecans I'm taking this nyx highlighting
contour duo and i'm using the darkest
shade of course and i'm contouring my
cheekbones my nose my forehand my chin
and my Cupid's bow to milligan more just
fine i'm conjugated lachchi products
when I last why wait let me let me
finish this video if I use my big sister
stuff they're mine but I honestly didn't
pee my videos I like to use a mixture of
drugstore and high-end just really like
yep option I totally noticed that oh I
didn't notice until like code videos
back I noticed like him I use a little
bit of both and I mean everything was
cool to me anyways I'm blending and
blending and blending my nose contour
always we're doing this we all discover
then I pick my Chanel powder to set
everything I love this powder so so so
so so so much I did I be human you
should too I don't know it's an
investment though it should cost like
$54 which is a log I don't like swimming
money but for good products it's okay to
spend money you just here's what I do I
always have a cheaper powder and a more
expensive powder and on days I look
extra good I use a more expensive one
I'm days I don't care I use a cheap one
you know that way the expensive one
lasts longer strategy okay I just gave
you to the pit without you guys even
asked me
all right now I love my hair a little
bit don't know why probably because I
like it and then I'm gonna start on my
eyeballs which is super duper easy I
love this I shall look if I can wear it
everyday I would now I'm taking this
Maxim it palette and I'm going in this
dark burgundy shade right here I'm use
as a base I know it's kind of weird but
it totally makes sense and the
consistency of the ballistic works
perfectly for the eye look that I'm
going for
so you can go with me okay
nothing this palette by the balm some at
the door I think and I'm taking this
really pretty mustard yellow color I've
never seen I travel exciting for death I
used it and I'm just going to put that
all over where I put the lipstick as a
base before after I did my dark brown oh
I just love these colors yeah I'm just
gonna swap it out and do my thing and
you guys just like keep watching
then I'm taking the piloted boss pallet
divided lost copilot it just cannot play
actually and it's awesome I would take
this brown shade right here and I'm
going to use that on top of what I put
the mustard color this is a very easy
eye shadow will get glass which is kind
of like a smoked out Brown warm look and
now I'm just using that same fluffy
brush to kind of put underneath my lash
line and that pretty much completes the
eye shadow look I'm telling you guys
what's the most usee eye shadow ever it
looks really cool and I like it now that
my entire face I'm using my Mac Studio
Fix powder I have to edit Sony parts of
this video because of certain angles you
see my double chin which is coming back
like I don't work out and I eat a lot of
food and I should I work out but until
then I have a spoon now I'm going to
bronze my weight no I lied I'm going to
contour my nose live in my cooler
bronzer then I'm going to stand on my
contour with that powder I need to find
my big one this is my mini one is
totally right now I could tell us if it
can by have no idea where my big one is
but it's one of my favorite bronzer
it's the bomb now I am going to clean
the air and that would poke some blush
on blush I'm using is bright orange
blush by Mac is called devil you need
very very very little but I really like
it along with bronzer color just makes
it look super warm and very nice
now the mask am using is tart taste by
tarsem but I already quick I'm really
not last person if you've been following
my channel for a while you know that I
wear
I don't know I still flies there
necessary to make the look look nice not
everyone has time to smell much all the
time okay so I don't know how we do it
now for lips I'm taking Matt cork lip
liner and this one with a really
whatever and then I'd not want to run
out so I hardly use it that's why I
always use it but I heart means at the
same time I'm just gonna buy another one
you know usually I like products a lot
I'll buy another one before I'm even
done with the one I already have just so
I don't have anxiety of running out
that's much I'm going to do that anyways
after i line my lips which taken me
forever I'm going to take this NYX
butter gloss and the sheet I don't know
I think a cinnamon roll
I'm pretty sure several times before
it's a very off and of grey brown tone
lip gloss it's very nice but it comes a
little too grey tone for me I'm going to
take my buxom gloss this is Dolly and
it's like a pink gloss and so I'm going
to mix it with this gloss it kind of
like warm up the gloss so it's not so
great
now the most exciting part I'm using my
glow kid this is Nicole
Dave's last name Guerrero
Guerrero don't worry anyway it's Nicole
freaking world kid it comes out like
March 3rd so my step I don't know like

excited to see how it looks on my face

I'm just trying to be different but it's
like super pigmented and it's just like
amazing like you literally like you put
it on and you're like oh like this
is crazy and you think huh this is a lot
applied on medium or but you want to
keep putting more on I don't know man I
want to put some more right now that's
how I feel about the school kid it's
honestly it's entitled to the best one
by how all of them some of our PR lives
I've tried all of them the ultimate
globe kid I didn't like too much of to
glitter in my opinion son dick was their
shades are a little too I don't know
explain some did I didn't realize the
sudden glow kid the first two ones are
cool moon child isn't for every day I
think of all the ones they have this but
the best one I think it has shades for
every single skin tone and it's just
awesome and I was shook I can they did a
really good job Nicole Guerrero I hope I
