welcome so I don't know cookie ready
with me now I did both my hair and
makeup I really focused too much in my
hair I just want to include this wig in
the video because I wear this wig in my
tattoos and piercings video I've got a
lot of questions on it so I decided to
just do my review in this video and so
I'm going to review the wig a little bit
first I'll let you guys see me put it on
that kind of stuff but the main folks in
this video will be like my makeup look
because I also want to make a look in my
tattoos and piercing video and I'm going
to make them look a lot and I think any
questions like hey don't stir on that
and I'm kind of shocked because it's a
very simple look and I don't know people
would want to see it but if you guys did
so awesome families alright so quick
review this hair from a LaMotta now I do
already have a review for their hair up
already and insert curly hair and I like
instead of clip I'll do something to
indicate which video that is and um
could are you on that because I'm going
to try both their textures I start
curling up okay a lot of people like
that career on me either a lot of comps
and looks right now so very great I'm
more of 11 curly hair and more body in
it their curly hair is more on the it
has with lower density and it's cool if
you have naturally curly hair maybe I'll
make clip in baobab there'll be really
good for questions but for the wig I may
actually it was a little too thin for my
liking a lot of the life is so hey I'm
cool with it
I will say that you cannot bleach or
dive it curly hair because I got a mixer
here before and I bleach and diet and
the curls were completely gone
completely gone so you do order curly
hair at don't boot your diet in to be
mine alright well just straight hair is
a different story I like to straight
hear much more than like the curly hair
I'm actually worse was out in New York
and our cert pictures and all kind of
stuff what if the whole town's in New
York and it came 30 inches I cut it now
it's kind of like to my stomach now or
like not it doesn't really reached up my
waist so it's still pretty involved with
damn sure not there into cervix is way
too much for me to handle and I'm like
no thank you
alright so I warden New York and um it
was I had no issues with it
I did notice minimal Shetty
it was notice that shading because my
hotel room like my hotel bathroom floor
was white marble so everything like
everything show him on the floor and so
I did see hair on the floor like when I
was fresh in stuff like that but it
wasn't shades the point where it's
balcony like this is meds like where is
it going it was just like it was no
small because the floor is white but the
floor was my wife I probably when I
noticed it now the only analysis here
was when I came back from New York to
California and I believe that the
changes and the weather between the two
states have them to do it just coming to
the hair to where it made it super dryer
tingly and it got kind of matted and I
immediately noticed it and it made me
take up wig I didn't wear it like a
couple weeks because I thought it was
the hair but don't let you know what I
wore it an attachment piercings video
and I was like we want to review on this
okay look I haven't better-paying on it
now because before that video that day I
actually washed and conditioned it and
then the hair went back to normal is
perfectly fine and so I really do
believe the weather changes have
something to do with the hair ask me
funny because this starting to telephone
me like it was a breeze a whole time in
New York I've been active I even touch
it I literally like mines got me freeze
glue whatever the heck I used to like
hold it it stayed the whole time it is
start lifting until like last day and
that's what I was like I want to take it
off but I couldn't because I knew I was
ready to leave but I'm I had no issues
the whole entire time until I got back
and so I'm pretty sure the weather
change that's the only nice thing to say
was that when I got into different
weather the hair kind of guy will take
the advantage and so I had someone
rewash conditioning but I'm at the hair
itself is really Ryan's graceful their
luster supernatural I have not died this
hair I'm not sure why it looks black oh
my God my nose does it at me and sick I
think it looks flat because my studio
life but this is it a 1b color I
probably will guide this because I mean
I like this wig I've been in with those
was on a ho much times and I just you
know so the baby here down a little bit
closer filler and examine so super easy
there frontals are hella nice because I
made this with an hour and a half before
my flight
and able to girls rush wigs somehow it
came out like this is probably one of my
favorite wigs that I've made as far as
being able to put it on and looking
natural looking good so um that's my
review I will let you exit a to watch
this video I'm going to show you guys
mmm
I'm going to show you guys wait I'm
going to show me putting on the lid I'm
not finishing styling mix I don't I
don't really style this one I wear it I
got his work straight to the side I
think it looks really nice and very
sleek and imma show you guys how i got
this makeup look right here which is
like my everyday look so if you want to
see that the people are watching and be
sure to subscribe and like this video
only if you really like it and I'll see
you guys later
so here's my natural hair before I put
my wig it's grown so much you guys like
if you're real Arnel Aman fan did you
know this like it's longer and it's I
don't know like a flappy I get crushed
sugar bear hair it actually works well
is for me
maybe that's everyone at least for me so
I gotta tell you guys about it anyways
not sure what I'm doing here I look too
stirred but what I look so disturbed
what happened to me I don't know anyways
I'm gonna get this jailed I'm a slick my
hair back nothing new this is what I
always do
anam yeah just like that back then put
my wig cap and then when I get started
on my little wig
so this might be really quick i'ma show
you guys you know how I found the wig
and then I'm going to show myself
putting on my god to be free free now I
won't show myself lo drying the hair or
straight in it because I mean I don't
know it's probably boring so I didn't
think it'd need to include in this video
and so yeah it's very simple this lake
is very very very easy to just put on
and just go you don't have to do much I
mean honestly I didn't have to do what I
do with the baby hair I just prefer to
do that because I mean I like laid baby
hair but I think this wig it's very easy
very very very easy to deal with and
it's like one of my favorites like I
really do wear this with a lot I know
you guys won't know that because I don't
always post on Instagram or snapchat
sometimes I'll go like four or five days
without posting but I'm not posting I'm
either wearing this wig or I'm wearing
that curly was I called it's the blonde
wig that Enron likes on me I really
rotate between those two and another one
I have two and that one is like a blonde
tooth but I wear like three main ways
that are my fave and this one isn't so
let you guys watch this then I'm going
to hop back in when I'm about to start
my makeup
all right so it's Primus skin I'm going
to use the Kat Von D lock-it hydrating
primer this like one of my favorite ones
very simple very basic but it really
hides your skin so I'm using to find my
skin first foundation I'm using my an
accessor Beverly Hills stick foundations
a shade caramel and amber I use amber
unlike what you call that
the perimeter of my face and I caramel
in the middle and cuz Karma's a little
lighter I just like using both them
together and these foundations are
perfect for every single day because
they cover just enough but they're not
cakey looking they're actually perfect
in my opinion so I put those on I'm
gonna blend it out my Tarte sponge
to conceal I'm taking my cabinet quad
sensual skin enhancer and I'm yeah just
concealed with that um this is very very
bright for everyday but it's just what
I've been using so I want the videos to
be pretty accurate
um this one works for everyone
I will say that because very bright very
heavy and you will spend a little more
extra time blowing it out
I just really love how to look I love
where my under eye looks very bright and
just like light and just I don't know
like I really like it that's why I
bought it so um if you're interested I
can I would recommend this concealer
also be able to dry or normal skin I
recommend if you have oily skin this
probably shambles in a jar but um I
really like it it's like 48 dollars I'm
going to buy every single shade for my
freelance kit it's a lot money but it's
not worth it cuz it's just awesome it
works so good like it's like one of the
best purchase I've ever made not
exaggerating and then I don't know why I
didn't show the powder in the screen I'm
shaking my Laura Mercier powder I'm just
studying the places where I concealed
now to send my entire face I'm taking my
black reading soft focus powder this is
my favorite powder it's still a really
really great powder I just started using
something else I didn't want to keep
using the same stuff but everyone knows
that I love love love as Tyler's like $5
at Walmart I think they sell at Target
I'm adjusted Hanukkah talked I bet a
hundred percent sure but the great
powder it's a really really good powder
so I'm just going to really set my face
in that and just like thoroughly dust
away that powder so I have like no
flashback or anything crazy like that
now I'm taking my favorite bronze of all
time which is hoola by benefit I'm used
to contour I have to contour you know
every single day does every day where I
don't contour I just it's something that
I have to do so yeah no matter how much
I'm in a rush or what I'm doing I'm
going to contour I'm going to use this
because it's not too warm it's not too
cool so it gives me a natural contour
and I mean it's just my favorite
so for blush I'm news is very very
natural-looking blush you probably would
see it show up too much it's by city
color and it's called toasted coconut it
gives me a really nice natural flush and
it's perfect for every single day you
can barely see it but you can see it but
it's not like in your face kind of blush
so that's why things perfect very simple
safe now I'm gonna do my brows really
fast and this is like the easiest part
it tends in like five minutes of real
life I mean sped up it's like two
minutes I just use this brow Wiz by a
necessarily hills and this is a shade
evany I purpose you the darker shade
that way I can I don't put it i set us
in a video before i like using a darker
shade that way i have a lighter hand i
use less product but it still shows up
my brows that makes any sense at all so
I'm just going to pretty much define my
brow shape using this pencil and then
I'm going to well let me get there and
I'll be aware do
all right so once about with that make
it this sinister growl conditioner and I
like using this because it makes my
natural brow hair stand out and so it
gives my brows more dimension and makes
them look more natural than you know
what they really look like with just
pencil you can't see too much in the
video but you feel on a person I think
it looks really great I love this so now
for highlights I have to highlight no
matter what I'm doing I might take the
nicole grow glow kit by innocence
Beverly Hills like one of my favorite I
was like this year or ever I'm just
going to hide on my face NASA at my face
and use my NYX dewy setting spray and
I'm going to spray a lot of that because
usually what I do like everyday look I
put a highlight on I like to spray a lot
to make sure that highlight really
settles into my skin so it's not too
extreme now for lips i'm taking this nyx
brown lip liner i had a piece of hair on
it you guys I have hair everywhere like
I don't want to say the places I find my
hair but that's the life of like a wig
person I literally have hair everywhere
everywhere it kind of like drives me
crazy at times but it's like you know
what can I do about it anyways now take
this new makeup vehicle is a lipstick I
don't even own the name of this cuz new
and I mean is my first time using this
in this video I just I know it's like
it's like an everyday lip color and I
really want to try it cuz I just got the
package that day I found this look like
a few days ago but it looked really good
and somehow it made me look my lips my
lips look more plump and bigger and the
forma is really really nice I realize
the formula so that was perfect
now for mascara I'm taking this one by
Mac I'm not even sure what it's called
I just know you see for everyday I like
using a lighter mascara and this one's
like a dark brown it's not black so it's
perfect for every single day because not
too much so yeah I'm going to put that
on
so I was like my makeup but I really
want a glossy lip because I always have
gloss on so I might just take my buxom
lip gloss and a shaved sugar which is
like one of my favorites and put it on
top
I just I love gloss I don't know I
hardly ever do like matte lips anymore
cuz glossy just this is my thing as
crazy I used to hate go off but now I
love it so I'm going to wear it alright
so I'm pretty much done see the look is
very simple very easy
now I'm gonna like I bump my hair lip I
love this hair honestly watching this
video makes gonna go put this wig on
right now like I want to you really good
but um yeah I'm kind of feeling myself I
thought it looks pretty great pretty
cool you know so I kind of bump my hair
a little bit then I went to a car let er
now I know the weather's nice now but I
filmed this video a few days ago it
wasn't nice this wasn't a few days ago
this week so now I'm just now getting
around to editing it but that's why I
turn a con because the weather was cold
and it was rainy
don't judge me at the top right now but
