I'm going to get ready with me and let's
just like get ready to it so I've
already done my brows only because I'm
an expert at to use and they're really
easy to build and I kinda want to like
play with them because today's like the
follow list well I have to wait a week
before if we really touch them so today
is what the 8th day don't label ergo the
con draw them and see how they're going
to like see for now on so I get those
but I wanted to update fast first
because I'm going to go inside a very
glowy look I'm also going to be using
this new Sephora Pro palette because
it's kind of very warm I sort goes kind
go for like a really pretty bronzy look
so I'm going to be reviewing this
palette as well I'm going to add the
other one to this other bold one but I
maybe do that like on a day where we're
both makeup and so on because I'm going
on a glowy look I want to try to smash I
got at Walmart I've seen the gold mask
everywhere but they usually kind of
expensive well this $2 so it's pretty
cheap so I bought it
it's collagen hydrogel gold mask for all
skin types
since it's a skin tightening elasticity
intensive next a hydrating gold gel mask
loaded with collagen and goals will help
hydrate revitalize dole to keep skin was
tops fine the impurities in the skin to
give an overall glow and life to the
skin
whoo okay Billie's keep it out for 20
minutes okay all right so I'm going to
open it has a strong smell to it
take it out oh god you don't have
freaked me out because they're very uh
Lainey oh god oh god why me
okay so confused because it's like I
just fell apart on me but I really don't
know I really I'm kind of really
confused this may be a fail because that
is a little of my face okay so I said
this is to go oh my god yeah I think
it's all part of me I mean I really
don't know what the heck or not this
point alright so I won't what's going on
this is such a fail kind of fat so what
I do is look at the finishes of it I'm
just going to rub it onto my skin I know
this looks so tacky but whatever because
I don't want to like waste the mass but
horns employed me I'm going to rub it
onto my skin and I bought two of them so
maybe I'll try the other one it seems
the same thing happens maybe have to
open that certain way but I think it
kind of ruined this would it definitely
like super gold like the Instagram mask
though so maybe that's was two dollars
so instead of like instead of waste it
I'm just going to go into my skin from a
mask the instructions and you don't
rinse at all so I'm not I'm just gonna
move into my skin oh well guess that's
cuticles alright yeah well it's this -
you really grew up in so I guess a lot
of sad but that did happen
all right well so more of my skin I'm
going to use this origins energy
boosting gel moisturizer this is to me
like I look weak ego and but I've
learned like unless I use all three to
Cox together they fit me a moisturizer a
tinted moisturizer and like I cream and
it's really really nice you guys like
organ is all the time I didn't care I
just have there's also expensive to me
so I would never buy it I bought like a
mask from them before but honestly it's
like I'm learning that you really can't
be cheap and come to skincare because if
you want your skin to be nice as long as
possible so if you'd buy me the price
even it cost a lot of these it's worth
it inning over just for real time
um then pass I cream a little bit though
trying to look very just glowy and fresh
how do I make it a very long time I feel
like so I really want this to come out
really nice
nothing on the wrong way I know there's
certain way to put it on I just I know
that's fair way to put it on I just
never know why you put it around my eyes
I'm gluing I'm strapped with the ice
covers come a new foundation I'm gonna
have to like so powder and I don't want
to powder a little as low as possible so
I think I'll be smart for me to do my
eyeshadow first and so on here's a
palette is Pacific very beautiful it
does come with a shade names honestly I
really prefer when like the palettes
have a shade names ride with the shadow
because do we really keep these like I
know I know keep these um it's just
annoying because you want to move
because you don't away in the mirror
it's like these are just so hard to keep
up with I always throw them away and so
I kind of like I wish they would put the
names under here the comments urban
campus how they all have a names a great
underneath little dingy
I prefer cops to have that just so
easier but I already I watched them
holding all of them but I did touch this
one and I noticed that when you touch
him literally uh you touch it a little
bit and product comes off in the hand
well then for them at once I notice that
they're really taking the tips and we're
going to see and it's crazy because I
paid $70 about - trying to see like 140
I didn't realize sometimes spring from a
palette I cut my friend Bree and she
goes send all for palette and I'm like
oh my words every adult I wouldn't even
think about it because I knew I'd have
asked you to vaccinators use this I'm
okay let me just by my or thin like over
weeks ago and so what I bought them
ideal to the parts I just added to a car
and I just like paid for it and yeah
they're seven dollars each that's kind
of a lot but we're going things worth it
so friends hi my eyes using my lemonade
Venice primer I don't have to get a bar
in the bag but for some rated people
sending ever here in my video so I'm not
going to like to stop when it goes by
I'm gonna just talk over it
and you guys we can't here
then let me know if you can I'll just do
what I've been doing and that's when
when it goes by out this stop talking
but I'll cut over that and it goes very
like five minutes so I can't stop
talking each time so that was my trip
thoughts it's really frustrating
all right so what I think of this brush
I'm gonna tie with my fingers my skin
feels so good what you feel so good
all right now the palette and I don't
want to go crazy on the eyeshadow
because I wanted to
I want this listed me mainly focus on
the face in my egg glowing but I made a
little something so I'm gonna use this
peachy color first alright so a lot
comes up on the brush I'm using mirror
in the palette and I want to start with
this shape just to see how pigmented is
on top of the primer and that's really
pigmented I want to cover yourself
orange I thought a little more like a
softer peach maybe it's like that when
you don't put on top of the primer but
I'm antsy just cold because I'm usually
when I get shadows that are like
pigmented I can't explain it but I like
shadows were like you could either tone
down or they can be really really
pigmented you hear what I mean because
you get more you sub them so I mean
although I didn't think this would be
this dark
I'm not complaining because you get more
use out of it and it was pretty cool so
I'm still just so long so weird all the
videos I post are like like that
how do the road to the item awaken looks
white welcome echinacea innovation a lot
of time I post videos I filmed in like
weeks ago it is taking forever to post
them because I like to post their videos
their time so I always put on my content
at once alright
so I use that color now we're going with
this director orange color we're see how
dark that is see I'm seeing fallout
that's a lot of products on the brush
yeah it gets very powdery when you press
on it I don't know if it's good or bad
but hey I guess essentially it's not the
best thing because that's the pan
factors a lot of crops being picked up
but then again it's good because then
you get more shadow on the brush so your
little comes out more pigmented depends
on your preference and interesting
because what's in the Far just this pals
very pigmented and honestly what it
looks like your basic palette like I
feel it sometimes with the same now by
the same time I bowl looks like your
basic palette it's really not like I'm
in my mind thinking about others house
that I've had a little bit this and this
is like way more pigmented most palettes
so although they look similar the
quality is different like it's way more
pigmented alright so now I'm going to
take this shade right here which are
like build up the colors
it is really I'm supposed to go
segmenting for my ass because I feel
like if you're not the best at eyeshadow
it's not always bad to like get palettes
that aren't that pigmented because it's
less than the state I mean literally
David hid you I really know what you're
doing and realizing about I don't always
like know like I slept record you better
now I'm just taking that first play I
use and I kind of put on top just to
make it look more diffused because it's
really pigment in you guys like it's
really good with this um Bob okay all
right use different brush to focus about
color even more on outer crease watch
really really it's run ticketed oh
by the way I'm trying to sing why don't
curse them to my video um like I noticed
that I curse even when I'm really mad or
what I'm really excited like I'm really
pressed for something hisses palette I'm
trying to control myself but I don't
want curse too much only because I don't
want to be seen to the potty mouth oh I
am like I don't I don't know if this a
good look on YouTube um so I took about
my reviews down one outside of the Ã¬iÃ®
class on snapchat and has been question
of where was the review I might come to
contour kit one I am just tired of
attention is getting because I didn't
anticipate that and I really don't like
that at all um but I curse too much
causally Matt in that video and I just
don't see me as someone who just like
curses all the time um so yeah I'm
trying to work on that I just what I do
ready to fight I'm gonna go kid oh yeah
really really pigmented oh God
so let's see for my lid I know guys I
wanna use so I'm denying it is it's a
really peachy color
and what's really pretty is a recipe
this brush cut sucks I'm going to choose
my finger it's interesting the shimmers
don't feel as creamy as most shimmer
shadows I've used it comes up on your
hand but not
let's go the goal is creamy okay the
goldens really creamy this one's really
creamy - okay um Wow the only one is not
super creamy is peach on right here the
peach one actually kind of goes dry
compared to the other ones the other
sugary ones are like you know very
creamy but the one that I want to use is
peachy one right here it actually feels
kind of dry yeah oh god it's not coming
up as much thank you the primer I'm
going to use my eye candy liquid sugar
I'm kind of bummed though because that
teach one isn't really showing up what I
thought it would so we're going is a
different brush especially now that I
thought I would at all like it's showing
up but not like I thought it was it's
kind of a drier color which interesting
because other ones don't feel like that
and you could tell the quality
difference when you swatch it other ones
don't feel like that but this one feels
really really dry it almost reminds me
of now I never bought this but in stores
I did swatch it because I kept here to
talk about it because I'd know how
they're saying that food and media
ecology is really dry and also like that
like when i swatched it almost anyone
owns it but um when i swatched it so
really try not creamy enough I feel so
I'm going to go in with this maybe this
gold color or yes school color I put on
top I just love this isn't showing up
the way I wanted to and the vocalism
totally just going over it when you can
tell though I have to peach on top left
health
yeah the peach wines not that painted is
going is really dignity it completely
covered the peach color the office on a
bummer
all right well okay I'm honestly kind of
bummed out over the peach color because
I really want to use that I just wasn't
showing up and it's really really dry
and kind of look at this by that by
understand that some of anemic palates
just sometimes shades how to formulas
like you guys know how someone is very
hard coming to come up with a gorilla's
dislike shade of black so I mean I don't
know but I'm just someone with my face
I'm going to dust with the fallout I
want to wipe it because I don't be too
harsh with my skin and all why something
is I can wrap it on so your foundation
I'm going to use this covergirl vilest
healthy elixir I really realized a lot
of I posted video for it I'm actually
and it's really good it feels really
really lightweight it just gives it a
really nice healthy glow and on
boyfriend look so I'm going to use this
kind of sucks because I know this will
float to darker on me um for the video
clips whether they send me two shades to
choose from and I lost other one I had
so I cannot do this by using like
classic tan with another one I lost the
other ones like I should be you this
time but honestly like after I'm done
life is doing everything and contouring
stuff you can't really tell it's not the
right shade for me so that's what I'm
just using it
that looks so orange about after the
film uses bareMinerals Berenstain
concealer and it's a shade medium goals
in I know it's pretty light I usually
use this one called pan but and right
now like it doesn't really all in
seconds a little bit left in there you
have the difference like this other ones
really really bright I usually mix them
but this one's kind of running out so I
mean aren't you use this one and my
foundation is a little too dark anyway
so this one because it's so light you
should tone it down after I get done
blending
all right just want to sit on you guys
and see that your definite Odin on
Foundations the nation's look away to
orgy it looks at dark so I'm concealing
it looks more like my skintone
all right this hostile kind of browse my
skin means this contour stick by little
while
this is shade we're a small knot I
always use this so I'm just going to
kind of contour just the cheekbones my
go on and define my Cupid's bow where
that behold by step approach next I'll
use my Chanel setting powder um this is
just called a decimal side pair they
have I think it's translucent - they
have like three shades so this number -
so for my under eye shadow I'm going to
use this shade this orange shade right
here
um one place that I need my lash line
water line where the thing is called cuz
we segment it I don't want to go I wanna
go to darker to have the energy there so
I'm gonna see this shape so it's not two
dogs but like I want there to be
something there um and then I want you
just peach it again I just try to put in
here yeah it really doesn't show up I
mean this shade right here like it's
like a white shimmery shade what I feel
like a peach tone - it works a pink tone
to it so
and Freddie he said abroad I mean it
makes big brother just called furnished
for deep skin you don't know bad Oh God
here's what I'll do over West buns turn
that down all that's last and my face
dad you dummy
oh well okay God absolute my face first
I'm not thinking I'm use my soft looks
kind of a black radiance like always I
always hit panel do you have to buy more
so I'm gonna set real light because like
I said triangle I don't want to like
mess on myself now I'm gonna go back in
my bronzer by Nick become a student a
college girl should kind of want to be
too Cigna anyways I need my brows I'm
taking more guys do it honey do it free
lately and I'm going to go in to fix my
brows we fast per flush on the goal with
gala funded by benefit because I have
agonized shimmer to it
that's what I was so Kiki because I have
a wear makeup like this in a world all
right if I highlight I'm going to take
turtle by color pop random but this is
this highlight brush ever I've had this
brush for about two years now I gotta
I'm s
but not last as I master year before
that so it's been two years and it's
amazing psycho zest and it is as 165 and
I tell you I have other highlight
brushes that I always go back to this
one because it just works as that it's
literally the best fresh for highlight
um if you don't get anything from this
video just buy this brush like this
really because it's so good no matter
what how it is no matter if it's a cream
a powder it really works for everything
highlight you have so I would just
recommend is brush it just it's perfect
highlights now I had a mess cubed so not
just cuz outlook but because my keep is
to us look it's not super defined if you
don't have a super defined cubed suppose
you could highlight it and that's it'll
help you find your lips essentially and
so it makes it easier to line your lips
so definitely a tip I remember when I
was doing a well my class one on my
clients I tired this trade me she goes
oh like I'd never do that like yeah like
it's sexy really cool like so it's hard
to find your lip line really if you
don't have like a super defined one so
tips off the lip liner fermented
chestnut now I'm going to take work now
take sugary defe take world you draw my
back by the way I kind of create like a
very type of fat so with liners the

earrings these earrings I believe it's
like a bomb star um they're really cute
they're like really cute like cross legs
a little stud um do I recommend them yes

mean really cute but no because when I

the price on my head I'll look it up an
insert or something um but when it got
