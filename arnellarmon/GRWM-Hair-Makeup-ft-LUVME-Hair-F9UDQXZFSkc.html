welcome I just got done filming a quick
but bad bad a quick get ready with me
I'm going out to dinner with benefit
tonight but if it cosmetics so decided
to fill myself do my hair my makeup now
I lied it's probably not gonna be quick
so I'm doing my hair my makeup I just
remember that but hopefully it's
entertaining hope you guys enjoy it I'm
gonna took a lot of fire selfies so
prepare for those on Instagram I can't
talk um yeah so I'm staying off right
now because I sighs stop being a lazy
and take a picture sitting down cuz I
want to like target upper body shots I'm
just trying to like you know just do
more much stuff anyways hope you guys
guys get ready with me um yeah that's
hard to say if you guys liked this video
please be sure to give it a thumbs up
and if you haven't already please
subscribe I'm almost a hundred K so make
it happen and I'll see you in my next
video so i'ma stop with my hair first
just call I get that going so usually
takes longer I'm gonna take this got to
be spiked up styling gel I'm used to lay
my hair back underneath my stocking cap
and so I'm gonna just put that my hair
then I brush it back
after I have that brush back and gel
down with my stocking cap on I need a
new one well I mean I honestly just
actually picking up old ones that I find
in my little hair box and I use the
mighty new one so anyways I put that on
and so I made this wig out of hair okay
well duh oh my god out of love me hair
on Aliexpress and this the herons
natural curl patter like I didn't touch
it and do anything to it I just want to
see how it would look like it's just as
natural state and it's beautiful you
guys like I'm Matt I've never done this
before using why I get hair I end up
wedding in it or strain I do something
to it I just made the wig and I kept it
in its natural state I made sure I
didn't do anything too much to where it
would like alter the natural state so
yeah this next day it's really really
really pretty alright so now to figure
out how let's part the hair I am doing a
side part cycle a because his hair so
much body like naturally I thought it'd
look really cute if I had some of it to
the side you know a lot of volume you
know you know what I was going for
so I pulled on my natural edges now I'm
taking this edge control it looks like
it's like lip gloss or whatever the heck
that lipstick not lipstick chapstick
whatever it rhymes with crime axe but
it's actually a control and I got from
the you sly store and so I laid my edges
but don't mind them like they're toilet
not gonna stay that way I was just
trying to figure out my life honestly
why did my wig thing it literally takes
me a long time to make them look good
because I'll trial and error for me I'm
not perfect at yet but I mean I just I
like to show everything I do on camera
just to show you guys that if you're
doing this at home it's not gonna come
out perfect the first time or maybe it
will and that's awesome but if it
doesn't don't get discouraged because
literally every time I do my wigs I mess
up Midway I do something that I don't
like and I end up fixing it so yeah just
don't get discouraged when you're
dealing with your wigs damn is plucking
my part knife look I did some to my part
I didn't like and I cannot determine
what it was I think when I plugged it
look fine but then I had a concealer to
it to make it look like Matt my skin
tone more I think I added too much
concealer because I used a little too
thick I did something wrong by affixing
it however I end up fixing like off
camera after this video so the looks in
shambles during the video just know that
I didn't go out and public look like
that it looked a little better after I
was done
so I put the still on my part and now
I'm going to make the part a little
longer because I feel like the long the
part looks the more real looks you know
when it goes further back I buy when the
parts a little too short it doesn't look
that realistic so I just plucked a
little more going backwards make sure I
didn't showing you the tracks in the
back yeah I just made a look a little
more natural this way
so now I'm taking this gorillas snot gel
I just didn't why you got to be gel the
black one I just dries too slow
and so I'm taking this and order to make
it not like yellow all you have to do
just like rubbing your fingers a little
bit make sure you really spread it out
when you put it underneath the lace that
way it doesn't look yellow and weird but
I'm just taking a thin amount and I'm
just put in where the lace stops or
starts and I mean you got to hold on the
lace and I didn't even blow dried or
anything I just let it naturally dry and
the lace is glued to my head there's
simple very easy very simple I just said
that
it's a last thing I have to do before I
move into my makeup I'm just going to
get this black brow powder and I'm going
to place that around my hairline just to
make it look less bald now I learned
that I prefer using brow powder over eye
shadows I feel like these brow powders
they're meant to go onto hair because we
put on the brows so something about this
that works better than the eye shadow I
mean you guys show if you want I just
like this more and so at first it's
looking like shambles but I just work
with okay I put the powder on then I
brush it out with a toothbrush so you
can't tell it's powder I'm kind of
brushing it into the thin hairs that I
have making the power lock onto those
thin hairs to make the hairs look
thicker just just watch it makes sense
so now that we have this wig look a
halfway decent Spanish I like makeup so
I do my brows off camera so this video
is an hour long and I will take this
Joey anti blemish mattifying primer I
noticed that any product with white
packaging does not show up on my camera
because my lights are really bright so
I'm sorry about that but it's just Joey
a primer and I put that on first and
then after that I'm gonna get this Mac
strobe cream what am I gonna do it right
now it was Mac strobe cream just to like
make my makeup illuminate from
underneath my skin and honestly I just
like the smell of strobe cream it's
really weird smell you almost question
hey that shouldn't be in my face but it
smells really good so I put that all
over my face
so Foundation take my Anastacio stick
foundations I'm using two shades I think
one is amber and I know for a fact the
other ones caramel now put the darker
one which is amber around the perimeter
of my face and then caramel the middle
on it's a caramel will work for a whole
time face I'm just trying to prolong the
foundation so I use bold so that way the
caramel color doesn't run out super fast
so that makes sense it meaning honestly
it looks great okay so that's how I do
it and I'm going to put that on my face
I'm gonna blend it out with the damp
Beauty Blender
so to conceal I'm paying these two
maybelline concealers now I just
recently bought these and these are the
bomb but you know like Maybelline then
we have anemone shades I just to get two
shades I got like one darker shade and
one lighter shade to make my shade and
these are awesome like I can't I can't
think of I can't think of what this
concealer compares to I just know that
it reminds me of a high-end brand I just
literally could knock my finger on it I
just know that would very shocked these
work really good because I've been
trying to buy more drugstore products
lately so I could do like more drugstore
videos so I've just been trying new
stuff and trust believe this is
definitely a concealer I recommend it's
the bomb like I still haven't all right
now hours later after filming this video
and like no creases no nothing I'm
staring at myself in the mirror right
now in the most non cocky way and my
face is flawless
so this concealer it's it's on my list
how to fix my brows I kind of messed
about my concealer but I'm gonna set the
place I concealed with my lure murmur
powder
you guys should notice by now we'll
actually shinik some windows a couple
times but I do one thin layer to set a
concealer and then if I'm doing shadow I
put another layer on top of that to
catch the fallout and this just like
prevents it from being cakey like
totally tried best dude ever
now I'm not cream contouring but I'm
going to cut the contour and where I
would cream contour because this makes
my cheekbones look more defined and it
makes my face look slimmer so yeah I'm
gonna do one I off camera and then I'm
gonna come back and do the other eye so
I did want to have camera it's looking
kind of flame you know more lashes and
everything so now it's time to the other
I don't mind the lion chains lighting
for some reason my light got brighter so
I had to kind of like tone the contract
so it looks more saturated I mean
doesn't look too bad so remover so I'm
put on this lemonade primer by benefit
to prime my eyes eye mass on top of that
with my lower murmur powder and then
we're gonna start on the eyes and I'm
gonna use the modern renaissance palette
by Anastasia Beverly Hills this is like
my favorite I should have followed the
year like literally like hands down and
so I'm gonna take this shade oh god what
is it one second all right got the
palette it's called golden ochre which
is like a very soft shadow that you
barely see but I'm using to the base
that I should take the shade ooh
when fresco Oh bula on boo-yan no that's
not what it's called it's spelled bu o n
so you could take from there never take
the shade ruger mix with the Bhuwan
fresco and I'm going to use that I'm
just warming up my eye you know I don't
like going in with dark colors
immediately that's kind of scary to me
so I just mix shades and I warm it up
and then I go in for the kill and use
the dark colors by themselves taking the
shade love letter which is like the best
color of this palette and it's crazy
because I first saw this palette I was
like what am I gonna do with a hot pink
I totally shave this color I'm just like
I met a pink person but this is like the
number one Shadow use I have this
palette every single time I do look this
palette because it's just beautiful okay
it's just beautiful and so now I'm
taking this like little shadow stick by
girl lactic I forgot this shade but
be down below it's like a shimmer stick
and I might use as a base before I put
on my shadow so the shine when you st.
palette it's called Vermeer and it's a
shimmer and when put on top of the girl
lactic stick in that way it just makes
it look more pigmented and it prevents
it from like going over into my crease
area because you know my lids are little
hooded
I'm gonna pond these lashes my new bound
some called bangle I do not show myself
with these on because honestly in
shambles with these lashes I'm shockers
to have them on because usually I rip
off lashes but I was rip them off today
some of the lashes on and I'm gonna do
my lower lash line and I'm just going to
mix the shades real gir and oh god love
letter I'm going to use that underneath
my lash line and I'm gonna take that
same shimmer stick by galactic and girl
lactic Jesus and put that in my like
inner core and of brighten up my eyes
I'm gonna set on top of that with the
same shadow using my lid very simple and
cut off my mascara and you're pretty
much done with this look now time for
the face I'm using this Mac Studio Fix
powder to set my foundation so Lisa mist
to me and I'm such a dummy I meant two
acts for Studio finish I said Studio Fix
when I got this in the mails like wait
what is this I realized in the email I
said Studio Fix steps to do finish do to
finish is like the UH
Oh God oh no I might it's nice to do
then is just Studio sculpt Jesus oh my
god I'm just gonna buy it anyways set my
face dust off that excess powder and you
guys see how it doesn't look all white
and cakey that's because I did one layer
first and the second layer and so I'm
not taking this Kat Von D contour
palette I'm gonna take these two shades
just contour my face get my cheekbones
looking right I wanna look like skeleton
you know I want to look like wow our
nail addiction lose five pounds I wish
but I didn't just contour so yeah
contour my face and Mitte what I do
after this we're gonna find out let me
finish this by the way don't mind how
goofy I get my voiceover is I just don't
like being scripted so when I'm doing
this I'm literally just talking and
saying whatever is on my mind oh all
right so I'm onto blush and this is my
girl acted too now so shocked by how
pigmented this looks have another blush
like this and it looks similar to us
making me blush I have but they may feed
blush not show up like this so I say to
tone it down cuz way pigmented it's a
beautiful though just make my cheekbones
pop so another girl active product is
highlighter and this is called I got it
right here I just put more on called
luster it's a face glow and man does it
pop it's like
it hath like purple and peak undertones
in my opinion like in person it looks it
doesn't just look like a white highlight
it has different undertones that really
compliment my skin so yeah I just
totally want this look and it was
awesome so I just put that everywhere
alright so my lip situation was in
shambles I thought my lips look red
because I tried on lipstick I was like
no I hate this did another one I was
like no I hate this I did not know what
kind of lipstick know what to wear I
just don't want to use this cork liner
and so I end up selling for a gloss
which end up looking beautiful it's not
my L'Oreal and it's like this really
perfect new gloss it's so perfect you
guys I think I'm pretty sure used to be
Alyssa but she hasn't asked about it in
months so it's mine now so I'm pretty
sure used to be mine in the past but uh
yeah it's awesome you just gonna put it
on a minute after I you know get done
lining my lips after like five years
here is the gloss you guys were sleeping
on right now babe babe you it's
beautiful I just I totally love this
gloss it's a perfect everyday gloss
because it's like nude but it's not too
new to wear makes you look washed out
and like Cass get ready I'm going to set
my face using my fix+ iMac and yeah just
gonna spread on my face I'm let it dry
them a move on to finishing my hair all
right now it's time just finish on my
hair tip the clip down
um I'd have to figure out my life figure
okay like I want to keep in a natural
state I just want to make it look more
polished and not super natural so I am
going to sing for like two seconds and
then I'm going to get my edge control
and fix those edges because I mean they
were not up to par okay they weren't
acceptable so I'm just going to fix
those and make them look more agile and
yeah
too much edge control in my hair I made
it stiff so if you have this problem
give it a spoolie and it will kind just
like scrape through your edges and
you'll make the edges look more edges I
don't want to describe it just look what
I'm doing okay
but yeah if you ever put too much on
control and your hair it's like stiff
and all its to like put together yeah
just get a spoolie and just run through
the hair anyways now put on more
concealer and this is where I remove my
life because I'd totally did not even
need to put more concealer on I don't
know why I did this I want to go back to
tongue in time you'd be like hey I know
don't do that but I did it it was too
late
now I run my finger over to kind of like
diffuse the concealer goes a little too
thick and I knew it was like shambles
but it was re too late so not taking
this sheet keratin mist and I really I
don't know what this does it just smells
really good and anything mrs. keratin
sounds good to me
and I'ma take this silk infusion by Chi
and this is like just a silk infusion so
my god it's a hair serum oh my god I
need to eat something very soon and I'm
gonna put that to make the hair look all
shiny and nice and not frizzy and it
just made it look beautiful
now I'm fixed my edges I start filling
myself a little bit honestly I don't
know how cuz I don't think it looked
that great but my lights are bright they
were blinding me that's my excuse so
we're just gonna roll with it and I mean
I was gonna go back so that was the
finished look I still can leave this
herons natural state it's so freakin
nice I'm so the only part with his hair
I didn't realize the tracks I thought
the tracks were a little too thick in my
opinion they were just kind of poorly
constructed but the hair itself is
beautiful I would recommend the hair
just let those tracks I don't know I
don't know you kinda have to make your
own decision that's just like my little
review but this is a finished look I
