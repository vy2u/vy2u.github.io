you're new welcome so I just got done
filming this look actually like it don't
know why I'm not used to this much bone
this is much color but I want I doing
more of this so I don't have to just
keep doing the same like natural
everything to look someone to do more
full so although I'm kind of nervous
because I never wearable this like I
never go looks like this I kind of
scared to go out I just feel weird name
is that I maybe I haven't reached that
level of confidence when go out in my
room a full ass face like this believe
or not I just felt I don't know like
insulting to looking as well she's hella
makeup on but I'm yes you can look
tonight and I'll spin my hair a little
bit oh there wasn't much to hair though
because it's the hair in its natural
state I want to keep it that way because
I hardly ever keep hearing snap
Tuesday's when we think about it unless
it's curly and so I kind of want the
hair to be how it was good to me you
know because I never do that other pair
is from my fashion hair co-op inserted
right here I have three bundles of
14-inch and a 12-inch run tool their
press was pretty big but to kind of
customize it cuz it's in my head
just more you guys head times we do
order the frontal it's come out on the
bigger side so maybe if you have a
bigger head in mind the frontal main
work now I can't almost be formative pay
on this hair just yet because I
literally just put it in it feels soft
and it feels fine like for now and I
doubt I'll have any prompts on the beam
that it's short usually don't have any
problems on my hair short Isuzu kind
it's like carefree easygoing but I will
however you know after I wear you know
during the day I'm going to vlog part of
this video see to sleep that we'll see
how it reacts to like outside of hair
last learning indoor/outdoor so we'll
see and then if you guys want me to do a
little more with you like diet we to do
some to it I will just just so you guys
can see you know if it's good quality
hair enough but if you'd like to
purchase hair all the details and
everything will be down below um I mean
I say go for SKU let's have a look
because i doubt i highly highly doubt i
have any problems with this hair
based on the length alone and they sound
like feels it doesn't feel different
immediate problems but that's just my
professional opinion so yeah let's just
watch people make
and then afterwards I'm going to go out
and go do some shopping I'm going to IQ
by moving out so I want to like start
writing a list out of the things I want
to buy I'm not going to buy a whole
bunch of substance yet I just want to
like an idea of how much I'm going to
save up and how much I'm going to spin
some certificate I shot with me and I
mean you guys just see me you know go
through my date so yeah I'll see you

gonna have to do my hair because like
it's really killing me I'm doing my
makeup so they look less dark so I just
got done making this wig I had like a
new wig with every single day just hair
from my fashion hair coat I'm assuming
the coast answer company and by the way
say I got three 14-inch bundles and a
12-inch frontal and so I'm going to keep
it wavy for the most part I just kind of
want to curl ups a little bit in the
front just so it doesn't look like too
sloppy in anything since my mom I'd let
the hair being this natural state just
to see how looks throughout the day I'm
gonna be vlogging today because I have
some errands to run headed up to that
picture
oh my god it's like a I won't call us a
meme but it was a guy he did a facebook
status and he goes boxing I run some
errands but he spelled errands as an a a
r om f but the name Eric's on a journey
um so every time I say I'm gonna run
errands I really think of that I'll say
errands and I never kiss my job
it keeps me to calm down the little
clips hella funny yeah so I mean I want
to do Mike I'm kind of doing the top
layer so just looks more clean - I feel
like the frontal because I bleached the
not and then I wet the frontal when it
kind of dried down it looks kind of like
this
so the curled had a kinda lost yeah it
got lost in the throat I'm in the
frontal but like I just college a little
bit and you are good to go
well devious Oh cute
I love what my hair is very easy I'm a
very simple person hence why I always do
just simple looks and simple stuff but

the difference I still can't tell the
difference like I don't know my heart
turn it I know if I do I'm mostly going
to buy it again once I understand it so
I must keep it like $1,000 for it but

where's walnut and I'm women out really
fast hair keeps sticking to my face all
right now I'm going to put powder oh
it's all gone where's my other one you
know what we're using an e powder I'm so
poured in here because it'll be easy to
grab oops
use my big night banana powder come on
Lindsay do your magic oh I like to plan
my Pappy looks come to bite and I'm just
going to use that and studies my eyes
I'm going to do a thin layer first to
say and I'm gonna do another layer to
catch my eye shadow
all right so you want to have camera I
tried to do it on this kind of cool I
try to do it on camera but was not
working because I do I shower looks but
she looks at my use of doing it took me
a while to kind of see where it's going
so I can with this look Linda just a
little bit more
it was correct small feels it was kind
of cool I like that and where's the last
box looking better alright so I'm going
to do either right now so let's see I'm
a prime eyelid using my lemonade part of
my benefit this guy right here it's just
a yellowy primer that kind of color
texture eyelids looking at our eyelids
although idealized like using it can use
our eyelids if you use this no hole
expression and give you a clean base
so today's palette I'm using the take me
to Brazil palette by BH Cosmetics very
colorful palette I wish I would show my
pal without his being so overexposed
number eight my life just really bright
and so to start off I'm going to take
this yellowy color right here the base
no this color right here yeah so twice
it's like a it looks yellow but it looks
yellow but it's more like chartreuse
it is my camera's I'm taking them on on
camera but my lights are calling bright
so it's Harper but camera pick up on it
who
let me take the color needed which is
like how I do it don't put up close your
focus on it no I'm going to the coloring
meet which like this um lime green color
you guys see me who mirror with a lime
green color and I'm going to put on top
hold what uses back to the other day but
the look was just too boring them or can
you do that over don't waste the
backdrop like that you snap just like I
feel like going to take a reflector off
it's better I feel like you could use
them awful times that I'm not all the
time Christos different that it was
noticeable
that's better a bit better and so now
I'm going to take this green chain are
here and mix it with this black shade
and then I'm going to place that on the
outer crease area now I'm trying to
follow the stuff I took when I first do
this is all over the place but using why
I do one I tell you the exact same thing
of other I even if I messed up just to
let's just like more accurate some ticks
on my mixing medium I gotta move on my
finger and I'm going to place that on my
lid then I'm going to take this orange
shadow right here and place it on top I
use a mix we managed to make the color
more pigmented because without it it
won't be activated and putting it on my
lids we melt my finger
like so and what this going to do is on
the Pigman was on top it makes it more
pigmented i use a pigment before and
without the orange base it's not just
pigmented so i learned that by putting
action underneath it and mixed more
pigmented and so before I do the pigment
on do I go with my Tarte Pro palette and
I'm going to use this brown shade right
here and I'm going to add that to the
corner
all right at the pigment first and then
see if I need to add more brown I'm
pretty sure I do because a little dark
on this side I'm at the pigment first
the pig man I use insulin by Inglot is
number 82 and it's like this shin right
pinion like this like a my interesting
burgundy pigment so look at my lid oh my
god you're killing me totally worth the
money
oh this is what when you buy me stuff
and it's kind of like uh it's a workday
and then using your like oh yes like you
already notice the difference that's me
my Lindsay and so I'm gonna take my
mixing even yet again and I'm going to
play on my lid like so and then I'm
going to take the pigment and just press
it I think of a lot as well fall out by
just want to make sure that um you know
my whole lid is covered
I'm going to go back Andersonville
darker let's come on Dacian like
freaking sweat and using arrows got the
roids oh my go use more of the brown
eyeshadow scimitar palette just as deep
in this color good to get to match the
other eye now that I kind of like
completed most of my eye shadow is going
on my lashes and we just walked camera
I'll show you guys what they look like
they're by the makeup Shack and they
look like this somebody put the arm and
click and I'll be right all right my
lashes are nice to my face um like I
said I don't know most of my stuff is at
because I tested an idiot so this like
mine it's actually because my bronzers
like called a sin bronzer but I'm just
going to wrong how much how you to
deciding powder you know just see if it
works
all right that works cool alright so for
blush I have a new blush where'd you go
this blush is by Mac o'clock format it
is like a rusty brownish mat so I'm
going to use that and use the same brush
to what you trying to I want you oh my
god this might never crack let's move
make a check brush better go under on
this favorite tail that's cloaks I'm
gonna put eyeshadow needs any weight in
fact well of you like look I child is
cool I just want a little more warmth I
mean use the same blush don't put that
over diet just to kind of like I saw
like it needs a better transition so I'm
just going to do that I love you just
tell the difference I can I like a
little better and now I'm going to use
the same brush and I'm going to put it
under my eyes I never like using super
dark shadow on my lower lash line very
rare that I do that because it doesn't I
very small so when I use dark shows and
close them out and you guys want those
airplanes ah dependent already shine
if you have less videos why do you like
dark underneath the eyes let me know
I'll make a little darker now I'll use
this Tarte bronzer - Negus little darker
all right I want to add very different
so I'm going to go back in with D take
me to Brazil palette and I'm going to
use this lime green and I'm going to put
it on the inside just to like you know
make this little arm just fun I like
