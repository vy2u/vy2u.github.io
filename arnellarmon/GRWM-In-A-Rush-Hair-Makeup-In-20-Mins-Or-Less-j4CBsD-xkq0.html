inches weight reduce myself and you guys

I was very awkward like introduce myself
by now if you were here thanks for being
here for this video if you liked the
video at the end subscribe do all that
good stuff but this videos gonna be
basically need getting ready do my hair
and makeup in under 20 minutes now um
that's that's not a lot of time it
usually when I do the makeup I like to
sit and really beat my face I like to
like just take my time honestly being a
youtuber I'll really have a schedule
unless I like my nan stuff which is
rarely because I hate commitments I used
to have a schedule is about to do just
take however on once in my face but I'm
today I'm like I want to be productive
but I don't want to spend all they do my
makeup so I child the stuff to do it in
last 20 minutes which I did my stopwatch
is right here it took me
what uh-ohhhhh I'll let you guys see
that in the video ooh challenge I know I
won't be to see it but when you first
look on this video if you know it's over
20 minutes well comment down the time
that you think I finished my makeup bag
like the exact time exact took like 90
minutes and 50 seconds comment that and
if ever gets the closest one no that
won't because something make cheated
skipped in the video I'll just comment
what you think and I'll tell you if
you're right or not or you'll see when
you get to the end of the video I'm
gonna run after this video
look this too much how the one you think
I finished but I pretty much did my hair
my makeup I know a lot of guys want to
know about this hair on Instagram I post
some Instagram out into the little clip
which I was wearing his hair this hair
is an absolute concept it's like I've
had long wavy hair on this before but
this is super nice um
or even onto the shower wedeck's I like
to come with refresh the hair you know
and just wedding watch her ever and it's
so soft I just love the wild but like
clean meat look it's giving me I love
this hair so much and I'll talk about a
woman styling the hair in the video and
I did a pretty basic makeup look but I
liked it I did something different I did
like this eyeliner thing I never do so I
just did a few things but nonetheless
that you're gonna let's swim in it so if
you want to watch this video maybe
you're bored maybe you're chillin maybe
you want to see me do you wanna make
them in here because it's satisfying
I like watch the meals like this then
continue to watch like I said these are
the video subscribe if you don't then
maybe watch another video it may be that
you like it maybe then you subscribe men
but it's getting pretty loud outside so
I'm gonna go now that's my cute guys
enjoyed this and I will see you guys
later alright so I started looking a hot
mess I cannot believe my hair is growing
so much it's like it's hard again it
becomes harder and harder to like do
this wig thing the longer your hair gets
because it just doesn't lay as flat um
yeah a duck tail in the back now you
should just look right down anyways
here's the air fresh out the shower
she's beautiful I don't know what I'm
gonna name this unit Jessica that's
first I came to mine her name Jessica
and I'm gonna speed this part up I'm
gonna put the wig on now this one is so
easy style the hairs really nice and I
put an emphasis on that because I've had
like long wavy hair this before and I
could see the difference this one's
better than the other one I had I don't
wanna say the company's name at respect
um but this one's way better and so I'm
just you know fixing my part and I'm
gonna do I do but you see how the comb
goes straight through the hair that's
how you know this hair is nice usually
you can't just comb through hair
especially curly wavy hair but the comb
went right through it so here I am just
you know laying my edges I decide to lay
edges on the side as well cuz I noticed
that when the wind blows on you could
see that this is a
so if you lay edges all the way around
it just looks more natural it's more
cold and so um yeah I'm doing what I
always do I'm gonna take this ultra
defining gel by Deva curls for curly
hair
I'm just put that in there that way when
the hair dries down it's not like frizzy
or anything it's definition but I don't
I don't think that this hair even needs
any product the pictures I had started
in the beginning of this video I had no
product in the hair whatsoever so I
don't think this hair needs product at
all but I did anyways out of habit but I
mean after I lay my baby hairs that's
literally it it was so easy style this
week and so now it's on to the makeup
I'm gonna first prod my skin with this
Mac skin base I believe it's called no
it's costly nails but it's from Mac
it'll be down below and I'm going to
just brother into my skin I love this
primer it's super smooth like Lucian
then I take my thin see Beauty
foundation my favorite foundation at the
moments my absolute favorite a bath in
tea Beauty giveaway planned
I just got buy more stuff for it I mean
I don't know it's it's all over the
place but I have one plan where I'm
gonna give away kind of a little bit of
everything
- the brushes unless maybe I'll go buy
the brushes I don't know I'm
overthinking things now let me know you
guys so they know in the comments what I
should do but after that I'm gonna
conceal with this covergirl concealer
I'm really not sure what inspired me to
pick this up it's not my favorite I
think I just picked it up cuz I want to
use the same concealer I always used so
I just decided to pick this one up but I
get my matchstick by 50 beauty and this
is in the shade I believe it's a vanilla
I think I'm just gonna use it to
highlight and I'm just gonna blend it
out quickly with my Tarte sponge and
then after this I'm going to take the
contour stick by also - see beauty in
the shade rum I use a very light light
concealer highlight shade because if you
think about it once you set it with
powder it really tones all that out
anyway so if you want there to be some
brightness you kind of have to go extra
light because you have to think about
setting with powder so yeah tickets our
concealed I'm uses Ric made no color
powder but look at this fly it's live
right over forehead I had to put that a
slo-mo I couldn't believe he did that to
me I was traumatized after that but I
kept on going house in a
I was literally trying to make sure I
did this in like 20 minutes or less I
was like super Russian like I mean of
course I sped this up but I was moving
fast in real life too that's why why I
see was even extra fast Meharry I'm
setting my face with this mattifying
powder by make it forever
it's awesome totally recommended there
was a freaking flagon he's just gonna be
in the video okay now to contour even
more to just broad my face I'm using
hotel heiress by Tarte they have me is
my Sigma blush see I'm moving extra fast
you guys like ding I should have sped up
so much cuz I'm moving fast in real life
but here I am this is gonna be like the
longest part my brows it takes me about
I can do my brows in a good three
minutes if I really have to because I
like the natural kind of scruffy not so
perfect brow sometimes like I know how
to like you know get them all to find
and whatnot but I like the natural like
I didn't really put too much effort to
this kind of brows you know so when I'm
doing that which so I'm doing this video
I could do it in about three minutes and
so yeah I'm gonna do my brows be fast
and then I could see let me do all that
good stuff and then I'll be right back I
figure why do after this that's why I
can't keep talking
SOTA Holly I'm taking my Finn T Beauty
kilowatt and hustle baby it's like my
favorite highlight at the moment it's so
nice because it's super pigmented the
mini put it on I just man I know I seem
like I'm like really on Rihanna's nuts
and her makeup line but it's literally
my favorite I love it so here I'm just
gonna fluff in my hair out I was really
digging this hair you guys won't want
throw that wig on right now I'm chilly
right now have my scarf on you know no
makeup on sweats you know drink but yeah
here decides to put eyeshadow I really
did not need to do this if I didn't do
this I would say like one minute or two
um I just wanted color of my eyes I
didn't want to be super lame and boring
so I decided to just go with something
super simple I use this orange shade
first real what we're pigmented I
thought it would be I thought it would
be like not so your pigmented but this
is violet loss so the shadow is really
nice and so I did a channel first I
decide to put bronzer in my eyes because
I feel like that looked too shadowy and
I want the bronzer it tone down the
orange enos of that shadow which kind of
did and then I decide to put this
eyeliner on I want now it look it's kind
of messy as my first time doing it like
this but I wanted to put it like super
close to my lash line that way when I
put mascara on my lashes look more
fuller which it did because I knew I
wouldn't have time to put falsies on so
um I wanted to like you know and make my
lash look nicer so this is a cool trick
I prize you use a different eyeliner but
I still think it looks nice
so we're really good now for my mascara
I'm using one by always get a mixed up
is this Dior Givenchy Givenchy one of
those high-end products I think she won
she
I don't wanna disrespect the Brad horn
omegle look okay I looked is Siobhan Chi
I knew it was one of those either way it
looks like you'll be dr though huh like
the the tube but this mascara is pretty
nice they send me a primer to you I
should have used a primer cuz when you
pair with the primer it looks so much
better and a primer is super nice but I
didn't have it
so I just read through my time my
mascara because I wanted my lashes
really full so yeah and that's gonna let
my lips I am going to use matte plum lip
liner I'd be using plum a lot because I
can't find my cork I lost both them and
they're both brand new I'm kind of sad
about that let's not talk about it I
don't wanna make this video depressing
now I'm gonna use this liquid lips have
ever been decay I forget this shade it's
like nineteen something that's a cool
shades like a neutral tone and I kind
you'd like to kind of like go on top of
the liner and I'm gonna put a clause in
this gloss by L'Oreal and it kind of
matches the lipstick but you know I want
some new classy and after that uh I'm a
mess with my hair a little more you know
because I'm filling it and whatnot got
fluff and make it look really big I'll
should I make a dry out marks I like
this hair when it's more dry it out I
just think it looks really great
don't I look like I belong in a jungle
huh I know but it's in my face I'm uses
Morpheus Eddy mist I'm always scared
when it comes setting spray I don't like
doing it and then a while I wait for
that to dry to my blow dryer and dried
the hair even more I'm a standout to
show you guys what look hair looks like
like you know what I'm staying up it's
so wild it's so freaking nice bad for
that I was done and I'm sure you guys
how long it took me 17 minutes 20
seconds I shouldn't have spent that part
up but um yeah if you guess that then
you're awesome and you should give video
a thumbs up subscribe because we're
totally in sync if you guess that's how
long it took and yeah that's all I have
to say I don't know what to say right
now oh yeah it gives me a thumbs up
subscribe I see the same thing
everything behind and I'm white here
watching more many videos and you know
enjoy yourself and I'll see you guys
