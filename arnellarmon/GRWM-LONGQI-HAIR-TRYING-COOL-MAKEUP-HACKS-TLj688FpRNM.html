we can touch you
and that's welcome back so let's start
with the hair first
I made this wig out of this hair got
this monkey hair now it's not the best
on grade because these bundles actually
came on braid and so it was like a black
to brown to blonde but I didn't like the
brown color I didn't think it looks
realistic all thought that it's just
that usually okay the bundles came on
braid but the closure wasn't and so I
knew it would be very hard for me to get
closer to match the brown that was a car
that ombre bundle so it's hard to get
like a pretty brown especially one that
matches the bundle so I know I should do
it all blonde but it's weird because
much higher tone it it could have banks
I'll try telling my wet hair I don't
know because it worked before but toner
was really taking so I have this kind of
like very warm not too yellowy was a
very warm blonde color I thought I
could've did a better job and I'll
probably add a dark color on top of this
but I mean
anywho I pretty much cut the hair
because I've ended to this length lately
I love this length is just very easy to
work with so it just it's perfect it's
perfect ones to me if you see like my
last few hair videos I like made my hair
just winds so I just cut this length and
I kind of just bumped it this hairs
really easy to work with I've broken
this company many times I've never had
you know a bad experience with them so
I'll concede work with him but um yeah
this was really simple
I literally just cut it and then I you
know strained a little bit and then I
was good to go and this hair
straightened so easily guys I live is
just a brand to flatten over I'd ask too
much at all and then I'm before I put my
headscarf on so that kind of like make
the top play a little flatter I just get
disliked you know silky hair stuff and I
put it through the hair
you know hairs off flippy you guys show
off the back and I put my headscarf on
and then I'll start on my makeup on my
skin I'm going to first use my Tarte
clean slate for this custom with a
concealer primer and I'm just going to
rub that I you say I'm supposed to my
primers around my nose because that's
where my makeup was not to separate it
get kind of oily there give me any
problems and then I just you know blend
it out from there I never like put it
around my whole
our face we made in my t-zone area and
then I take my NYX liquid illuminator
and it's like a rose bowl shade and I'm
going to put that as a base in order to
get my foundation to you know illuminate
and kind of glow from underneath yeah I
don't know what I'm saying I'm just I
want to go for a glue those foundation
if I try something different I decided
to put like a very lightweight glowy
foundation with the matte foundation and
I wasn't sure how I don't even know what
inspired this oh well I kind of said it
I want to see what would happened but I
wasn't sure until I start to blend it
out you guys and the combination of
these two foundations is so nice right
I could literally see it different so
when I get to like at the end when you
get see the reason the foundation I do
see like it's perfect because it has a
glow but then it's a mattified it's like
a magnifying five glow
I don't know explain it but it looks so
flawless and just I was not expecting
that these two foundational blends so
well together but I'm happy I tried it
because now I have like a new favorite
and they're all just or so that's pretty
cool but it literally looks so good you
just been talking about how it's like a
glow but it looks mad at the same time
it looks really cool so I was happy I
did that all right so now I'm gonna try
something weird I'm in Kasey's color
effects illuminator drops I'm gonna plan
on my eye honestly during this video I
tried so many different things am i okay
that I want to with this with you I
wanted to do and they kind of came out
cold
I want to see if this will help brighten
up my concealer I don't know if you guys
know isn't a sunny powder underneath the
eye it has like illuminating sparks to
them if I was going for and so I blend
that out and then I put my cabinet qualm
central skin enhancer on top and then
once I pointed that out at first I
couldn't really see a difference but
then when I really looked I can kind of
see the glow from underneath I would
just I wish should explain why I was
going for I saw them try something
different cause I feel like I have my
favorite process I was used by one I
just tried to use them in different ways
to be a more use out of them so that's
kind of wild just try rid of stuff and
you go see I try way more red and stuff
during this video it's no it's not
boring you know I don't want like you
know do the same thing
the time so I would learn to conceal her
out I take my time and concealer it's
very thick there's honestly no rush
unless you're in a rush then don't use
concealer because this concealer takes
of water blend out but if you have time
you know just take your time because you
want to look flawless but you can kind
of see you guys see how under the mecha
so you can kind of see the glow flow
going for that look really nice so I
know the exercise tribe was putting on
powder bronzer while my face still dance
and contri turn into a cream bronzer
again I know what made me do this I just
want to try something different and I
think this came out cool however I feel
like in the end it looks a little muddy
so I probably wouldn't do this again
I've seen people do this before I don't
know if you consider it a hack I guess
it depends on your preference but an
issue though because when I took this
bronzer then I blended on top of it with
my sponge out at my foundation on it
actually turned in more into a contour
shade it made it more cool tone smell
the plus but I thought it looked a
little muddy so I probably would do it
again now another thing I'm going to try
I may use lipstick as a cream blush I've
never done it before was on my channel
so I press try it out only in the views
they wanted lipstick another one was a
little too pink and then I blend around
I thought it'd look pretty nice I've
tried to put a liquid lipstick before
and it works pretty cool so I decide to
do with this - you take it anywhere like
lipstick in one of my last videos I also
don't remember but did in this video and
I thought it looks okay that's the best
okay that is this place I can feel it
I'm going to take my lower murmur powder
and just you know set every single place
that I put the Kevin of quantum Juliet
to send my entire face I'm just use my
Sephora Micro smooth powder is pretty
boring and pretty simple you know I
thought I went a little too ham on my
Lorimer powder because I was looking a
little ghostly otherwise is wrong
honestly half with this make tutorial I
was just saying this tutorial just get
ready with me cause like I'm kind of in
shambles but sometimes in unity it
looked it was a little nice but at this
point I was not feeling it I didn't
think I was good at all I'm sure you
agree now I'm taking my benefit
California blush I'm going to put on top
apart from my lipstick blush you know
just to intensify that color damaging my
fula bronzer just a contour my nose I
wanted like a nose contouring video if I
want to get a little better first I
wanna match my nose
like crazy like I want to smash my nose
so much I don't want to just recognize
me but I'm not that good yet so after I
did that it's time to do my brows Park
me sped up although I have my brows
micro bladed I still fill my brows
because I mean it just looks weird
without them
however um the mic related it's tomato
is it's are convenient what I don't our
makeup because it makes my brows look
more full I'm going to go back in in
September to get them even more full and
they are now as interesting when I first
got them I thought they look too thick
but now that I've had them it's almost
like they're mine now
I'd be belong to me and now wasn't even
thicker this means telling addiction I
don't know but I'm going to go back then
really does not hurt at all
I'm going to a video button to beneath
along to video now or do a video after I
get my touch-up let me know if you guys
want to see like one now or one like
later after I get the touch-ups and let
the final result
all right so now I'm gonna take my blush
again I'm going to put it in my little
flappy fold I did this like the other
day I thought was really pretty so I
have to do this video it just makes your
eyes look so bright and so cool and it's
perfect if you do wear eyeshadow cuz
this is I don't know something office
looks really good to me
and so I went to my Jeff and he'll
palette to get like even warmer orange
you shade to put on top and how much
kind of darken the color this wasn't the
best idea I noticed that with this you
need some of this war just transparent
like it has color but more transparent
so I blend that SEC color out just so
it's minting the blush and kept like
that to highlight I'm just going to
highlight the place I use the highlight
nothing special about this part just
regular highlight
two semi facing means my morphe same
spray dislike my scenes and spray all
the time this little shadow my eyelid
that's quite I almost did I shout and
try to wipe it away don't mind that
doesn't count not there
I hate doesn't even try to do that
that's my wrist I'm going to first
lightly align them with Matt chestnut
lip liner not too much I just I just
wanted to find my lip shape and you know
my lips down take my California blush
again just kind of try to stick with the
same theme I'm trying to make sure
everything ties in together and I'm
Prem's going to use that as a lip shade
looks pretty good I mean at one point it
looks kind of weird this point idealist
event but you'd ever see I'm going to
fix it so add a little more liner you
know just to bring more brown tones back
in there then take this pixie like
Norrish nourishing lip balm which is so
nice so nice man and I'm going to pretty
much put it on top cars or gloss that's
not really a cloth it's just really high
shine lip balm and it moisturize your
lips like crazy and yeah that's it for
the lips now I'm going to come I mascara
on imma try another little makeup pack
first time with my scare on and then I'm
going to take my Lorimer powder and I'm
going to look a little spoolie and then
put some of the powder on top of that
and this must make your lashes more full
I'm just trying out things that I've
seen people do not everything this video
I've seen people do by finger to do some
of this stuff and I felt try it for
never tried it before so I put the
powder on top of the mascara and then
I'm going to put another coat of mascara
on and I act so different because this
weight that is called Steeler mascara no
oh m'god pre for this Javad mascara
those shavon chain youths must to be
super light high in like super nice it
doesn't get your lash as full as you
think it would and so I noticed that
when I put on the powder on the mascara
back on top it definitely made a
difference full at least in my opinion I
used to mascara like every day so I've
noticed it and so yeah I guess I had
does work
all right so after that I pray myself my
face and I'm just going like fix his
hair it's a little flatter something
about these closures stole me off I
don't like it wrong um I should have
toned the knot but it looks like us
lifting off my head which is so weird
because the leg feels really flat and I
took my time on this wig it may surely
flat so I'm not sure I'll figure out you
know another video can go back now but I
just kind of bumped a hair out cut for
the look good I flipped it back and this
is the file looks let's enjoyed it give
it them some subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
