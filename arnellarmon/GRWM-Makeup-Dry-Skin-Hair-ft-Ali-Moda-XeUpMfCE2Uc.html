I'm going to take my joy cosmetics
daily treatment oil first and use that
before I put my moisturizer just for
extra extra moisture I love this oil
because it's super lightweight but it
really does a job and it smells good so
that's the plus then on top of that I'm
going to apply my favorite moisturizer
this the h2o + hydrating treatment and
like this to come effect in the form of
a gel so it's super duper it feels
water-based I'm gonna go on a limb here
and say it's water-based wherever the
case may be it is super moisturizing and
it's like on my favorite moisturize for
the winter so to prime my skin I'm using
when my favorite primers I'm pretty sure
you seen this before if you have been
subscribe my channel it's the lower miss
a radiance bronze primer I'm seeing this
cuz I mean it gives myself a really slow
those are the name so before seeing my
makeup I'm going to do my hair just a
little bit because I mean pretty simple
pretty easy and I want to put the cross
in and while the hair is still wet
now this hair come ally mode a hair I
actually got sent curling from them like
a minute ago but then I bleached
indicted and the curls were completely
gone so I will say that I'm their curly
hair it's nice it looks really nice I
think it looks really natural but it's
not hairy to bleach because is the curl
pattern will completely go away but I
mean I like how this looks when you're
looks really nice looks very natural
also got that scent there straight hair
so I'll be doing a review on both hair
texture soon but I mean a car until on
the overall review on the curly hair
because I've had it before and once I
believe to get the curls was gone but
this looks super nice so we're just
going to go with it
so foundation I'm using the NYX I don't
know what it's called but it's new okay
and I think it likes the dropper I don't
know what every other name I can spot it
and I still have it anyway that's the
sizes point so I'm going to use this
foundation because it is super
lightweight and it's like very liquidy
it's not creamy you guys can stack off
incense sticks yes my life has been
shambles as of like the last few weeks
but we'll get into that another time
this is pretty cool because like full
coverage will from when I see better
thing
I don't really have many likes cars so I
guess I can't say that with a hunch
percent accuracy but I still get covered
my skin really well and it felt pretty
opaque but I like that it's not heavy at
all
it kinda it's like a thinner version of
the cover FX was there call it the cover
dropped you guys know I'm talking about
like a thinner version of that so I
really like it and that's why I decided
to use it as a foundation I'm talking
too much so that's that
so the consume using the Kevin a qualm
concealer now I just got this maybe a
couple weeks ago I think it's the first
time using it a video so I'll clean up I
think about it I think it's awesome it's
super thick and creamy toes you kind of
have to like either blend the heck out
of it or if you don't want to be too
thick you have to like thin it out with
a couple so that's why I'm doing a news
miss oil by Mac um do we know which one
it is they fit me like two oils and I'm
using it and I put on my Beauty Blender
and I'm using that to blend up a
concealer because I mean well my skin is
very very dry and I mean my skin my skin
is drier than it's been in a while I
mean I know who my texture isn't picking
up on camera but like even under my eye
is kind of like textured and very very
dry so I didn't even want a thick layer
of concealer so I really just blended it
out as much as I could and I thought it
was really natural and nice I actually
really liked how it came out today and
it feels I feel like I don't have makeup
on to be honest but you're so super
lightweight
so the kongtong regions one long contour
stick episode used it um when I did the
video for them I really liked it so I
mean I've just been using it every
single day basically because I just like
the color I feel like it's like the
perfect contour sheet for me and it's
super even burned out I mean it's super
easy to apply so it's going to use that
to contour and then to set the places I
can filled which I'm only going to do it
on my eyes I'm using this chanel powder
now this is kind of similar to a
lemniscate powder except for it's a lot
more fine and I feel like you leave less
of like a white cast so I mean I like it
I mean it cost more but I like it and
I'm just playing a very thin layer on
just to make sure I set it just right
and now I'm going to like let it bake or
let it whatever you want to call it I
just simply said underneath my eyes and
I'm use that powder to set my entire
face usually I used like my Black
Radiance powder or another powder with
color but I wanted my niggas look as
natural as possible so I just use a
translucent powder to set my entire face
alright to contour I'm going to use this
cavity contour chin I'm going to take
this middle shade right here which is
like isn't a lot of shade but isn't
darker shade that's why it's in the
middle and I'm just going to like
lightly contour at that
um for blood typing that's on my Mac
I'll be doing really named they send to
me like the other day so I'm using it
it's a light pink it doesn't pick up
that much so you have to really really
dig your brush in it to make it like
show up and then you actually an
acquaintance with Jean I'm gonna fix it
later so like don't even worry about it
and then so highlight I'm taking this
girl laughs use highlighter and I like
it because it's like it's not glittery
highlighting it's like natural glowy
highlighting and voice are very natural
everyday look so that's why I use that
now I'm take this valley violet violet
Voss Holy Grail palette I'm going take
this like shade right here pretty basic
shade I'm just going to put that all
over my lid and that's the only I found
on my lid use ooh I don't feel like put
on my shadow I just feel like a really
nice warm transition type shade and I
put all of my lid and then I just keep
going it kind of makes it look like you
actually put effort into your eyes when
you really did it I just don't like
leave my eyes blink you know for my
scarib picking this one by Tarte
honestly I'm not a huge fan of it I
think it sucks I know they have better
mascaras than this I just kind of like
grabbed it excite never use it but I
mean that just me personally it could be
my lashes I'm not sure but that's my
opinion on it
I mean yeah it's okay I know how my lash
could look and they don't look how they
could typically looking ATS care of what
I mean hey we have to go with it so for
lips I'm going to lightly line my lips
with cork by Mac
and I'm use one of these new cat mangy
little lipsticks I'm unsure of a name
because like I said it's new but don't
worry ability I really like it I first
thought I would be too pink but it's
like the perfect mood
and because our like glossy lips i'm
taking this nyx lip gloss cause VIP is
just glam lip gloss aqua looks episode
on the tube and yeah who needs it to
place on top of the lipstick all right
so I'm not gonna rinse on my hair I'm
gonna give these live hands I'm just
going to pin down the side right here I
just I thought it'll make em look just a
little more natural click like my edge
look my edges were kind of spin compared
to the wig this is a link by the way so
I'm just going to like bobby pin it down
I guess just to make you look more cute
and just more like a style
and before I forget I'm going to set my
face you can just make a forever I think
it's like I don't know mists and shakes
after that was called but mostly stuff I
use in this tutorial is kind of new
because I've been like buying hoping to
make up lately but I'm going to just use
a semi face I'm gonna let it dry and
that is the completed look I think this
book is really nice like you know for
every day it's perfect for dry skin to
my skin I'm telling you guys like it
