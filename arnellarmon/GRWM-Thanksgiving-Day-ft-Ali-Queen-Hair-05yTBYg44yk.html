really am because it's like what's for
you guys I kinda want to be here right
now and you know me you know that I do
not like bloggers and youtubers that
kind of like shoot their fans like oh
yeah and because it's like if they

technically speaking so um yeah that's
why if you ever want to reach me
snapchat me cuz I literally put it
everyone on snapchat people are always
shocked like well I think you reply and
like yeah dude what's open it I'm
responding because then it's like I open
I don't respond that's ignoring and
that's me and I'm not a mean person
baby wait mom thank you for you guys I'm
thankful for my camera
I gotta feel with that thing for my
lights I'm thankful for a lot of stuff
thing for my mom they for everybody I
think for a lot of things okay I'll say
that all the dinner table I'm eating
thank for that food but um yeah hope you
guys enjoyed the video I'll see you guys
my next one which probably be tomorrow
you guys probably shopping but you're
not shopping at least we'll have
something to watch and yeah that's not
to say I'll see you guys later have a
great Thanksgiving
enjoy the food widows can I see enjoy
the family enjoy whatever we're gonna do
today enjoyed this video and I'll see
you later I'm so pissed I just did a
whole entire voiceover and the mic was
muted so was even recording thing
anyways I'm taking this got to be glued
now my hair looks really dry but I have
a natural hair styling routine whatever
you want to call it coming up soon
because I've just been wear my natural
hair a lot but yeah I'm gonna get a
brush and get the gel and I'm just going
to jail back my hair because I don't
want to leave any of my hair out well as
least as little mat as possible okay god
I don't want to talk okay I just smoked
a blunt things give me forgive me but
yeah I'm just brushing my hair back kids
don't smoke
I didn't say that and I'm just putting
the gel on because I just wanted to lay
flat before I put my stocking cap on
so yeah this is the wig I made now the
color it looks cool but it looks kind of
like not even that great and I use box
die l like link I'll put down the box I
use down below and it was like this just
week Claro brand and with box die if I
ever want a certain color I always get a
box die that's lighter than the color
that I want cuz bauxite a happy time it
doesn't really work so say I want this
color so I got a blonde box dyes so that
way I can get this color that makes
sense you just you have to get color
lighter than what you really need unless
you're doing black then I mean just get
black so I'm just party around try
figure out where I want to my part
Aibileen ox on my frontal so that's what
it looks so flawless but yeah this
here's an ally Queen on Aliexpress X I
did Black Friday so so click the link
below check them out there's pretty
decent like um how do I explain it I
don't say desync sexy like it like this
wig is one you guys are pricing me wear
a lot not only cuz I like the color but
it's just very easy to manage and
something about their frontal it's like
one of my most natural-looking frontals
yet and I haven't even customize yet
which by the way I will do video
customize this frontal because like I
said I'm gonna wear this wig like often
so I want to make sure it looks like
perfect so yeah I just part it down that
and then I'm going to pretty much glue
the perimeter using the gotta be gel and
I finally kind of gave the hang of that
so a video of that will be up soon - I'm
just took me a while it's kind of get
the hang of it but it actually looks
beautiful now while I'm on this hair the
only thing I noticed I did not like
Stiles making the wig and everything was
turning out pretty cool the 360 front
old 230 sister friend tried to cut it
once again maybe it's me but I feel like
this one's bigger than other ones I got
so I'll determine if it's me the frontal
what to make my other wig with other
front so I have but I was making the wig
and everything was turning out fine
until I got on my third bundle which had
the shortest amount of hair and noticed
of the tracks were thicker than the
previous bundles I use cuz all the
bundles for the most part were single
wefted but then one of the bundles I was
like okay it's thicker so it was like
double to almost triple weft it which I
don't like cuz I I do not like thick
tracks and I don't like to go to the
extra work of having to split them so
that's only problem one of the bundles
it was thicker than the other and I
guess that posed a problem because it's
like you want consistency when you
here you want them all to be great so
one thing I learned with this got to be
glue gel whatever the heck it's better
to do intersection so instead of doing
the whole entire thing I want wealth
easier for me to do it in sections I
think I kept messing up because I was
seeing other videos and I knows they're
doing the whole thing at once but I mean
if you're new at this it's just better
you're doing a sections and I'll go that
well I do a dedicated video video on
this but yeah I was just doing in
section by section just to make it
easier
once I'm done putting the gel on the
perimeter I'm gonna get my scarf and I'm
going to wrap it just to make sure it's
like really holding there it's just flat
so yeah they put my scarf on and then
I'll be on time makeup yeah why don't
make up I'm really not gonna talk too
much I know some get ready with me is
not everyone talk so I'm not gonna talk
I'll show you the product I'm using I
mean you guys see me just all the time
so yeah just if you want to list all the
products it'll be down below
Bobby says do my makeup and I'm gonna
speed this up and let you guys watch and
enjoy
all right so I do I make up now before I
even set my face and put lipstick on I'm
just gonna like figure out my hair
situation and I just kept it pretty
simple I just like fix that middle part
and then I flat on the top cuz a little
bit thick
now I am gonna go back and customize his
frontal I was just like I said earlier I
was too lazy today but don't worry video
would be coming soon on that
right so I put oil in my hair and I'll
put the scarf back on to make it more
flat and I'm gonna finish my face and
then yeah I'll pretty much be done after
that
so I went and I changed my shirt this
letters from the gap and it's super cute
and comfy god I wish we take pictures
looking into the picture of us right now

sweater for Thanksgiving because we're
corny why can we take pictures don't
