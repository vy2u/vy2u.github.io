by take my brows by an excessive Everly
Hills I'm just gonna fill in my
non-existent brows this probably the
longest part yeah my brows always take
the longest which is why I typically do
them before the tutorials but because
it's a get ready with me video yeah I
just have to you know follow the rule
and do everything in the video glue to
my brows just let you guys know my brow
tutorial will be up soon it's gonna be
amazing and I wasn't keeping a surprise
but I'm gonna do three broad swirls
actually I'm going to show you guys how
to do your brows with a pencil and then
I'm gonna show you guys how to do your
brows with a cream and then I'm gonna
show you guys head to your brows with a
powder because I understand that not
everyone knows how to work with each
product you know they're starting
brought tutorials where it's only with
the pencil you know and not everyone
likes pencils some people like creams or
powders so I wanted to do a tutorial
where I can show you how to use all
three you know I don't know I'm not sure
if anyone's done that yet but I haven't
seen it yet so I guess let me the first
one to do it
Trifield the majority of my brows the
brow is I'm gonna take my pro brow how
about uh sighs Beverly Hills and get the
shade Auburn and I'm gonna just kind of
fill in my brows a little bit more and
I'm a panda the tail of a q-tip I'll
explain why I do this in my browser
toriel and so for my primary being use
my cover effects illuminating primer now
this is a tutorial that is focused on
you know makeup for drier the skin so I
want to use illuminating primary you
know just to give my skin a little bit
of glow because when it's dry it can be
very dull
so I'm foundation I'm gonna be taking my
custom cover drops my cover FX mix on my
Mac face and body I'm gonna add a little
bit of Girl Meets Pro by benefit in
there to make it even more illuminate it
now if you want coverage I would suggest
putting your custom cover drops on any
blemishes you have before mixing with
the face and body that's what I do
because the custom cover drops are you
know it's a pure pigment so it will
cover anything pretty much so yeah if
you do want full coverage just use the
custom cover drops to cover any
blemishes before you mix it with the
face and body the reason I chose the
face and body foundation because it's
really hydrating but also because it's
very very like thin and when my skin is
dry I can get a little textured you know
can get a little bumpy and I feel like
when you have breakouts you shouldn't
use a foundation that's thick or creamy
you should use one that's either
water-based or very thin because when
use a cream on top of blemishes it just
makes them more you know noticeable and
you don't want that
until I'd be using my bare skin memory
mineral so this one so it's also very
hydrating and I'm gonna mix in my
maybelline instant age rewind and that's
just a bright him in because you know I
do want to look very highlighted but not
too much there's just a little you know
just a little can't look too natural
now to cocked one when you're using what
I always use Mary Ruby kisses through
the face creator and my contour is
pretty normal like all my tutorials like
I mean I pretty much do the same thing
you know I just put it on I'm spooned it
out
now the semi concealer i'm gonna be
using banana powder like always but i'm
gonna apply it differently now typically
when i put mine down to powder on
i just like put it on i kind of pile it
on and i kind of put on very thick and i
let it sit and then i brush it away but
instead of doing that I'm just going to
take a little bit on the sponge I'm just
gonna simply set it I'm not gonna let it
sit I'm not gonna pile it on I'm just
gonna put very little and I'm just gonna
set it underneath my eye I just want the
layer powder to be very thin because I
feel like the thicker the layer of the
powder is the more drying it is so yeah
you just want to put a very thin layer
so after that I set my face with my mac
mineralize skinfinish now this is a very
lightweight powder it's almost it's
almost translucent it just has a little
tint to it
now to apply my powder I'm using a
different burst than usual and I'll
shake that's a difference on this brush
it a little it's thinner than the one I
typically use so I typically use a
little more dense so it's less flexible
you guys will see in one second and so I
want to use a thinner brush so the about
the powder will apply lighter because
you know I feel like the more dense your
brush is the more heavily that powder
goes on your face in to apply my bronzer
I'm also going to use it thinner more
flexible brush so the bronzer goes on a
little more airbrush like
and like always after coming bronzer on
I go back over with the same brush used
to apply my powder just to diffuse that
and make it look seamless now for blush
I forgot to name by will include in the
description box what's why make it peak
and now it's a very like shimmery blush
you guys will see you see how to ask
that glitter on my cheek it's not so
much pigment in color but it does have
some type of illuminator in it and I
chose this blush because I want to look
as glowing as possible so I don't look
dry until then we give an anesthetic
contour kit and I'm just gonna brighten
up my under-eye just a little bit I
applied very little powder and I'm gonna
put a little bow my forehead and I'm
gonna take this star of this tutorial
which is my glow kit by Anastasia
Beverly Hills in that glow she just
released these a few days ago so I
really want to make a video showing it
off just so you can see just how awesome
it is so I took the two shades golden
bronze and dripping in gold and I mix
those two dripping in gold is a little
more it's definitely brighter I mixed
our golden bronzer to tone it down a
little bit because I wanted to glow by
they want to look too highlighted it for
this look
but trust me this kit your yeah it's
capable of making you look as
highlighted as you could possibly be I
just have the usual areas you know my
cheekbones my nose my chin and I do
apply a little bit above my brow bone
and a little about my forehead so then I
plan my mascara I use benefit they're
real
I didn't use any eye shadow for this
look because my lid does have a little
bit of X ma on it right now which is
super annoying but speaking I can love
you guys let me make a video on how to
get rid of the majority of it and how to
get rid of your scars from it let me
know because I will do a video on that
her lips I first lined my lips with a
color rose Brown by NYX and then just
pretty much laying in very lightly after
that I may take my gloves banana sauce
in Beverly Hills in the color Sunset
Strip that's pretty much it for the face
I kept it very natural the very dewy and
gluing now for here I'm just going to
take my wand from nume
this is my first time ever using this
wand so I kind of didn't know what I was
doing but I made it work and I could do
my whole entire head I'm just gonna curl
some parts of the hair that just needs a
little more definition in the front and
that's pretty much what I do I don't I
honestly haven't been doing my rope like
the whole head at all honestly for the
past week I haven't really did my hair I
just kind of like you know alter the
front a little bit just to make it look
like I did my hair but I'm really not
doing it at all
so after that going my annoying closure
with the launched make it lay a little
flatter and then you take your edge
control and just control your edges and
that's pretty much all I do when I'm
being super lazy and I don't feel like
doing anything extra to my hair and
that's pretty much the finished look oh
yeah
and you have to spray your face with a
little flakes plus of course oh no I
forgot that
and let's pretty much it sorry if my
voice is SuperDuper mellow it's pretty
late and I'm up editing and I'm kind of
tired and I can't make too much noise
but I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and stay tuned for my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
