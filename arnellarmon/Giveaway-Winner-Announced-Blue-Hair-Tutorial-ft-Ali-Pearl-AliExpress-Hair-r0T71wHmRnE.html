if you are new I want to make this into
a super sure so let's see if I can do in
like four minutes that's kind of long
but I have a lot to say okay I just dyed
this hair dyed it blue it's pretty nice
the hairs from Ali pearl on Aliexpress
if you guys want my snapchat you guys
know I showed the bundles they're
beautiful beautiful bundles they're
straight bundles I curled this if you
want to turn on this let me know because
it's like the quickest hairstyle you
could ever do in your life literally
five minutes now quickly review and Nitz
let me super quick socks you have
nothing bad to say um yeah because the
thing I do have to say it's and I
haven't really a bad thing the butters
are nice I've experienced no shiny no
tangling even after I bleached it um
it's beautiful you got to see it's very
silky after run my fingers right through
it you guys see I don't let the safety
much you guys see how nice it is the
only problem I had was with the 360
frontal and I'll list everything that I
used to make this wig down below um the
360 front oh I thought was a little too
big so I had to cut it and cut a section
out of it to get it to fit my head now
doesn't my decimal strap but I was good
depend on that and I flipped with a 360
front a little too big it's hard to so
with the wig if that makes sense
I'll make the Torah on you know doing a
wavelet 360 frontal is the first time I
ever even used one so it's pretty is
it's actually pretty easy so don't worry
about that but it's only problem I had
was that it was a little too big and
lose why I knew is a little too big is
because I've been sent 360 from some
other companies and once I got those I
kind of compared the two and I realized
that hey like these was a little more
smaller and they pipe in my hair a
little better so I was able to determine
if that one was a little too big but
that's only Palmilla had the hair to the
color really really nicely now the color
is blue however it does reflect um like
teal and green and light and that's
because I not toned the hair after i
bleached I just put the dye right in and
when you bleach share terms of weird
yellow color and when you mix blue and
yellow you get green so I'll insert
pictures of it in the natural life you
could really see what the hair color
looks like now one more thing I have to
announce my giveaway winner now you can
follow me you know I was going to

um yeah that's all I have to say this is
a pretty short interim really proud of
myself
um probably not to be too much talking
during the video it's gonna be a really
quick video just showing how I got it
here it's really simple because our I
did a video dine hair I'm gonna kind of
speed up the bleaching process because I
mean I don't want my videos become
repetitive anyway stay tuned because I
have a lot of videos planned I'm gonna
do a video on how to lay down your
frontal so that they ain't going nowhere
damn you're really not going anywhere
okay okay alright I respect you um a new
video on how to make a wig of the lace
front already have one up if you want to
watch it but I'm gonna update it so it's
better quality oh oh my god also videos
on more hair dye all that stuff I'm
talking a lot so let you guys see the
video if you guys like it give it thumbs
up if you don't sorry
I'll see you in my next one and
hopefully you like that one bye I don't
fucking goofy and I want tacos and or
Chadha and I'm really hot I gotta get
out of here
these lights are killing me man YouTube
is hard man you guys saved from these
lights I have three lights some
youtubers Elissa films just six lights
that girls cry
but yeah see you guys nicked for you so
I'm so sorry I'm uploading this so late
I just adopted two kids today so I was
really busy you know doing all that
adoption stuff it's so hard job de
cádiz many way is this the hair its
natural state I made a quick little wig
out of it and I got straight bundles
from Ali pearl all the details
everything to be down below and so I
have the bleach and the dye already in
the bowls because I had actually did a
test stream before I did the whole head
just see like how it come out before I
came into the whole entire thing so when
I believes his hair I didn't do sections
like I did the last time I bleached my
hair I just kind of just start from the
bottom work my way to the top and I just
let the bleach send the hair as a whole
instead of bleaching one section rinse
it out classify those too much work and
I feel like it's just easier to just
bleach the whole thing and then get
choose different dyes if you want that
ombre effect so yeah that's what I'd add
is please the whole thing I must be at
this process because I don't want to be
repetitive or boring and I mean I like
to keep my videos pretty simple and
straightforward so took little bleach an
entire head and yeah
you
so I let the bleach process maybe 10 to
15 minutes and I rinse it out and it
first looked and even like some parts
look lighter and darker than others and
so I let it air dry overnight I don't
wanna put any heat on it so I didn't
blow dry it and I'm looking like this in
the morning
so look much better and I was able to
see which part through darker and
lighter but overall I thought the color
was light enough for what I was trying
to go for so I didn't add any extra
bleach now I had three or like four blue
dyes and they'll all be down below um
honestly the two dyes too that are close
to each other the one I showed first I
thought they were different but they're
honestly pretty much the same I mean I
just mixed a few this dyed I'm showing
right now that's what I'm using the
roots and that's cause more pigment it's
like stronger diets where you like
Pravana and sparks so better quality dye
so I thought it'd be smart to use as as
at the root so the roots are like the
most pigmented and then I use like some
adored eye at the bottom and so with
this I just sectioned thin pieces that
way the dive fully coats the hair and I
pretty much at first I started from the
bottom and worked to the top and then I
discovered that it was easier to start
the dye at the top and it work to the
bottom so you guys will see me do it
it's honestly pretty simple you're just
putting the color on the hair and I'm
sorry that some of it is cut out I tried
different met them dyeing my hair I try
making the wig first then dyeing it
versus dying the bundle then making the
wig but I think I liked doing the bundle
because I felt like it was a better view
and you guys actually see it more so let
me know if you guys like that more I
think I'm gonna start doing that because
I this way I didn't really like filming
this way I just tried to do something
different
you
you
you
so why you bleach the bundles it's okay
to be a little messy cat in a day the
hair come your Diana anyway so it's okay
you messy you I wish the bundles but I
was more careful around the frontal part
I'll show you guys how I did the front
tool because I mean you want to try to
avoid getting any dye on the frontal or
it looks really bad so I zoomed up on
this and pretty much I part it very very
very part of my god I parked very thin
pieces and I just took the brush and I
just like put the color on it very very
lightly and very slowly that now it's
sped up so it looks like I'm doing
really fast but I was actually moving
pretty pretty slow now the only has
sucked is that because this dye was so
strong even when I rinsed it out it's
still tint the lace a little bit which
is very annoying but I'm not sure how to
avoid that honestly so yeah it's kind of
tricky but I guess the more I learn I'll
be to teach you guys how to avoid that I
just know that I did everything I could
to avoid getting the Dinah lid so I did
this process and it all worked out fine
but when I rinse it out it yeah it's
still tint to the lace maybe I'll rinse
it out like upside down next time so
none of the guys got the lace I'll have
to figure out another way to do it but
nevertheless the wigs do look nice so
so yeah this wouldn't look like once the
dye was all in the hair and imma show
you guys what looked like once I rinsed
out the dye so look pretty pretty blue
and then this would've looked like after
I blow dry too so you can see the hints
of teal in it and here's just a little
side view and insert few pictures of me
just in the hair and that's pretty much
any of the videos pretty simple pretty
straightforward you guys like my fields
like this let me know that what the hair
with flash this without flash so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you guys my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
