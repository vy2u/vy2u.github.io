hydrating primer I think that's the name
I know everything of hers is like locket
something but I'm gonna take this primer
I'm just gonna pry in my whole entire
face I did my brows on so just gonna pry
my skin first the foundation taking my
Sephora collection foundation now this
one dish is so underrated I used to use
foundation back when I can afford NARS
kept like $20 and I literally emptied my
whole entire bottle and saw that so far
I was like oh I want to use this again
and I'm happy about it because I just
love the consistency it's very easy to
blend and I mean the price point that's
what sold me so yeah if you can't really
afford your rate to foundation but you
still want something that's like not
drugstore this Sephora operations pretty
good I mean I like it so I'm Rick and
Minn didn't it
the Amber's I take that and blend it out
with the Beauty Blender
to conceal and taking my calves auntie
lucky concealer I'm not sure the shame
it'll be done below so look at that
everything's always down below yeah I'm
just going to conceal underneath my eyes
for my forehead my chin my nose pretty
much everywhere I was concealed
so once I'm done placed that can sit on
my face I'm staying blended out with the
damn Beauty Blender
so to confirm taking me Anastasia
Beverly Hills stick foundation in the
shade espresso and I contour my
cheekbones around my jawline my forehead
I'm also I come to my nose cuz I don't
know I feel like I've been ever enjoying
doing that lately cuz you could really
change the shape of your nose doing this
not saying I don't like my natural nose
I think it's pretty cute but I don't
know it's always fun just play with
makeup and try new things so that's what
I've been doing
they I'm gonna blend that out I'm gonna
take a little extra time my nose I think
it's with nose contour I never want to
be one of those people where it's like
well bad news contour so I always take
my most time on that cuz like man and
nose contour it's like everything you
just yeah so I take a lot of time on
this and yeah once I'm done with this I
will be back
sewing back now I'm taking my laura
mercier translucent powder like always
i'm just going to set the places i
concealed and then i'm going to go on to
the eyes so I did one AB camera and this
so I came up with I really liked it a
lot so here's how you can do it first
you need to prime your lids
you gotta get the prime right first with
this lemonade prime by benefit this is
my favorite primer and my eyelids
they're totally breaking out eczema like
they were skin kind of feeling thank God
you guys can't see that bill is very
very annoying doing this that's why I
like this prior because it's like the
perfect consistency it's not too thick
or too thin it's great if you get eczema
on your lids so yeah I'm gonna blend it
out and then I'm going to set that with
my translucent powder so now I'm like
yeah I can talk I'm gonna go into this
paddle of my make big shadows and I'm
going to take this soft little brown
right here don't worry that names me
below actually don't have the pallet
next to me so I don't know the names but
I might get this shade I'm gonna wash
that all over my lid
so to create that goddess II like I'm
serious look I get that shadow I started
bringing it towards my brows you know
like you guys see what I'm doing it's it
looks better when you watch it I kind of
bring that up towards my brows now I'm
going to take this slightly darker brown
or shade and I'm pretty much them go
over exactly where I put the first
shadow I'm gonna bring that into my
brows as well come try to like dark in
that area I don't know what like I don't
know yeah I don't know I just think it
looks great and it makes me look more
serious and God is like so that's why I
did it
next I'm going into my master palette by
Mario I'm taking this dark brown shade
right here because it looks like a warm
brown but accident goes on kind of like
dark than that I don't know I just want
to deepen that Brown so I took that and
I focus that a little bit under my like
liddie thingy my little hood thingy you
guys see what I'm doing that's so good
as lady things now I'm going to take
this really pretty shimmery gold color
as you can see on my other lid and I'm
gonna place all on my lid with my mixing
medium because I've hooded lids so if I
don't use this stuff it's gonna get all
over my hoods and I mean I want my hoods
to be okay and glitter free so that's
why I use this stuff so like sixteen
dollars at Mac get it but yeah I'm just
placing a shimmer my lids
now I'm taking my liquid sugar by eye
candy cosmetics also good pretty lips
I'm gonna get this glitter buy these
make it forever it's really pretty gold
glitter and I'm going to place on top
weigh put the shimmer to make it more
gold that's what you use gold glitter
for see I'm gonna place it on top and
then it's got to dry a little bit then
we'll go back to the eyes and do that
blue stuff now for the blue I'm taking
these two blues right here this matte
blue in this shimmer blue not sure why I
chose to do that I just noticed I want
to mix the shimmer in a little bit it is
kind of deepened the pigment of the blue
and I placed that in my waterline will
under my lash line but close to my
waterline and um yeah it's kind of
frustrating to copy it into my eyes and
for some reason I'm going to push a
dough under my lash line it's very
annoying it always it always gets to my
eyes I don't know what that's about
maybe have to change the brush but even
when I use a different brush still does
it I just I don't know if it's me but
whatever the case might be
I'm putting the blue shadows on my lid
then I would take this blue eyeliner and
now I start talking about it before I
even show it on the screen its vitality
deluxe and it's two dollars all this
stuff is like two dollars and they have
the best eyeliners and lip liners I've
ever tried their lip liners are better
than Mac yeah I said it they're amazing
they're so creamy and pigmented it makes
no sense like the price yeah they're
amazing so next time take this pick me
by makeup addiction cosmetics and like
this teal pigman I'm just gonna place
that like in the corner of my lower lash
line so you I don't know I just want a
little pop and I felt like it will give
me that and it did so that's what I did
then I'm gonna pop a hooter Beauty
lashes and bam got those on I did not do
lashes on cameras you guys you guys
should know that by now
I'm trash anyways I'm gonna set my face
using my spa focus power black radiance
like always and yeah well I'll come back
when I'm doing the other stuff I believe
I'm gonna do contour next I never know
that's right I'm contouring next I'm
editing this view like a day later so I
don't remember how I did everything but
I am taking my hoola contour by benefit
like always gonna define my nose contour
just a little bit not too much to find
that cheek contour and I'm also going to
define my Cupid's bow because I like how
that looks oh it looks like I'm going to
put a little bit that bronzer underneath
my lips cuz I like how that looks it
makes your lips look bigger so I mean
that's what I want
and then yeah we're just gonna go on to
more contour I don't remember doing this
I'm taking another soft focus powder I'm
just doing this to warm my face to the
hoola bronzer is a little cool tone so I
want to be a little more warm in bronzy
cuz that's what goddesses are and I'm
taking this flush by Mac it's called
peach twist doesn't show on camera but
it's like a radish pinky tone with gold
in it and I'm just going to dust that on
my cheeks kind of blend that into my
contour to make it look real seamless do
highlight take my Mac oh darling to be
honest I'll you grab this cuz it match
the backdrop of my eyes by later added
more exciting like it didn't pop enough
like I don't even know what that was
about but you know what I think God is I
think highlight and this one was okay
but I added more later because you guys
know like if it's not blinding you what
am I wearing it for so goofy right now I
don't know why but my lips look a little
red because I almost went red lipstick I
was like nah fam it's too fourth of July
II so took that off now I'm lighting my
little another tired leg how your deluxe
lipliner in the shade brown eyed to
sharpen a little bit and yeah back in
lying it and I'm yeah make my lip color
was pretty tricky because my lips turned
red from the liquid lipstick I use
either tone that out so I'm taking honey
love by Mac to kind of mute my lips now
I'm gonna get polished up by Mac and
guys like this color is awesome if your
brown skin use this with chestnut lip
liner you fall in love trust me I know
these things but um I list a little too
nude for me so I'm taking this black
radiance lip liner I don't think has a
name it's like a number but it's a brown
lip liner I'm just going back over that
deep in my lip line not too much because
I feel like my eyes were already a lot
but I want to be there and I'm taking
this gloss by the balm cosmetics like my
favorite golden gloss I'm gonna place it
on top and that's what I did from my
lips looking good thumbs up now I gotta
go do some of my hair I'll say I didn't
do anything I just wet and I put on a
necklace and bam I'm looking more
goddess but I decided to get that same
gold pigment that's on my eyes and I put
on my lips and it was beautiful okay I
mean what do you guys think it just
totally gave the look even more looks
you know I'm feeling myself trying to
give my angles that's why I notice
something wrong you know I'm not glowing
enough so I took this glow kit baddest
hacia and I just packed that stuff on I
used like more peachy shade honestly I
showed on camera buying AB dip into
every single shade there was so I was
really trying to make this happen and
yeah I just brushed that everywhere I
was like you know what I gotta go I have
to I must blind them because I'm evil no
I why am I so goofy you guys I don't
know what's wrong with me I'm sitting my
face my slate I stand spring and we are
