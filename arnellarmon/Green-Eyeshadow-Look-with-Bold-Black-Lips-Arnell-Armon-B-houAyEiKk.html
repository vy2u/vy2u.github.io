be filming another talk-through today
because I learned that from doing top
thirds it's so much easier to edit
because when you edit um today when you
don't do talked throughs you have to do
voice overs which takes so long so I
like talk to you let me know if you guys
like them so first I'm gonna take my
primer I'm using this hydrating part of
my Kat Von D it is feels really really
great on my skin I music probably about
three times now I bet you there was she
sent the products to me Oh
oh my god my hair everything else into
my hair which by the way this is the
same curly wig I made I just want curled
it and I was so impressed with how the
hair took the curls
love hair so much I just wanna keep
making wigs over the rest of my life
oh speaking of wigs I wish they're
selling them but I have to find out my
price to first I have to figure out you
know what's reasonable for you guys
bottle what's reasonable for me because
way to sob let me tell you they're
they're they're very time consuming take
something's five to eight hours or so
fixing my prices figuring out what I
want to charge on what you guys know
where they know for foundation I'm using
the Kat Von D lock a tattoo foundation
in the shade medium 62 warm
so for consumer you also using more
caveny products I'm using this concealer
the left concealer cream in the shade
d31 warm and I'm using wite-out I'm
gonna show you guys what this concealer
does cuz it's awesome it's amazing
so first I'm in concealable guys and win
that out forehead to you so let's put
this out first
okay so now that's play that I'm gonna
put right out on one side just to show
you guys like how cool it is you only
need about three dots probably two and a
half
you guys are the difference it's so much
more great if this I have cameras a
little bit forehead my nose my chin I
had to cos the scene because they were
sirens the background and I I felt like
it was too distracting but you got to
the difference that the white concealer
makes me add to your concealer so if you
wanted this and that go ahead it's
awesome I like having control over how
bright my consumer gets like even if I
want it brighter I can add more white
and make it brighter now I don't want to
do things I don't like cats get ready
I'm just saying that's cool to have that
option now to come tour I'm going to use
the Ruby kisses 3-phase creator but
instead of level like 13 12 which is
what I was used I'm using level 14
because I want a more intense contour
okay are my freaking cheeks cut or what
I'm having a blend any further probably
should okay I'll do it
hmm I don't want to bleed too much
because I wanted to be there you know
but I thought was good back over a
pallet or so and be safe and sorry or
just good enough for me okay now I'm
going to stagnate my eyes on my forehead
my nose in my chin
whoo am i I'm just like I'm totally I
want to look beat
that's what I'm going for pileup on the
cake eat it too all right now that I've
got done do whatever I just did to my
face I'm gonna go do one off the camera
and I'll be back to do the second I okay
so did this I have camera as well as my
brows I love my girls came out I
typically don't do them bolding works
I'm on this natural these look nice so
now time to do this side so first we're
taking my lemonade primer by benefit and
just put it all over my eyelid
what I'm doubling that element take a
translucent powder and just set that
Oh
so now I'm using a few different she'll
stay from different brands the first
pound Muniz was a Tartelette by Tarte
I'm going to start by taking the shape
up flower child in smartypants
which of these two sheets right here
okay now I'm going to take this blush by
matcom devil and it's a really nice warm
orange color and I'm going to place at
my crease

Mac and put it all over my lid
now I'm going to take this make me
shadow called gesture and plays on top

last look was dramatic I don't know I
just like this look is alright smoky and
dark so I don't think any lashes so set

lids or my crease this bright orange
threat love that blah blah this bright
orange blush by Mac you're not going to
