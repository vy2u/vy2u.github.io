new welcome I'm second filming this look
now I did this look the other day well
like something similar to it but long
story short I'm not using I move anymore
because I'm just like I have to upgrade
my lifestyle so I'd like literally cast
on a Final Cut Pro and a new camera
yesterday and I'm just like you know I'm
but just upgrade all my quality next
thing is lights but I'm not buying them
just yet but pretty much down with
Hanukkah Pro so I had to like delete
iMovie because it's taken up space and
so I was heading the look I did and I
had different hair and everything and in
the video I'll insert clip right here
and insert Clinton's I don't have the
French anymore scratch that belongs - or
the flares I've deleted
God long story short and it's like to
redo the look back to change something
attends a lipstick because I just
thought that I don't know I looked
through a listing Jordan I just saw this
color first like I thought that'd look
good with that I would go with the vibes
and I liked it much more than the
lipstick I originally had which is like
a it was like a warm matte brown the
gold lipstick so I really like this much
more and I'd like the look how I did it
I made it much more easier excited music
tape my eyes I just like I told like way
more than their original look to begin
with so yeah um I edit this video with
Final Cut Pro so let me know if I get a
good job I still don't know what I'm
doing it's very foreign bomb like I paid
300 for this I got a learn like some way
or another so um yeah I hope the video
is nice because enjoy it if you do
please give a thumbs up if you're not
subscribed already please do so right
now I'm gonna make you start inserting
my Instagram or snapchat and all other
stuff that cool youtubers do what's
learn how to do that but it's in the
description box if you want to like
follow my other stuff to you and I'll
see you in my next video which I'm not
sure what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna do
something and I'll see you guys later
I did one eye and my eyebrows off camera
just to make this video faster than what
it would have been if I didn't do my
when I have camera so I'm gonna take my
limited cry my benefit I love this
prayer because it works grandma I'll
it's even when I'm breaking out eczema
so that's how I always use it
and the PAL I'm using today had to put
this slow-mo but it's going slower than
I thought it's okay it's okay
it's about to happen like right now I'm
using the naked smoky palette which is
actually an amazing palette I love it so
I'm going to start off with this like
white shade and I'm used as a base on my
eyelid as a base
okay and I'm type of shade next to it
which is like a soft pink shade you
won't even see a huge difference and put
on top of the white just to add some
warmth and just get that color going
down I grab my tape light is V dizzy I'm
going to place it where I think it
should go I always mess up it only works
when you do both at the same time if I
did one eye first and the other after I
always place a tape in the wrong
direction I don't know how it just it's
kind of hard unless you're a genius
so I'm take the palette and it's broken
by the way and I'm going to get this
brown shade
okay brush put is the right one this
brown shade this gray shade I mix the
two together I like mixing shadows
because I'm not an expert eye shadow
person and so I feel like when I mix the
shadows it makes my life much easier and
it's a great beginners trick because
you're less likely to mess up when
you're mixing a darker shadow with a
lighter shadow because that way the eye
doesn't automatically go off like to be
too dark if that makes sense so if you
mix with the lighter shadow it's just
it's less mistakes okay like it's like
Mendham or Anupa to come to eyeshadow
and I'm just like winging it out and by
the way the brush I use will be down
below or maybe I'll turn in this video
if I could figure out how to edit that
into it oh and I'm taking this black
shade mixed with another gray shade
because I do not I never going on my
eyes with just black alone I always
build it up but yeah um I know that
began comment saying hey my brush do you
use and I'm sorry and honestly I just
don't mean knowing but I'll insert them
or I'll put them somewhere you'll know
and so I'm gonna get this mixing medium
which is great for the lids and I'm
gonna play some eyes first and then I'm
going to take this shimmer shadow which
I just pointed to like five seconds ago
and that's gonna be my lid color mixed
means a mix you need make some mediums
awesome if you have paint lids because
it keeps the shimmer from moving
anywhere so hey I love it's like sixteen
dollars at Mac so get it yeah the key to
mixing medium to work is you have to put
the mixing meme in the shadow then the
mixing medium on top of that to seal and
the shadow I can't see the comedian then
we get those two dark shades again the
green the black and I'm gonna go over
kind of the corner if I didn't want my
whole lid to be that light and so I'm
just you know you're gonna look better
I'm gonna take this TARDIS liner I like
this line but then I don't I wouldn't
recommend if you're not an extra
eyeliner user because almost too liquidy
and too pigmented to wear you you really
have no room for mistakes honestly like
you literally don't so if you're on an
expert eyeliner person which I'm not
Saul you know why I'm using it then I
wouldn't use this one because if for
experts so now I'm struggling take off
the tape finally did it and now I am
just going back over and just fixing any
mistakes I made and try to perfect the
liner and just you know fixing a
mistakes I need
all right now come strong face I'm
taking my Mac strobe creams white pants
on show up with my camera so I mean oh
maybe I'll shut my new camera
we'll see I'm gonna take this I'm gonna
use that to prime my skin Mac strobe
cream is kinda like it's very
moisturizing get your skin like a very
nice blue or needy foundation by
honestly like when you guys have a
foundation like I doubt the glow even
shine through but I mean can't change
now so yeah let my face then I'll be on
to my foundation
all right foundation I'm using the curve
X natural finish foundation the shade
g70 I'm uses Tarte many blending which
is actually super bomb now this
foundation looked way dark on me but
that's cuz it's winter and I'm more like
pale right now so that's why I look
crazy
and if Alyssa's watching this she's make
why you use way too much foundation
because I you gotta see I'm gonna show
my hand I have way too much foundation
and it was it was looking kind of
shambles but I fixed it so that's all I
matter so for concealer well let me
bring my foundation out first in then
we'll move on to kazoo it to can see i'm
using the maybelline fitme concealer
which is like their eye favourite lately
and so i'm going to conceal in my eyes
of course concealed underneath while for
my contour on my forehead on my chin
now i put a lot of concealer on because
i wanted it to kind of mix it with my
foundation that way it could tone down
how dark my foundation was and so you
got to see like Afridi's and sealer it
totally made my foundation look more
wearable
and Here I am fix my eyeliner yang I got
concealer on it and I kind of fixed my
eyeliner throughout this whole entire
video because it just wasn't perfect to
me I shouldn't use a different eyeliner
I really like the LA girl eyeliner and I
mean it's cheaper too so I'd recommend
that one especially for beginners
because it's really foolproof this one
like I said it is just it it squeezes
out too much liquid at once so it's more
likely to be messy it's almost too wet
like oh my god I don't even know like
that was such thing but yeah fixing that
up and then I'm gonna just gonna
continue blending out my concealer
so to set the place I can see I'm use
this Maybelline shine-free loose powder
and I mean use this I've used prior like
five times oh and I actually really like
it it's actually really good primer
primer oh my god Pellatt err okay
y'all's on the right track it's awesome
like I I'm not sure if I quite paired to
UM why can I not why can't I talk I
don't know if I can pair to my lure
murmur powder just yet but I haven't
using it a lot and I think it's awesome
so set my whole face i'm using the mac
studio fix powder in a shade in c-45
that's my shade if it helps anybody am
show some old tired face
so to define my calm time using my hoola
benefit bronzer and I'm just going to
define the contour my cheeks and pull it
on my forehead and I'm gonna put a
little on my nose just to kind of like
give my nose a little definition
for blush amuses one by the balm
cosmetics called hound stew
whatever that is or whatever it means
I'm using it's like a soft pink um it
can't be darker but I mean I put on very
lightly because I mean lately I haven't
been a huge blessed person however I do
like to use this was in the winter
because I get the really pale and washed
out so I really need some warmth back to
my face now I'm gonna use this Tarte
highlighter palette I just got in the
mail today and they sent me a freaking
Easy Bake Oven you guys like who even
does that but this pallets bomb and you
ever see this highlights bomb ice when I
first open the palette I was not wow I
was like Oh key but then i swatched them
I was like okay that problem I faced and
I was like okay like it's really bomb
because it's like it's weird because
they look powdery they almost look like
me patchy but if they go on really
really smooth I like the fun they don't
sit on top of your skin they it's just a
really great highlighter I was actually
impressed by this so of course I just
had my whole entire face
because I make I'm using this L'Oreal
infallible spray which I don't like
so I am using silver spray I forgot
right and I'm add another spray but I
like this one because uhm how it sprays
out it sprays out like small pieces of
setting spray and thick your pieces of
setting spray so ends up looking like
someone splash wine in your face sign up
getting this Ruby kisses one to spray on
top so that way my makeup didn't look
like blotchy
all right so now I'm putting my mascara
on it's the Tarte TARDIS mascara the
clip cut changed because I ended like
pausing the recording till in my face
dry um yeah just put my scare on and I
at this point in the video I do not plan
on wearing lashes because like I'm too
lazy and I'm gonna keep them on so yeah
next I'm gonna line my lips using Mac's
quark lipliner what is it cork like that
cork lip liner and then I'm going to use
this lip gloss by NYX that I have in my
pocket so let's pull it out to figure
out the name by the time it pops up on
screen I'm gonna use this intense butter
gloss and it is called cinnamon roll
that's totally even it's like totally
goes the gloss cuz it looks like a
cinnamon roll that's cute I like that
name that's a really cute name
now I'm trying to situate my hair I
really didn't do not like this frontal
only because it's like I thought once I
bleached it will look more natural but
even if I did it just it looks too party
to me but whatever okay so I put out
more highlights on by the way the hair
information will be in the link below
because I mean the texture is really
nice but the frontal I think I bashed it
I think it's my fault so yeah I put on
more highlight because it's like this
highlight like I said it's amazing I
just want it a lot more on and then what
the hell of my brow bones that
completely brought the look together it
looks so much better and I hardly ever
do this so I think that's why it makes
such a huge difference
all right so I'm not prepared to my
slo-moes I think okay this looks kinda
nice but it's just like deep down inside
I knew I was being lazy and I knew I was
better off putting lashes my knife
showed it but I was thinking it right
now so I put on lashes BAM these hooded
view lash like that they're like the
only ones I really really like my hoodie
beauty and after that um I was pretty
much done I read just to my hair this is
the natural state I literally just
washed I just let it air dry just to see
how it would form and I'm yeah this is
pretty much it I'm sorry I'm uploading
this pretty late um I had to take my
little kid to the vet today to make sure
she's okay she's a little cold so that
cut took like almost two hours out of my
time however I'm happy that I posted it
so I'm happy I'm finding using a better
editing software so hopefully when I get
my new camera like want to look after
the sky this isn't a movie but I hope
what I give a new camera my whole life
changes or else I spit like a thousand
dollars on nothing but yeah if you guys
