welcome so if you guys want to be on how
I died by now enjoy hair color as well
it's how I dyed my clip-ins to match the
color perfectly now these clippings are
from her given hair if it sounds
familiar it's because I viewed their
bundles before and I'll link that video
dummy local fair but was actually really
nice so I got the same as that texture
in clip in forum because I thought it
would match my nads her hair perfectly
but it didn't and so like got the clip
ins and I realized that my curl patter
is different the kinky curly I decided I
don't know why I thought of a match I
decided to dye my natural hair and then
dyed my clip into looking match
perfectly
I don't know why decide this I just I
simply want to dye my hair and I mean
that's I came up with this so I dyed my
hair first because it will be easy for
me and I'm a natural hair and then get
my clippers to match then it will be for
me to dye my clippings and get my
natural hair to match so I do mine a
shower first and I dyed it clip-ins the
same exact way that's how able to get
this pretty much going to be identical
and so the clippings come a kink early
however because the texture and it
matches my natural hair in the way I
thought it would I really struggle
trying to style this and you guys to see
out insert into the end and so and of
strain it this morning
and I just used them as fun fillers
because I try to click the clip them
into the back of my hair I think I'm
making it my hair braids at first before
I try to use clip pins because my hair
my hair curly is already too thin for me
to clip in clipping so my hair straight
is even more thin and more silky and so
the clip and they were not sticking in
my hair put it that way
and so I kind of struggled but you know
this sound looks for me I'll try to find
other styles as well and a B maybe I
make a video on it but I already do have
a video at least on
Bin's and so I'll link that below as
well but if you want to know more about
this hair and how I got this coloring
more about my hair and how I got this
code that gatina watch this video I will
say that I would appreciate if I got no
negative rude comments about me dye my
hair as in today this hair is on my head
not your so what I do with it
should not cannot necessarily concern
you but it should not cause you to leave
in negative comments when I first post
on Instagram I dyed my natural hair I
got a lot of like the motherly feedback
and it's like a motherly innocence words
like only my mom could be should be talk
to me that way and I don't normally need
that you know like I don't really care
for it and then the day I dyed it to my
hair it still it's curly it's still
healthy
I love this color a lot and I'd love it
as well cuz I keep being asked about it
so it took me like two weeks to three
weeks even posted the video as it is
because I was now my dueling negative
comments for hearing post in it so i'm
destinee only negative comments a no
tell me what i should have done or could
have done I mean I did it and that's
that
why not I'm always different color my
videos house even Jolly Rancher anyway
so malicious watch this video if you
enjoyed you find helpful be sure to give
this video a thumbs up please subscribe
and I'll see you guys later
alright so first I did a test Ram never
no one was in my life I was like you
know this is my natural hair and I'm
finally a girl so I was like you know
I'm not gonna destroy it so I did test
trend and figure out the kind of color I
want it now my hair is dirty and that is
because I did not wash my hair and
that's conditioner my comb
I didn't wash my hair it's a good dish
oh it's bleach
oops anyways I didn't wash my hair
before this because I heard that it's I
didn't want to like strip my hair its
natural moisture with shampoos so I just
brushed my hair out for my nose gelled
down and just you know kind of
processing this blond brilliance
developer well bleach powder and
developer and so I put the powder in
first I make a lot of weird face in this
video by the way this powder it's not
really good and I mix it with the
developer and developer is five-volume
developers so I mixed five I mixed a
little
date of 20 because when I first bleached
my hair I noticed the five took a little
long so I mix a little tiny bit of 20 if
your Diner natural hair bleaching it do
not use no 42,000 developer that's why I
uses you which is why whenever I bleach
my hair it always get messed up so I use
majority 5 with a tad bit of 20 just to
speed up the process and I just apply
that all over my head
now you generally want to you know
generally want to dye the tips of your
hair first then the roots but me I'm so
impatient honestly when you when you do
like that you have to go professional
because it's much easier for another
person to do it on you than it is to
yourself because I'm applying the bleach
like a conditioner damn near it was just
much easier you know if I ended up going
back in to dye my roots darker anyway so
I mean this is how I did it if you go to
professional there and do it differently
I just I wanted to have the patience I
did but I'm just simply not that patient
and because I was using the 5 volume
developer for the most part with a
little 20 it didn't process as fast and
usually does you know because like I
said I used to bleach my hair I used for
TiVo developer and I when I tell you my
head would immediately start burning I'm
also using different brands I would not
do this with BW to a quick glue I do not
like those brands of bleach especially
for natural hair use one that just cost
a little more that is just more
professional if you feel it I'm saying
so I like that process and I rinse it
out I don't want to like go to light and
then I toned it I use a t15 toner I try
to show the box of the box didn't show
up in camera so I cut that part out but
it's T 15 by Wella and that information
will be down below as well so I told him
to get rid of the yellowness I didn't
get rid of all the yellowness but I want
to at least you know tone some of it out
and um yeah I just I didn't want to look
too yellow cuz in the past I bleached my
hair I didn't know about toner back then
and so I bleached my hair and I think it
looks cute when it will look super
yellow and just not appealing so tone
then you rinse it out and then this one
looks like it looks pretty similar but I
did turn out something yellow and you
guys will see that when my roots dry a
little bit but um I still have my curls
as you get since
I just actually filmed a video on
straight to curly I don't know which one
will go up first but my curls are still
very much intact so don't even worry
about it
look at my roots and those at this point
I knew I had to put a freaking sally's
because I was like no like now I have to
put color on top and so you guys see my
roots I toned down mostly yellow that's
my roots look a pale blonde but this is
not gonna work for me so I went to
Sally's sponsor me and I got these dyes
that actual names me down below so this
is a dye and use for my roots this is a
slightly darker dye they're both caramel
colors which is why my hair is like a
caramel color now they're more on the
caramel east side you know cuz I wanted
my hair to be like light and it's
interesting though because when I first
dyed my hair Oh Here I am I just put the
dark color on the roots and then I make
a part and then I'm just only put on the
roots and I was very patient with this
part so I want to look nice but I was
saying ooh
umm what was I saying crap I forgot oh I
wanted to be light and what was
interesting is that the first two days
it looked dark like and I was like what
the heck I just bleached my hair dyed it
for no reason but it's almost like over
time it got a little lighter so I
thought that was pretty cool
anyways I do my roots first and then as
a process it's gonna turn a little red
but it's not actually read some more
caramel II that I take the second die
and I put the second die on the tips of
my hair and you know the name will a bat
will be down below I'm moving pretty
fast that's kind I want this video to be
super long because not only do I die my
dad your hair if I die my clippings as
well so you know I'm just trying to move
fast but I dyed my roots first and then
I do the tip so I'm not gonna show
myself do the whole entire head because
I took a very long time I just want you
guys to get like a general idea of what
I did and so I rinsed that out and then
I put a deep conditioner in the hair the
hair my hair I'm please talking my wigs
and I just let that sit I'm gonna put a
cap on my hair I'm saturating my hair
deep conditioner by the way you want to
deep condition the heck I'm here after
you bleach it and I wouldn't put a
processing cap on top and then I wore
the cap as I was dyeing my clip-ins
you know I just Ward until it was
ready to rinse it off so that's what I
did and now we're out of clippings
it's a clippings come in this box it is
from her giving hair I work with them
before I really like their hair a lot I
was so sad that the clippings were so
kinky like I love the bundles ma'am and
just stick with their bundles their
bundles they're bomb but clipping for me
honestly they hardly ever work and it's
like I know oh by the way you get extra
clips in this box you get the bundles
and then you just get instructions and
you know same old same old from last
video but clippings never work for me
and it's cause my hair texture and it's
like when I whenever I request clippings
I know deep down not gonna work but I
try to make my work each and every
single time if you have thin hair and
you want clip is to work Bellamy has a
product it's on their side it makes your
hair like stiff and that's the only
thing I have ever used I actually kind
of helped the clip and stick if I no
longer have that which is why I struggle
and so I cut the bundle open I take
those little press things out so I'm
able to say like look at the clips and
how many like tracks I have and
everything you get two clips with five
you pretty much get two pieces with five
I believe two piece with four I think if
three pieces with three and like one two
piece clip something like that I'll try
to put the exact details below I always
forget but you get it enough to like
pretty much fill up your entire head
I would like I do with my hair i did a
test bundle andand this does not the
same color as my hair and that's gonna
has products in it but once this dries
it matches my hair color perfectly when
i first dyed this as i was like oh crap
like you know like I ruined it it does
not look just like my hair but trust me
it does it does it works okay and so now
I have to bleach the clip in so I'm
going to use this ion bleach I'm use for
t-value developer because since is not
my real hair I use a stronger bleach
because will help process it faster and
so I mixed the powder and the bleach
whisk it up and then I have that mixture
now I put my gloves on because getting
bleach underneath your nails on your
hands it stings I hate it I always the
bleach of myself whenever I'm doing
bleach and I put a piece fold down I
start to bleach these clip-ins and now I
am going to pretty much saturate each
little piece of hair and bleach them and
wrap it in foil and the foil it's gonna
help the process much faster and I'll
show you guys exactly what happened when
the hair is ready to be rinsed out in
one second
when the hair is ready to rinse out
you're gonna see it start to steam
that's how you know it's done like it's
processed the color is lifted you guys
see the very very blond until that's
when I take it to rinse it out
now you guys see the curl pattern still
there it's still looking good so now I'm
gonna take the leftover die for my roots
I'm not gonna waste and I'm gonna take
the same exact dye and I'm gonna just
put more in in you know add more
developer just you know make it spread I
don't waste dye you guys guys too
expensive
speaking of dye I want to go buy some
more dye I like dicks to buying hair dye
that's another story
and so I you know make that make sure
you know do my thing and I use 25
developer because you know it's a darker
color you don't want to like do a super
strong developer that's not necessary
next I'm gonna mix my other dye and
these are bought by Wella one is in a
form of a cream and one is a liquid but
it's like it's the same line of guys
just different texture and so I get this
dye and I am going to mix it in a bowl
and this is gonna be for the tips of the
hair I'm really doing exactly what I did
for my real hair I'm just using
different developers because like with
my real hair I have to be more gentle
with it of course so just using
different developers and then I'm going
to start depositing the dye onto the
clip-ins just like I did with my real
hair
the clip-ins I rinsed it out and now I'm
putting some hair milk in them because I
want them to stay moisturize I did
bleach this oh I also put on the
camiolos products and as well so I
bleach it and I want it to you know of
course stay moisturize you want treat
like your weave and your bundles like
you treat you real hair so now I'm going
to show my self style this hair real
quick so I think you'll be born if I
don't show at least one style and so
when I did how to clip-ins curly I did
two little buns you guys know me and my
buns and I also did bangs and the reason
why I show this because I want you guys
to see how well the clippings belen with
my hair while they're curly you guys
seen in the beginning the video that the
clippings blend perfectly with my hair
while they're straight but I wanted to
show you guys how they blend curly as
well
all right so I'm like in my last video
of my clip-ins I just put my hair in two
little buns then I grab the clips I grab
the longest ones the one with five clips
I believe five or four I don't do these
with the ones with three because I mean
it's kind of pointless the longer ones
of course have more hair which means
they'll add more body and so I just you
know wrap it around and then I wrap it
around and it's super simple
yeah pretty darn easy and as you can see
it matches my hair now it's let the
clippings match my hair even more now
it's almost like the die had to take
time to settle into my hair it's really
really weird I can't really explain it
but some of them at my hair even more
now that the dye has really set onto my
hair but this is a pretty easy style
that I want to show you guys I'm going
to insert a few pictures of what the
hair looked like before I did the style
so here's what the clippings look like
with my hair before I put in the buns
and it was not blending the right way
and so that's why I did this bun stab
feels super easy and it was just easier
it's like foolproof you know and then I
was able to strain the clip-ins and the
reason why I was able to straighten it
so silky is because I put perm rods in
them first which stressed the curl
pattern out and so they strain like a
dream so I hope you did enjoy this video
if you did please give it a thumbs up
please subscribe and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
