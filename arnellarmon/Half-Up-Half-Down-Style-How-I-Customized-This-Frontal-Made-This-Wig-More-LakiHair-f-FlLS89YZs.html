need welcome today's video is going to
be on this wig it's good little
everything because I learned from
watching other wig videos that I like
seeing a little bit of the entire
process and so I figured maybe you guys
are like that too and so I tried to
include you guys know I usually don't
show myself making the wig on or that
stuff I try to include a little bit of
like everything of course nothing but a
full blown like here's how I make the
wig by the trifle snippets you guys see
the entire process if I do
and so this hair some wacky hair and
lucky lucky I'm I just insert in the
screen I love this shirt um and I've
worked on it before I'll insert the link
to that video don't you looks I like
that video as well it's a really great
video and so I wanted to make for us are
you know the hair is nice this hair is
that specifically night it's really nice
honestly like the most basic hair you
get it's your average Brazilian body way
I've got it long I got 24 inches let me
stand up my phone do not disturb um it
is 24 inches long so goes all the way
down to like my waist yeah oh that was
my waist and they asked me can I do a
video on how to do like a half up half
down style what is sure that's how I do
but then I'm like so in love with the
front one how natural look I just want
to be down like this guy thought it
looked very cute and natural like I
really took my time on this and of
course I don't know that I showed you
guys how I bleached my frontal have I
told you the knocks on my frontal how I
customized this frontal and how I put
together this wig to where it's gonna
lay the flattest and so this agree if
we're really helpful video I don't have
nothing bad to say about this hair I
didn't dye it I honestly do too much
altering to it so of course I mean it's
it's ten like straight out of the
package so I don't expect any issues
because I mean you guys know I'm usually
bleached my hair dye and you stomach to
it I haven't dyed or done anything to it
so I don't expect to have any issues
which I do not it is very soft as you
guys can
this prick tell how I'm running my
fingers through it the luster is it
doesn't really have high luster it's
more on the lower side but I like that
so it looks more natural and if I want a
little more shine I can just add oil to
it so Bobby I have nothing about the
same which I I didn't expect you because
I didn't do anything to this hair I
guess you know customized non-parental
and that was that but yeah I'm such as
watch this video all the hair details
and where I got it the links all that
stuff you need to know be down the strip
store on us below and if you enjoyed
this video you find it helpful give a
thumbs up and please subscribe if you
like more videos where I'm sure like a
look bits and pieces of the process let
me know that as well I have an updated
with to tour a planned I just I wanted
to be really good like I want to want to
like one of my videos it I don't know
maybe it's a million will see Boas watch
this video and like I said doesn't
subscribe all that good stuff and I'll
see you guys later
so here's the air when I first got it I
got four bundles and a frontal a
Brazilian body wave just showing you
guys the bundles ain't him only using
about three and maybe a quarter or the
bundles I had a lot left over and then
here is the frontal the front was
already kind of customized well at least
customizing has since compared like to
my other front tools that I've had that
are varied in so yeah so here I'm gonna
clip the frontal to my marble countertop
and one of my last videos everyone
thought that I it was actually like
actual countertop and I stained it but
this is actually like wallpaper I don't
know what's I know it's costly notes but
it's like that sticky paper that you
could put it on anything and so whenever
I do stain this which is rare because
for some reason um my hair dyes never
stain it I just if I do stain ever mess
it up I just put a layer on top and it's
like brand new so anyways I'm use this
iron color no this not color brilliance
it's just ion bleach it's like a
sensitive scalp bleach I love this
bleach it's not all super chemically it
smells really good
doesn't make you cough or sneeze awesome
and so I'm used some of that and then at
first I'm gonna mix in the ion developer
as well but then um I didn't like the
textured hat so I end up mixing another
developer in there and I
developer was like some off-brand or
like it wasn't ion so yeah what you guys
watch that then after I mix the two
together I just you know mix it up with
my wick my my with wicks my whisk I
can't talk I'm sleepy it's like almost
toilet night right now yeah I mix with
my whisk you know to really combine it I
always recommend a whisk you guys I used
to always mix my bleach my dies all that
with a fork or a spoon or you know like
a mixer but a whisk man it just mixes up
so smoothly and so fastly and they're
only like 149 Sally's are 249 something
really cheap it's like you might as well
get them so yeah well after I get my
perfect consistency I just spread it on
my frontal with a butter knife you want
a consistency like butter and I learned
this from Chrissy bails she told me this
knife trick I'm gonna always give credit
where it's due cuz i never wants me to
washes be like oh my gosh she's a genius
like I'm actually not um this was a talk
to me I guess you could say cuz I
watched one of her videos I just like
watching other people and you know
supporting them or what not so she's
really cool she gives a lot of good
information I'll link her channel below
but yeah this like the best thing I've
ever discovered is spreading the bleach
with a knife because with a brush it's
so freakin hard and so yeah just take
your time with that I actually went
really slow in real life but of course
I'm to speed up the video don't want to
be too long but um yeah just spread that
bleach everywhere and I'm gonna lift up
this front old none of the bleach got
through the lace whatsoever could I do
this perfectly but I'm gonna leave with
the front hold and place some foil down
and then place the front toe on top of
the foil just to help it process a
little faster
this part actually did after I made the
wig by inserted here because it's kind
of steps you want to tone the lace with
purple shampoo so I feel I do those in
my kitchen but you want to Tony with
purple shampoo or else your scalp will
look yellow and orange e and you don't
want that and so you just get your
purple shampoo this is my Bed Head
shimmer lights has a really strong spell
you Harley could ever get rid of so I
used his Bed Head one aniele's I'm
Marcia's fairly cheap and I just really
work that in there and then I let this
sit on there for 30 minutes but you'll
have to do for 15 I just started doing
something I think I was watching a
catfish or something so Kai distracted
but you just want this to sit at least
for 15 minutes to tone the knot and then
you're good to go it's time to customize
this front I'll have this really cool
water bottle from Sally's if you ever
like curly hair and you like what you
hear a lot this so cool it's like a
mister it's so super awesome and so I
learned that it's best to customize your
frontal when the hair is wet it gives
you a better idea of how much you're
plucking um so yeah you gotta like get
that rinsed I mean get that frontal
trans sorry
and so I'm wetting it you guys see like
the hairline well on the mannequin head
doesn't look that customized it looks
pretty dense but we're gonna fix that
and the reason why I want to take my
time on this is because I was going to a
half up half down style and I just feel
like it looks better with the frontal
customized you know and so I took my
time on this I parted out half the
section for the back and half for the
front this section I partner on the
front is what I'll customize the back I
leave it alone because I never
customized the back section because you
want that hair to be thick to cover any
tracks
if you customize and thin that part out
then how you gonna cover the tracks it
makes no sense so who I cannot wait
until one day hopefully they come out
front holes they're like it's super big
like they go black do they have like I
don't know I'm overthinking anyways here
I'm tweezing you want to get a good pair
of tweezers I tried three different pair
of tweezers until I find settle on these
ones these ones like work the best but
you want to get a good pair of tweezers
or else if you're using like dull
tweezers that suck you're gonna be
picking
extra hard the front holders try to get
the hair come up and that can cause you
just snap
the front oh and have a hole in the
front tool but if you are subscribed
Chrissy bails she just made a video on
how to like fix a hole in the front tool
and I watched your nails really cool so
I'm you know if you do have a whole new
frontal just watch that video it's on
her channel it's really cool anyways by
the way she's not paid me for this promo
I just like her channel anyways you're
just gonna tweeze away like like tweeze
like crazy and this took me it's gonna
take you at least 30 to 40 minutes per
side I sectioned off into two halves
only because when you I've done this
before why didn't section it off and it
just feels like you're working forever
whereas if we do one half first you
could see like all the progress that you
made and it kind of like motivates you
to get the other half done
you know the minx if you're doing both
at the same time you can't really tell
the difference whereas me doing this
half once I'm done I'm gonna show you
guys other half and you can see that go
wow like she really made a difference in
the frontal and so I totally recommend
just always doing half first because I
mean I don't know just makes you work
better but I'm gonna stop talking now
I'm gonna let you guys watch me I'm kind
Twizy random spots I'm just kind of
going with the flow it all depends on
your hairline as well I know my hairline
is pretty thin so I was kind of going
ham and tweezing a lot of hair off the
frontal
so here you guys see the difference then
here's how much hair that I got from
just freaking tweezing one side now here
to make the wig I am sewing on the
frontal and now I showed this part to
pretty much say that I used nylon thread
I've always a con thread but nylon
actually lays flatter oh it's a little
hard to work with but it lays much
flatter than cotton so I just sew the
front hole all the way across but yeah
totally get nylon thread I don't know
why I haven't been using this but it
lays so much flatter you could barely
see it literally with the Cotton's kind
of thicker so you could have a seed and
you can feel it it's more lumpy with
nylon it lays super flat it's awesome so
that's why I want to include this part
so after I sew down that frontal I glued
most of the trip not most of them like
what make it corner of the tracks just
to kind of get started and here I am
just going to show you guys how I do it
ooh sorry had to be rough if you've
watched my channel before you have seen
me do this before but I just want to
show you know including this video I
said in the beginning video it's cooling
you include little snippets of what goes
on and so all I do is just measure the
track and I'm going straight across and
then I cut it then I add glue to it as
I'm showing right here and the glue will
be in the description box below I glue
to it and then I dried a little bit with
the blow dryer to make it a little tacky
just a little because you don't want
write too much but it's wet it's gonna
slip right off and then I just stick it
to the wig cap and I press it down then
I put the dryer on top of it again sorry
I was kind of falling don't worry about
that
iced I got it then I put the motor on
top of that to just make sure that it is
all dry and it's not going anywhere and
then I just simply move on to the next
one it's super simple and first I go
straight across then I slowly start to
curve the bundle and I'll show you guys
that towards like the end of this video
will tour end of the wig making process
but it's super simple and it's really
simple
but once I do half this is when I start
to split the tracks in the bundles
because I do like a regular bundle on
the bottom and then towards the top I
fin the bundle out so it lays flat so I
have my blade and you just start by
cutting at the end and it kind of cuts
open now these bundles split they split
okay I did have some rips I didn't get
that in the video though because uhm I
was splitting off-camera like I only
show myself splitting some of it but I
did have some rips so it's like I was
going fast at first until I realized
that it ripped but um just it all
depends on the bundle some bundles you
can go really fast and it's easy some
you kind of have to like slowly wiggle
your way through it like this one was so
good at first and I got a rip and I was
like what the heck and so you know I
moved a little slower well I'm a little
faster I spent the video up but I got a
little rip at this part so if you ever
get a rip all I have to do is just get
scissors and cut that part and just
restart over you don't want to keep
going because it's pointless it's it's
you see what I'm talking about when you
do this so you just cut it and then you
just continue to split the track now I'm
going to show you guys two other ways
for the track that makes it easier you
could hold it in your hands like this
you could hold her hair like a head like
this or spread it with like your index
and your middle finger and you kind just
like have in the middle and you just
kind of like cut it and then you spread
it out and then you just keep
readjusting now this will eventually
figure it's just an option yeah I mean
yeah it's not the best option but it's
an option hikes for the tracks or you
could pin the bundle to your star from
head like so and then you could split
the track like this I hope you guys see
this the right way let's see are they
gonna be I see it let me let me see
what's going on
what's going on okay cool and then you
could have split it and then you just
slightly tug on it and it just kind of
splits into two this is like one of the
best options um but if you have like a
bundle that it just splits super easily
you could do it in your hands but it's
always a risk that you can cut the track
it depends on where you get the bundles
to be honest so this is like the part of
the easiest way to do it you just pin it
and then you just split it like that and
then once it gets too long for you you
just take the pin up and then readjust
it you know move it backwards and then
you just continue to split it until you
get to the very bottom well just split
the track so you can continue to glue
the pieces on but at a certain point
you're going to start to change the
direction of the way the tracks are
going and so when I got to this point
because I'm wants to lay super flat I
started to lay the tracks straight
across and so first you start off by
putting a little piece there and you
pretty much slowly it's like you're
going to you then you want to go
straight across and this straight across
track it will then just start to curve
and it'll curve into like an upside-down
u and you pretty much want to curve it
the direction the front tolls lane so
that way when you get to the top part of
the frontal which I'm going to show you
guys in one second it it's going along
with that you guys see what I mean how
it goes right
look against the frontal that's what you
want you kind of want to curve at the
direction of frontals going so when you
get to the very top
it lays as flat as possible and it's
super easy don't worry I'll have a more
detailed tutorial on how I make these
wigs and I'll just do it really slow and
whatnot um but I just want to show you
guys a little snippets have me this one
because I think it's important I feel
like if you're gonna do Styles like half
up a hop down the construction of the
wig is very important because you just
want to look the most natural you want
to leave flat it's so much that goes
into this and the reason why I really
wanted to split the tracks civically for
this wig is because
because some of the hair in the frontal
is gonna be up you don't like you
technically can't put a lot of hair down
and cover the track so you want to make
it as seamless as possible so you don't
have to use too much hair to cover the
track so most the hair can go in the
ponytail so the ponytail is more full so
you know strategy
alright so now I'm going to show you
guys how great a little piece of hair
covers is check I'm gonna part a little
section out I'm gonna lay it over the
track and you guys see how you can't see
the track at all that's what you want
that is why you split your tracks we
engage the very top because it just lays
flatter it feels super smooth it's
awesome so here's I am don't worry I
feel this makeup tutorial I'm not sure
which one's gonna go up first probably
make this tutorial honestly but um yeah
I'm gonna put the wig on and then we're
gonna style it and the wig look great
when I first put it on um it looks
pretty darn good it's not over the
customized could have had the hairline a
little thinner but can't go back now I
still like it so here I'm gonna cut the
lace off I decided to cut it walls on my
head I've never done this before and I
actually moved my camera don't worry
I'll move it back but I've never done
this way before but I've seen would do
it it seems like this works the best
because sometimes I cut too much lace
off my front tools and so I decided just
cut on my head because I mean that's
what I've been seeing will do and it
actually looks much better when you cut
it on your head you want to make sure
all your natural hair is slicked back as
much as possible though because you
don't want to risk cutting your natural
hair which I do not luckily but um yeah
this works way better than cutting off
the head because you want to make sure
it's customized to your hairline so
definitely cut it walks on your head so
after I cut it I'm going to take it off
and I'm gonna sew an elastic band on to
it because I didn't really want to glue
it down and the elastic band is perfect
I'll do a detailed video on how to sell
your elastic bands down but once I sewed
it down it was laying flat I but it was
laying tight but not so tight to where
it hurt my head it was perfect so here I
am I am going to separate my baby hairs
before putting something here in a
ponytail because you put your hair in a
ponytail with the baby hairs it's gonna
lift up and the lace knuckle a flat so
you want to section off your baby hairs
first that way because when you put your
ponytail you're kind of like it's
creating tension
I think that's the warm looking form or
pressure it's gonna pull up the lace and
you don't want that to happen so you're
gonna you know do I did just clip off
your baby hairs okay just listen to me
so I'll just put my hand a little
ponytail and then I'm gonna customize
the baby here before you know I move
forward with this because I just I want
it my baby here to look great
after I lay my baby hairs I kept messing
them up I did this point to over like
five times that's not my baby here's a
little different so I decided to like
put it in like a tiny little bun then
wrap it track around it I'm gonna do a
messy bun because this just in what's
trying out neat and I don't know what
that was about so I was like it you
know screw it my bad sorry for my
language I was like fudgie make it messy
so that's why I did looks like a little
piece of turd on my head it looks kinda
cute and here I'm just fix my baby here
some more actually like the messy bun
look cuz it looks more natural because
no one's bun is perfect well mine isn't
at least so just gonna lay my baby hair
some more
so I lay my baby hairs got my bun
situated whatnot and this is the final
look I love how this wig came out he
looks really great and he found this
video informative or helpful sorry there
was like little strands of my face just
fixing that but you found this video
helpful and you liked it give it a
