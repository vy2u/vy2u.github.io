I'm so sleepy but like you don't know if
you have to do a Halloween look they're
gonna be mad at you so that's what I'm
doing I'm really kind of Halloween
person so I'm into one off camera
because I mean I don't really know what
I'm doing exactly and then a profess
that I'm going to come back and do the
other eye and the rest of the face on
camera so alright guys so I did this I
off camera it looks pretty cool to look
even more fall into the bottom I
actually did it the first time and it's
not come good he's like took a break you
know I went I've got my car off you go
get it details and I came back I did
this um I'm gonna fix a little part
though I shifted my brows first just
kind of make them blend it out and of
course they look different I clean up
concealer and whatnot but I make it
perfect as possible it looks really cool
though I really like it I like it a lot
alright well let's do the other eye
alright so first I'm gonna take this
shadows shield only because when I did
this first
I lightly the first time is so much
fallout oh my god it's so much fallout
I'll go raccoon and then although I do
clean up in the eye shadow under here it
was still a lot I was like no things no
things so I put a shower
because man fall out like crazy you pry
my lid I'm using my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre never really the unusually
kind use as a guy but I really need as a
guy but I'm not going for like a sharp
winged outlook I'm kind of try to keep
it inside kind of like cool like so now
I take the new morphe palette this is
the new more 335 oh - and I'll insert
the palette in the screen I mean if I
put it up on get out of focus and I'm
gonna take this lightest shade as a base
shade I'm gonna put it all over my lid
then I'm going to take this orange you
shade come on - looks smoked out you
won't see too much of the orange that
off deep with other colors
I'm gonna take this darker like like a
brown shape but it has red tones I'm
gonna focus ad towards outer crease just
just deepen that a bit then I'm gonna
take the take me to Brazil palette by BH
Cosmetics I'm going to take this pinky
purple shade start working that into
mater crease I'm going to keep picking
it up and just really pack in the color
on and don't worry this top part pick
you messy after you do the brows and we
can see little clean it up down take
this purple shade and mix it in the pink
shade and I'm gonna focus ad towards
outer crease
alright that looks like that's as much
it's gonna pick up all right so now I'm
going to take this makeup geek
full-spectrum eyeliner in the shade
royal which is like a dark purple place
out all over my lids like so it shot up
and away when I'm blending that good
that's about fix it that's about
oh come on tell later now I'm gonna take
my niggas violet boss palette I'm gonna
get this shade indigo and violet and
pack it all over I put that eyeliner and
I'm gonna smudge that up so it's not
just like a harsh line you want to looks
much that out
then I going back into the market I'll
take this black shade and put that
towards the corner
I'm gonna take this eye candy liquid
sugar with this angle at pigment number
120 let's look at your Desson and I'm
gonna get a flat brush I'm gonna take
the liquid sugar and place it on top of
my lid first I'm gonna dig into that
Inglot pigment get a lot of it and pack
it onto my lid
I brought that purple shadow up a little
too high higher than I would like it so
how am I gonna fix that let's see that
purple shimmer there I'm going to blend
it to a kind of goes away type right up
a little too high I make this look
identical looks sloppy right now that
it's gonna come together later I promise
take this off how I need it and don't
worry about this edges I'm gonna like
fix them once I do my concealer and you
guys see how those fall out on my nose
all right so I'm done with this eye it's
not perfect just yet but in order to not
freak out which I typically do what I'm
I see when I look a little bit I'm gonna
start working on the rest of my face and
then go back kind of like fix it alter
it and if you ever do an eye shall look
that's more on the complicated side was
that a little sister and if you're doing
an eye shadow look that's one the
complicated side you like you mess a
little bit don't freak out just take a
step back go start work on the rest of
your face and you go back and you don't
make little you know fixes of it here
and there but you don't don't freak out
about it I used to do all the time and
that's why I'm it's taking me so long to
learn into my shadow so I'm gonna zoom
out and we're gonna work on the rest of
the face and then like you know slowly
fix the eyes and just kind of perfect
them
all right so I did most my face now I
have to do Ernie my I'm just kind tricky
so I'm gonna do this on first that I'll
be back for the socks I I don't know how
am I do we get but we'll see so okay so
I think this is actually not as hard as
he like looks um I've ever crash I'm do
this looks I thought would be hard I
think I would be to do it but it's a
little so let's zoom in all right
so surprisingly very easy so first you
take this orange shade from the new
morphe palette you just dust it all on
your eye like so they take that slightly
darker brown shade on top of that
smoking it out ooh oh my god I think
it's so cool what if I comes together oh
this is why you don't you continue do
look I fronted this Isles I feel I
wanted it to toriel anymore why don't we
have the equity you now take this purple
Island I'm a big geek I can't look at
the camera because it it's gonna be kind
of hard but you wanna rub it in your
waterline as well underneath your
lashline then you have those two shades
use from the bio Moss palette indigo and
violet and smudge that top already some
liner to make that really purple and
pigmented then you want to go back to
your take me to Brazil palette and use
that soft pinkish purple you used and
Resta underneath that and kind of start
bringing it down and take the purple as
well take them both
and start bringing it down kind of
deformity
like so now before you put the glitter
on I dust the powder will no way before
I am finish I don't want this winged out
I don't I actually wanted more circular
I want automatically at this to this
circle so I'm going to take my beauty
sponge and just kind of cut off that
wing I don't want it like that in clean
it up on my finger like so see the ant
take that pinkish purple shade and put
that on top just so it looks more faded
out mix up and fix the eye Lulu very
easy now
I'm gonna brush off in powder before you
to your glitter tear like this then I
take this flat brush I spray say
straight first and then I dab a little
bit already in my eye
not have to where it gets wet but enough
to where I feel it and I go back into
that eating black pigment and I just
police don't top of where I dabbed it
very simple
it's actually so much simpler than I
thought I mean it did more Halloween
looks now see this isn't that hard and
that's pretty much it and then of course
later on repair lash not Stefan I just I
want that last cuz lashes reeling on my
eyes and I'm a door I put the button
just yet and so now my tongue is drew
for me now leaders I'm gonna face wash
my face then I'll do my eyebrows and
lashes off camera and then you don't let
let's do the rest of the base face
ooh out there I'm dead
that's one look for though like okay the
reason why I did harsh contour and I
explained earlier before chital was
usually kind of old you know they got
some time in the game and I mean when
you're older your cheeks look more
sunken so of course you don't want
coughed or like this and a regular day
let's maybe it's your preference but um
it's just Halloween so decide to throw
in there
I had to do my brows off camera I'm like
I'm coming together now I'm gonna lips
before I do lashes so far that kind of
contour my keep its bull ridings called
to make it look more indented one then
I'll add my lips kinda excited because
the way they dude is kind of chin to the
Sabrina with Leonard's night mop and Mac
I can't talk about either so don't need
this kind of rain lipstick in the shade
Tootsie I mix that in with this shade
teeny tiny but color problem
and now you want to clean the lips up
with concealer wit dream come to the
cult
now I'm going to take the shade by them
of all the boss and was just that on top
hooker look pretty
I was really freaking scary in my
opinion but hey I gotta look all right
so now I'm gonna do missing anything I
have everything and my lashes on then we
have put the wig on and the jewelry and
all that kind of stuff and that we're
damn near done
Oh before last does it mean to my
savings spray and I like to do my sighs
mother lashes so take the works and
spray this in my face I know the sad
part just wash it all off the second I'm
done in two ways I'm gonna go do my lash
and do that off camera because I don't
want speed ups we even blocker
um it takes forever to relax just so
you'll actually wait alright to do my
lashes one more thing that what I do
should make this look a little more cool
and just more Halloweeny I want to take
this purple eyeshadow for my take me to
Brazil tada and bring it into my brows I
wouldn't do this earlier if I waited my
brows first if I didn't vice play like
this makes the look look really cool if
you just take a small brush and just
bring it into your mouth
like bring it upwards you see what I did
dear
I'll actually be this for Halloween but
this makeup looks actually pretty fun
I would actually totally be this
Halloween but I plan to be something
else hint
there's makes involved I would so be
this Rowley I thought this look is
actually easy you know you actually try
to do it you take your time you try to
bring that to brow just makes it more
serious got support just a tail oh this
is so cool alright so there by my hair
looks crazy I'm just gonna throw my wig
on it doesn't have to be super late
because I have a little thing to go on
top of it I just wanna own my trick me
thingy whatever I also use it I just
want to show you guys the headpiece and
