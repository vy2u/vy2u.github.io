using the 50 Beauty Pro filter primer
this is one my favorite primers at the
moment ever site but actually it's like
a moisturizer and it like it makes your
face feel super smooth but kind of
sticky to an extent so the foundation
sticks right to it
so foundation I'm using my NARS sheer
glow and I am in the shade Tahoe this is
like my go-to foundation it's my
favorite this is a new bottle I've I
bought this foundation like four times
already so this is like my all-time
favorite foundation for those of you who
wonder it's the bomb and my shade range
is pretty nice to NARS has always been
pretty cool with their shades so
definitely recommend it it comes out to
be like well like $50 after-tax so I
think it's worth it lasts a very long
time mine's lasts like a year or more
and so you can see I'm using my tart
shape to concealer and this is a shade
medium this shades like perfect for me
it looks very light when I first put it
on but once I blend it out it's like the
perfect shade and you also to factor in
that after you blow out the concealer
not only does it kind of like blend into
the foundation which is typically darker
they're gonna concealer so it kind of
like tones it out but then when you say
day with powder it kind of like tones it
down even more so if you want to like a
really bright under eyed you kinda have
to go pretty bright but that's just them
that's a tip from me to you so instead
of play second seal it I mean use my
Patrick Starr powder when I did this
review I told you guys that you got to
see this more on my channel and I was
being serious I love this powder I use
it every single day it's literally my
favorite powder at the moment so semi
face I was gonna use this girl elastic
setting powder which actually really
liked the feel of it but this is shade
deep Anna it was really it was actually
deep I didn't I didn't think would be
this dark I thought it was gonna be like
you guys see like a matte look crazy
it's not to fix myself
put more foundation on it was way deeper
than I thought it would be I
underestimated its deepness and the
powder before this will be too light for
me so I don't know I'm gonna do but that
kind of almost ruined my entire life so
I switch to the makeup forever powder
which is kind of foolproof and I put
that on I was I can't believe I did this
to myself
don't underestimate powders basically
that's why I'm trying to say so um yeah
I'm just trying to like really buff into
my skin
fix my silks I I feel like I look kind
of crazy I honestly don't know if I
fixed it I filmed this like days ago so
we'll see how it looked or seeing this
video to bronze my skin I'm gonna use
this Tarte this hotel heiress yeah
hotels bronzer put too much that on that
was a mistake
icons in shambles but I feel like the
look look good up in so her blush I'm
using this blush my Mac I don't know the
name so I just recently bought it but
it's a really pretty orange II blush and
I'm gonna fill in my brows I'm gonna
show you guys you know myself me do this
a little bit but I'm gonna kind of like
cut it short because I mean it's gonna
take forever so I'm using the precisely
my brow pencil my benefit and the shade
number 4 and I did my brows now time for
a liner which I dread doing because I'm
at expert the first I always comes out
great you guys see it was almost
effortless you know how those this is
sped up but isn't like a minute to do
came my really nice the second eye
however I always make the wings
different like one wing would be going
straight while the other ones kind of
curved down so I kind of really messed
up and I didn't cut out my net mistake
so you guys are gonna see me fix this I
have to like get a q-tip I had to take
the wing off put it back on I was just
in Chambal so I'll let you guys on watch
me be in shambles and out shit back in
once I fix myself
so once my liner was cool enough for me
to like like look cool I put mascara on
I'm using my Mac bold and bad lash but
it was kind of dried out so I end up
adding my covergirl mascara this is like
one of those og mascaras everyone knows
the mascara it's really nice so I'm
gonna use that then upon these lashes by
new bounce um I think I used Australian
mist or was a Russian white I'm gonna
hold the box on one second these are a
Russian white these are awesome throw
those on BAM lashes like it's they're
perfect because they're not too dramatic
but it just you guys see made a
difference that I use this Mac highlight
I don't know the names I just bought
these but it'll be down below
it wasn't popping that we wanted to pop
so I added another one I just be buying
stuff to feel it is these aren't the
best but I do know that with these
highlights they won't be the best when
you first use them but once you kind of
like break them in they become more
pigmented so I grab a different brush
and then this helped the highlight pop
even more so I think my brush was kind
of like messing me up
I didn't want to see me win or whatever
I don't know but um I'll fix it myself
then I put too much on so I had to take
some off because I like glow but I got
to go out in public I don't want like
crazy so gotta be realistic you know it
looks good on Instagram but in real life
it looks crazy you can't facetune
yourself in real life so I'm gonna use
this deal um I think
somebody medals and I'm gonna put that
where I place the highlight to make it
pop to make this more like holiday is
more like New Year's party you know what
I'm going to call it put that in there I
never use this I bought it a while ago
and I've never used a silver one because
I'm not a silver type person now I'm
gonna use color pop churro highlighter
try become a highlight pop just a little
bit more because I did make it fade a
little bit too much but then I kind of
ruined myself and I fixed myself once
again I don't edit these parts out
because I want you guys to know that I'd
be in shambles too - so like don't give
up when you do your makeup if you mess
up cuz it'll get better if you just keep
going so semi face before I did my lips
my more if you said you miss then I
moved my chapstick and I line my lips
using my Mac quark lipliner
I've gone to like every Mac store and I
finally found why they had cork after
alignment cork I take my black gradients
red lip liner this is my my name is just
it's only red lip liner and I have you
guys that Walmart and I think that Black
Radiance at some targets in Walgreens
and I take my Finn T Beauty lipstick I
forget this name I mean it's the only
one they have the moment the liquid
lipstick the red one it's really
beautiful it's my favorite of all time
not even discuss the color because I
like color trains cherry blossom I like
that color red a little more but this
applicator and just how this red feels
is what makes it my favorite
it's a beautiful red and so after I put
it on I just clean it up with a
concealer you know except wants look
neat I typically don't do Super Bowl
lips because it just requires so much
work I mean throughout the day just
annoying dealing with it because you
know you mess it up but just all this
extra work that I don't like doing and
then I kind of had a little bit to dry
it faster and then I'm gonna do my her
now I'm just I don't really do anything
to my hair i I don't know man I just
want to include this in the video you
don't have to watch it as videos like
will remain it long so just stay around
for the culture but I ended up like just
put in half of it up and the rest down
it was a cute style I want to do bangs
and my hair is too long for freakin
bangs now
and I've been like contemplating cutting
it but then like it's so dumb like you
don't know where bangs like that so not
gonna cut it so I just like made it got
a clip and I clipped it from behind so
my hair has a lot of body up top then I
curl my and you can still see the red
dye I had in my hair so I planned dyeing
my hair again another black just so it's
more like a jet black with no red
undertones because I don't like how that
looks just my personal preference but
after I bump my ends you know kind of
kill my hair that is the completed look
I was kind of mad I want to throw my
hoops on but I couldn't find them I'm
pretty sure the night before they say it
was a talked skate and I lost them but
that's another story so I'm yeah that is
my holiday look super holiday super easy
to do you just add a little highlight in
your eyes a red lip and bam you've got a
holiday look so if you enjoyed this
video if you're into this look calm down
below let me know show love do all that
good stuff please subscribe give this
video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys
