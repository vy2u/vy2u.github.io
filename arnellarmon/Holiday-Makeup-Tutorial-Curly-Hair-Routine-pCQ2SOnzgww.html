take my stroke cream by Mac and just use
it to prime my skin now this cream will
make you look very illuminated and very
dewy which is why I love it and then I'm
gonna take my NARS foundation it's like
that all-day weightless luminous I'm
super long name which is so unnecessary
and I just breast on my skin and I
really buff it in this foundation is
full coverage but it feels very light
it's honestly the best foundation of
ever used on my freakin life which is
why I buy it all the time even though it
cost $50 okay so while I let my
foundation sit and dry a little bit I'm
gonna go and do my eyes really fast this
eye look is super duper duper simple as
you guys will see first time priming my
lid using my lemonade prior by benefit
I'm gonna go and take this shade buy in
a saucer member thehills in the color
orange soda or cream soda one knows some
in soda I'll list all the products below
in the description box and then I'm
gonna go with the shade Morocco my
favorite shade ever maybe you guys
noticed the lighting day get a little
darker in this part I don't know why my
camera does that by I'm gonna fix time
get a ring light soon - do not worry so
I took a piece of tape because I'm
making like a sharp little wing and as
you see I didn't really blend that
shutter out too much but it's because
I'm gonna cover it so I mean you can
kind of honest and sloppy weave them in
here because you know you won't really
see it after you put the shimmer on you
gotta see and so then I get my Mac's
mixing medium and just place that all
over my lid where I'm gonna place the
shimmer or a pigment and then I may get
this payment by Mac I'll list the name
of it below in the description box now
you can see I kind of messed up but you
guys can see I fixed it a little later
because I was doing this not using
mirror I was just using my camera um
reflection so I cannot see where I was
messing up at and so then I took this
darker green shade by NARS and I pad at
the end of my wing just to make it a
little darker at the end and I'm gonna
take another shade which is lighter and
kind of more shimmery and I put it on my
lid you know just to make a little
gradient effect you couldn't really tell
in the camera but it actually did work
now back to the face I'm gonna take my
pro longer concealer right Mac now this
is my favorite concealer guys it's just
the bomb it never creases on me it just
works the greatest
honestly and I'm just gonna put that
underneath my eyes I'm gonna place them
on my forehead a little bit and I'm
gonna put some on my nose my chin and
then I'm gonna put a little bit on my
Cupid's bow and yeah I'm just gonna
blend that all out with the Beauty
Blender
okay so after blending on it out you're
gonna take another concealer I'm using
it a polaron concealer now honestly guys
with prolonged concealer I recommend
blending as fast as you can because if
you let it sit it does dry up super fast
anyone who has used this concealer
before probably knows that so you have
to work with it pretty fast because it
does it gets like sticky it dries really
really fast okay
so as you see I just kind of like
contour my forehead and then my
cheekbones now it may look like I didn't
blend it that well but it's because I
didn't but it's because what honestly
like I take blending seriously but at
the same time when I say I stuff a
powder it looks fine to me and you know
it just somehow it always looks flawless
okay sometimes it just it works out okay
but I could have blended my forehead a
little bit better
probably yeah it could have oh yeah and
I decided to contour my nose again this
time but I think this time I did a much
better job you know clearly took my time
on it and I used a better brush and yeah
I really really really didn't when I
mess up this time because last time I
messed up I just like my nose it's
really weird I don't really have a
bridge it's kind of like it just kind of
like goes in my face seems like swoop
and it just pokes out and you know I
don't really have a bridge or like a
strong nose which sucks
so yeah it's really hard to contour this
thing sometimes
so after all that you want to set the
place you highlighted with I've been
Nana powder just that it really really
good just make it look awesome mood so I
was gonna set my face when I realized
okay I'm gonna fix that eye shadow
that's when I noticed how messed up it
was and you kind of brush off some of
this shimmer and then it's all good
see I fixed it and then I set my whole
face using my mineralized skinfinish
powder by Mac and I'll see you see what
I meant see on my forehead now looks all
fine even though I didn't bleed with
that green see it all it all works out
you know but I mean if I were you just
freaking blend you know play it safe
so after sighting everything you just
want to go back in with like a contour
shade and just like you know intensify
the contour just make sure it's really
standing out now guys later in this
video you'll see that I didn't include
the clip of me finishing off my
eyeshadow and that's because I actually
deleted it and I'm super sorry about
that but I will tell you that's where I
did I just end up putting the same
Morocco shade underneath my waterline I
just added that darker green shade in
the corner of my eyes and I just simply
put on mascara it was really simple so
for blush I'm using two different
blushes I'm using warm sole and a little
lusty by Mac because I wanted to be kind
of I want to be noticeable but also stop
at the same time so these two shades
together work perfectly to highlight new
you know darling my Mac now if you read
a little subtitles I am giving away one
of these guys but the reason why I'm
only including it in this video is
because I want the winner to be someone
who actually watches and supports me so
the only way you'll know about this
giveaway is if you're watching this
video so make sure to enter and
subscribe so first I'm gonna lightly
line my lips and I'm all lining them to
use as a guideline for the liquid
lipstick I'm gonna line my lips with
next you guys will see I'm gonna go in
with trust issues by anastasia beverly
hills and i'm gonna pretty much go over
where i line my lips because this is
gonna act as my liner for my ombre lip
that i'm going to create
so then after i line my lips with that
i'm gonna take and it's that's the
beverly hills Seraphine and pretty much
gonna go over that and you'll see this
is like honestly so simple and easy you
just kind of just flinch together with
your finger and you're pretty much done
after that now time for hair this is the
hair and its natural state bt-dubs first
I'm going to take the rviz Ollie a
premium argan oil hair treatment and I
love this stuff so do be honestly use as
much you want and it still will make
your hair feel oily honestly its yeah
and it smells amazing so I pretty much
just run that all through my hair it
specifically on the ends you know cuz
typically the intra pair get really dry
so you really just want to like saturate
your hair with this oil man it just
smells so good I love it then I'm gonna
take the rviz all the ultra curl
defining cream and I'm gonna go over
that and just really really really work
that into my hair my hair the hair by
the way this hair is from Diamond
Dynasty virgin hair it's like honestly
pray the over here that I wear at the
moment oh yeah by the way I'm wearing
this look base closure for the first
time I'm gonna go back to lace because
these silk shits are hard and I'm
worried three bundles of your agent deep
wave and the inches are like 24 or 24
and 26 for anywhere that's wondering now
the reason why I'm working out stuff so
much into the hair is because when curly
hair dries it gets poofy I don't you
like that poofy look so the more
products I typically put in the hair the
more it stays in the same state as when
I wet it and that's what I was going for
it because I do not like that poofy hair
look so as you can see I got my edge
control there's a little toothbrush and
I kind just like press my baby hairs a
little bit honestly I'm not with that
whole artificial baby hair I just
you know I just kind of brush this
sloppily you know I don't really care
too much for that part and then yeah
it's pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoyed this and again I'm super sorry I
wasn't able to include the part where I
finished my eyes off but as you can see
it's really simple and I really do hope
you guys love this and I hope
guys we create it and please subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
