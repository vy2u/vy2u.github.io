washed hair dye let it air dry so this
is what the head looks like it's active
state by the way this is the way guys
then I straighten my hair I skip the
part where actually did it because like
oh that's kind of boring i'ma get these
scissors and I'm not supposed to be
using to cut my hair okay I could not
find this is I did cut my hair with so
these just have to work out for me but I
mean make it pretty okay it's just if
you plan on doing this at home probably
get some better scissors but you know I
made it work so I'm someone with
professional whatever cough cough um
yeah I'm just grabbing random pieces and
I'm cutting in a slanting motion I kind
of backed up so you guys see better I'm
just cutting yeah I don't know
another term besides slanty that's not a
word but I cut in a little slant
emotions and it was guy random pieces
the bear bear BAM now honestly guys if
this is your real hair you probably
shouldn't do it like you shouldn't do at
all because your stuff will be mad
uneven but I want that uneven look okay
when I curl the hair you guys will see
why I want that look but yeah if this is
your real hair you price you can do this
but this is a wig and it's weave so like
Oh can't really lose anything if I mess
up on this but I mean I've been kind of
my own hair since I was 12 so I kinda
want to cut my hair to where no matter
how I cut it it's gonna look pretty good
now although it seems like I'm kind just
like going crazy on my hair for no
reason it's like ma'am does she even
know she's doing I totally know what I'm
doing it looks like I'm picking up
random pieces but I'm cutting in like
certain pieces on purpose I'm cutting in
a way to wear when I curl it it all lays
and flows a certain way and when I start
curling my hair you guys will see
exactly what I'm talking about like I
have a purpose for all the pieces that
I'm cutting
so here I am caroling the pieces now you
guys will see me go back and recall some
of the pieces that's because at first I
thought I want to go for like just this
kind of like light layered look but then
I realized I wanted more body and I
wanted like actual curls so tourists I
think that video you guys will see how
my hair is I'm looking at the end but I
end up curling more and more as I go I
just I honestly kind of randomly decided
to cut my hair this was a plan it's like
I sat down like oh I'm gonna show him I
cut my hair I was doing makeup like I
want to use my hair up because you guys
know I choose my hair like every week I
was like oh why not cut it and the
camera was still on and I was like hmm
might as well film it in case I like it
I could show them so I kind of like yeah
it was very very very not planned I just
I got bored I was like I'm gonna cut my
hair
let's see what happens
by the way give this video a thumbs up
if you want more hair tutorials I know
everyone's always asked me for them
because apparently my hair is always
late I'm not gonna disagree on that but
yeah if you like these kind of videos
please let me know cuz hair is like it
used to be my number one passion before
I discovered makeup so I'm pretty good
at I know how to come out on boss my own
being so if you want my videos on this
please let me know and I'll be happy to
film them for you now if you guys are
wondering how long this took me it took
me about 15 minutes to cut in style both
sides I didn't film myself to the other
side because I mean it kind of would
just make this video super long I pretty
much do the same thing for both sides
now at the end of the video you guys
will notice that the front part of my
hair looks more defined enough because
after I cut and styled other side I just
redefined the curls in the front so that
they looked identical and just you know
more even and perfect yeah so this is a
finished look I really hope you guys
like this look I personally came out
really nice and I was super happy that I
decided to film it for you guys so yeah
just let me know if you guys want to see
any more videos like this and be sure to
like subscribe and do all that good
stuff
and I'll see you guys on my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
