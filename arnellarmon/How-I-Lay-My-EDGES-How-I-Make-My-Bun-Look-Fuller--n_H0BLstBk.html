you're new welcome so today's bit is
going to be on how I perfect my bun and
lay my edges I've been doing like a lot
of extra mists of my edits lately I've
noticed because I have a new edge
control brush and I like it a lot and so
I'm able to like really get in there or
maybe I'm just extra but I've got a lot
of compliments on my edges gonna get all
the messages on how I do them so I
decided to a video as well I was like
show/hide to my bun because my hair is
short but the way I do my bun I make it
look longer than what it really is and
so I was saying it this video could be
helpful for people who aren't growing up
they're like I am and they want the hair
with longer in a bun so that's what I
did and I'm yeah that's pretty much it
for us intro I don't want my tuckus ears
off so I'm gonna let you guys watch this
video if you enjoy finding helpful I
think this video a thumbs up and like an
organized comment all the products I use
in this video will be down to this box
below and I'll see you guys later
alright so my hair looks kind of wild
it's kind of like brushed and combed out
I'm going to use a comb to brush into
the bun shape I use a comb because I
feel it grabs more hair versus a brush
and you want as much hair into the bun
as possible this will make sense if
you're doing this at home um you just
it's what I do and so I put my hair and
a little ponytail first and don't worry
I'm gonna like reeben this later but I
like to put my hair up first
just like I lay my edges so I can get
idea of how I want to lay them and then
I go back and I fix the button so I'm
gonna use my kiss edge fixer in order to
lay my edges now I have this one which
is like a clear color which is what I'm
showing right now and that means another
one that's pigmented later but I'll tell
you guys why so first I'm gonna use this
clear one to kind of lay the sides on my
bun so my hair looks more slick I want
my bun to be like sleek but not too
sleek if that makes any sense at all
like I don't want it to be like you know
super super perfect but I wanted to look
neat as well so I'm just using my kiss
edge fixer as well as this kiss edge
brush and this brush is super awesome
you guys like I just I got this I think
it's going so crazy with my edges like I
do super dramatic like styles because I
had like a little mini comb on the end
of it which you get to see me use in the
front part of my hair it's really cool I
love it
I love this edge of trouble
it's flake-free and the product gives
you time to like style your hair and
arrange your edges during application
before it sets
and it's super long-lasting like my
edges literally stay the same the entire
day so now I'm gonna take another kiss
edge fixer in the shade dark brown it
looks pretty dark but it's actually
perfect now I use this because my
natural hair is like a lighter brown
blondish color and so my baby hairs
always blonde so it makes it look like
it makes it look bald in the front part
of my hair and so I use this dark in the
hairs up front so my hair looks more
full up front and I love that because
it's like I used to have to put powder
you know in these little areas but you
can always tell there is power there for
some odd reason so the fact that this
edge control is like pigmented and
tinted to be brown like hair is awesome
so I am just you know putting that as
control in my hair I put on the brush
then I put the brush my hair of course
and I'm just sweeping like I used my
finger to help me sweep the edges as you
can see it's kind of hard to explain
this to be honest because it comes like
so natural to me but I'm literally just
you know like brushing the edges down
and I just use my finger to swoop it I'm
yeah just just watch me do it it's
pretty simple
so as you can see I mainly use the brush
but then when I want to get like more
detailed I use like little cone part
it's so convenient honestly if you want
like super late edges you need that got
meaning like little comb like this like
that's how you really get them to look
super nice even like videos I've watched
before I notice I use a comb I never
knew that that's how you did it but you
need like a little comb and so I'm I'm
just gonna keep mess on my edges until I
flood they look perfect
they look very dramatic which I like but
at the same time you don't them to look
like too dramatic and I mean I'm adding
more of the dark brown edge control into
my hair to make myself look less bald so
I'm just like perfecting at this point
so after I've perfected my edges I'm
gonna go and redo my ponytail it just so
looks neater that's why I always do I
can't for me to be longer so I got a
super long bun so like perfecting my bun
and my hair in general is kind of hard
here I'm just adding more of the dark
brown air control into my hair because I
my roots are growing out so I thought
looks crazy I'm just trying to bounce it
out and then I took a little bit of the
kiss Argan hair spray it protects you
from heat damage but I mean technically
speaking I'm not putting too much heat
on my hair I mainly used to kinda like
tame my hair and I like how it smells so
that's why I used it and now to make my
butt look bigger I'm just bumping it and
I'm coating the sides too because I like
how that looks and then I take a
rubberband and I am going to kind of
like put my bun into place now I kind of
messed up on this part and I didn't edit
it out or cut it out because I want you
guys to know that like you probably
won't get on your first try it's kind of
difficult kind of semi annoying
especially when you don't have much hair
to work with it just I feel like this
look kind of awkward well looking back
actually kind of cute but it didn't look
as big as I knew it could look so I took
you back down and I feel like my hair is
a little dry so I use this kiss argan
oil it smells so good you guys this
whole line smells so good
I actually poured a little bit too much
of the oil in my hand but this oil is
like it's like it's an oil but it kind
of reminds me of a serum like it's not
too heavy it doesn't make your hair feel
stiff or super like grease or anything
that's why like you know I just wrote
into my hands and I put it on my hair
because it wasn't heavy at all and just
smells so good so I wrote in my hair and
then I put my hair back in the ponytail
to perfect my bun it used to take me two
tries every time to my bun it takes at
least two try so this is totally normal
so yeah pull em back up you know I used
the robe and you don't - perfected I
bumped another piece and I pretty much
perfected it like although like the
other bun was cuter you guys can't you
guys have to admit they're like this one
looks bigger and more full which what I
want it cuz you know I want my hair to
look longer than what it really is
and so um yeah that's completed look
that is how I make my bun look all nice
and full I can't wake up my hair in a
bun that's nuts to me um and that is how
I lay my edges cuz I bring a lot of
questions about that so that is why I
made this video so if you enjoyed this
