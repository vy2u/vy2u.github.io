going to first wash condition it and
deep condition am using my bio Terra pro
series damage care with vital keratin
now these products were sent to me
therefore this video is sponsored but
I've been using these products for a
month only because I don't believe in
promoting like haircare skincare unless
I've actually used it so I actually
talked about it so let's talk about it I
learned that I prefer to mix their
shampoo condition together only cause
I'm I'm not really a big fan of shampoo
to begin with I feel like I just hate
how those on my hair so I learned that
when I mix the two together it cleans my
hair and it also keeps soft at the same
time oh this ship of conditioner is
supposed to pretty much help repair
damaged hair from chemicals flat earns
everybody in my hair
now I didn't necessarily know the
difference from using just shampoo
conditioner but after I use a treatment
mask I learned why it's important to use
like the same series all together what I
mean is that like if you're gonna use
one product from a line it's good to use
like the whole entire line because
usually the whole entire line works the
best when you're using it all together
so yeah you use the shampoo and
conditioner together if you have really
dry hair or just damaged hair I would
recommend doing this just mixing your
shampoo and conditioner together because
it just makes your hair feel much better
and this stuff smells so good like it's
all it has an addicting smell to it I
can't explain the smell I wish I could
but I can't it's really different but
yeah I just massage that through my hair
a little bit and then I went and rinsed
it out and now it's time to do the mask
which is like my favorite part that guys
can see I use this mask a lot I was not
joking my seventies for a month I have
the receipts ok they sent out the
products I got August 25th and it is now
August 27th and I'm just now you know
filming the video because I really
wanted to try it out you know so I've
made this mask a lot after the first
time I used it I immediately got hooked
because I noticed that it literally did
make my hair feel less damaged because I
bleached my hair like maybe like 2 or 3
months ago and I pretty much bleached it
three times and I dyed it back black the
next day don't even ask me why I did
that I still don't know I did that it's
been damaged ever since that's why it
does not get curly at all anymore
so when I use this mask I immediately
flatten and you know strain afterwards
I can't really tell when a mask works
and till my hair straight because I
could see just how still gigas how soft
it feels and when I did that like it
made me want to rock my natural hair
which is why I wear my natural hair now
because it made my hair feel that good
what makes these products even better
it's the price point believe it or not
each Park is only ten dollars its
treatment mask
I looked it up to see where I could buy
it again um it's at Sally's and with the
salads cup car it's only $8.99 so
basically you got to see it on snap I'm
gonna go buy it again cuz I mean it's
gonna be gone by like next week but yeah
when I seen the price point I was like
wow like this is definitely something I
want to try and use and if I like it
which I do after use it for a month I'm
gonna make a video on it cuz honestly
there's been times where I got sent
products and it's like oh yeah you know
we're gonna make a video and we talked
about pay me all that stuff and I if I
don't like it I'm like yeah I keep the
money like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
promote it I'll feel bad by the same
time I don't promote stuff that I don't
like so yeah
oh it's foam time iodine remember the
name of this film I just know I bought
it because it smells like coconut it
smells the best but I'm not a
professional phone person so I don't
know which films worked the best
honestly I got this one cuts of smell
yeah you can really use any foam you
like your new phone that works best for
your hair it's not I don't think it's a
huge deal I mean foam is foam it's gonna
all feel foamy I just yeah get one that
smells good at least because I mean
you're gonna pull on your hair it has to
smell good yeah so you want to get the
foam and squeeze a lot in your hair
partially because you need it a person
because it's fun and then you're gonna
start combing your hair and styling it
in the way you want it to be styled so
I'm sticking my hair down and I'm trying
to like create like a little cute wave I
think of what to call why I'm trying to
do I guess
I'll call like a smooth with a weave in
it but you know just watch the video you
guys see what I'm doing I'm just trying
to like create a wave because I watched
a video I'll link below and I just
noticed that when she put the foam her
hair and then she's like kind of like
curled it and weaved it when it dried
that's how it ended up forming I guess
you could say so I was just trying to
get that effect so that's what I'm doing
Ola started the lighting changes in this
video I couldn't really control it you
got to see the lighting really changes
when I wake up in the morning uhm yeah
anyways this is the back way here looks
like it's not the neatest right now
except I can't really see it all the
time so I don't really know how to style
it but my shaped cut goes all the way to
the back I wasn't ashamed the other side
to me my stylist decided not to do that
because my hair is a little thinner on
the other side and I just it looked a
little ball oh my god this is when I
realized that I am dip in my waves are
so crazy okay wait let me be quiet so
you guys get seasick and really feel
this way okay I'm done
so after took me like 10 years to style
my hair I had a little more foam don't
worry okay then I'm at a film you add it
doesn't really matter I first a little
care now you're gonna wake up with stiff
hair but that like it totally didn't
happen so trust me on this so out of our
phone because I'm about to wrap my hair
and I want the little wrap things to
stick it's gonna get this little white
thingy these are like I don't know like
two dollars the be spiced or and you're
just gonna start to wrap your hair
you're gonna wrap it like you're
wrapping a boo-boo like you know if you
got a really big cut and you're gonna
wrap it to make sure with blood that's
come out that's you're gonna do and
you're tight and make sure it's tight
make sure it's not too tight though
because I tied my little too tight and
in the middle of night I kind of like
adjusted it because it was hurting my
head and I mean you got to see what that
did to me in my morning you kind of miss
to my wrap but it's okay cuz I made it
work yeah you're trying to wrap your
hair and do your dues
yeah I'll be right back what I've done I
did a lot of wrapping probably more
rappy that I needed to do but because
this is my first time doing this I want
to make sure I was perfect because there
was no way I was gonna waste my time
just for it to look bad in the morning
well yeah it did but okay I'm gonna wrap
my hair down
you're done wrapping you're gonna go to
sleep then you wake up and I woke up
grumpy because I was tired you guys I
literally got write a bed and start
filling me
my frickin teeth weren't even brushed
yet I hadn't showered yet I was in
shambles okay but anyways you guys see
how I kind of messed up my rap because I
kind of like ripped off a little piece
because hurting my head too much and it
kind of gave me like justin bieber bangs
but anyways i was like you know what i'm
just gonna make it work so i remove the
wrap first I start moving each strand by
itself but I realized it slips right off
like a little cap as you guys can see
like in one second it kind of slipped
right off wait when is it gonna happen
right now yeah it slipped right off and
my hair is so shady it's soft I was like
woah dude like I never want to put heat
on my hair again I'm just gonna do this
every night and it made my side look
super soft and I loved it
I was literally in love and I want to
take a mini Flatiron if you have short
hair if you have longer hair I don't
know if you do have to do so you have
longer hair up of course like if you
have short hair you want to get mini
flattering because I mean that's what
beer made for for short hair now I don't
even know the name the brand of this
flattered by would even recommend it
because it kept burning my fingers it's
one those flatters that gets really hot
but it doesn't really have protection of
round the Flatiron so you can't really
grab it and really curl the hair because
it burns your fingers I had this other
flatter that's why PYT hair that flatter
and although um it doesn't get as hot as
this one it still curls the hair and
it's more like heat-safe like it doesn't
burn your fingers if you guys you know
are looking for a mini flyer and that
works pretty well hey I'm just using
this one because I was kind of in a rush
and this one gets hot super fast so I'm
just bumping my hair and kind of curling
it to the best of my abilities I didn't
record myself why record on myself I cut
out the clips of me curling most the
back because I mean I didn't really show
it in the camera so I didn't I didn't
think it was necessary including the
video I mean it's kind of boring to
watch me just reach the back of my head
and kuroh stuff you can't see but I did
record myself curling the front because
that is the part that matters the most
so I get to thread my hair I'm curling
everything forward and that's because I
thought it creates more body because I
want to fluff it back I feel like it
kind of creates a Oh God
it's something about gravity okay like
if I Carol did backwards it'll fall
backwards if I killed it front worse
while I'm doing and I pushed it back it
makes it just look more fluffy because
like you can't you're pushing it back
but the hair is forward so it wants to
go forward so it's like what is it doing
like am I making sense you guys will see
I really don't know how to explain that
by Miss Carolina off board
doesn't see when I get to the pieces
that are more close to my shave side I
still curl it forward by kind curl it
going to the side like side words that's
because I wanted to flow where all the
hair is already flowing I don't want to
kind of go and cover my shave side if
that makes sense I just want to make
sure it's with the hair that it belongs
with
they're done you want to start running
your fingers to your curls now I almost
forgot oil I took this argan oil right
here and I just go back and I start you
know about my finger through it again
you want to use oil so it doesn't look
dry and it stays moisturize and all
shiny and pretty so yeah I just kind of
like fluffed my curls out now once I
fluff it out I do I will go back and I
will like recur a few pieces that I feel
like need to be a little more defined or
like you know that I don't feel look
perfect enough so yeah I go back and I
perfect everything
when I'm done with that I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna lay my edges don't mind my
little friend captions I kind of did
those kind of bored and I don't know I
just want to add them I thought they
were cute so yeah I go and I lay my
edges just the case the wind blows and
it's an old shoe heard you got laid you
want to lay them and make them you know
looks all neat and pretty
after you lay your edges you are done so
this is what the hair looks like from
that angle
now I'm great turn my head a little bit
now turn it all the way and that's all
looks like at this side and then I'm
gonna show the back a little bit I like
the back a lot I just like that wave
effect you look like I just came from a
salon yeah that's pretty much it for
this tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it
