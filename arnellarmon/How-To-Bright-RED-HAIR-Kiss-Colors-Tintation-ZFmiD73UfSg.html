welcome straights we just wanted to be
on how I got this super bright vivid red
um it matches my backdrop we'll just
kind of freaking me out but it's kind of
really cool to you this hair color is so
freaking vivid and pretty I post on
Instagram story and a lot of guys seems
excited to see it I did a poll and asked
you guys if I was doing red or blue hair
except with the pictures by the way
everyone go to blue which is weird so
I'm almost sure that everyone's going to
go to red definitely think that you guys
want to see a blue hair color net so
that's the case comment blue heart and
I'll do that next but in you this videos
we've got ha got this red color mouth I
do start from blonde hair in this video
I'm only stating that because unless
when I go and I click on a video and I'm
looking to go and I'm looking to achieve
a certain color I want to know like okay
are we starting from black bundles and
dyeing them and then color them wears
from blonde to that color because it
makes a huge difference and so I do want
to clarify that these bundles were
blonde so that's how is able to get this
really vivid color you can't cheat this
amount of vividness and brightness when
starting from black but knows it just
you have to bleach it it's a longer
process and so I just want to clarify
that but this video is sponsored by kids
colors it's in collaboration with their
new hair color line called temptation
and so I was sent the entire line every
single color there was and so before
this video before doing this color I did
use their dyes two other times just test
them out and get a feel for how they
work and so I tried this wig using their
hair dye and um you're gonna see that
video soon I'm sure I figure out how I
wanna do it I did record myself game use
color by the way but um it came out
really really pretty it's like a what is
that like a purpley - raspberry unbury I
don't know what color just yet but it
can really really nice and it's super
beautiful has so much dimension and also
dyed this hair I have a bun looks I made
the wig yet because I might change
color but I was able to use their gray
dye to dye this hair color right here
and so I use their dyes mobile times and
I'm able to kind of like know what works
best as far as life isn't daya better on
dry hair damp hair so I'll be going on
than the video as well as given my
honest opinion so if you want to hear it
and you want to see how about this color
to continue watch this video if you
enjoyed it find it helpful if you plan
on repeating this color get its video a
thumbs up please subscribe and I'll see
you guys later
so this thing I'm gonna be doing today
just these blonde bundles and I got me
Lisa hair
you guys have priced me on my channel
before but this video isn't sponsored by
them I just had their blonde bundle
sliced I desire them and so I'm gonna
use quite a few dies today I'm starting
off with red velvet and obviously took
the red velvet color it's like the
darker color and then I have Cherry Bomb
investiment goes towards the bottom
these aren't in order in which I'm using
them and I have crimson red then we have
a mahogany red last red is paprika
so I'll be dividing these dyes into
three bowls so the first bowl I am using
red velvet and I have two bottles of
those and then in the second bowl I am
taking crimson red and paprika so I was
kind of going for like darkest to
lightest and so on the third bowl I'm
using Cherry Bomb mahogany red cherry
bombs like the lightest color of air is
so that was like the very last color I
put in you could tell the difference and
so after I put them together I mixed
them all up and after mixing them I
realized that my darkest make sure
wasn't dark enough so I took this dark
warm brown color from their line and I
add it to the red velvet mixture and
that might get a napkin I'm gonna do
some swashing to kind of figure out how
dark this is gonna be so this is the
dark the dark warm Brown a red velvet
and this is the second mixture which I
believe is the crimson red and the
paprika and then this third one is the
mahogany red and Cherry Bomb and you can
see it goes from like dark to light I
want the first one being slightly darker
though so I add even more dye these guys
are really cool because they're great
for mixing and customizing colors
because they are aloe vera based I feel
like it makes it so much easier for the
clothes to fuse and mix well and blend
and so these colors are perfect if you
want to customize and come up with your
own custom color I promise you because
they blend so well and so I made the
first one darker and I was pretty
satisfied on how these colors look on
the napkin and so I you know went in to
dye the bundles
so indict in this hair I'm gonna start
from the roots and I'm using darkest
color or the darkest mix that I made off
the roots and then the middle colors off
to go in the middle and then the in
colors and within I set my bowls up to
where they're an order in which like
from dark to light so it's easiest to
use this nice super easy to use and I
feel like it's because it's aloe vera
gel based it makes it um for lack of a
better word because I can't think of one
almost a little slimy that sounds gross
but um slime in a good way because it
spreads very very easily so it's super
easy to work with it also smells really
good I can't describe the smell but it's
definitely not a smell that is like kind
of like chemical like or like a smell
that it makes it uncomfortable while
dying because I mean I use pretty much
every single hair dye you could think of
and so I know where and I smells good
and when it kind of gives you an
headache
and these guys are very easy to work
with so as far as working with these
dyes so like I said the beginners video
I've used this dye multiple time so I
know what works best and what doesn't so
I will say that although this color came
out really really nice and dyeing this
on dry hair I believe it's because the
bundles are blonde so automatically was
easier I do think that this dye works
better when the hair is damp now I think
this because in the wig I show in the
media video that plumage color I
actually die fat and the hair was
slightly damp not damp enough to where
it's a little drippy it's literally damp
like the definition of a damp that's
what the hair is and I feel like that is
worked out better I don't know I just
feel like I I prefer to use this hair
dye and damp hair which is also a plus
because you can't use every single hair
dye damp hair and you guys are probably
seen that for my videos usually when you
dye hair when the hair is dry even when
you like buy like hair dye from the
stores it always says to put the color
on dry hair however with this hair it
works best when it's damp and I feel
like that's a plus because usually when
I like you know bleach hair or wash it
and I
two died after the fact I dread having
to blow dry it and then die annex I feel
like it just adds more time it's like an
extra step and so because I can do this
women's dance it makes my life much
easier and it makes this whole variety I
don't know what so am I talking because
I definitely just said overall instead
overall but you guys give it I mean it
just makes it easier and so I will say
that where kumys dies the colors are
very very vivid as you can see in the
beginning this video I think the great I
use very very vivid and I also think
that the raspberry purplish color came
out very vivid as well and it had a lot
of dimension and I have to say that my
favorite thing about these dyes how well
they mix together I'm a person that
likes doing fun and unique colors I
think these dyes because you're able to
make some you're really kind of create
custom colors that's my favorite thing
and so now that you've heard me talk for
like five minutes straight if you've
been watching this whole time this like
the most simple process you live in just
make sure that you really lasats that
color into the hair and I actually let
this sit overnight I put in a little
plastic like caps like basic plastic bag
and I let it sit overnight and then I
rinse it out only the shampoo at once if
this hair do not bleed and so will the
hair color doesn't bleed and so I
shouldn't put it once condition it I
blow-dry it it made a wig styled it and
that is how I got the finished product
which I'll show you guys like one second
so here's the final look I did get a
slow-mo so I insert some photos excuse
me for that but if you enjoyed this
