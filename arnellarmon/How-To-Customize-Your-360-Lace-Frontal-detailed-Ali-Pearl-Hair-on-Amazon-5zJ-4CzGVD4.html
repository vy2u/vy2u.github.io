that done filming a video it's kind of
detailed very detailed on how to
customize your 350 ways frontal frontal
whatever kind of frontal and you ain't
have um I am wearing a three sequential
so 360 X 1 tilde is like a bigger
version of threshold those closures
would you're like tiny they're like
interested in but I don't love that my
heart whether it's closure is because
like three variable are and then you
have the front holes but ear by ear to
ear in 3/1 which was all way around
their heads
now I'm aware this is a frontal only
because the 360 frontal essentially was
way too big for my head and so the
purpose of a 360 friends homes to be
able to put your hair up in high buns by
me when I wear my wig I wasn't get
anyway so I mean I have they don't see
is really fun told the only thing I
really like about them is that if you
customize it to fit as a frontal you can
make them fit as even longer frontal to
give you more like hairstyles decide if
I makes any sense
maybe who of this video is cream to
detailed video trying to customize it
and they can look are natural like so I
have a part right there that's what it's
there but I decided to kind of do a
little flip over textbook and look more
sexy
oh the end of hair from Alec are on
Amazon was acting cool because I have a
couple comes people asking me to do
reviews for hair from Amazon's
not all Aliexpress companies ships
everywhere but Amazon does and so yeah
they are company on Amazon well I am
standing up since why I keeping me and I
want to show you guys the body of the
hair how it flows and I will show you
guys how long it is I'm short advisory
so I can't really speak at all but this
hair goes all the way down to my tip I
really should show you guys I got was
junk but I don't know I'm from that high
but I'm yeah I sent me three bundles and
recently spent a lot I serve the exact
length right here and they'll be in
description box below
I love the tell you guys honestly I'm
pretty sure you guys love a few basic
house moving I'm so extraordinary I know
oh there's my commercial huh oh yeah
this is great
the pairs really nice muster very
natural
has really nice flow to it and so far I
haven't had any I haven't felt any
tangling and you shedding let's see
let's do a little test really fast and
see I get you shedding only one with one
or two strands I'm going to get to even
see that so basically this hairs on it
looks to all not me I like it hope you
guys liked it as well this hair did come
straight however I curled it just
because I like doing different stuff on
my hair so yeah if you guys want to see
how I got some kind of curls I'll link a
video worm or endemic side I've already
done her avocado curls
they're very did you enjoy the class
I'll link that video below but much I've
watched this you know customizing video
and I'm going to do more detailed videos
that help you guys customize you will
make your waist look more natural my
next video on this little series I guess
you can call it is how to lay your way
what we got to be free spray become this
come on tricky
an evening with tricky so stay tuned for
that but let have lost the videos you
guys might get sweet viewers thumbs up
and please subscribe and I'll see you
guys next one so the first thing you
need to do which is very important and
bleach the knots believe it or not I
used to make our wigs I you should not
wish to knock that out okay you know it
is a really matter it totally matters if
you've never bleached not before and you
bleed too now you completely see a
difference and so I've learned on
bleaching knots because you have to have
a thick consistency I add the developer
first then the powder I just have more
control that way and so I use a 45
developer and just a BW to powder you
use any bleaching powder I'm not sure if
they'll make a difference I use either
this one or the quick blue or even like
another I think it's like all like glad
you scoop whatever it's called but yeah
all those work and so yeah I just mix
the bleach and then if I need to add
more powder out add it to make it
thicker and I'll show you guys the
exactly sister you want to go for I'm
going to show it in like one second
right here this is what you want to go
for like something that like is thick
but not too thick because it makes it
hard to spread up the frontal so you
want to be thick enough to where you
pick up on the brush and you like took a
brush downwards it kind takes a couple
seconds for it to fall just like this
so here's a 3-2 vice fronted before I do
anything to it it almost like it's pre
plucked it has like an more natural
hairline sometimes you get them and it's
like straight across so this is I kind
of like customized pre plugs for you of
course you have to do a little more and
so now we'll put the bleach on the
frontal sorry it's cropped down the
viewing I didn't realize it until just
now but yeah I'm going to just apply the
bleach after the frontal ELISA I'm going
pretty fast but that's because sped up
but towards the end I put it in normal
time and you have to see how slow I do
this I just take my time because I don't
want to be too fast too rough because
then the bleach will seep through the
knots and bleach the actual hair and
that is not a good look so you want to
go lay this low it's very slow even
slower if you're new take your time you
know it's no rush so I put on my
mannequin head and for this process you
want the hair to be wet it's much easier
to plug when it's wet and it gives you
an idea of just how much you are
lowering the dip speaks when the hair is
dry and looks thicker but when it's wet
you can see just how much you're doing
the hair out and you can see a later on
the video because I go back and what the
hair once it's dried because it's hair
dries pretty fast not in a bad way but I
mean it was hot my lights are bright is
just it's naturally going to dry a
little fast and so here I impart into
two sections because I want to be to
show comparison from one side to the
other and so I part a little section
from the front and this is the part I'm
going to customize I leave half of the
front tool alone because that hair back
there needs to be thick enough to cover
the tracks on my wig and I learned it
the hard way I used to plug back there
that I realized it spins out the hair
and then you can see the track so you
don't want that so you just want to
section it out and then you just part
pieces and then you just plug randomly
you don't have pluck to uniform because
then you're creating actual parts you
just want to pluck randomly like maybe
going like a zigzag motion it's just how
I do it I'm pretty sure with time I'll
come with a new technique I'm always
teaching myself new things but for now
that's how I do it I just pluck randomly
and I part I brush the you know the hair
that I plucked out out of it you know
keep it clean and I'm yeah I just go
through and I just pluck part pluck part
I check it to see you know what it's
looking like
and then I just keep on poking
just to warn you this is a very long and
tedious process which is why I do not do
this with all of my wigs because I'm
honestly kind of lazy and this takes
forever and honestly like I could have
kept going I could I feel like it
couldn't even been better I mean I think
it looks nice but I could have kept
going I just don't want sitting out too
much but this is going to take you at
least 30 to 40 minutes so make sure
you're not in a rush and make sure you
have time to really just take care
because I've been in the day a pair that
you're purchasing and you spent money on
it you don't mess it up and it's like
you want to look at best or if not best
my god grammar as good as it possibly
looks I mean you know you spent your
money on it I mean you're going to be
wearing it in public just take your time
you know and just watch Netflix or
YouTube that's what I do I always have
lon order on no matter what I'm doing I
literally have a Hulu account just to
watch Law &amp;amp; Order and I literally just
re-watch the seasons over and over and
over and over again I don't get bored so
when I'm filming making my wigs I always
have law and order on and that makes the
process to go by much faster because I'd
be technically like doing this that's
like one lot order episode look at it
that way
just one lot our episode see I'm sore
see the hair got dry if I went and wet
it and now you can see the actual
density of it and then I'm going to pair
to the other side I like to check
because all you're doing is it kind of
could feel like you're not doing much
because you don't see a dramatic
difference until you compare to the
other side like oh I see so here's some
slo-mo action here's the other side I
haven't touched and here is the side
that I've been working on so like do
that to encourage you because when
you're doing it it really doesn't feel
like you're doing much until you compare
with you and you're like okay factually
worth my time and so now I'm just going
to customize the baby hair you know I
like to do this whilst my mannequin head
it's much easier I am capable of doing
it what's on my head but it's much
easier to do it on mannequin head just
like saves you more time
so after I do my baby hairs that pretty
much concludes this video you guys see
how it looks like in the beginning and I
didn't get any slow most of me in this
wig for this electro some let you guys
know right now that the mannequins to do
my slow moves for me they're all reading
me but would I'd like this video give it
a thumbs up and please subscribe and
stay tuned for my next informative video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
