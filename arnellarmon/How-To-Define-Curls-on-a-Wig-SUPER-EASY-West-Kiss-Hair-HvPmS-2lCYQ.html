welcome my energy is a little low it's
because this looked like six times
filming this intro because I haven't
filmed since my arnelle doing stuff
video and so whenever you I would say
this forever you go a while without
filming it's super weird throwing again
so excuse me if my energy super low I
didn't sing kind of frustrated but
anyways just from this video I literally
just got done from this video on how I
stopped this wig not although this is
technically a wig video what I do in
order to style this week we're doing on
your natural hair because I do the same
exact being on my natural hair and I do
have more nationair videos coming soon
however not yet and so on this video
super straightforward super trick to the
point I literally just stop this hair I
show you guys how to just to find curls
your extensions your natural hair it
just a way to let defined curls and make
them look nicer and this more balance II
this hair is super duper nice it was so
easy to work with easier than I thought
it would be this hair was sent to my
West cos hair and I only used one and a
half bundles and a frontal for this plus
they send me three bundles and this how
the hair looks when you first get it
whoever wants you unravel it the hair
does get a little um well it gets frizzy
and so that's why you need to you know
wedded the product in order to maintain
the curls and make them look more
defined because once you wet the hair
and around for them the it won't look
like this it's gonna look you know way
more frizzy and so in this video I
simply show you guys how to style pretty
much top curly hair alright so um as far
as pros the cons about this hair I knew
we have no comments I thought about it I
had no tingling no shedding no nothing
the track split super easily I loo have
nothing best about this hair pros will
be that it's super manageable su v--'s
and work with however it could be
because I picked short bundles usually
when you pick shorter bundles of course
gonna be easier because it's less hair
deal with so I cannot speak for how the
super long bundles will let work I can't
speak to that I can't say that you did
like you know
in this same texture if you have this
same experience as me because when you
get short bundles they're always a
breeze and I cut this even shorter this
is probably like 10 inches or shorter
than that so of course the musical may
work with but that's my thing on the
hair if you were to send me before and
you'd have some feedback or an opinion
leave that comment down below for anyone
watch this video who's interested
purchase men's hair and all the hair
links and everything will be down below
in the description box so if you're
doing this video to find it helpful if
you use these products before let me
know this video thumbs up and subscribe
and I'll see you guys later alright so
this is the hair in its natural state it
was wet and dry it down so looks a
little frizzy it honestly doesn't look
bad however I want the curls me more
defined and so I'm gonna show you guys
how I do it right now so first you want
to wet it with a spray bottle this
bottle act used to have like this blow
dry like beach way to spray but I lost
my other water bottle so I have to empty
this one and put water in this one or
its use it and then you want to get
Denman and brush which is like perfect
for curly hair it like defines curls
without tangling them and so you wanna
you know just wet the hair and brush
through it and colleges detangle it and
like pretty much starts to define the
curls using the brush by itself and then
we're going to add product and here him
I'm trying to go through the hair with
some scissors and kind just fix it
because I do like a bad chop job on this
I'm not the best of cutting hair so I'm
just you know fixing pieces that I feel
like we're too long and it was like
obvious that they're uneven I'm gonna
wet the hair a little bit more and then
in like four seconds or five mmm
what am I gonna do it all right now I'm
going to take my coil a custom I'd miss
jessie's and I'm going to take my black
vanilla for when combing creme of
Carol's Daughter and I mix these two
together I like mixing a cream and a gel
I don't know why it just I feel like it
just makes the curls perfect so they're
not too country crunchy but they're not
too soft and frizzy either and so I'm
just gonna you know like rub it through
the hair and like the
prematurely run through the hair and I
thought I'd get done you know rubbing
through it with my hands I'm gonna take
a brush and brush through it to make
sure like you know all the hair is
coated with the product all right so if
you haven't noticed already I feel like
the back of this wig is a little
top-heavy that's only thing I don't like
about it which kind of sucks I took my
time making this wig I really tried to
make sure it's flat however the dome cap
I used was too big and so the bag is a
little top-heavy however after the hairs
dried down it doesn't look that bad it
kind of like makes more sense it makes
look more full but when it's wet I
flights to back this little funny style
anyways after I get done combing the
products through my hair I'm going to
take the diva fuser or diva dryer it's
from diva curl you can get at Ulta and
online and I'm gonna use it to diffuse
my hair I finally learn how to diffuse
my hair the proper way I just don't have
to be patient and you have to you know
just go to different sections just kind
of hold it for at least ten seconds and
I do it on warm I don't do it on hot
because I like the like if it's more hot
it's gonna make the hair like frizzy and
dry but warm is perfect I don't like
using the cold setting
so it took me about like eight to ten
minutes to defuse this out of my head
probably I'm a dad maybe like five to
ten minutes and I'm gonna show you guys
the difference when you defuse and when
you just you know leave it alone so you
guys see how the defuse side looks like
just more full and the curls of bouncy
air and just has more body that's why I
love defusing now and so I am going to
defuse the other side of camera because
I mean it's kind of repetitive and then
I'll be back to pretty much finish off
this video so after the fuse on their
side I realize that this cut is super
and even I don't know you guys can't
tell but it's super not even at all and
so I'm trying to go back and try to even
it out I don't think I did the right way
because I feel like it's kind of
complicated doing this wall on your head
it would have been easier to do this on
a mannequin head because cutting curly
hair is kind of difficult anyways cuz
you just don't know and I don't know I
end up just you know just sticking with
it I just let it be and I mean it look
cool to me so that is the end of this
video if you enjoyed this you find it
helpful be sure to give this a thumbs up
please subscribe if you plan to pretty
much recreate what I did in this video

I could see your looks and I'll see you
