new welcome today's video is going to be
on how to get like super long curly or
wavy hair to have body it to be nice and
soft now I know that some super random
but believe it or not I have tried a lot
of curly and wavy hair and there's
really a way to put products in to make
sure that when it dries down it's
manageable now you'll get curly hair and
it'll feel pretty nice when it's wet I
mean most curly bundles feel pretty cool
in their way but if you have never tried
curly weave when you tried multiple for
the weaves you would know that sometimes
if you don't stop the right wait and
once it dries down its dry it gets
tangley it can get a little matted it
just starts acting funny and so this
video I decided to do it they don't like
what I use to kind of like style this
hair this hair specifically I haven't
uses products on other curly hair and
use other things for super curly hair
this is more like a curl waiting you
know curb slash weight and so I show you
guys what I'd use to like pretty much
make this hair looks like right now it's
full of body it's nice but doesn't dry
the frizzy because I've had hair like
that before especially super long hair
super long hair super long curly wavy
hair is really really high maintenance I
typically don't really deal with that
all but I mean that kind of hair on it
and so I picked this out because I've
never tried this kind of hair before and
buy this hair I mean Indian deep live
this is indeed deep wave and this is
from and I'll insert their name because
I don't you not pronounce it I want to
say it's e lr hair I don't know it's
such a difficult name but I'm just you
know in suruc I was doing you guys I
don't know you can help me out for you
North Mountain but this is their Indian
deep way but I got 26 inches now I'm
pretty short so I can't even show you
how low it gets but it does reach you
don't be you have
there by your it reaches that like the
bottom of that if that makes any sense
at all and I'm five - almost five three
if that helps
and so 26 inch bundle goes down to my
little V area why I say be like that
like it weighs this certain deep wave
not I'm trying even before I try to deep
wait before not Indian though I tried
Malaysia deep wave I've tried brazilian
deep wave but believe it or not there's
a difference
I'm really really learning hair the more
I get I'm really learning it brazilians
more course Malaysian is nice but stupid
on a thinner side it's always thinner
than Brazilian and Indians almost in the
middle and so I had to like this hair
especially prepared till it the last
deep wave hair I tried I actually like
this year a lot because it was like
lower maintenance due to the texture and
just the overall feel to it it's lower
maintenance so in this video to show you
guys when I use in order to style it as
far as my review goes I made something a
week oh so I've worried enough to kind
of like fill it out I don't always post
pictures when I'm wearing my wigs
because I don't always wear makeup so if
you guys are ever wonder like does she
wear her wigs outside of YouTube early
off Instagram I do there's some weeks I
always wear out of time I still as post
pictures I don't know like three four
six days off post a picture and I wear a
lot of weights in between that time so
just let you guys know yes I do wear
these wigs outside these videos but um
yeah I would say I'm shortening of the
only column that I have I don't really
have any cons I did notice some shady
boxes on the hair just honestly normal
for long curly hair and I'd ditch this
shedding during the video that was seed
the shame that I got
positives are pros I think it's very low
maintenance it's really not that hard to
deal with and that's really good being
that this hair is very long I think it's
even style I think it has a nice less to
it the last year's and really high at
all but I think that kind of asked the
natural look of it it doesn't tangle
much now I can't like run my fingers
through it super smoothly without
feelings of brick
which is awesome written or for lawn
care but it's not like tangling and
shaking like crazy
I'm pretty sure I ran my fingers through
it like over and over again I'll prank
get some strength which is totally
normal totally fine basically what I'm
saying is this hair seems normal find it
seems cool to me if you have ever order
from this company before and you've had
either good experience of that
experience always comment to that below
I don't believe those comments if you go
through my videos I always leave every
comment regarding your own personal
review on the cross I'm reviewing only
because I think it's helpful you never
know you know sometimes they censor
people certain hair and so if you've
ever on the board from his company
leader experienced outlooks it may help
someone who wants to order but until
then I'm let you guys watch this videos
been really quick I'm speeded up and do
a voiceover if you enjoyed give it a
thumbs up you can subscribe and I'll see
you guys later
alright so the hair is soaking wet I
just got the shower and it's all looks
like I think it looks pretty good wet
boss I like how it looks when it's dried
down so I just love like the wild look
that it has I don't know
so first time take this cream of nature
argan oil foam
I love foam because you could put how
much foam you want into the hair and
when it dries down it's like it was
never there it just keeps moisture
locked in and it's just it's just so
nice I can't explain how much I
literally love foam and I'm mad that it
took me so long to even discover it foam
is great on your natural hair when you
don't wanna put heat on it and you want
to like set your hair that's another
video but foam is really great so I put
foam in it first
so in this part is showing the shading
that I got it's honestly nothing
considering that I'm wearing very long
curly wavy hair usually all curly hair
sheds or like you get shedding literally
even natural curly hair sheds and so
this really wasn't nothing next one take
my curls daughter hair milk I'm not
gonna use too much cuz this stuff isn't
cheap but I can't believe I put it on my
weave to begin with but I like this wig
and I want to make sure it has a lot of
moisture at all times that doesn't dry
out on me and so I'm willing to use you
know my better products and so next I'm
taking my curl enhancing smoothie by
Shea Moisture their own cancel guys I'm
joking I don't know their status of
their their cancellation but I like
using curly hair and because I don't
usually use it on my my real hair
anymore I don't really like how it works
my real anymore I just use on my
extensions because it's still good
product and I mean it's cool and so yeah
I'm gonna continue to distribute that
product all through the hair and then
I'll move on to the next step
alright so next up took my blow-dryer to
kinda help me dry this down I know I'll
have a diffuser yet I'm gonna get one
soon but I just use this for now this
blow-dryer from Amica if you guys it's
$300 I even know that they sense to me
cool like a blow dryer like i love good
blowjobs this is a really bomb blow
dryer
I just um when I was going to get the
link to the blow dryer so you guys can
go check it out I saw the price I'm like
Jesus but honestly I've had enough boy
guys to know that this is a very good
quality one so um I think it's I'm not
even talking about that after that just
let it air dry then insert some pictures
of what looks like when it's fully dried
sorry I didn't get video footage but
yeah this is it I told you guys to be a
very quick video if you enjoyed it
please give a thumbs up and be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
