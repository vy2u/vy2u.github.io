welcome I'm right now I can make this
into really fast fortunately for you
guys had me you guys who I talked to you
guys ears off to listen to the color
exactly five minutes and that was like
four minutes ago so um this video
originally I'm just going to do a tour
on how do you make it when your skin is
breaking out which is this essentially
is that as well but I plunged am let
this stroll is great for people who dry
skin because my skin is super dry down
right now not sure that was about out
insert some pictures it has like a rash
right here and so I didn't wanna make it
what's the last two days it was just
been breaking out but I had to fill
today this hair tutorial which you guys
will seat the fool Jesus I've had to
film today and I'm like I don't want my
face beat beat for this makeup I mean
for this hair look so it could look
right and so I think I'm gonna do my
makeup
Bhama is doing the wait to wear it still
it's flawless and not too cakey because
you guys know use it when you're
breaking out you have a texture of skin
foundation and powder on other stuff a
like highlights that it makes it look
even worse and so this tutorial will be
great for you if you're a break it out
you have texture skin or you have dry
skin and you want to beat your face
while still looking really cool so I'm a
Latina watch this if you enjoyed it
friend it helpful let me know the
comments down below so some love that
show some globe thumbs up the sky on a
good stuff and I'll see you guys later
oh don't mind the fact that I'm uses
backdrop for two videos uh I have to do
a tune one okay this is really nice
backdrop so don't even mind that all
right Elizabeth post a video all right
so first thing I do is moisturize my
skin first and going with my oil by Joey
cosmetics is daily clarifying treatment
oil and I love this little because it's
like wolf
I mean it's oil but it doesn't make your
skin feel too greasy and so you know I
just do my beloved rips
they rub them in making a lose
moisturize
you have a lot of texture on like this
area right here know what that's about
it's kind of really annoying my
foreheads fine under here is fine
but it's very texture right here and I
mean everyone has different ideas of
breakouts I don't sometimes when I talk
about it keep on your skin spine but
it's like my skin everyone's skin is
different so my idea breakup could be
dimmed from like here I gave a breakout
but to me that this is brick and I even
post on Instagram I'll insert that as
well
it was all red and it was just it was
tripping but um anyways somewhere I can
use my h2o hydrating gel moisturizer if
it's actually the cream I have to I have
the gel which is like a blue and then
this is a cream and that's like old
Shore hydrating so it's like a different
tint of blue but it's really nice it's
super good for dry skin I post this on
my snapchat multiple times I have so
many of these moisturize from h2o you
guys like I don't know if they're just
nice and they know that's my favorite
but they're always sending me tonight I
don't complain because I finish the jar
it's like this is like halfway empty I
finished them all because it's just
they're so hydrating like it's like
water for your skin no I just rub it in
and that with the oil makes my skin feel
super moisturize so the point of this
like to Touro whatever is to know that
if your skin is textured or like if you
having a breakout you want to like be
pretty much to keep your skin hydrated
as possible because what happens is like
you could be do your foundation I would
be look good and then once you stay with
that powder it's like the powders bring
out the texture like when I used to 3x
how would you make up on all different
type of skin types by notice that what I
would do makeup on people who had like
acne or like you know more textured skin
it would be cool and then once you start
putting the powders like powder
highlight blush Connor that's when all
the protective skin will really start to
like come out and so you want to make
sure you're using a lot of creams in
this
you know in this makeup look dry skin -
alright so next you're gonna prime your
skin and what I'm gonna use is this skin
base by Mac and what's a pump that up
I'm going to let me grab it now I'm
gonna mix it with this honey do me up
because this is really this was really
hydrated as well and it keeps it glow
and aunt Ellen mixing primers sometimes
I do it randomly I like mixing stuff a
lot because like some product could have
certain benefits while another one has
like you know different benefits oh this
feels so good together
so it's not bad to mix products of
course you know you know the extreme
yield mix any create anything crazy like
you know you want Carter's gonna need
breakouts or anything you never know but
these two together for like a dream oh
my god
these together Louise like a moisturizer
but I just feel so good boom and my
skin's been the kind of dry where it's
so dried out and raschi that whatever
I'm fitting to my moisturizer on it my
sin kind of burns the stings that only
happens on my skin SuperDuper dry so I
felt that I put on moisturizer on let a
little like teen links it's so dry it's
like it's almost hard for that the
moisturizer oil to be pinched or my skin
it's been dry now even my arm gonna
break out eczema and just my skin's in
really really dry really I don't know
what that's about
alright so next time choose a foundation
now I pulled out my fin tea yet almost
use that and I realize it's like more of
a matte a matte finish by love into
foundation guys but you want to pick a
foundation there like and you know it's
gonna look good but it's not to try and
excite mattifying so one of my favorites
all time is this NARS sheer glow it is
perfect I need to buy another one soon I
have two of them but one of them is
running now I think it's this one but
you don't still use it it hurts making
and pour it out but this one's empty I
really rather one hold on
good they got two of these
let's get the other one all right that's
much better
and they took a damp sponge and uses fin
T Beauty sponge and you're just going to
blend it all out like you would normally
do your foundation
all right so no foundation now it's time
to conceal now you want to take a
concealer that's like what depends on
the coverage you want you could take a
concealer that's not so full coverage
because those are usually like on a
thinner side if I like the tart shape
tape it's like it gives you just amount
of coverage so it's not too creamy and
thick you want to avoid the super creamy
and thick products and this one I feel
like it may appear to be creamy and
thick when you first apply it but when
you blend it out it really smooth out so
that's why I chose this one and I mean
I've other concealers like for example
like I would not use my cabinet qualm
concealer but this look that's way too
thick um that would yeah that would not
look good with my skin being this dry
and also with my skin you know breaking
out that would not look good
so I mean you kind of you can't just
know what concealer would work and I
think it's heart shaped tape is the bomb
I can't let me tell you this concealer I
kept hearing about it it took me months
to get it if I got it now I see why
everyone loves it
you just open that out
all right so I'll brown the concealer
now time to contour know when it comes
to contouring a more drier Bergin off
skin you need to be selective for
example typically I would go for like a
thick cream like my Vinci beauty contour
stick or you know some of that type of
cream but like I said you want to go for
products that aren't so thick and heavy
and so a good alternative is a
foundation that of course is like darker
than your skin
there's also for making forever this is
a shade Y 535 and hope it's not too dark
it shouldn't be okay gliese on my hand
I'm just going to take so I got the back
of my sponge and just put it you know
the place where normally contouring is
cool because it gives you a more natural
and contour as well it is not so heavy
you know you don't want heavy you don't
want cakey because you just don't want
to intensify it need to run this or any
breakouts I'm just going to blend that
in places I would normally contour and
yes it's a looking more natural looking
if you want a little more intense you
just put up another layer which is what
I do sometimes you know you just go on
top of it
all right so I lay down my contour now
it's time to set the place I conceal
this one gets kind of tricky because you
want to go too heavy you definitely
don't I'm fake so what I do when I don't
want to you know do too much as far as
you know putting too much powder just I
want cake on my skin I set my concealer
with the brush you guys know I was doing
a sponge that really packs a product in
but if you want me to go very
lightweight you could just set with the
brush now if you really really heavily
crease on your eyes then set with the
sponge but because I use a more or less
lightly concealer it shouldn't creep so
I'm fine all right so I'm gonna take
this brush with a makeup Shack I'm just
gonna press that powder underneath my
eyes
this is looking so flawless you guys
alright so I said move my eyes I'm not
gonna set my forehead that's unnecessary
it is a crease I just do it out of habit
sometimes now I'm gonna set the entire
face so to send my entire face I'm using
Sephora micro smooth side you powder I
don't know how I forgot the name I'm use
this Mac brushes 140s I like this
because it's a curved and super alike
it's not too dense um when your skin is
breaking out it's more dry and you're
setting your face you don't wanna use a
brush like too dense because a minute
packs on more proud didn't I get two
more cakey you want to use a very
flexible brush I notice I had a word
that I came not remembering but you want
to use a brush to suck more flexible and
you'd want to lightly stead and to make
sure you're really setting you touch
your skin and you could tell I'm like
right now it feels a little damp but
it's not wet which is a good thing if I
want to set it's a little bit more and
if you can rub the brush on your skin
smoothly without it and you be in any
wagging which you could use you tell if
the foundation is too wet it needs to be
set more then that means you set it up
you just don't over sex like I said
you're avoiding cape like this area I
could feel some lacking so kind of put a
powder there so I'm gonna put some more
powder and now a car run smoothly so you
can tell the time things just like rub
your brush against your skin not too
harshly you want to mess with your
foundation but just rub it lightly and
you could feel the difference um you'll
feel it lag a little bit you're gonna
mean so just that wow this is looking so
great you got if I was kind of scared to
makeup today because my skin is breaking
out and I hate doing makeup my face is
breaking out because it just makes me
look like just not great but this looks
so now I'm going to do my eyebrows off
camera cuz this this video is not about
that I'm gonna do one eye off-camera I
want to do a little bit eyeshadow and
then I'll do the other
on camera so I'll be alright star my
brows in my eye off camera I'm just
extra super I looked so it's just like
get into it because I don't want to like
take too long
alright so I'm using my new modern here
no songs pub and accessibility heal so
in my favor I should have helped ever
I'm taking off see an advert orange I'm
not gonna use a primer because I don't
want it to be like too pigmented I want
this should be very simple and easy so
pick those two colors this morphe brush
that doesn't have a number anymore it's
so old it's all fade in annexing your
key on it but so for my favorite more
brushes um I wish you didn't mean I'm so
sorry guys it just like that but the
perfect blending brush to take those
shades and then I'm going to take the
shade real car real girl whatever I'm
gonna focus out more on towards the
corner I'm comic smoking this out that
would take these shade a red ochre mix
with Rooker so it's not too dark once
again focus out on the corner and then
take right ochre by itself and focus
that more in the corner this is
literally like a 2 minute I look now I'm
gonna take my Mac mixing medium puts on
my hand then I'm going to take this flat
brush where makeup addiction cosmetics
the classic shader and I'm gonna put
some of the mix a medium on the brush
them a dip into primavera
this sheet right here and that's what I
use for my lid I'm gonna first dip that
in there put that on my lid
then I didn't pretty there and then pack
that onto my lid and the Mac makes me a
Miss so um these doesn't transfer on to
my crease that hooded lids do damn I
talked to Olivia if I'd held its face I
would do something where woods not on
this in her or it Walt still whatever to
red ochre and real girl just pack that
on and I'm taking more than that mixing
me in the rest of a that by my hand pack
that all on top to seal the pigment in
so just take this and blend out the
edges then we use this safe brush I
might take primavera and bloom it out of
my eyebrow to highlight the brow very
simple and I'm not I'm not trying to
look up too much I don't want to
transfer once dried and still wet now
I'm gonna take the shade realtor makes
it time a right ochre and take this
makeup - cosmetics pencil brush I'm
gonna focus that towards the outer
corner of my lower lash line it's hard
talking do this the same time
the psychic ahead too much and I'm gonna
take the same brush used earlier to
apply my powder and just kind of brush
our meat here to defuse that I flipped
up a little too pigmented and there's no
like powder on this I'm just using the
excess powder all right cool
now I'm gonna do left she's a mess
scared later looks I bought this you
must mascara by Mac the big bag flatten
the bulb at lash I bought it actually
they said to me originally I liked it so
much I bought it and I lost it I don't
know why isn't it here please in here no
I know where it's at
it's okay I'm so excited I thought I
lost it's in the bag and my liver all
right so I'm gonna put this high and on
and then you just high like Becca
they sent see me it's still in the box
and I thought I will deal with this look
because it's really bronzy they sent me
to they send me this one and it's called
lilyc geode but it's more on the purple
side which is why the packages per hole
so that definitely go this look I'll
show you guys looks pretty cool too much
oh it's very it's a very light
highlighter I'll show you that another
video YouTube probably my unicorn
tutorial cumbia moly well from where my
looks I'm use this one and it's like uh
it's different tones and I'm just gonna
use all open and this is called gradient
glow just swirl it all around
don't worry I'm conduits sloppy desks
I'm gonna go over it with my other brush
to tone it down fine it
I should tone it down a tad bit so it's
more seamless now I'm not going to get
back into this I'm just take the
leftover powder I'd be the tip of my
nose just so it's not someone tins you
know a fake bridge top lip and my chin
just to add some glow there extra right
now so that's very good for the face I'm
not gonna contour powder and not gonna
use blush you can I just feel like I'm
not gonna go too crazy with the powders
and I just I don't take it on so I'm
gonna give I say spray on a set my face
all right so some my face i'm using
mac's fix+ this it's Teddy and I say
it's great but it's super hydrating and
it makes you look a little more dewy so
I'm just gonna use that oh it's
brand-new so I have to let it pop out
first all right cool
and feel free to drown yourself in this
the more the better
you don't need soaked but I always go
ham on my second spray because it just
gets rid of any other powder residue it
just makes your makeup just completely
settle into your skin it hydrates you it
feels really great you don't want to use
it like a matte setting spray that
defeats the purpose and everything we
just did but this is great to make the
drugs have a classroom to my blow dryer
I mean come on the cool setting you
don't want to be hot because I feel like
heat like for example when you have an
eczema it's not recommend take super hot
baths because like the heat the hot
water just let the heat itself kind of
try to get out a little more so I'm
applying that to my face let me do the
cool setting I'm just gonna like blow it
on my face
just make a dry look faster I was you
this this was so flawless in French ha
all right so now I can I lick one hour
behind you lip liner - Mac they're so
out of freakin cork if you have a
maximum immunity they have a court fee
like is anyone I'll pay you up he pay
you the money but I got chestnut because
I mean that's not the second best in
Cork some people grab it and I grabbed
my mascara do my lashes do my lips and
then yeah I'll be right back all right
so first one new lips well there's
something weird okay but it'll he'll
make sense hopefully so first friend lip
liner on was just the chest on my back
it's brand new
I love Verna lip liners so first line
was first
all right so now I'm going to put oil on
my lips it sounds weird and I want to
line my lips first because I put oil
before Italy impossible uh get the liner
stick and I mean yeah you don't want
that until they read the lines and oils
and I'm going to blend into the liner a
little bit to you just to diffuse it
because I don't want to want to be too
dark anyways but the reason I put the
oil is because when my skin is dry my
lips are also dry as well and like the
last couple days it's been so annoyed
cuz like my lips I don't know what's
going on my skin but I live to this
thing where and almost like we're kind
of rash you up and so have your lips
ever been so dry to where when you put
chapstick on it immediately dries out
and your lips just feel super textured
and grainy like there's like sort of a
rash and then your skin is peeling
that's one of those we're doing and so
I'm in order to avoid them drying out
again I'm just gonna put oil before my
little lipstick because I'm I don't want
them to dry out and so coming all first
now for the lipstick I'm using cork my
dose of colors and I put them on top you
guys see it still shows up no problem
early don't want to be too dry because
my lips
I finally got them back to feeling like
the using feel and I'm not going to grab
and I hate it
then you can rub it on your finger so it
looks really good
it almost kind of like mixes the oil
into like a lipstick - they're like it's
still gonna look a little matte
I know you don't matter oh my skin feels
so notice that hydrated
I probably look - Matt right now to
enjoy Tom no but it does not feel dry at
one dose of colors is a really great
little lipstick I mean if you have dry
lips and you want a really cool lipstick
where does the color it's cuz they're
formula is like perfect the best liquid
lipstick for me ever
and so I'm gonna lash on camera I'm
gonna tear on on camera cause I gotta
increase I love this stuff you guys I'm
Grant said I could eat my Mac an accent
for one but when I drool over products
but I'm so impatient I might need it
right now I don't want too late so I did
when I bought it I think I was like
maybe $18 something and something put
that on this mascara gets perfect after
like a week or two it's nice when you
first get it of course but after a week
or two when it starts to slightly dry
out just a bit it's literally so on yeah
my lips right now yes if it's not my
scare on my lashes on and they'll be
back in this long-ass video all right
guys I did my lashes these looks
interesting I'm there from violent boss
and these are the lashes but I cult
where's Annie oh I'm not seeing
name on this thing that's weird you know
these definitely do have a name on them
oh look like it's hot they're pretty
interesting I feel like the front
pockets longer so I thought I know it's
kind of weird you guys see how it looks
a little thick I don't really like that
look so I'm gonna cut that piece off
just a little more natural like it just
looks a little too dramatic in the front
for me you easy way did there
by the way I'm not cutting my relations
at all I'm just trying to like I just
think a little thick in the front part I
don't know anyways this the finished
look and I'm doing my hair which gonna
be a separate video so stay tuned for
that and I'm reference levels and um
yeah hoping after this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
