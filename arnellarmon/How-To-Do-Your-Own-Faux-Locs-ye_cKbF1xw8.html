hope that I am because I'm not filming
this over any glasses I actually did a
kind of serious note we'll talk about
that another video um I'm fine doing my
fall off tutorial I cannot wait to be
done with this cuz I'm tired of doing
these things I've done them about like
three times now I'm learning that
there's literally a technique to it um
I thought it was super easy that's not
the case because I mean it's really
technique like it's really certain what
you have to do in order to make it look
legit
I've already gets that um it is very hot
right now it is probably like 80 degrees
in my room my boobs are sweating I need
to put some flowers baby powder on these
things the fans on I said I said fans on
so you guys hear it I'm sorry I just I
got a live I got a survive I never to
talk through because I live in Oakland
and it's very noisy so if whatever you
hear sirens or something crazy to happen
outside or you know just noise I'm sorry
okay head out there start a video all
right so I left this section out this
section right here this could fit about
época products I took them out I left
this section out so this perspex I'm
going to do they're very simple but I
mean this is certain technique i'ma show
you guys and I'll also let this little
section out because this part is shorter
so I want to show you guys how I do the
faux locs
on like I guess you can say medium
length hair and then we should get how
to do like on shorter hair because it's
different ways cuz the short of the hair
the harder it is to kind of grip it um
yeah anyways I'm just sure look from
because there's no my camera battery
would have been lasted doing this whole
thing this takes it's a good all-day
thing I'm pretty sure if you do out with
people it's faster but if you're doing
yourself took all day so first before I
even get to start them show you guys a
hair I used I want to put the names
everything in the description box below
but I want to show you guys just what it
looks like and what the packaging looks
like I use Marleen hair to do the locks
so here's what it looks like take your
screenshots now it just like this I've
tried I because I did like multiple
times I tried different hair this hair
is the best hair to me I like the
texture of it pretty soft it's easy to
work with and it has
nice luster to it so it gives your full
locks a nice little shine and to do my
braids and you guys will see what I do
braids in a minute
I use this hair take your screenshots
now it's almost easier to actually see
the packaging first adjust the name and
sort of looks like just read the
braiding hair I don't know you can kind
of get any brand of braiding hair there
is I could start it cuz I'd like I've
been talking for a long time so I'm
gonna zoom up into my hair are you up
there okay so here we are now this time
around
last time I was partying my hair with a
comb this hair now decided to kind just
like freestyle and part of my hand kind
of want to look more sloppy and natural
so I take a little section now the
section depends on how big you want them
but I'm in Russian I'm kinda I'm ready
to be done with these things so may get
it a slightly bigger section for the
hair and I'm going to get like a section
that's like this big yeah that's good
you get tail sirens I was right I was
right I'm not to guess here I'm so
predictable this section I get is why
don't you talk to your foot oh my god
sirens now you will need gel I'm just
using pro style gel you're gonna use a
different type of gel if your hair
shorter I'll show you guys that in one
second but for you know just regular if
your hair is like at least this long
regular gel would work so I'm gonna get
a little bit the gel oh this much and
put a little bit where I'm going to
start my braid I'm gonna put a little
bit on my hair just kind of like spread
it out now to start my braid I get this
piece and place it on here okay
and I grab this piece with this finger
to tell a gel in my hand and I kind of
loop like that I'll start my braid off
and then I take this piece put it over
that piece pull this down those sirens
are so freaking crazy then I start a
braid wait do you guys hear that I'm
like really freaking out because this is
Decker I predicted
Oakland for you so I'm just going to do
a breed
well oh my god when I said it there'll
be sirens I was joking I don't actually
want to be right about that
I don't think that's gonna be right oh
gosh can you guys hear that that's
freakin nuts
yo moving a Pleasanton I think they're
gone okay
so you're just gonna braid until your
natural hair stops and then you don't
even have to braid the rest of this you
just totally alone now okay if the
sirens going okay the Marley hair
actually comes section for you so I'm
just gonna grab a piece out of that now
I elected with the Marley hairs I kind
of like to pick it apart a little bit so
it's not so perfect and I kind of
stretch it by pulling it
I'm really like wild is really science
that's really nice to me okay if you
want strong like this I'm going to grab
this like that you're going to put that
over this section while still holding
that piece pull it from underneath and
you're literally I do this about like
maybe two or three times around the root
area root what root what side the word
for that around the oh yeah these are my
roots that make sense
just kind of hook it okay and then you
just proceed to wrap it you literally
just wrapping it around that braid and
try to make to where the hair is kind of
like spread out a little bit you don't
want the hair like this because then you
can see the hair from underneath you
kind of want to make sure it's kind of
like flat so it's actually covering the
hair just will be covering for the lock
some that I messed up on but at this
point I'm I'm like I'm not doing you
guys over look I'm so over doing them
over I came to count how many times I've
done them over at this point I was like
you know what if they're not all perfect
then asked to the room you know the
realness of them you know
so you're just wrapping now the camera
that cut off cuz I can't you know get
myself wrapping the bottom I'm we're
just gonna repeat this motion until I
get to the very bottom I'm literally
just wrapping and I'm wrapping I'm
wrapping okay you see what I'm doing
here you see how it's like getting lucky
so yeah I'm just gonna keep wrapping I
want to do a story time I don't know
about what I want to take off the time I
stab this guy's tire but you go crazy
but it's actually a very entertaining
story it's actually very funny but
kinda crazy I'm not crazy no girl
we're motions what does that make me go
easy all right
I'm still rapping by the way who this
one's look at Natalie's took the noise
okay and keep rapping bt-dubs for the
next few ones I'm totally gonna speed it
up I'm not gonna let you guys missed any
talk cuz I be talking and talking and
I'd be seeing stuff that shouldn't be
heard okay and no more talking so that
is the end what I did was as I was
rapping down when I got towards the end
I started rapping back up to end the
lock I'll show you guys on the next one
cuz I kind of totally forgot to do it on
this one
but um now what you're going to do do
you need a lighter BAM lighter this is
my mom's and you're just gonna go over
just to get ready a flyaways and just to
seal the ends don't go over where your
hair stops cuz that's how you burn your
hair off I did that and I mean it was a
cool umm I'm not happy about it but I
mean can't take it back now right yeah
make sure you don't burn the part where
your actual hair stops that's bad you
don't want that so I'm just burning the
ends like so try and burn this off and I
burn it and I kind of squeeze it to make
sure it's like legit and secure burn and
squeeze then I cut that little part off
like that this hotel man
I just burn that little tip there in the
tube that sounds evil bam and you got
yourself a lock the dread shake those
things alright let's put that to the
side let's go to the next one that one's
okay I can do better okay
okay so now I'm finally done doing the
front good this little part right here
that's super short hopefully I can show
up in the camera if not I'm sorry for
shorter pizzas I prefer to use the
Marley hair as the hair that braids with
only because it's more textured so it
grips onto my hair easier and the gel I
like to use is this gorilla glue not
glue
oh the gorillas not gel um that's the
jump for use because SuperDuper tacky
it's like snot so it grips onto my hair
very very very very very well so I put
that in my hair
and on this part now I do the same thing
as I'm doing as far as the braids go so
I started grade but of course it is
going to be long enough to braid so when
I get to the end I grab one of the
strands and I start twisting around
where the braid is I twist it around my
roots
and then I twist it around the mini Brae
I did just to make sure that braid does
not come apart and I twist it you can
see the hair stops but it's secured like
it's not going anywhere
I really I may have to put this part
alone so you can see but it's actually
very simple you just start a braid and
then before the braid ends you start
twisting it kind of like how we do the
lock you just can't twist at the root
just to make it secure
so I'm going to finish this one and I
will be right back
some find Ellen my annoying little lots
yes sir Annoying clubs tired of doing
them now when you're done if you want
them to blow better you do have to dip
them in water however I do not have
water ready at the time so I would not
be doing any dipping today and my family
they're waiting for me like always we
want dinner whatever anyways so that's
about it they're super easy to do my
next tutorial will be on how I make my
wigs now I'm going to attempt to make my
own lace closure because for some exact
but I can do it if I just practice so
we're gonna say that goes but if I am
successful I'll show you guys I do that
to you um I'm just going to try
everything you know this is my first
time doing this and it came out pretty
