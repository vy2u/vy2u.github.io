um I just had them show me two videos
why filling myself Diana's here with
sending Bobby with the students about by
also I stopped doing this makeup look
and so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
make a look before this video wrap this
video to know there will be up I got
this handsome beast over here and I'll
Express now they sent to me three buns
and lace closure and the bundles
actually came on braid and you go to
them again the video so I specifically
action for ombre hair because a lot of
companies actually most companies that
do the review any promoting they don't
send bloggers blonde bundles now I
simply prefer blonds bundles I'm doing a
light hair car like this or anything
lighter because it just makes the
process easier but I think that the
reason why coming to first and not said
loggers do on bundles because they know
that they don't last that long and they
don't want to send them hair that's not
going to be great that make sense so I
saw ombre bundles I knew I intend on
dyeing and bleaching the hair to make it
this color so I got this color now in
the video I'm going to kind of be in
shambles but what's new rate Bosley like
you can see this it can't like this so
if any point during the video I'll tell
you what's going on this isn't making
sense know that eventually led to this
so it all makes sense right but I don't
even I was like I wanna garlic with that
but you know me I know I think
everything worked literally wake up the
hair I just make everything work now I
won't say one thing I did three bundle
Manolis closure now the distracted mood
I did rebound that lace closure now one
of the bundles I bleached like maybe
like two months ago when I first got the
hair ties went to a practice bundle and
I never got back to it until now so that
bundle is lighter among four three
bundles and I'll mix that a video so I
will say this if you're ever dying here
in your die emotional bundles and you
mess up on one bundle where like one add
the two bundles it's like a different
color than other two and you're gonna
make a way to do a fill in that messed
up bundle just sew it or put it at the
bottom and that makes sense like you
know how usually when you do bundles and
you go up from saying like the bundles
are like using your blood like 16 18 20
for example
and you mess up on the 18 inch or the 20
inch put the 28 to the bottom like you'd
usually do and I maybe instead put the
mess to bundle at the bottom because you
won't be to tell you know because after
you end up putting the other two bundles
the herrings are playing together you
cannot tell then you met them on the
bundles because if you look you can see
on this it's kind of like a I don't know
it's a call this color but just know
that underneath that that third bundle
it was lighter than the other bundles
and so honestly it's like you can tell
you can tell it tell where I messed up
but once you put other two bills on top
you totally can't tell it even like from
behind you can't tell it I want to look
like an ombre effect so you guys you
know I'm talking about it looks like I
did that I'm perfectly I did it I'm
sound at the same if you mess up don't
get scared there's ways to fix it yes
anyways I'm trying to encourage you if
you mess up commit always mess up I'm
dying here and everything I messed up
that messed up bundle I just put at the
bottom you move cannot tell it doesn't
matter what color like whenever I've
done red here one bundle was too dark I
don't know if Lauren actually showed me
my regular video it was too dark I
messed up I put the bottle then it makes
you look like a really nice ombre effect
you can't clean that up anyways super
long intro up setup top of too much the
kid wants this video and I hope you guys
enjoy it and I'll see you medics would
alright so here is a closure now they
don't offer ombre closure so I have to
like do that from scratch but here are
the bundle sorry I lost focus but I'm
back here in a bundle so this wooden
looks like I mean it's just kind of like
ombre bundles I really do not my fan
does hombre only because I mean I'm
really not a fan of ombre ombre in
general anyways I'm gonna take some BW
to bleach in some 40-thousand developer
I'm sorry that my life is so bright
white object if we don't show up in my
own camera by trying to saturate as you
can see it so that's what a lighting
change
anyways I got this cute little pink
bucket in a package I decided to use it
to mix my bleach because I mean it's
cute it's a bucket and I thought of a
cute in video so I'm gonna put my scoops
of bleach powder in the bucket first so
I'm like I put a developer in just yet
I'm just getting that prepared so that's
what I'm doing I think I put like three
or four scoops I ended up using like
almost this whole thing of which were
like half
because I did a lot of bleaching a lot
of processing I'm just unrolling the
bundle I'm preparing to bleach it now I
did notice the tracks that I mean the
West were you know constructed pretty
nicely I had no issues while making the
wig and yeah so anyways Here I am
pouring the developer into the bleach
mixture now what I do is I just mix and
mix a mix and I add more developer media
or I more powder if needed I just like
to get a pretty runny consistency but
not too runny because I want it to be
like strong if that makes sense
I'm I wanted to have an effect so I
don't wanna put too much developer but I
want to be run enough to where it's
pressed easily because I just make some
bleaching process easier so you guys get
ready it I like it like that so I think
the clothes that compared to it's like
pancake batter so yeah do like pancake
batter now I'm gonna take the bundle and
I kind of unravel the whole thing and I
just start applying bleach honestly I'm
really not super neat when I do this
because like why do we need I don't know
like usually I'm doing this costume in a
rush so I kind of go pretty fast all
right what I'm doing is I'm laying it
flat to make sure the bleach is like
getting on each strand of hair but then
I just flip it over and I roll it over
that way once it's done is kind of like
oh god I'm contradicting myself I want
to be like all over the place so I'm
just like putting the bleach on and I'm
rolling it and pretty simple Christy
pretty simple so and I focus in the
bleach on the black part of the hair
course now I am putting a little bit on
like the second layer of ombre but I'm
not really focusing it too much on the
bottom and again on the bottom like
regardless because like it's a lot of
bleach but I wasn't really focusing to
bleach too much on the bottom because
the bottom tips of the hair were already
blonde as it is so I didn't think it
really needed bleach
you
but I believe stuff on my bundles I
didn't show everything and here to look
like why I rinsed it now I'm putting
more bleach on it now honestly okay
bleaching dry hair is much more
effective however I didn't want to like
totally kill it or processes hair I
notice that when I put the bleach on the
first time it started getting hot like
it processed SuperDuper fast so I kind
of left the hair a little damp to slow
up the bleaching process because I
noticed that when the hair is dry the
bleach process is way fast so yeah I'm
just going to put bleach on the damp
hair just to line it just a little more
and yeah then I'm going to UM you guys
see what I'm going to do next I'm not
gonna save you have to keep Washington
video to find
all right so I rinsed out that bleach
and you probably see a major difference
between there was a difference and
here's a bomb bundle why don't you think
bundle bundle I was talking about it
again in the video the one I was
lighting the rest them so I'm yeah now
it's time to tone now business well a
toner it's t18 have like three bottles
and I'm going to put them all in my cute
little bucket with my bucket wait
where's my bucket it's right there I
rinsed it out by the way absent pour the
toner in there and then I'm going to mix
it with developer and now with this
toner I believe it's on one part owner
to part developer and it's 20 volume
developer but I had like a 20 bottom
developer and the bottles almost empty
so I honestly just like said f it and I
poured the whole thing in there it
wasn't a lot though it totally worked
out I just I picked these not tone hair
so I'm not an expert at this but you
know you do to do so I'm doing what I'm
doing and it came out okay so yeah got a
poor developer in there 20 volumes now
I'm giving this garni whatever tech that
G hair dye and it's like this brown hair
time they used up for the roots I'm sick
I'm so lucky I forgot buying this I
don't even remember buying it it would
just in my hair Jory I'm like oh cool
perfect this is probably work for that
okay I want black roots KY 4xw dark so I
had to start brown and I just put in the
bottle shook it up just just focus start
like developing okay so shake that up
get that the parent now I'm going to use
the gloves that come with this comes
with a little brush some years later and
it comes with gloves so I need those
even though I'm not using them like
later on this video which is so dumb I
just anyways time to tone the hair now
at first I was only going to tone like
the tips of the hair and then leave the
roots alone by toning up the whole thing
just let you guys know but before I told
I'm just going to like brush through it
that way you need to kind of like apply
the toner off the hair evenly now Tony
going to pretty simple because since
like the the tone our self on a water
base it's very runny so it's super easy
to kind of put the hair so
unless you guys watch this part and I'll
check back in once I'm good
this got really messy but it's okay
because I mean dyeing hair is always
messy so I'll let that sit and I rinse
it out and then here I was I thought was
okay by once to tone a little more so I
have two silver haired I was what
essentially is like toner it's just this
purple like a lavender type of hair dye
so I put down the hair to kind of let it
sit in some more and honestly I felt
safer using this because how do I say
this
I thought we toned hair a developer you
could it's a possibility you could over
tone and damage the hair whereas this is
just straight color so I just thought it
was safer to leave in the hair longer
usually when I tone them I see Alyssa
tone all the time and I've seen her mess
up and you don't want to over tone
because then you're screwed fading ways
time to dye the roots so now I'm pouring
that brown hair dye in my little bucket
just to make it easier to grab with the
brush to apply to the hair I didn't want
to squeeze every single time I needed so
I just put it all in the bucket and here
I'm using that same with a brush and now
I'm going to work on the closure first
em to the bundles the closure was
interesting it took me some time at the
part through each little part and
honestly I'm really shocked I didn't get
on the knots well like I'm shop I'm not
shocked I did take my time but I really
thought that I would at least dye the
knots but somehow everything turned out
perfect with the closure like every
close looks perfect it was my favorite
part of this whole process so I'm gonna
let you guys watch me apply the brown
dye to the tips now I found the bundles
you can see that I'm going to apply it
kind of messily and that's because I
want it I didn't want to look perfect I
didn't want the roots to look perfect
that make sense I wanted them to look
kind of messy kind of like I need to
retouch these things you know I'm saying
so right guys watch and I'll be back
again
checking back in really quick just wanna
say that I'm going to another video
styling his hair and giving a more
in-depth review but from wearing this
wig so have it all right now so far the
hair has given me no problems I've
actually haven't experienced any
shedding or tangu which is actually a
shocker being that I bleached the hell
out of his hair but just shows that the
hair is very uh what's that word I'm
going to say strong oh my gosh you just
want to call it just to the fade yeah
the hair is very strong
I'm actually really reflect on the fact
that I haven't had any like shedding or
tingling that's really a trip because I
I've had hair shed and tangle me when I
didn't bleach it at all so the fact that
I was able to bleached it and
everything's perfectly fine that's
awesome I might do a video on the wall
curly makes I think that'll look really
really cute and then I guess we'll have
to see you know how much they have to
take heat in a lot of stuff but honestly
like making him a wig was a breeze
because the tracks themselves they were
super nice seeing a web did no mistakes
no error in the construction of the
track so ever and the you guys see the
closure the bleach hair technique
soubise doing super well so everything
was a-ok in my book but I don't make
another video to talk about it more I
just want to jump back in there say back
you guys are wondering
yeah we're poaching into this video
after I got done dying the roots I let
them sit of course I want to process
them and then I shampooed conditioned I
let the hair be conditioned overnight
then I blow-dried a base wig and this is
the finished product I think it came out
really really nice if you guys agree
please give this video a thumbs up if
you want more videos like this please
come down below and please subscribe and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
