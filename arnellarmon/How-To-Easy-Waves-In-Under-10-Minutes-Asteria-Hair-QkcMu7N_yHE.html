hey guys look at my trailer for your new
welcome sweetie I supposed to be another
super easy hairstyle um I've been doing
more videos where I do just very simple
straight to the point type hairstyles
look like they're helpful and so I think
I'm gonna be doing like to this like
maybe a year or two Rico but obviously
the quads a little different so I decide
to film it over and so in today's video
I'm going to show you guys how I get
these really nice like effortless waves
for under 10 minutes I decide for the
timer on life um this video kind of
taught myself to keep it under 10
minutes
I know that people have school and work
and they want to make the hair look nice
they don't have too much time and so I
mean if you have more time you could
definitely feel more time to style make
the curls more defined and obviously
make the waves look nicer however if
you're in a rush I feel like this is a
cool little style
I've always loved carefree type style
and so you do to the continue watch this
video
so we've marketed to this tutorial I'm
going to quickly go over this hair this
hair some Astoria hair they sent me four
bundles of Brazilian straight in 20
inches and the matching frontal I only
use three the bundles so I still have
one left over so this will looks up on
the hair straight although you guys ever
see them be in this video so pros and
cons on this hair pro is that it's super
easy to curl you've seen this video and
fluid ecoegg really well and it holds
these curls would be well I know that my
wants a retired curl which I mean I'm I
supposed to because I'm right here I
know for a fact that it will hold really
well when we wanted to tight curl you
contact a mover as you slowly take small
pieces in this video I'm going to take
big pizzas grab them in a rush but if
you want a tighter curl just take
smaller piece that I just took drag it
and then I just let it hang like that
you guys see how beautiful that curl is
anyways uh this hair takes curls are you
well it's tangle free obviously it's
straights very silky the only con I like
to say is that the frontal has a lot of
flyaways I peaked I noticed that when I
was making the wig that there's shorter
pieces in the back of the frontal the
front front was okay but other than that
you see the beginning
do or go do it and I laid the fly away
there's a lot of flip lines in the front
tool more than I typically notice which
is a trip because the frontal itself is
constructed really nicely I did not have
to customize a front obviously my baby
hairs but a frontal came like kind of
pre plucked and so I thought the frontal
isn't really great which for the most
part it was but I did have flyaways and
I'll show you decide girls in this video
as well but that's the only con I could
think of so if you're interested
purchase hair all the links and
everything will be down below if you
ever purchased from this company leave
your thoughts down below I've worked
with them before and I'll link that
video down description box is a very old
video I like two years ago and remember
having a good experience at the very
last time
so yeah share my thoughts with
yesterday's video like I always say if
you enjoyed give a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
so this say hair in its natural state
it's SuperDuper silky and nice actually
like two straight however I flooded the
back this way was a little top-heavy so
I thought that curling it will make it
look less top-heavy and so I just show
this click prod like it's cheese stray
card and I use it to help lay down the
flyaways I got this straight car from
Marshalls and I've had it for like over
a year now and it's still like half way
full it smells so good I love it and so
I'm gonna set my timer
I'm started right now and I'm gonna do
this under 10 minutes to show you guys
how fast this goes so you're gonna
eclipse you only like one or two I'm
gonna split the sections in half you
don't want tiny sections but I feel like
if you do like usually want to do my
hairstyles would be like four sections
that takes longer if you only do two
sections you get through it faster like
you're more in a rush I can't explain it
but I'm gonna take my babble is a
flatter and it's like a thinnest one
they have I think and I'm lyrics gonna
grab a piece of hair and just curl it
you're literally just taking it and
you're rolling the flatter and as you
guys can see the flat iron iron I don't
know what is there and then you just you
know just pull it it's like the most
easiest step and I didn't speed this
part up because I want you to see how I
actually do it you get really nice curls
from this and if you want super defined
curls just take smaller sections I grab
sections that are kind of like on the
medium side and I also don't mind if
it's messy because that's kind of point
the cool thing about this hairstyle that
it doesn't have to be perfect
I like when hair style
don't look too perfect see I'm to show
you guys how I do it so how I create
like this kind of effortless wave look
is if you notice I'm doing all the curls
they're super random I'm Lily grabbing
like the most random sections of hair
it's so messy on this kind of cringe
wary but some hair I'm curling
frontwards other hand I'm curling to the
side other here I'm coming backwards and
I feel like that's how you get very like
just effortless waves you can curl this
on the same direction and then when you
brush all together it kind of all folds
together actually it's really pretty but
I didn't wanna do that I want it like
you know crazy waves so I'm with curling
in all different directions
teni speaking the back doesn't matter
too much it's all about how the front to
look so as long as your front looks good
then you're good and you want to curl
the front based on your like face shape
so I curl the front like I curl it going
some inward some backwards but the main
piece I kind of curl it outwards because
I feel like when I make the curls go
inwards toward my face it makes my face
look rounder and so this is all about
trial and error I've been doing this for
a very long time so I kinda know what
works best you know on me you just have
to keep doing this you know but you
don't want to go over like the same
piece too many times because then it
won't curl the way you want to curl
especially if you have a really good
flat iron and it's super duper hot so um
yeah here here's me struggling by didn't
cut that out cuz I mean it's part of the
everyday routine so I don't wanna cut
anything out if you notice this frontal
is really nice I feel like it has a
really nice density it's not too thick
like I said earlier the only thing in
like woo those flyaways they're annoying
Oh Here I am I did half my hair and it
was only four minutes of 31 seconds I
know it showed pretty fast but it took
me 4 min to 30 seconds to do that one
side so this style is super duper easy
you just can't think too deeply into it
to be honest you see right here I just
messed up and I just fixed the edge so
I'm back over it it's really easy to do
my flower was almost too hot um it's fun
it's the bomb it's the best one ever
and this is my second
I'm buying it I bought it old for $160
so that's how you know I like something
if I buy toys and so I'm yeah just going
to this side and then I'll check back in
towards the end when I'm like you know
doing the finishing touches now in a
second I understand them show you guys
how the ends are looking and it's gotta
see this is the hair a long so I stood
up and then you know I made sure that
answer curly and the piece that I saw
that weren't curly I just went back and
read curl at them that's what's cool so
cool about this style like if you mess
up this toy cool this is such a easy fix
and so now I am just going back over
some pieces that I felt like me just
have a little more curl to them if you
have more time the style come on nicer
however like I said I gave myself ten
minutes and I really want to stick to it
so however the hair looked was however
it was gonna look so I had like extra
two minutes I think two or one minute
left so I just decided to kind of like
perfect pieces and now I'm going to put
this kiss argan oil in my hair just to
make sure that my hair is all
moisturized and you know oily although I
should have brushed out a little bit
more cuz it's kind of like it didn't
look good on camera I didn't see that
until after but um here's the timer
I took nine minutes and ten seconds and
so because I actually um I decided to go
back and even you know fix even more
pieces cuz you can do that if you have a
little more time but this style should
not take you no longer than 20 minutes
even as a beginner I don't think you
should take more than 20 minutes we take
some more in 20 minutes and I mean I'm
not judging you I just feel like it's so
easy as you shouldn't take longer than
that
after I perfect you and a few pieces I
talked about why don't I pick out one
little flyaway that I saw back there
right there and that's pretty much the
finished look so if you enjoyed this
video if you plan to rekey this look I
said recreate recreate this look leave a

back rolls give this video a thumbs up
