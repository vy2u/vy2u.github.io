going to be on like how to make you like
pretty much okay long story short I made
this wig ooh
progress you know I made this way before
them to this apartment which is a June
fit so maybe before then and what
happened was I think I made this wig and
my hair so lies god damn it oh I made
this way well coming down to my faith as
well there is a very stern alright
anyways what happened was I made the wig
and pretty much I was too lazy to bleach
the knots because it's the wrong time I
was moving and I myself passed out but I
did not feel like doing that I just
dislike it and so I'm plucking the
closure and so honestly bleep sand rocks
is honestly that's the best thing you
can do if you want your wigs let's look
as natchez possible because even you
pluck it it doesn't always look like the
most natural I suppose which you're not
see like the best way to go and so I
moved here and I want to do a video with
the wig you know because I mean like hey
that's my job um I am like how was plug
so I believed it so the thing is I
bleached it when I bleached it pretty
much the part looks super wise because I
only was a super plug because you do
when you have luck without bleaching it
to plug more Z to a plus because it's
not the leached so the part looks super
why I just wasn't feeling it at all it
did not look good to me it not look good
and I thought to find the pictures guys
this one my third time filming a video
with this wick I need something to work
it just was not working for me and so if
I could find I'm such as all assert and
whatever I was doing like serious it
looks looks weak I like it but I'm a
tripod pictures always good for whatever
and I'll actually insert them and so I
found a video and I try to abrade out
with this hair and it was a complete
fail decide because I had always been
like all my channel like ready we put
public for like weeks now but I was just
like
and I don't know they're like it as the
quality of exactness I just been
stalling on it so I can kind of like
think of snails to do with this wig and
so I decided to fill a video on how I
make my prices better when I messed up
on them now this matter now this may not
be everyone's style I know I have like a
hoop loop right here by notice down down
a middle part I like doing that but I
don't do it looks weird and I'll insert
a little clip from my previous video I
have the middle part and someone called
my forehead big which I agree by because
I didn't have anything in front of the
part if so it looked off and so I
noticed that I did a little swoop a
little kind of weird because it's like
apartments of hair something about it
makes it look good
and so one is veil to show you guys how
I just make this part look better if you
happen to us over plus your part or you
know just make it to where it looks it
doesn't look that great I think like I
personally I like how this looks I know
you know it's not gonna be I wouldn't
say wrinkled people maybe look stupid
aware of the case maybe by me I'm gonna
go out and I I think I look good I think
this looks great and so about the
charity guys this hair is from peerless
version hair their hair so nice devised
use I pretty much how to fix and put
your ask closure cuz I've had this with
for so long and I've always liked it but
the closure just did not it did not vibe
with me and so got my laundry I gotta do
it you guys I can show more little two
of this um but yeah I just have some
finessing by now I like it and this hair
is so nice will say this I post a video
I don't want you to talk to my forehead
look at the thing whatever okay every
tomorrow middle part you guys are gonna
go group or the two big guys that's all
other important veiled everybody like
their hair a lot I just kind of like any
like a fool why I cut it I cut it like
pretty much to my boob I really like
this kind of hair a people to learn a
tional and beyond me it was longer was
what always out to like my my Fupa area
but I thought I didn't so I just kinda
stopped it I had to did during the video
I'm not going to really show it because
that's not to be just for let's have
some cameras virgin hair as you can see
their hair is very soft and silky and I
notice that their hair is consistent
like this I have work done before
fuckin I don't forget this one time last
year is almost a year ago I want to be
able to link them down below I think I
did hear one or two videos for them so
if I'm given do really like their hair a
lot like a luster is so nice to guide
it's so silky and soft I really have no
complaints I'm not going back to say I
had an experience shedding I never
experienced it with her hair it is very
soft and just big like not super thick
to where it looks fake but it just I
wish I would have got a frontal for this
wig I just feel like old us much much
better so imma stop talking I'm just
going to get straight to this video
hopefully it's informative with you over
plug you got to see how bad it looks
when I first put it on and you got to
appreciate this right here because look
I made it it's private re I'll take you
like five minutes took me 17 but when
you watch this and take you like five
minutes
- like perfected five minutes so then
you're advanced find helpful leave a
thumbs up if you ever have if you have
an experience where you butcher their
front row or closure comes and come in
and we will try to do it all the time so
yeah you know alone so just let me do
now I'm like I said thumbs up subscribe
do all that good stuff and I'll see you
guys later alright so first take my
little head scarf on I always have one
on in my part like I already have part
in the center usually I have a wig
that's a middle part if I'm not lazy
I'll do a middle part for my legs little
what would you call this but a jail down
there I'm just kind of gel and decide
just so they're more slick and they're
not in my way
and for this video I'm going to speed it
up here I am just putting foundation
powder on my wig cap so that it's
lighter in that area yeah I'm going to
speed up this video for the most part
because it's like simple it took me a
while to really work with this wig I
kept on to pull it upwards because it
was just a little too small for my head
to begin with this leg would just
shambles for me you guys can see yeah it
did not look that good when I first
started off like I feel like what I end
up doing to it did we made a difference
because like right now without that
little piece of hair in the front I have
an egg head it just does not look good
at all but I really liked the hair
texture the quality's hair is really
really really nice so I just wanted to
try my hardest trying to make this wig
work somehow because I don't want to
have to like not wear it anymore I
really like it so I'm just beat us up
you got to see what I'm doing I don't
want to talk too much in this video but
I'm pretty much as you know putting the
concealer on the part trying to make the
part match my scalp and that's possible
and then I'm just trying to create baby
hairs you never see me kind of struggle
a bit but I mean this just goes to show
you that it's not always perfect the
first time around some of you we live
just keep trying to keep trying and you
know eventually we'll be able to finesse
something I hope I honestly I don't
think I even showed it in my face but I
was kind of given nori during this video
because I wasn't sure if it was going to
work out and it was kind of frustrating
me but and then I think it looks pretty
nice if you think it looks nice as well
and let me know so I don't think I'm
crazy but I was able to finesse it so I
mean Here I am I'm just trying to I knew
I want to click a little baby here right
where that part was I noticed that when
you over plucked it apart and you make
it too big it gives away that's the wig
because it's more noticeable like when a
part is kind of like slim and small you
don't really see it but have you ever
seen someone with the wig and they have
a wide last part and that's the first
thing you look at when you see them I
feel like that part look like that and
it maybe look smaller in the video like
as I'm editing it I'm realizing it
doesn't look huge in the video but it
person it looked really really big it
was very very Wiggy so I'm just trying
to create baby hair to distract from
that I feel like baby hairs help with
that because it makes us more natural
and I'm going to also end up putting
black eyeshadow in that part to kind of
make it smaller as well so overall I
pretty much is over plus and I almost
ruined this but I did what I can do
yeah I basically just you know I kept
working at it I'm really affectionate so
it's like my solid it was too many baby
hairs I would take them away you guys
see what I'm doing I just I just try to
work in till I feel like it looks good
enough for me to go outside and so when
I finally got to that point I left it
alone actually were this way for like
three days straight without taking it
off so I liked it I'm I liked it a lot I
work for a whole weekend which is kind
of rare for me to do but if you guys
enjoyed the video you find helpful give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll
see you guys under</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
