old to beiieve a license
hey get home at 5:00 got done pretty
much transforming his wig now it's not
perfect yet he'll and I don't know one
or two quick it I fell to look hella
good straight the thing is I just spent
a lot of time walk home in it but I
refuse to strangers yet the somatic
extreme or don't I don't know but I just
want some vehicle just with intro which
there's no that album dirty with this
wig from LA today of the sub-aqua came
in can Brookins or it comes in a box and
on this i just looked to me all that
asses because all these this is about
screener coming down below okay remember
that my heart but came pre-dice but I
want they and my team the color came in
it's like it's exact color you'd get if
you bleached hair so I want to pay it
Kings bleach I don't want they was died
because they did to pop any color into
it
I knew that based on when I died a hair
and let's customize it a big asses outta
here it came to each other that's super
cool because one thing I hate doing this
bleaching hair on which is why I would
say for everybody comes a hair dye
videos I hate bleaching hair got legacy
Oh anyone care and so when I said I
listened it away those are a dime a cool
I didn't do it bit by incoming of this
pretty cool color but when it felt a
little nice and is really nice compared
to other wigs irises I perfectly like
when I make my own way I'm very picky
when it comes to advancement my post so
quick video reason you guys see I was in
Hell trying to make it look nice and I
have never come from a tan it
comfortable I agree so I you know if
they're sure they're everyone looking
good but this link is really really nice
when I first got it my friend
that I have and I was like oh but
it was foster then I have a plant new
creeper got to my last video where I've
had a wig that was already made but I
feel like when lifts in teeth are made
out of those typical cells they're all
human hair they claim a lot of a better
system that I already made you can speed
it look a little more stiff or a little
more synthetic like I can let the con
like that on my previous video and I
agree to this because I'd let me mix it
with classic hair sometimes I try to get
away with it I'm still a lot of with
them spinning you refer back to my
videos where I'm working anyway I was
consuming made I wanted there Thomas
saying that it just feels I haven't way
to coming up with our name and yeah that
hair cells even feels a little bit
synthetic key so what about this without
immediately notice that hey this
actually inherited noted quite a bit
there's no plastic hairs in it because
some companies will try to say that the
way to the hunch in my hair but they are
mine and I don't tell my hope that I'm
like oh I like when is cool but
something feels a little plastic me if I
don't know dear you don't understand
even here I'm like I work with human
hair all the time and I know the
difference and so guys without us in
your oh yeah this hair is legit it's not
you know mixing synthetic fibers meet
lasting Barbie doll here none of that
was here success and it so guys I
beautifully I really love this color I
will to go to something else perfect
upload something dollar just you know
different looking and so I got this if
you want to see how I got it just keep
on watching um I have to figure out
perfected style
I don't want thing I want smooth things
I don't know you never know we're gonna
get I'm also going to strain it this
look a little bit and look I'm going for
but yeah the cameras are now that's a
fine I got shut up and started video if
you enjoy something a thumbs up
subscribe don't I just wigs yet the
color go without I'll talk more about in
this video so yeah which awesome
in a few minutes one all right so this
hella we came
I finally got well I made my wig stand
so I think it would be much easier to be
like film hair videos now we had to say
Hannah's natural state it's really curly
it's really nice I felt really was soft
and you guys see what I mean that it
looks like it was just bleached like it
wasn't died at all it was just bleach so
I want to work with that so the first
thing I do is take this toner it was not
showing up but it's by Wella and it is
color charm it's zero five zero zero 50
cooling violet so it's illicit area here
kinda like greyish and we mix that with
some tins I'm developer and so I just
kind of pour it I kind of I it in so
hard following the instructions I don't
have a measuring cup so I never know I
just I it in most the time it works out
some of it doesn't but I just you know
mix it up put some gloves on and I'm
just going to put that all throughout
the pretty much the whole entire wig
let that sit for about five minutes and
I rinse it out and you guys see you got
rid of all the warmth I'm sitting over
to our left is here but I want to do
something different I was going for a
certain vibe so I decided to get my
sparks hair dye which is right here and
then after I could die I'm going to add
a whole bunch of conditioner into it I
don't know if you have to use a specific
conditioner but I select this local
smells very good and then I mix that all
up and this will looks like it looks
pigmented but it's not really and so I
apply that pretty much throughout the
hair I tried to make sure you're out
every single strand but I did miss a few
pieces but I mean in it looking cool
anyways I was going for this certain
type of vibe I'm gonna get fall Shalom
she's on YouTube as well
Oh insert the picture she did this hair
color era no it's not this seems like
things I wasn't going for that but the
vibe of that hair color I liked it
because it was like a weird hair color
you're like I've never seen that before
and so that's all going for just
something just different like I don't
want you to scream screams all the
freaking time
and so yeah I put that in there and then
I let it sit maybe 10 to 15 minutes I
know it wasn't super long but yeah about
10 to 15 minutes
after letting the guys sit I rinsed it
out and actually what the hair air dry
overnight because I didn't really wanna
like mess up or damage the curl so I
flip them air dry overnight and the next
day I want toasted I thought the wig
looks so much better on the mannequin
head I should've never cut the bangs I
could I'm a little thinking I could fix
it but the color looks really cool you
guys see the hair is very bouncy and
very nice I love this wig I just I know
I could do better so you don't see in my
video but if you enjoyed this one be
sure to give a thumbs up to subscribe
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
