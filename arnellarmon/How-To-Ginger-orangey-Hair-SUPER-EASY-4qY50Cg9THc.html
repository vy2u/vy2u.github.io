through new welcome today's video is
going to be a pretty simple video I'm
just going to show you guys how I got
this color now this color I got on
accident um I was sick from hurting a
company and I've done a video using
their hair before it's when I did that
that unicorn
I looked at a picture I did some
unicorns I color with their hair and
they have the best blonde bundles ever
that I ever freaking tried and so when
they send a small bundles I originally
want to keep the hair kind of blonde
however I told I'd turn it gray and the
gray was cool too but it was too cool
tone for me so I tried to warm it up and
I basically got this color which i think
is a really pretty color I thought this
color would look great on anyone um I
don't know if I can pick up the true
color I'm looking at our monitor and
this hair looks very like orange and
ginger but in real life it's not that
orange so I don't know if you guys see
that your color however it's a really
just pretty soft and ginger color it's
not too orange um it's definitely
wearable for the every single day I love
the color I love these bundles I have
nothing negative say about their bundles
if you want to purchase some really bomb
hair and specifically blonde hair her
hair company like there's no debates
there's no like second thoughts they
have the best blonde bundles ever so
yeah anyways if you'd like to see how
about this color bikini watch this video
the Vedas kind of shambles like I said
this color was on accident however it's
super simple um when you watch it so if
you enjoyed find helpful give this video
a thumbs up if you liked this hair color
give this video a thumbs up please
subscribe and all the links and
everything to purchase hair be down
below like always and I'll see you guys
in the next video alright so here's the
hair freshman of the box their hair is
so nice you guys one thing I love the
most is the thickness as well as how the
hair is like thick from root to tip look
at look at those ends you guys those are
beautiful like I don't know you probably
appreciate them if we deal with bundles
and hair like I do but man those ends
are beautiful it's like a hairball so
traumatic but I love I love the hair
it's so nice I'm gonna like totally hype
it up because it's worth the hype so I'm
showing you guys the bundles the
thickness and all that and then want me
do to the frontal just to get it
prepared for my diet later on I'm gonna
lay the front out I'm using my gut to
pee got to pee got to be free spray I'm
a spray on the frontal that way my dead
the roots on the
later on the knots don't get died on the
frontal I'm trying to avoid that
although the front time I'm messing it
up in the beginning of video it doesn't
look the best because I didn't take the
most time to like you know customize it
but don't worry I'm gonna fix it you
gotta see it in the next video something
to another view on this hair too so for
my roots I'm going to take some 20
bottom developer with this color tangle
7 in in dye it's like a roast toasted
pecan or it's like roasted yea roasted
pecan it's like a really nice Brown and
I'm gonna use that for the roots so I'm
gonna mix in two tubes and then I'm
going to I how much developer I put in I
just like get to a certain consistency
so it's easy to spread and then I'm
going to start applying that to the
roots of the bundles
so what I did was unraveled a bundle and
then I apply some to the roots and I
just flip it over
I found this is that the easy way to do
it I'm gonna show you guys how I do it
the whole way through so don't worry
about it but I just apply some of the
dye and then I flip it over then I brush
it through and then I just keep applying
it super easy and so what I did was I
only died the roots of two of the
bundles and the other two I didn't
because other two were gonna be in the
back of the wig anyway so you wouldn't
you wouldn't even see those roots I
learned that from tiara Monet one of her
videos I should know she I think she
only had like dyed the roots to act like
one of the bundles and this saves so
much time like I can't believe I just
started doing this so I'm all just gonna
yeah dyed the roots to two of the
bundles another two I just left alone
so after applying the dye I'm going to
let that process some foil this took
about like 15 20 minutes process and
then once it processed it look like this
really nice it's really nice color and
now time to tone the bundles so I'm
gonna use this well a t28 toner and I'm
gonna mix it with I believe 10 volume
developer now so here's what I want
wrong wrong here's what I went wrong
because I tone the but when I toned the
bundles with the dyed roots the color
came out more warm something about the
way I blended the bundles in I don't I
can't explain it but it came out warm
the bundles I toned without the dyed
roots they were like way too cool tone I
think because you guys can see how like
what I'm telling these bundles I'm
dragging it from the root to the
tip so some of that dye is mixed in with
the toner and it's making the toner more
warm and so that's the only thing I did
wrong in this process because the other
two bundles that I just toned and didn't
dye the roots they were like kind of
purply you don't see the layer on the
video which is why I'm putting down on
top of it so I messed up on this part
it's okay we learn from our mistakes I
didn't cut it out because I want you
guys to learn form I did wrong so don't
worry about it just don't yeah right
yeah anyway so
this the bundle after got D'Antoni it
was beautiful I wish honestly speaking I
wish they all came out this color
however they didn't and so I'm just
gonna show a little scene of me doing
the roots just say see how to do that I
just you know polo down the roots part
it with like a very fine comb and then I
brush it out and then I'm yeah super
simple and because I sprayed with it got
to be free spray the roots didn't get
died at all
all right so here are the bundles and
everything once they're done you just
see the bundles and the frontal really
nice color it's like warm but cool but
the two bundles that I did not dye the
roots on there way too cool tone so I
made the wig you can see the front part
looks really warm and the back part
looks super cool because the back part
is where the two bundles that I didn't
have any to die with in the future I'll
just mix on the diet of toner but that's
size point so I'm taking this cinnamon
dye from a door now in this video I use
shampoo don't do that use conditioner if
you want the color to show up use
conditioner because I apply this to the
hair I let it sit for a few hours I got
home thinking oh yeah this is gonna be
it there's gonna be the move whatever
into now all the color came out with it
and so what I had to do was I just do it
over and I had to mix the same dye with
conditioner and that's how I got the
color that I wanted so idea was just you
know I did what I'm doing right here I
just just do a conditioner instead and I
let it sit not even for that long
actually did less like 15 minutes so if
you want more color of course let it sit
for longer and then I am washed it
rinsed it and I want coat the hair and
then you guys will see like the final
results at the end same look as it was
in the beginning but um yeah let me I'll
do differently next time is just
customize the front a little more
because the frontal it's not my best
work I can't acknowledge that it's not
as good as you know my previous frontals
have looked but overall this hair is so
nice I obviously didn't have any issues
besides my own personal stakes that I
made so if you enjoyed this video if you
find it helpful be sure to give it a
thumbs up and please subscribe and I'll
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
