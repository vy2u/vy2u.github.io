new welcome space video I'm going to
show you how I achieve this hairstyle I
actually got arrived last night or I
don't know want to post this video by
gone live and a lot of people thought
this is my real hair I know it looks
like it but it's actually not I actually
have pieces in here that glued in and so
I'm going to show you how I do that now
I know a lot of people kind of gift
gluant I just do glue it that's all I
used to do back when I first start
wearing weave like 15 between like 15
like 17 18 I was doing strictly blue
eggs because I thought they look the
most natural and they were just easy for
me to do of course I've gotta make wigs
back there and I know I was so in hair
and sauce just doing glue ends and I
know that people are intimidated or
scared glue ins because I guess they
can't they can pull your hair out if you
take them out the wrong way
however there's ways to prevent doing
that and although I don't think I'll
have time to film the process of me
taking them out so I'm going out of town
I will say that or it's gonna glue in
like the track in order to get it out
and learn to saturate your hair
conditioner and it literally like slips
right out so I miss I guess the
disclaimer so me and I have comments
about me choose to put glue my hair I
noticed that when I do things to my hair
that people don't agree what they tend
to comment on it and I just don't think
that's necessary because my hair and I
got this basically but this video is
sponsored by Pierce hair company I work
with that many times before I love their
hair they are one of my favorite
aliexpress companies and so they sent me
three bones on a frontal and I start to
make away but that wasn't you know what
I always do with videos I want to switch
it up and so that's why science is glue
cease it and you know I got this so if
you want to I got this to you watch this
video as far as the pros and cons this
hair pros are that it took the die very
easily I mean I dyed it black so
obviously if I dunno the vigor bleach is
really well as well all the videos I've
done before in the past I'll link them
down below so you guys get an idea of
like you know different hair textures
and whatnot another Pro no tangling of
course I haven't experienced any Shetty
but I don't expect you with the glue
I don't think I'll make much sense the
tracks split very very easily I split
the tracks are the wefts
in order to make this gluon is flat and
natural-looking as possible so it's not
bulky at all as far as cones go i do we
have but none that can think of if I do
run into some cons I'll comment down
below but I I don't see myself right
into cons typically speaking when you
get straight bundles and less like the
only cons you typically would have is
like with the wefts and you have
constant the wefts that's how I get
Shetty
but because the wefts are perfectly fine
I don't see any cons you know coming up
and like I would say the order was
coming before leave your feedback in the
comment area down below and I'll legit
watch this video if you enjoyed it give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll
see you guys later all right
so my hair starts to like this ain't
nothing wrong with my hair however I
wanted to be more full of body and
longer so first I'm going to part out my
things you know because I'm gonna do
those cuz you know I don't know I just
feel like I'm beings I always do middle
parts if you guys haven't peeped and so
now I'm going to section off half my
hair I like doing my hair in sections
it's easier so I section off this one
half and then from this half I section
off the bottom now I'm leaving a lot you
know at the bottom because I wanted me
to put this in a ponytail which you guys
are gonna see the ponytail looks
flawless so if you want to put it in a
ponytail after gluing the tracks in
leave some hair so these are the bundles
like I said to begin the video I
literally have no cons all pros I dye
his hair to match my hair perfectly I
dyed my hair and the bun was the same
night I use the same as egg dye so first
I am going to measure the track on my
part now after I measure I'm gonna cut
it obviously then glue it but I'm gonna
say that I'm not perfect at this and I
also do have a mirror so some of the
tracks aren't even on my scalp however
that is totally fine if it gets on your
hair it's a little bit like not on the
South area it's actually a little better
because it like minimizes the chance of
you pulling your hair out at the scalp
if that makes sense at all and it
actually makes easier to kind of get
them to slip out and so if you happen to
get a little bit on your hair that's
cool you don't want to get on the top
part but if it gets on the bottom
partyer in there if that makes any sense
at all
that's totally cool all right you're you
know what it's not gonna be perfect and
just as long as it looks good okay so I
put the track on and then I use a blow
dryer to make sure is in place sorry
this is out of focus but the next one
should be perfectly fine so then I part
another little section now if you want
your hair to look super duper fold it
along you could put a lot of pieces in
however I mainly focus on fullness so I
didn't need that many pieces if I wanted
to go for like more length then I would
have added more pieces that way if fluid
better but I just want more fullness so
I am doing pretty big parts if you ask
me cuz I used to do very thin parts to
fit in as much hair as possible but I
didn't really beat them a chair so this
woman came up pretty good you know the
fact I do have a mirror that's pretty
cool but yeah just put the glue on I
blow dry a little bit just to make a
little tacky sort of a slip I press it
on my scalp then I grab my blow-dryer
again dry it the blow dryer was extra
hot tonight I don't know what that was
about
it kept burning my finger but just you
know gotta make sure I just move
anywhere and then you're good to go
so I'm going to the back half off camera
I didn't show the whole process because
it's pretty repetitive before I get a to
the front part I'm going to lay my edges
with this got to the pomade I feel like
my voice sounds so weird I cannot wait
until I can hear again because I just
this cycle my second time recording his
voice over because the first time I was
talking to low even though I felt like I
was pretty loud so it's kind of sucks
I'm sorry if I spelled it off but I'm
saying I just got something looked crazy
and it was kind of discouraging and then
I'm gonna continue to just glue the
pieces um
it's pretty simple when you at the
bottom I'm like you know the bottom half
the hair the tracks can be small but we
get to the top and you have like longer
parting sections
I suggest split into half so this piece
that I'm doing it's like part it all the
way to the other side of my hair I
didn't do one big track I split them in
half and glued like one by one because
when you do like a very long track it's
possible however is just more messy so I
wouldn't recommend that so just like you
know if you have a pretty long part just
cut the track in two pieces and then
glue it that way I hope that makes sense
if it didn't make sense just comment
down below and ask me and I'll try to
explain it further
so I finished off the back and now I'm
going to the front um and that's where
you know I started you know really
getting into it so for the front two
matters the rows and it also looks like
I'm doing a lot of passing the flattery
which I am however I have it on a very
low heat which is why it's requiring me
to like flatter it more than I usually
would my hair is actually not as
straight as it could get I just didn't I
didn't want to like put it on super high
heat you know I'm just like I just not
worth it as far as the damage in my hair
go so I just put on a very low heat and
it was it was kind of annoying because
I'm used to my hair getting like
straighter than this however I don't
need to be going straight for this style
because you're not gonna see half of my
hair anyways so I didn't think it was
necessary to put high heat and I mean if
you're trying to protect your hair and
not damage your hair too much I would
recommend that like you don't have to
get it blown straight for this look
because after you end up gluing all the
piece in her hair anyways you're not
gonna see her stick your hair and when
it's not pulling straight actually gives
it more body so I mean unless you want
to lay very sleek and flat then don't
worry about it
by the way you can see the track right
now I'm gonna show you guys how I can
say that because my hair is pretty thin
so when it comes to this kind of style
it's always been this way in a sense
where you can kind of see the tracks and
I'll show you guys what I do to fix that
in like one second so check out this
ponytail flawless so in order to fix
that like Gaby space I'm just gonna use
a black eyeshadow I've done this before
my channel forget when but it's nothing
new and I just put black eyeshadow near
the part where you could kind of see the
track because my hair is thin and my
hair isn't been do this style to happen
to the style and during that year
especially I grew my hair out here just
a little Oh fine I would caught
just a little more time so I need this
eyeshadow to make it you know look more
thick your sneaker though you shouldn't
top them now I decide to cut the hair
closer to my hair length because since
my hair was so full of body and made the
ends of the bundles look thinner than
they were because there's so much body
at the top the bottoms just look way too
thin and so I just had to cut it and I
kinda like this better because it looks
more natural and just flows better by
natural hair I did not cut any of my
natural hair in this process because I
knew exactly where it stopped so yeah
after cut that I just bumped a little
bit and then I'm gonna do the big area
where we starting the bangs just look at
that ponytail the ponytails like it
looks flawless I don't know you look so
good I was very satisfied with that and
you know I'm happy with something where
I do that little shoulder dance that I
do if you watching my videos you know
what I'm talking about so I'll try to
figure out what my bangs I wanted if you
want your bangs to lay in your face
Kanaka like a Leah you know how her
bangs would be you want to glue the
tracks downwards however if you don't
want the hair on your face you're gonna
glue it side works is what I'm gonna do
and so um it's all based on how you glue
tracks that's how the hair will float if
that makes any sense at all I mean it
should make sense I mean it's pretty
simple but yeah I'm just gluing those
pieces you know and then drying them
make sure they're really in place
they're cutting them to make sure
they're kind of like flowing with the
rest of the hair and yeah it's so
straightforward this is like obviously
one of the easy things you could do I
started doing this when I was like 15 so
if I could do it at 15 you could do it
at whatever age you are right now all
right so I finished the bangs now I'm
just laying my baby hairs making sure
that everything looks flawless you know
pretty much she's doing the finishing
touches it's pretty much it's done at
this point I should add a little more
shadow in the front part however you
can't even tell they do the track right
there I can see it because I need but
you probably can't tell yeah I'm just
adding a little bit of body or layers to
the bangs just so lets more natural it
flows a little better and then that's
pretty much it I'm gonna add some army
oil in a second just to you know asset
Sheen but the hair itself already had a
nice little natural Sheen I just felt
like oil make it look a little more
sleeker and so I'm not some arguing on
one second and I'm gonna brush that
argan oil through and I'll be back for
my out
my little slo-moes well Gretchen I was
slow you got to see them in one second
all right so this is the finished look I
love how this came out I got on
Instagram live and everyone thought in
my real hair it looks so good then you
literally came and tell like I feel like
a liar like like I'm deceiving you guys
but you guys just see what I did so on
today's episode how to be a fraud you
learn how to make a girl look longer
make it look real at the same time so if
you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up to subscribe like I see like two or
three times every single video and I'll
