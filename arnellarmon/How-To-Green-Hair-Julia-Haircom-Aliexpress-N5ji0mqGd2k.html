and then you need some developer of
course because those will go to bleach
then you need a mixing bowl a whisk
which is very convenient also applicator
brush there you need some full sheets
that way you can lay them down it helps
process the bleach faster now let's hear
from Ali Julia hair this the box comes
in and these are the bundles before
bleaching and altering them you guys my
life's an absolute shambles right now
imma let you guys know that right now
because my fluid got all delete it and
then this over its like 12 I'm drinking
coffee with no cream err just sugar
anyways this is the frontal okay the
frontal and the bundles are different
textures because they currently don't
have front holds I match the bundle
texture that's okay so I'm going to add
the powder bleach into the bowl mix the
liquor into it not too much at first I
you know mix it and see how much I need
then I add a little more to make it
spread and you want to go for like a
pancake batter consistency for this
so after number bleaching we'll mix in
the bleach mixture I'm going to lay down
my foil that way I place my hair buttons
on top of them so yeah I don't know
what's taking me so long oh I'm glad my
hair I'm really sleepy so I want to lay
my hair like this and that's because I'm
going to die the pitch of the bundles
first coupling for ombre effect to be
honest I don't know if I shouldn't have
done this but I didn't have to because I
feel like by doing this well the way I
did it I over process the bundles which
is why my ends are drier than the rest
of my hair
luckily the rest of my hair stayed
moisturize and stayed nice but the ends
were definitely dry yeah you're going to
take your little brush and just brush it
on the ends of the hair now I'm slow tip
you want to make sure that you get every
single strand so after I do one side of
the bundle I flip it over I do the other
side just to make sure it's all coated
evenly now I mean you Thunder the best
you can if you miss a piece it's not the
end the world in fact if you're dyeing
the hair like a darker color such as
this green it actually is kind of cool
it gives the hair more dimension so
don't beat yourself up if you like miss
a piece or two because it means it will
completely ruin the look but then again
these Lots look perfect and try to get
every single strand of hair so yeah I'm
going to do this part up but I'm just
putting the bleach on the ends and then
I'm just placing the foil on top and
you'll know that the foil or the bleach
is processing because you could touch
the foil and you could feel it getting
hot and the hair kind of actually starts
steaming interesting but pretty cool so
sorry I let the hair processor maybe
like 15 20 minutes this would look like
now this way went wrong I should have
rinsed out the bleach on the tips but
instead I just added more bleach and let
it process even longer and the reason I
did this because I didn't want to rinse
out the bottom and risk getting the
other part up on the wet because once
the part was wet it would been hard for
the next step of bleach processing to
process because when the hair gets wet
it the bleach doesn't really work the
same so I added more bleach on top of
the other bleach so the process again
and then I kind of like brought the
ombre up so to avoid like getting your
ends dry and stringy like mine squirt
you definitely want to at least get a
spray bottle and spray it in so that
bleach gets stop processing or you know
rinsed it out and then let the hair dry
and then go for the sextet of bleach but
usually I'm doing this I mean in a rush
I'm just really trying to get it done so
I could post something for you guys so
that's why I don't always make the
smartest decisions but here I am telling
you guys um just just rinse it out or
like spray it I should have done that I
didn't think that it would get as
damaged as it did it's not terrible but
um it's mostly damaged so
alright so the hair process I rinse it
all out and this one's looking like
honestly Timon a huge difference but
then again this hair was still a little
damp another thing when you're drying
hair lay draw the way the kulluk a lot
better now this color actually deters be
done below I forget the name but it's
L'Oreal these dyes these two guys I'm
showing right now I wouldn't recommend
using them unless you're going to bleach
the hair to a platinum blond the last I
showed is the color dye and abusing the
most and then I end up fixing the guy
with because these dyes I honestly wish
to make money and I wasted them because
it just it's not going to show up unless
the hairs platinum blonde which is
interesting because when did my salmon
pink hair well the hair ducks in my
blonde so now it makes sense that cover
took in this one didn't because I should
have bleached the hair maybe a little
lighter blonde but I didn't want to
damage it too much but these colors
didn't really show up much the blue one
would supposed to take a mint color
didn't show up at all so you definitely
like platinum for that show up the one
that's a yellow Elvin turned green I
don't know why it came up a tube like
that yellow gold but um oh by the way
I'm just mixing developer into it just
to help it spread and that was
instructions and then I'm adding this
color accelerant um just because I don't
know I bought it and I want to try it
but I don't think it's some that you
need but yeah the one that in deterring
green the one that I'm mixing right now
that one did show up but you don't see
it later it was a green that I was not a
fan of and the creasing is the Box wool
inside the store the swatch that is the
color of greens like a army type green
it just it wasn't for this hair maybe
I'll try it again and try to do any
different style but you guys see that
once I put the dye in the hair and I
wash it and then it's kind of dry the
green was just not flattering and it
reminded me of the Grinch you love to
see that like later but this green that
I'm put in the little thing right now it
was the best green i flirt to work the
best
it looks teal but I explain why it
turned out the best little later when
I'm fixing it so I took the disc darkest
greens first because I wants to go an
ombre effect I thought that's how it
works so I applied this color first and
then I'm going to
the other color which you'll see it's
turned green already it was kind of cold
to see you change colors I took this
color and then I put it sexy and I kind
of infused it with the dark green to
make sure everything was well blended
this will honestly would have looked
really nice if the bundles were platinum
blonde but they're not so and I took
this blue color and I immediately knew
that it was not going to take I
immediately knew that the hair wasn't
blonde enough and I mean it's cool
because I actually have another box of
this so I will try another video with a
hair like a platinum blonde you just
test see if it works but it was not
going to work for this so um yeah I just
deposit the color and I'm going to speed
it up really fast because this took me
actually a very long time to make sure
that all the dye really got into the
hair because the hair is a little damp
so it was kind of hard to coat every
single strand that's why I say it's much
smarter to dye hair what it's completely
dry but me like I'm always at rush and
honestly when I'm dyeing hair like I
just want I want to see through like
when I'm dying I'm like ooh like let me
here you can do it to see how it turns
out but don't be like me take your time
and you'll save money and it will come
out much better than end
so I let the color sit for like I wanted
40 minutes I rinsed it and I dried and
this was looking like she looks like a
Grinchy like I know I could have made it
work but I was not messing with that
color it just was not cool to me so I
went to go buy another one of these dyes
which I really like they're Jerome
Russell and I've decided to go with that
because I knew that the color would come
out better now I'll explain to you guys
why this color works even though it
looks teal so because when you bleach
hair it has a yellowy tint to it when
you make this color which is like a teal
II blue it produces the perfect green
and I don't know if this hair dye was
like designed to be perfect for that but
it worked out perfectly so when I
deposit this color onto this hair which
do have a yellow tint to it it's not
picking up much the camera but it had
like a very like ugly dreamy yellow tint
to it
when I put this on it came out perfect
as you can see on my snapchat in my
previous video I'm styling the hair it's
like the perfect green and so I just
section out pieces you know I brush the
hair out you know to get any tangles out
and then I just applied to color not on
not like from root to tip but you know
pretty much most of the hair but I let
the tips alone only so some of that
green could still show through now in
the hair straight the green doesn't show
through when I curls it I definitely
seen the green at the tip so I thought
it looked pretty cool and I was happy
that I decided to do it this way
so I put this color in I let it sit for
maybe like an hour just to make sure
that the color is there and this is how
it turned out
I hope you guys found this video helpful
I hope you learned that even when you
mess up it's the case you know is six
and they'll give up no one's perfect
except for like professional hairstylist
but I'm not fresh nor I go to school for
this I just eat myself and then I teach
you guys along the way so if you enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up I
have a lot more colors planned and
hopefully my freaking Final Cut Pro
works out for me to delete my video so I
have to re-edit about twelve o'clock in
the morning but um yeah I'll let you
guys go now hope you guys enjoyed it and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
