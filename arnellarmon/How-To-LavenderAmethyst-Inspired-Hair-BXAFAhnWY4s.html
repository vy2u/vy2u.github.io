you're new welcome today's news what to
be on how I got this hair color this is
a prior one of my favorite hair colors
to date I was inspired by cracker
knuckleheaded that I was inspired by
Birds snow which is an amethyst and so I
got this color using BOTS die now I
started blonde bundles the blonde
bundles were sent to me by a starry hair
and who follow my channel for a while
you've heard them before because I work
at them more than a few times they sent
to me these blonde bundles that one said
he sent me three bundles and a frontal I
believe the limbs were three long like
20 22 24 the front toe is a 20 inch and
so I did cut it though because I died to
hair the hair is beautiful had no issues
whatsoever dyeing the hair however once
I made the wig I know how I want to
style it I tried to do a middle part at
first and it was not it wasn't looking a
sleigh full as I want to look at all so
what colors like these it's kind of hard
to make the hairline look natural
because a baby hairs and all kind of
stuff and at the frontal isn't big
enough it's just difficult and I was a
gap I'm not doing that
and so something told me to cut it like
this and kind of like that and this is
style I got i SuperDuper love it I've
done it so much dollars before but the
hair color I had was just not cute so I
clicked overall style it cute but this
haircut and style and color it's like I
you can't even clock me okay it's funny
because I posted some sneak peeks on
Instagram before revealing this color
and I got a few negative dams like throw
the wig in the trash
I replied you first I also gather want
like oh no sis blah blah I mean I post
in my DM through shambles right now
because never doubt me what comes this
kind of stuff I know how to finesse and
that's one thing I don't do is finesse
away make it look good and that's why I
did right here I have no complaints
about the hair whatsoever I didn't
notice that when I was brushing it um I
did get some Shetty but this is how I
split the West cuz I had a little key
was actually making this way but other
than that yeah doesn't know
the hair what order blog bundles is
always tricky you want to really make
sure you condition in really well
because they aren't even processed and
they're blonde bundles naturally shed
more than the natural at one be colors
but once you put the color red in your
condition you make the wig you should
have no problems but yeah I mean I'm I'm
still shook I cannot wait to take photos
and just I can't I'm done with this
intro okay a bigger wrist video if you
liked the video give a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
so this thing here in its natural state
just your average typical blonde body
wave it looked really really pretty and
as you see the ins looked really nice as
well not too thin and so the diamond
amusing is by Laura else's box dye this
is a color 721 and in this next clip I'm
going to the shade that I'm supposed to
get based on the box dye and the hair
color I'm starting with and this is
second shade and I use this for the
roots in the front part of the hair and
this the colors was to get with that and
I'm this is the box number five twenty
five and so box I three simple comes the
developer comes with the liquid you Lu
just pour the liquid into the bottle it
was kind of focused but you can see what
I'm doing these products the bottle put
a cap back on shake it up and it's ready
to go it's the most simple thing you can
do and so in order to apply this I kind
is one crazy I just start squaring the
dial all over the place because boxing
is very easy to use it's not you know
you don't do too much measuring anything
it's already measured for you and so I'm
Ida score at the die all through the
hair and I just massage the dye into the
hair with my hands and then for the
roots I'm going to take just a typical
dye brush and I scored uh some of this
dye into a little dye mixer bowl and I'm
just going to take the brush and really
like paint the dye onto the roots just
to make sure I don't have blonde roots
because you will see that when the wind
blows and that's honestly all I did is
the most simple thing for the back part
of the hair I start off with the first
box daya showed and then when I got to
the front because I had only bought one
box dye for the front I use the darker
shades on the roots of the frontal and
then a little
on the top part of the wig but the rest
of the hair is just the first color I
showed and I used four boxes of the
first color and then one box of the
second color it will all be listed on
below from not making sense but I just
used in total five boxes and so I show
myself dice on the front - I was pissed
because I thought I was recording this
whole time but I wasn't and so in order
to the frontal I just parked very very
thin sections and I paint the darker
shade of purple onto the roots then I
part out a section and just continue to
do that it was very very simple this is
actually very easy to do and I let the
dice it on the hair for about 40 minutes
then I rinsed it out shampooed
conditioned it very very well and then I
let the hair sit out overnight to air
dry and then in the morning I went in
with my blow dryer just to blow it out I
straightened the hair then I curled it
and I styled it I wasn't able to film
the process of me styling and cutting
and like doing the hair because I wasn't
really sure why I was even going with it
so I didn't do that on camera but if you
guys like a video on how I created this
hairstyle I will do one it's very very
simple and I could just easily do it on
another wig but this the finish looks so
if you enjoyed this video be sure to
give this a thumbs up and subscribe
don't mind the fact that my hair looks
dry at the top I did not brush it it was
a little all in place but all the links
his hair be done below as well as all
the products I use in the order I use
them and that's about it
I'll see you guys later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
