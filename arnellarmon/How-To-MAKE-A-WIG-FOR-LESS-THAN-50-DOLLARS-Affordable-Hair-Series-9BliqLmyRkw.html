you're new welcome so this video is
going to be on how I make this wig for
less than $50 I've been getting a lot of
comments if you ask me to do more like
affordable hair options try synthetic
wigs all that good stuff and so I listen
I wish would boost my store and I bought
this this hair it's like 13 dollars a
pack it's it's nuts it's crazy it takes
me back to when I first started messing
with weaves and I bought like three
packs is hair is by Milky Way I know you
probably never thought you'd hear that
on my channel but it's like Milky Way
and this is their short cut series it is
the French twist style and I got in opie
27 which pretty much just means black -
this 27 color I got this color because
your mind we have the color I just dyed
my hair and you know more light you can
do this style with any color if you
wanted you all black you could do that
if you want however I thought this would
look good on my skin tone so I got this
color and I bought three packs you guys
to see I still have two bundles left
over so you can do this style with only
two packs if you're really short on
money you could totally make it work all
you just spread the tracks further apart
however I mean if you bought all three
packs what is that 13 times 3 that's $39
that's pretty cool and then when you add
the wig cap which is like five dollars
that is $44 plus the glue which is only
five dollars that is 49 it's it's less
than $50 so yeah I like this style
I put the scarf on because I want to
kind of go for this like carefree type
vibe and this wig wrap a scarf I look
like Halle Berry from the call and you
guys will see that in this video maybe
some of you guys let me pull off that
style I know I'm peak mill I started his
video and that kind of helped me as far
as making this wig goes guys sorry I
forget what hair she is used curly hair
but she wrapped it around on the wig cap
and she just didn't use any closure
piece she I pretty much use that videos
look like a guy guidance in order to
make this wig that's a pretty easy
method and so she was my inspiration for
like the style like the way I made this
wig however she did like a wig that was
I don't wanna say it's similar because
hers looks way better but it looks
really good on her
I'm saying that to say that just because
I don't think this work looks good on me
without this scarf doesn't mean it won't
look good on you because you look at
peak Mills video and I'll link that
below if you have the right like face
shape for it it may work but just for me
I'm gonna stick with this scarf so
without further ado I want to talk you
guys ears off
I'll miss you let's watch this video if
you want more videos like this they're
gonna get them but if you want me to try
a specific hair or just different slick
specific styles comment them not below
so I know or maybe if you see a post or
Instagram tagged me in that hair post
right I could see that you guys want me
to do that style and I'll do it so if
you enjoyed this video if you find it
helpful be sure to give it a thumbs up
like I always say and subscribe to my
channel if you aren't already and I'll
see you guys in my next video alright so
first we need a Styrofoam head of course
you're ready to hair now this series
they come with so many different
patterns textures colors so you don't
have to use this specific color or
pattern they're gonna need some glue add
some hair right there to pull it off
and then I'm gonna show you guys the
bundle don't know why I'm just gonna
show it but as I said I'm you can do
this for any of the hair textures and
clothes they have you do not have to do
this specific texture color if it's not
your preference then you need a dome cap
and I got this at the beach sliced off
like five dollars I'll put the actual
braid down below alright so now you're
going to take one of the bundles and
what you're going to do is just gonna
wrap it around and measure it and then
when you get when you get the tracks the
tips are the tracks to like touch each
other that's not so gross then you're
gonna cut it and then you're gonna put
the glue on and then let's see it's a
long track so be patient with this and
after you put the glue on what you're
gonna do is you're gonna get a blow
dryer or you can air dry but that's
gonna take forever you're gonna blow
dryer and then kind of like blow-dry
lightly for like five seconds or to get
the glue tacky so it sticks better if
you don't do this and the Sharks gonna
slip right off the dome cap so you have
to get it tacky just a little bit and
then you're just gonna start to place it
around the dome cap now it may slip just
a little bit only because the piece is
so long it's a really like hold each
part in order to get to stick these are
shorter pieces it would it would have no
problem because it's longer it has more
weight on it so it's bound to kind of
like slip
a little bit but you try keep working
with it and then you know you just gotta
use your fingers to press the track down
the dome cap that you take the blow dry
again go over it you know just to make
sure it's completely dry and then you
move on to your next piece this is very
easy so I did it this way for like the
first two bundles until I realized there
was a shorter way to do it and so I'm
gonna speed up the process a little bit
so I'm literally doing the same thing
and I'm gonna check back in when I show
you guys how to do it a more quicker and
easier way the way I'm talking about is
a little more messier over it's quicker
and easier so I feel like it's more like
beneficial especially if you're pretty
new at this so just be part up and I'll
check back in in a second
all right so here's the way I discovered
that it's much easier what you're gonna
do is you're just gonna put a whole
bunch of glue on where you're gonna like
put the tracks it looks really messy and
then you're just going to place the
tracks on top of the glue now although
this weighs mess here it's actually way
easier it's way way easier I wish we
would start off like this you may get a
little glue on the root of the track but
you won't see it at all so if you do
don't freak out I mean I never care when
I do it and I do it all the time don't
freak out because you won't see it you
literally will not see it at all and so
you just put a whole bunch of glue and
then you place the tracks on top and
you're all good to go super easy so
unless you guys watching now
all right so now the closure piece first
time I've never done this so I'm a
professional if I took a little track
and then I rolled it up
I saw a peek mildew this I've seen um I
used to watch this one youtuber I've
seen her do this too
I've seen this happen that a lot of
times so I should get it right I think I
got it right I hope so
and so I rolled it up and I measured it
to make sure it'll fit the hole when I
wrote the hole was a little big I glued
another tiny little piece in there just
to kind of fill it in because I'm the
hole was too big in my opinion and so
after I filled the hole I put glue on
the trap and then I just rolled it up
and I put glue in order to make the
little I don't know what to call it and
it's all called the closure piece to
make the closure piece day as you guys
I'm an amateur at this
well at least at this cuz I usually have
like lace closures and front tools but
this won't work if you don't have it so
you're all in a little ball you kind of
press it together to make sure you know
it's stained or whatever and then I'm
taking forever why do I speed this part
up oh okay
it's do waiting then you blow dry it a
little bit you know to make it tacky so
that it sticks and then you're gonna add
glue on top a little piece of course so
it could stick to the actual wig then
you place it press it down and there's
your closure
so after you you know pressure close
your on you just want to like press it
and make it kind of flat it's kind of
weird but it work and then use the hair
to make sure no tracks are showing and
that's how you make the wig and in the
next part of this video I'm gonna show
you guys how I style and cut it all
right so I put the wig on and I look
total Halle Berry from the call not
saying she looked bad but we all know
that's not Halle Berry's most popular
look so here I am just you know cutting
the front mainly you know not necessary
making bangs but I'm making bangs I'm
trying to shape the wig to frame my face
better I was like this will look way
better if there wasn't in dark roots I
feel like yeah I feel it cuter if the
roots weren't dark cuz you see how it's
kind of like really dark and black like
up front it looks kind of awkward what
do you think you see you yeah I wasn't
even want anything a little more decent
right how are these video
all right so after I got lists approval
don't mind our weirdness I decided to
pick the hair out because I feel like
the texture is almost too like perfect
but now I picked it out I made the hair
super frizzy so I got this dry oil which
is so bomb
and so from organics and I sprayed it on
top of that to get rid of the frizz
because I just was not digging the
fridge and so I'll just messin with this
wig trying to make it look good but it
wasn't looking like my favorite and I
feel like it's cuz I didn't have makeup
on if--like makeup really pools looks
together especially hair looks like
there's certain wigs that I won't wear
with without makeup
or that I won't wear with makeup it
really depends so take the wig off in
the next morning okay today I did my
face I thought the wig look much better
it's a bit oil kind of like diffuse so
wasn't so shiny but it had that natural
look to it that's not on my scarf the
scarf our American Apparel it was a
body's got like a actual scarf like your
neck and I cut it into pieces and want
to make head scarf so I had like three
little head scarves and so you know I
just put the scarf on I tucked some of
the hair you don't underneath the scarf
put a clip on you know just perfect you
this entire look and this is how I liked
it so if you guys enjoyed this video you

a wig just for fun because you like how
this wig look then let me know and give
you a thumbs up and please subscribe if
