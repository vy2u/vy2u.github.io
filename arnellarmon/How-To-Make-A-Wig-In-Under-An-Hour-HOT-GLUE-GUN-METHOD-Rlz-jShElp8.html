you're new welcome so today's theme is
going to be on how I meet this super
easy of course the train start I can't
wait to look at this apart of you guys
I'm actually moving to a lace sooner and
that my lease is up because I'm over the
threes around here anyways I'm trying to
get mad what makes me so upset is that
when I sign this lease I was told oh no
as long as you have the windows and
doors closed you'll be here at all
anyways today's video is going to be on
how I made this wig using a hot glue gun
in previous videos I said I would not
recommend hot glue a method only because
what I did it one time it like the wig
almost fell apart immediately however I
bought a stronger type new stick I think
that has made a difference because this
wig already feels like more secure more
durable than the wig I made previously
with the glue stick I use like gorilla
glue sticks and girl glue it's supposed
to be legit and I'm Andy say he's like
five times stronger than the regular
glue stick so hopefully that's a
difference this hair is sensitive might
be sore hair they sent me three bundles
and a closure I wish this hair I wishes
the front holds I feel like this is a
much prettier as a frontal I like this
hair more than I thought I would and I
say that because I get sent a lot of
curly hair and so I also know the
distant curly hair and like you know I
just certain curly hair stand out to me
and said curtly I don't really care
about knowing this hair said to me I
thought it was just regular curly FML
Kayla though I'll take my time on this
video however when working with this
hair when it was wet I did notice a
behave differently than other curly hair
I've been seen before
other coming I haven't said before I'm
not saying it's been bad I I don't
review too much curly hair but so far
I've had a pretty cool experience of
curly hair but I noticed that this hair
behaves more like
natural hair versus the other have been
since and I say that because with my
natural hair with my curls when I you
know if it find a little clip on Cermak
little bit when I brush it the curls
kind of crunch back up and it's like
animal sass-mouthing a watch and this
hair did that but it was wet and so I
thought that was super cool I thought it
was something I had to mention because
it kind of like behaves differently than
other curly hair I've been since before
baby went as far as pros and cons to
this hair to be honest I have no cons
but then I don't really know my pros
because I just made this wig so I can't
really speak on the hair too much
because I haven't worn long enough I
will say that it's been very easy to
work with a constant across and it um it
wasn't tangling I did notice - shady
which I do show in the video but
shedding with curly hair
I haven't well curly hair and I like
landing a video through the air of
companies I will recommend and I'll
mention that curly hair in that video
that was the only time that curly hair
that was like crazy other than that most
of curly I haven't sent it sheds it all
sheds but it's never like oh my god this
is another it sound could be like good
natural hair if you're it sheds like
that so um that's the only thing I was
saying I would be really labeled as a
con I just think it should be noted
other than that I I just start wearing
this wig so so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
wear this wig a few more times just to
form a proper opinion on it and I don't
either comment down below underneath
this video like a week or two from now
or I like to look at Instagram updated
snapchat update
be sure to follow me on my other social
media so you guys kind of keep up with
my pay on this hair and not only just
his hair but how the glue sticks I'm
only done because this glue sticks hold
up and like the tracks aren't falling
out of the wig I may start making all my
wigs with this glue stick because I make
so many wigs for my videos that I have
to find the fastest way to make wigs
possible and this just might be it so um
safety from outdated you want to go
ahead and purchase this here now all the
links and everything will be in the
description box below
until then I'll let you guys watch
if you enjoyed if you find it helpful
let me know that I can this video thumbs
up please subscribe and I'll see you
guys later okay so the hair will come in
this box I got sent three bundles and a
closure this what the bundles look like
before I made into a wig the bundles are
very nice the tips were a little dry but
I'm gonna fix that a little later
here is the closure the closure was nice
as well however the knots
um they were unacceptable so I had to
bleach those which is pretty easy it's
super easy bleach and closure so to make
this process easier and also show you
guys you know how I do it I'm going to
pin the closure on to my Styrofoam head
this makes it super easy or you can just
lay it flat and you're gonna make your
bleach mixture I'm getting this ion
color brilliance powder bleach water
pack and some 45 developer also by ion
color brilliance I like using the same
line I feel like it works the best and
I'm gonna mix majority powder maybe like
80 to 20 like powder and liquid because
you want this mix to be super thick you
want to be like butter that like has
been out of the fridge for 5 minutes but
like it's not room temperature yet if
that makes any sense at all and then we
use a butter knife and I'm gonna spread
it on the entire closure piece it's so
easy now I do have to bleach this
closure
twice because the first time I let it
process for maybe 20 minutes and the
knots weren't bleached like I want them
to and I've done this multiple times
before like you know bleaching a closure
of frontal twice it seems like the
second time around
it always bleaches better I just rather
do it twice then leave the bleach on for
like too long so anyways why I let the
the closure process I'm just going to
like put product in these bundles I was
afraid to put product and wet the
bundles once I made the way because I
didn't think the glue would be so strong
which is why I did this first however
the glue into being so strong I'm gonna
end up styling the hair on myself
anyways but this is just what I was
doing to kind of like past time so I
used my hair if a leave-in conditioner
and this Camille Rose like curling cream
and I just put that in the bundle and
then once I'm done I mean like show you
guys the bundle before
to kind of like compare and show the
difference I've kinda just like
loosening the curl pattern and like
making the bundle kind of longer you
know what I mean cool
all right so now time to make the wig
you're gonna need a dome cap it's like
my head's weird like it's like I don't
know if you got bigger but then it's
like it doesn't fit the extra large I
don't know because this is kind of small
on me
anyways I pinned on my closure then I
threaded my needle and thread don't
worry I did not show this process and I
sped this process up because I have a
video coming soon
like I updated how to make a wig for
beginners coming very very soon where
they'll be like more detail to do even
worry about it this is just a very quick
way to make a wig and so yeah I just sew
the closure
all around will the closure duh it's
super easy and then after this I'm going
to start gluing the tracks with my hot
glue gun and while you do this you want
to plug up your hot glue gun that way
it's hot and it's ready you know by the
time you're done doing this you don't
wait for it I hate waiting for glue gun
storm up so it was already plugged up so
here's a glue gun I had to like put a
black backdrop behind it cuz it yeah it
was not looking good with my white
backdrop and then I got these gorilla
glue glue sticks five times more durable
and here the track has shown up close
you know my new camera whatever details
quality gods
the tracks are kind of thick and I could
have split them I just didn't think it
was necessary and it turns out it wasn't
because you know in it going pretty cool
so this is my first this is my second
time doing this but I don't think I'm
that good yet because I kind of made a
mess but don't worry you know when you
glue the tracks first you want to like
you know measure the the track you're in
glue then you cut it then you glue it
it's SuperDuper simple you just measure
cut glue measure cut glue cut glue
measure you know and don't worry if the
glue gets messy because it's gonna get
stringy once you touch it but you
literally could just pick it off I don't
see any glue strings and my hair
whatsoever right now so don't worry
about it it's gonna look messy don't
line discourage you because you won't be
to see it by the time you finish the way
exit or even trip
so yeah this part was quite quite oh my
god
quite repetitive so you know I cut out
some parts I'm literally just cutting
the tracks glue cutting tracks
glue it's super easy you guys it took me
like 40 minutes like I couldn't believe
how fast it was like if this glue lasts
long which I hope it does I'm literally
gonna make all my wigs like this because
it's just so easy it's cheap
honestly buying the glue sticks like
based on how long they last like actual
glue shoot themselves it's cheaper than
like the bonding glue that I typically
use so I mean I hope this lasts pretty
long so I finished the wig and Here I am
you know wetting it just to kind of like
make the closure and the bundles like
blend together seamlessly you know
covering those tracks and Prima's are
styling it I said I want a middle part
you guys this curl pattern is so nice
I'm so shocked with how nice it was I
almost want to die this hair now that I
see how nice it is I kind of like diet
like a lighter brown color let me know
if I should but um
yeah I'm just dialing it's super simple
you guys know the drill I do this like
all the time
all right so I put the wig on and cut
the lace off and now I'm just using this
got to be glue just stick it because
this is wig was a little smaller for me
I had to make sure I damn it glued it's
in my head so wouldn't slip back and so
that's why I did I'm brushing it and
then I'm going to you know oh I'm
looking moving mad fast me because she
slows down but I don't want I don't want
this able to be super long cuz I
supposed to make a quick and easy way to
do it so anyway it's here I'm just
laying some baby hairs I'll probably go
back in or like make them even more
natural-looking but I I was being lazy
and then I'm gonna cut the ends just a
little bit that were looking a little
stringy or whatever and then I do my
makeup I let the hair dry and that's
pretty much it I'm saying this now but
the slo-moes about to happen so stay
tuned like right now
and um here's what the hair looks like
you know once it's kind of dried out the
back needs to be fluffed a little more
cuz it's looking a little thin back
there but when I fluffed it some more it
looked better so um yeah this is a video
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
please give it a thumbs up please
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
