on how to make a wig now this one will
include the lace closure so first you
need a dome cap and then you're going to
need thread and of course following
you're going to need a needle now I'm
doing a series imma show you guys how to
make a wig with a lace closure lace
frontal and a through this lace frontal
and this is gonna be all for beginners
because I don't do my wigs where I sewed
them all and you gotta see once I've
done until you need some glue and this
is my salon Pro it's a 30 second glue
you're also going to need some t pins
this is going to help you keep your
closure piece in place so it's easier to
sew and then you also need some hair now
this here's some peerless version hair
they are a vendor on Aliexpress now I
showed this hair my snapchat I expressed
I was like super excited to use it
because it felt beautiful now first I
was concerned because usually when hair
feels really nice individually again in
bundles sometimes we put the hair
together they're not I guess you could
say compatible so you get like shedding
and tangling and it's really it's just
not nice but after I make this wig and
I'm wearing the wig right now I'm I've
experienced literally no no
tangling literally no problems at all
like zero and see how the hair is thick
from root to tip that's why I was so
excited use this hair because I knew it
was good quality hair so you need hair
they need scissors and then you're gonna
need a blow dryer and a clip and I think
that's I think that's it okay
so first the obvious you're gonna put
the dome cap on to your style from hand
now this styrofoam has new because the
one I was using before it was a little
petite and I found this one at Hobby
Lobby and it's actually big so if you
have a big head you kinda have to go to
like a legit store not Sally's because
they have like different sizes so this
one's like really big and I thought okay
like this is a more accurate vegetation
on my head and so I get a t pin eye pin
that down just make sure that the dome
cap doesn't move or slip around and then
I'm going to put the lace closure on top
to kind of figure out where I want to
put it I'm messing up but it also is no
big deal you can't tell I just I placed
it where I didn't want to place it but
anyways you place it right in the middle
until he doesn't matter replace because
you're gonna cut part of the dome cap
off anyway so you want me to tell if
it's an emitter or not but you're gonna
place it and you're going to pin it down
that way it's easier to sew
once you have that situated you're going
to get your needle and thread and thread
your needle and then you're gonna start
sewing
now I sew all the way around so I start
not the exact front but a little bit
behind where the closure starts and then
I go back to the front because I just
don't want the knot to be in the very
front if that makes sense so I start a
little bit behind where the very front
part of the closure is if that makes any
sense at all don't worry in a minute I'm
going to zoom in because I realize this
angles a little too far sometimes umas
you can see what I'm doing better I'm
literally just sewing and lace closures
they're much easier to make a wig out of
because they're just more simple they're
smaller
now lace frontals they're annoying I
honestly hate making Windsor lace
frontals because it just it's always
hard and later on so I was a little too
big and I just I'm not a fan of sewing
them they just require more work which
is why I decide to split this series up
and do a video for each one because each
one is different I mean honestly it's
over the same technique as far as like
the glue in part which you guys have
seen a minute but when it comes to taxes
sewing down the closures they're each
each of them are different and honestly
like with a 360 lace frontal that's like
a whole new thing and I personally hate
those I really do not like them at all
but I mean I know that people want
stories on them so I'm gonna do it
anyways but yeah so I'm just sewing and
I'm gonna zoom in like one second it
should be happening right now and take a
seat closer but it's really simple I
learned how to sew when I was in the
fourth grade so I think that's why it's
pretty easy to me but I mean something's
real easy is just stitching and you're
just making sure the needles going
through the lace of course and through
the dome cap so it's staying on and it's
secure
you
all right so I finished sewing the lace
closure off-camera I mean it's pretty
simple I just went all the way around
and now it's time for the easy part and
that's gluing the tracks on to the dome
cap so I'm just showing you guys like
how you guys see where I kind of messed
up it wasn't perfectly straight but
honestly doesn't matter by the time you
put the wig on you cut the dome kapha
you need so that's why I really wasn't
concerned
all right so you can take your bundle
you're gonna cut it and get ready now
they send me five bundles and a closure
and all five bundles are the same Lin so
usually if you have bundles and you have
a like different lens you want to put
the longest one at the bottom and then
you know you closer to the top that's we
use a shortened bundle so it's layered
but these are the same length so it
wasn't hard and I'm going to showing you
guys the web so Westwood constructor
really nicely however when I got to the
last bundle I noticed that part of the
weft got thicker so that kind of threw
me off so I really don't like on bundles
do that but for the most part the bundle
is pretty good like I've had to rate the
bundles I mean I'll just give them tens
I'm not gonna let one piece of the
bundle mess up for the whole you know
the whole entire hairpiece so yeah you
should get it and you want to measure
from the very like I guess you could say
from ear to ear now the reason why I do
this guy float the hair falls better
falls naturally when you like you know
it's it's kind of like falling from your
face if that makes sense
oh my god you guys I'm so all over the
place because like we have a cable right
here I just moved downstairs to my
living room and the little fire detector
you guys just hear it the fighter
tractors on so the BP I'm like the most
frustrated person in the world right now
and I'm really just trying to do this
and it's like the world's against me
like from doing this I don't know what's
going on but I just measured a piece and
now I'm gonna take my glue okay and I'm
stressed I put it on the track now you
don't want to put too much but same time
you make sure you put enough to where
this gonna stick I just know that in the
past when I put too much glue it's
really messy and when you press down and
press the piece onto the dome cap the
glue kind of like spills from the side
so that's not what you want and then
this step is crew for your near
blow-dryer and they're gonna dry the
glue for just like five seconds no
longer in bad just really really quick
just five seconds you're going to just
run the blow-dryer over it and this
would make the glue a little tacky that
way when you put onto the dome cap it
actually sticks and it dries much faster
but later on this video I'll show you
guys what will happen if you don't blow
dry the glue first because I mean you
can do that it yeah it may work but this
just cut your time like in half and it
just makes it easier for people who do
this for the first time because they had
you go to see later watching the example
but when you don't blow dry the glue
first it just slips it slipped right off
the dome cap and so most
annoying thing ever after I stick to the
head I'm gonna take the blow dragon I'm
just going to go over it one more time
just to make sure that is secure and
that it's completely dry and then I'll
move on to my next pieces absolutely
Pete the same steps so I'm going to
speed it up a little bit
after I was done using that first bundle
how a little extra piece so this one I'm
going to show you guys what happens when
you do not blow dry the glue after you
put on the track so I put the glue on
the track and then I'm going to zoom it
but I'm gonna zoom up a little bit just
to see what happens I'm going to try to
place and I put in slow-mo to them
really extra I'm going to try to place
it onto the dome cap and you guys will
see it literally does not stick and it
slips right off and it's very very
annoying the only way you can get two
sticks if you hold it for super long and
who wants to do that not me so that's
why you need to blow it out of glue just
at least for five seconds before you do
it so here I am going to show you guys
like the shape that I'm putting the
tracks into now it's like a u-shape I
used to do this shape and then once I
got to that this part I used to just put
the tracks through the tracks straight
across but I learned that when you
continue to do this shape up into the
very top it's much more seamless and
it's easier to hide the tracks through
the lace closure because sometimes if
the hair if it's based on my hair and
how do you lay the bundles but sometimes
you can see the bundle the tracks
through the lace closure so I notice
that when I do it in the zoo section up
to the very top I don't see any of the
tracks through my lace closure or the
lace front or whatever type of leaves
I'm using I'm pretty much will just do
the same thing I've been doing and
that's just like measuring how much hair
I need and then putting the glue on blow
dryer then stake to the dome cap I'm
just showing this part because I know my
last wig video I really didn't show
every single part I just didn't want
anyone to complain and saying I didn't
show enough and I want make sure you
guys really get this method so I'm going
to speed up a little bit but I'm
literally doing the same thing I've been
doing
all right so I got to the very top and
so now I'm going to start placing in the
tracks like I guess horizontally inside
that that little you part and that just
makes a lay flatter front and I mean I
just I don't know I prefer to do it this
way and so I'm just going to cut little
pieces and fill in that center piece
now I'm done making the wig so I'm gonna
take a comb and kind of comb through it
and make sure there's no tangles or just
you know just come through it like you
do with any wig and then what you want
to do before you even take the wig off
the styrofoam head you're going to want
to get a blow-dryer I just kind of
blow-dry it through it all just to make
sure everything's really dry because if
you when you lip up when you lift out
the styrofoam head you're are going to
have it's gonna it may feel like it
doesn't come off the styrofoam head
because some of the glue will seep to
the dome cap which is why it gives you
like a plastic little cap and put it
underneath the dome cap I just never do
that because I mean it's not a big deal
to me but you just want to dry it so
that none of the tracks are you know
misplaced or no them to get loose
because they're still a little wet which
they shouldn't be if you've been blow
drying each track I just personally do
this graphic look it just seals the deal
and it makes me just feel like more
secure
all right so now I took the wig off the
dome cat I don't miles the white pieces
that's just from the start from head and
it literally happens on my wigs and you
really cannot see them so it is a bother
me now you want to cut the piece of dome
cap that's showing underneath the lace
closure that way it's not black because
Newman's scalp is like that black so now
I'm gonna work on my part now with lace
closure so I always do middle parts
because I feel like lace closures are
not big enough to do side parts unless
you place them in a certain way which I
almost you lazy to do so every time I
get a lace closure I just do a middle
Parkes I feel like it is just most easy
and it looks the most simple I also
prefer lace frontals which is why I like
don't worry my lace front tutorial be up
sooner wool soon after this video but
with lace closures are kind of limited
because I mean you don't have that much
lace to work with I'm trying to part the
hair so I am able to tweeze the part so
to make this easier I'm just going to
spray a little water on it because it's
like when the hair is dry it wants to
its own thing whereas when you wet it
lays flatter and it just easy to work
with so I wet the hair and I had to turn
it towards me to good idea of like where
the part should be even though my part
was not straight like it was until I
plugged it I'm like wow this part it's
not really straight by me honestly as I
started when the parts aren't perfectly
straight it's okay because it makes look
more real you know like I don't see many
perfect parts often okay so that's why I
just kept it as it was and I was
honestly too lazy to fix it so I'm just
figure out the part right now
now I'm just tweezing this part and now
conclude the video now I did post a
video right after this one I just didn't
want to post them like I didn't want the
video to be too long because our 23 mins
long so I decided to separate the two
and this is part one where I show you
guys I made the wig and part two is
going to be me putting on the wig
styling it and a more in-depth review on
this hair so when you're done with this
be sure to click the video I literally
just posted right after this and you
doesn't see me put the wig on and
everything but yeah if you guys enjoyed
this video if it was helpful please let
me know and give it a thumbs up if
you're not subscribed please do so right
now and I'll see you in my next video
which is like already up
