head and a dome cap this is the dome cap
I'm using it's just a typical spandex
dome cap you're gonna need needles and
thread I like to use at least 3 or 4
needles or more if I'd have them you're
going to be clips duck clips will work
just clips with the little clampy things
you're going to need a comb some
scissors and you're going to need a few
scrunchies and more like clips that's
gonna help keep the hair out the way
while you're sewing you're also gonna
need stick pins you guys will see what I
use them for I know it's kind of random
Oh before I say you need hair you need a
laptop or some type of DVD player so you
could watch Netflix oh you're not bored
because no one ever tells you that you
get really bored just doing this so get
some entertainment and then get your
bundles now time to start sewing on the
front hole for this wig I'm gonna leave
a little bit my hair out because it's a
curly wig and I don't have to straighten
my hair so I like leaving a little bit
of leave out so I'm gonna put the
frontal directly where the dome cap
starts however if you want your frontal
to light completely cover all your hair
and you want none of your hair out
you're gonna move your frontal maybe
like half an inch above where the actual
dome cap starts so that way cuz when you
start sewing the frontal kind of gets
pulled back by all the you know the
tension and stuff with a thread I'll
explain this another wig video because I
plan on making one where it's like a
whole wig with no hair out I'm just
explaining why I lies it up directly
where the actual cap starts I pray that
that made sense by lining my frontal and
I'm getting the stick pins to kind just
help keep it in place so that way you
know I kind of get it ready to start
sewing and I'm using those clips to kind
of clip any loose hairs or annoying hair
that in my way out the way so I'm going
to start off by still in one side of the
front hole and they want to get done
with this side I'll show you guys when
I'm finished I'm gonna move to the other
side because I don't like to sew around
I like to sew one side first I go to the
other side I pulled the front toe a
little bit just to make it tighter and
then I sewed down and then I sewed the
back of the front toe at the very end
you guys will notice in this video that
the angles kind of changed quite often
that's because beena this is my first
time making a video on how to make a wig
I wasn't sure which angle looked best so
I changed it throughout the video to see
you know what works best
I changed the lighting a little bit so
I'm sorry that kind of distracts to you
I was just trying to figure out what
looks best if there's a certain angle
that you thought looked best and you
thought that you could see the most
please let me know that way for my next
tutorial I can do better this is my
first one so I kind of just played
around with it so yeah just give me
feedback and let me know peace
Piketty sewing I'm not gonna show myself
so the whole entire thing because this
is very time-consuming and I had to
really kind of like reserve my battery
by just you know it's really really
simple you just have to know how to sew
honestly you need to do this I just
started making these a couple months ago
and I'm getting better each time I do it
so this one looks like when it's fully
sewn down and I'm going to turn around
on the side and sewed that side down so
I sewed both sides down now I'm going to
sew I haven't know what to call that
part just the back part of the frontal
so I noticed that thread on this side
was starting to get a little short so I
knew I was going to start over but
rather than just wreath reading a new
needle I just go to the opposite side
and I start sewing on that side and then
what I end up doing was just sewing and
sewing and sewing on both sides until I
met in the middle and then I just
finished it off and knotted up in the
middle if that makes sense
I just think that's pretty simple I just
sew it on both sides time in the middle
soin I'm like okay I'm on a roll here
now I'm nowhere I cut my freaking finger
I stabbed it so I take a break but I
finished and Here I am cutting the lace
guys I was really injured you know one
time I stabbed myself in the hand with
the for trying to get brownies they're
old brownies man sat out all night well
no they were in the fridge actually and
they're like the hardest brownies ever
but I was determined I was like I want a
brownie and pretty much like I was
trying at the brownie with a fork and
the fork went through the brownie and
into my hand and stabbed the heck out of
me but anyways now that you guys care
about my hand you know cuz I totally
don't leave my hand and make my wigs for
this tutorial for you guys but it's as
years ago I'm just kidding oh it's on to
the good part and that is sewing the
actual bundles into the to the wig so do
you guys like this view I don't know I
think this is a really good view and
like I was so up close so I just start
by just sewing into it now I'll say this
I sew into the tracks some people in
this other wigs they so like I guess you
could say like through the tracks we're
not going to the track so I kind of
underneath the track through the hair
but I like to sew like through the
actual track all exact look it's more
secure of the reason why some people
don't like sewn through the track is
because apparently it causes shedding
but I really do feel like it's based on
the bundles you have and how well that
that they're constructed because some
bundles are another word some bundles
they just suck okay and some butters are
made now these bundles they're really
nice like the way the webs were they're
very neat they were sewn very neat so I
felt confident and sewing through the
tracks and I you know I didn't I felt
confident knowing that the bundles
weren't gonna shed and I sewed the
needle to the tracks and I was right cuz
I haven't had any shame so far
whereas but like some bundles you know
you kind of tell if they're weakly
constructed and then you can make that
decision yourself if you want to sew
through the hair or through the tracks
I'm just letting you guys know what I
did
we
so if you want something so I'm only
gonna show myself sewing this track in
detail because as you can see it takes
forever and this shit is like it's like
not even double speed up it's like Plus
after three cut quadruple speed it up
you know it's times for the speed it's
still taking super long but you know I
just kind of like you know I just sew
the track the top of each other I keep
going till I get to the very top and
when I get to the very top I'm gonna
show you guys what I do as far as making
a lay flat at the top
okay so on one second I sold like ten
tracks now I'm almost done no I'm
totally exaggerating it took me like two
hours at least anyways so what I do at
the top before I fill in all of it I get
a track at the top and I put it pretty
much not on top very very close to where
the back of the lace frontal is and I
pretty much anchor this track to the
lace frontal because it's just more
secure and so as I'm sewing this I'm not
just sewing the track into the actual
dome cap I'm sewing it into the back of
the lace where the frontal is just so
that there anchor together does that
make sense I hope so it's like I said in
the most simple way possible and I'm
laying as flat as I possibly can that
way you know it just lays super flat and
when I put the hair for the frontal on
top of this it's all covered up it's all
seamless just do this and it looks
really good you know yeah so I'm just
gonna do that I'm gonna speed this part
up so we can get to finishing this wig
after I get done sewing this track I'm
gonna go in and fill in that empty spot
that I'm showing you guys right now so
after I get done filling in that empty
space that's pretty much it all have to
do now is cut off the spandex dome cap
where you can see their lace frontal and
which is pretty easy I pretty much just
kind of like cut a oval shape or I just
follow the frontal and cut anything that
you could see through the frontal
because you don't want your scalpels
with black you know that's not realistic
and that's pretty much it now of course
you have to you know pluck the closure
and customize it to your liking which I
will show my next week making video but
my next video will be how I put this wig
on and how I make it look all good and
nice which I know you guys want to see
that's premature audit for this video
I'm so happy I finally did this you guys
been waiting forever thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
