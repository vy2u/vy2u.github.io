haven't seen me in like five days and
honestly I just haven't filmed because I
want to give my other video some time to
kind of like marinate on my channel I
was like posted back to back to back and
typically if I was posting like makeup
tutorials I wouldn't mind doing that but
I post a very informative video this
video right here and so I thought I'd
give some time to shine and do its
little thing but I am back more videos
um today's videos gonna be on how I got
these beautiful curls they're beautiful
right um and to me a little review but
in stab doing the review and the
beginning the video and talking a lot
I'm just gonna do it while I'm showing
the tutorial so if you want to know
where I got this wig because this is a
wig and what I think about it I mean it
looks great
okay but you want to know my thoughts
just watch the video and you'll hear it
as the video goes on just don't want
something to be super long um I think
that's allowed to say I feel like I'm
forgetting something
am i oh no I'm not let's just get to
this tutorial so ma'am here it is how to
get these beautiful curls Oh
in fact this choker let me know because
I made it myself and I think it's really
cute and it works I match my backdrop do
but like let me know and I'll do a DIY
and I'll see you guys next video so I'm
going to need three scrunchie today and
I'm gonna make sure my wand is on I'll
put the exact like barrel size down
below but this one is from Bellamy now
I'm going to power head to two sections
and I'm going to scrunch you up one side
and I'm going to part the other side to
other sections so in total I have three
sections hence why I have three
scrunchies so imma do that really fast
oh I parted off the first section I'm
just taking this comb through brush and
is combing out any tangles that might
have gotten the hair last night when I
slept and so now I'm going to take this
little section in the back I like to use
tinier sections in the front I like to
use I pretty much go from smaller
sections to thicker sections to smaller
section so I'm getting this really tiny
section about this big now I'm going to
curl I'm going to zoom up so you guys
see what I'm doing and I put it in slow
mode because you guys know I love
slow-mo so I'm wrapping the hair around
the wand and you could kind of see that
I'm kind of like pulling it make sure
it's tight around the wand that's to
make sure that curls last as long as
possible as you can also see the hairs
kind of bunched up and it's not laying
flat on the wand if you guys want to
know what I'm talking about just
watching my previous wand cone tutorial
if you lay the hair flat like directly
on the wand then it creates like a
waterfall like princess-type curl and
that was some kind of curls going for
like I said if you guys want to see what
I'm talking about just I'll link the
other video down below oh my god I just
went and watched the other video to make
sure it's like it's legit and it's not
legit you guys my qualities and shambles
but I mean if you want to go see go see
it just just know I've upgraded my whole
entire lifestyle oh my god I never
realized how much I upgraded until I
just want to go watch one of my older
videos my voice over sounded horrible oh
my god I'm never yeah anyways this is
the curl I'm going to show you guys
again and make sure I do it slow just so
you guys can kind of get the technique
down oh my oh my god you see the last
video I completely have like improved on
my wand curls and oh man oh man here we
are again doing the same thing
um while curling is pretty easy you have
to have patience
and you kind of have to be okay with
burning your finger at least once during
the process because it's gonna happen I
mean I actually I did burn my fingers at
all this time because I mean pry cuz I
was recording I was trying to be perfect
but just know that you might burn your
finger and it's okay because the burn
only burns like a day that'll be gone
and you'll be fine
so here's the second curl we're gonna
slo-mo that baby up again because we
love slo-moes and you guys see I'm
adding extra angles in this video I'm
doing the most while recording this it
kind of made me realize just how weird I
really am but I was having fun just
having my curls bounce so I'm gonna
speed this up and watch speed and stuff
I'm gonna talk about this hair a little
bit now this is a wig it's from oMG
Queen hair the same company that sent me
curly bundles and that I made a wig out
of it I have it tutorial my channel I'll
link that below now a lot of people
asked me to try a different texture to
make sure they offer just great hair
overall now there's straight hair
textures awesome it's beautiful it's
super duper easy to manage I will say
that when I got my first week they sent
me two wigs the first one the density
was too low for me it was a little too
thin and I mean it's it's not like a
natural feel but I like a little bit of
body my hair oh I got this wig instead
and I really like it honestly there's
not many cons it's mostly pros I have
had an experienced machete or anything
bad the only thing that I will say is
that on the lace frontal part I mean the
part where the lace frontal is um it
kind of had a how I say this
it had a wrinkle in it um like it was a
like a little lump and for life me I did
not know how to get rid of it I end up
having to put a scarf on and put on
really tight to make it lay flat because
the lace frontal part like the front of
it will lay flat but then when it goes
towards the back where the lace ends on
the wig it's like a little lump like
it's kind of wrinkled I don't know what
that's about but I know that I was able
to fix with a headscarf but that's the
only negative thing I could say about
this wig other than that I feel like the
lustre is beautiful as you can see this
video clearly it's very easy to manage
and it curls really well which what I
look for so far everything is good I do
plan
hairlike I died all the hair that I
review to just see okwait check out this
angle look at that angle do you guys
like this angle I feel like it looks so
cool and just like angles and slo-moes
baby ways I do plan diantha's hair to
see if the quality remains the same I
prefer to dye hair at all the hair I get
because it's like if I'm gonna promote
have to make sure it's good quality both
natural and dyed you know because most
people when they get hair they
eventually diet so you want to have hair
that you can actually die so if you have
any suggestions on what color should I
the hair just let me know I'm not sure
what I want to diet I always dye my hair
different colors so it's kind of hard to
choose cuz I don't like doing the same
colors but if you have any ideas of what
you think might look good just come
below I kind of cut out a lot of parts
in this video only because I feel like
you know whan curling it could be very
repetitive and I know whenever I watch
the tutorial when they're doing this
kind of stuff if they just show them do
the whole thing I kind of skip through
it anyways cuz kind of like a you're
doing the same thing but administrating
guys how to do the front parks I feel
like the front part of the hair like it
just kind of finalized everything and it
kind of you know brings everything
together so I'm just show you guys how I
do the front part of the hair and that
will be that
I am on last curl um for my next tour on
assure what I want to do I wanted to
make up a my skin's breaking now you
can't really tell in the video but it
has kind of like a rash on it be due to
like the weather changing
whenever wet it goes from really hot to
kind of cold my skin breaks out from it
so I'm not sure what I want to do next
I'm not sure if you want to suggest some
let me know but yeah this is the final
look but wait no it's not I'm a liar I'm
gonna show you guys how to make this
hair look bigger and more full wait I
have to do some slow moves first you
guys know I'm like in a Pantene
commercial so I kind of had to do this
kind of into you it was really fun
alright Here I am doing some more weird
 alright now I'm gonna show you guys
I make it look more full I can take some
oil I'm uses PYT oil it's my favorite
one but any oil will work and you're
just going to tease the roots
okay and with sweetest part up come kind
of the same thing and then I'm gonna
flip my hair over to create more body
and then I'm going to slowly but not all
the way run my fingers through the curls
just a little bit and just at the the
roots not I'm not gonna go all the way
down so I don't want to mess up the
overall body of the curl and that's
pretty much it and this is a finished
look I thought it'd look really cute and
I hope you guys do too
be sure to subscribe to give this video
a thumbs up and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
