you new welcomes J's meters once again
how I got this hair color I did this
color on another leg another video and
in that video you guys really seem to
like that color and I got a lot of
requests of people asking me to do this
color in that video I asked you guys
want to see this color and they had a
lot of compensating yes I'll insert a
picture where I'm talking about it was
the same type of color it was just
different style of wig I end up cutting
bangs actually really like that way I
need to do that but a lot into one that
color and so it stays if you go to shake
I got it
this hair from tricky beauty hair base
into me was it four bundles three or
four bundles on the front told the exact
lengths will either be on the screen or
down below and i decide to bleach and
tone the hair that's how about this
color it's super duper easy to get it's
semi foolproof you have to take your
time to be patient and just don't get
frustrated just patience that's nothing
then one thing I can say when it comes
to dyeing hair you know create a color
just have patience and you're most
likely not going to mess up and so as
far as pros and cons about this hair all
the typical pros is very easy bleach
varies if tone to die to color of the
witless degrees and make the frontals
nice I kind of cut too much off but the
frontal had a very decent myspace I just
cut off a lot because I kind of messed
it up but that's my fault
I was able to finesse to make it look
nice enough to wear in this video in
another video but the frontal is not my
favorite from what I did
the frontal itself that they sent me was
perfectly fine the only Connell says I
have known slow this shaggy not all hair
sheds but this hair sheds just slightly
more than I'm used to excited noticing
when I like hook around my finger
through the hair
and I do get some you know some some
strands not each time but I did notice
it earlier when I was curling my hair
and I was brushed and I did notice some
strands falling out so I felt a need to
mention that but I'm that I hadn't know
about experience so I'm Jordan
color the Catena watch this video and
also if you happen to order from this
company before as a customer now listen
you know cuz you know I didn't sit here
sits in the ISO for the review but there
is this rumor going around has been
going around for a while that companies
tend to send a bloggers and youtubers
better quality hair mason customers so
if you order from this company or if you
happen to order from any other company
up and a video on please leave your
teammate got below whether it's good
whether it's bad all feedback is welcome
and it's actually I guess request it
because I know that I can get hair and
not have a bad experience where they
recommend it to you guys but if
companies are sending better hair to me
versus than with this interview they
have time messed up and then it kind of
puts me in a bad position because it's
like if you purchase hair and they don't
send you this quality that you're not
gonna trust me and I don't want that so
like I said before order who's coming
before already had a good about
experience leave that comment down below
that way if someone is watching this
video they're interested in purchasing
this hair they have more than just my
opinion to go on make sense cool
so much I plus this video if you find
helpful if you enjoyed thumbs something
subscribe I want to move along so I'm
standing up but I'm not used to standing
through my videos I we want to show you
guys the hair um big ways eligibles
video and I hope you find it helpful so
this the hair in its natural state is
any four bundles I'm pretty sure it's
like 26 inches and it's in me a frontal
and all front holes the longest front
toes go is 20 inches but I've never had
a frontal longer than that and so they
say minutes from so you guys see it's a
very nice spacious front so by spacious
I mean it gives you a lot of party room
not off front tools do that and so I'm
the hair is very thick and nice from
root to tip as you guys can see which is
why I'm showing you guys here right now
and then a second I'm going to show you
guys what I'm going to use in order to
bleach this hair so the bleach I'm gonna
use when I always use the ion color
brilliance I love this place because it
smells good it does not make you sneeze
it doesn't give me any allergy so I love
it and I use a matching developer as
well and so you can get all sets alleys
the bleach the developer the utensils
the whiz the foil
I bought this all at Sally's that's why
I buy most of the hair dye that I use
and most of the hair supplies that I use
and so I'm just saying everything up to
sure it's all gonna you know work out
because once I have my gloves on and my
bleach on the gloves
I don't like grabbing more stuff it's
just easier dude all I want and so here
I am just scooping some scoops into the
bowl and then pouring a decent mine
developer and then I grab my 30 divided
bill developer before my gloves on
because I'm gonna use this later and
I'll explain that like later when I use
it so I'm going to mix my bleach mixture
up I like it runny because it applies to
the hair easier and then I'm going to
wrap the whisk in foil so it doesn't
like you know get on anything else and
I'm gonna work on two bundles at a time
just so I'm not working on this forever
because this takes a long time
especially when you have like long
bundles bleachy long bundles is so
annoying because it just takes so much
time and it's a lot of goes into it so
first I apply a thin layer on the top
did I brush it through then I'm gonna
flip the bundles I'm gonna let you guys
just watch me do this because it's
easier to watch the news for me to
explain but I'm basically just you know
distributing the bleach and making sure
every single hair strand is covered and
I'm sorry if the table gets a little
shaky is just that's what happens in
time so I'll check back in a few
so now I'm gonna make a second mixture
of bleach in this one I'm going to use
less bleach powder I'm gonna use a
different developer so for the first
mixture I use 240 and this one I'm using
at 30 I don't apply that to the top part
of the bundle that way it's going to
help this overall color job it just I
don't know ever so I've been doing this
and makes my ombre look much better and
it just looks more professionally done
and then what you're also going to see
me do in a couple minutes I'm gonna pour
a little bit of developer directly onto
the bundle and that just helps dilute
the mixture it just I don't know what it
does but it just I notice whenever I do
this it just looks so much more clean
and neat there's no harsh lines and
everything look super professional so
just follow these steps and you'll be
straight
so when you're done you wanna wrap the
bundle in foil that way
the color the bleach I mean can actually
process it sorry crossing the other guys
and see the rapid fall just you know
helps be at the process and make sure
you're getting all the time you spin it
just it helps Kay wrap in foil wrap it
up alright so now it's a tone I'm gonna
use to while I toner through from
Sally's one is t28 and one is t10 I'm
going to put oh my god I forget the
names one is like light ash blonde
they're different types of tones one is
another tone more crazy than the other I
will put in the description box but I
totally did bring for it I don't know
how to describe it
but I'm gonna put the one that's gonna
tone it more at the bottom of the
bundles and of course once they towing a
little less at the top and that also
helps my ombre and so for every bottle
of the toner you need two bottles a
developer and so I just put ten vibe
developer in each of my mixtures and
then I'm just going to put the toner in
the bundles now this is easy the toner
the texture I'm put it fall down just so
like my table doesn't get super dirty
but the texture of toner is very watery
and runny and so it's actually very easy
to distribute it throughout the bundles
this is like my favorite part because
it's just super easy you literal you
could just do this in the most sloppy
way it's no way you could fail at this
so at first you'll send me put the toner
my fingers then I just poured strand
bundles because it is I don't know it's
it's different it's not like hair dye
it's just it's
is easy to work with and so after you
apply all the toner to the bundles
you're going to put a foil on top of it
I'm explaining things now before I run
out of time um you can put foil on top
of you and let it tone for 30 or 40
minutes just to make sure it's getting
rid of all the brassiness it's like a
tone too much because I didn't bleach
the bundles to like a high level of
blond however it will tone enough it
will give me that really nice sandy
brown color that I got and so what you
do after you tone the hair is you're
gonna want to rinse it and let it sit in
purple shampoo I didn't show this part
because I wasn't able to bring my camera
to my sink it was just way too
complicated however I use shimmer lights
which is like a purple shampoo everyone
knows that Shampoo and you're gonna want
it you're gonna run on rinse the toner
out first and then let it sit in the
shimmer lights for at least an hour to I
let it sit for a while and then when you
rinse it out and your straightening
style it and you make your wig or maybe
do some one this is the color you're
gonna get once it's all said and done
and so it's a really beautiful color
look how even and nice it looks it's
perfect I love it so much I want to do a
wig that's all this coat like not even
dark roots anyways if you guys enjoyed
