today's video is going to be and how I
got its really sleek bun the bun itself
isn't sleek its curly but the hair round
is sleek so that's one part that is a
sweet curly bun now this videos even
planned I wanted to do a different type
of ponytail and I want to sort of like
what I was trying to girls in shambles
but because of the shambles I like ya
know they're gonna roast me this video
was just canceled I'm still trying to
figure out how to clip into this video
in spots my pedal ins handy Sydney's
have clippings so I was trying something
different I've gotten to go with it for
them before now I already did like my
cutest style I can do it clip in with
like the two buns of the hair curly and
down so I want to do something different
I just didn't know what so I tried to do
a ponytail blunt straight back and out
okay but it just didn't look how I
wanted to look and I'm also castro's I
got a mirror accent use my monitor in
order to do this so that was also a
little hard and I just realized I have
mascara on crap anyways and so I decided
to do this but it was very very easy to
do
I mean my hair it's growing and it's
getting longer and longer and so it's
slowly you not a bun this slowly getting
nice however when I do wear buttons if I
fill it in Cirque Eriksen blending just
limp really small and I had to move big
so I thought I'd do my butt look bigger
just to like go with my head and so I
use the clip in to act my bunch to make
it look more full and this is why I got
so if you want to see a very quick and
easy way to do a quick little bun and
make a little folder if you have short
hair thick Tina watch this video and if
you enjoyed if you have any other ideas
like you know of what I can do a clip is
please send me pictures I mr. diamond
cakes inspiration then my next be on
doing that so I took lessons video
thumbs up subscribe all that good stuff
and I'll see you guys later
so before we get to the styling I'm
going to show you guys what the hair
comes and it comes to this silk bag and
this is what all the clip ins look like
bunched together it's pretty full I
already put product in it I'm gonna show
you guys the products I used in like one
second so first I'll use Miss Jessie's
coil custard and then I use Carol's
Daughter form on combing creme and that
is how I saw the clip ins or you know
got them ready so I look kind of annoyed
because you know this is after I tried
that styled I showed
in his video and so here I'm just really
really wetting my hair with this styling
foam by Apple G you want to use water
but I lost my spray bottle so I'm just
using this foam instead and I'm just you
know making sure that most of my hair is
moisturized so it's easier to slicked up
with this gel so now I'm gonna take my
eco styler gel and just starts licking
my ponytail up I'm used to months of gel
just enough to where it's like you know
very slick and neat and I am just going
to start you know putting my hair into a
high top bun so after you get the bun
situated you're gonna want to put it
into the bun and here I'm just you know
just making sure my edges look smooth
and whatnot I'm gonna like really like
lay them and I guess design them a
little later on but here I am you know
just look in the back of my hair just
make sure everything looks super neat
and lay and then we're gonna start to
add the clip ins I'm going to use two
clips so first gonna use this one and
this has four clips on it and I'm just
gonna clip one little section in the
front and then just wrap it around you
don't have to clip each section just
like you clip the first clip and you
clip the last clip the other two clips
in the middle do not need to be clipped
and then I'm going to add another piece
and I believe I use another oh this is a
three this is a three clip one and so I
clip the first one on top of the first
clip extension and then I wrap it and I
clip it and now you're gonna want to
wrap the extensions or the clip ends you
know around making sure you're covering
the clip and everything looks seamless
and you're gonna want to like I guess
manipulate the bun into looking natural
whatever looks natural to you I could
have left it like this but I want to
wrap it a little bit more because I felt
like this looked a little too curly for
me if it makes sense so here I'm just
you know just play with the bun making
sure that I like it now I'm going to go
back and relay my edges and I just you
know use a little bit more that foam to
rewetting uh because my edges lay the
best well my hair is wet and we use my
kiss edge control brush to just you know
design my edges
after I get done perfecting my edges I
take another scrunchie and I wrap it
around the bun just to make sure that
the hair is going nowhere and it just
looks perfect and you know on meat and I
think this little mistake I made and
after that that's pretty much it so this
is like super easy to do you can do this
every single day if you wanted to it's
like the most easiest thing ever and it
just gives you a nice full little bun so
