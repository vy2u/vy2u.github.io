welcome so today's video is going to be
on how I achieve this ponytail so long
so short you guys know I get sent hair
from companies all the time and I was
going to do a wig like a hair type
tutorial which I still would like me
doing videos like that but I'm trying to
like figure out ways like make my
content more like different and more
like cuz I ever wants to wear wigs with
people who like extensions so I'm gonna
try to do more videos where it's try to
use extensions in different ways and so
I just think where I'll put my hair in a
bun and I'll use like some tracks to
make the bun look fuller and if you guys
want to be done with that I'll do it
although I think I've done that before
and so I've wanted a long sleek ponytail
like this one I've never done this
before so it's not perfect but it's like
totally doable and super easy and I
think it looks good like I'm gonna leave
the house like this and I like it um
I've never done this before so it's kind
of like I can't wait for her to be this
long with this meat nuts baby ways this
hair was sent to me from LaMotta hair
company and they send me 4 Bibles on her
front open so I still have 3 bundles in
front two left I didn't want to make a
wig I usually do but I wanted something
different because I mean like I think
when people go online to order hair and
they then kind of order the same stuff
you you don't really think to order just
one bundles these do stuff like this
well at least I'm assuming maybe you
won't but now after this video you
probably will do stuff like this and so
with that being said I want to give this
away I mentioned in a previous video
that I'm honest I'm giving away more my
hair because I get so much it's like a
tell agree D for me just hold on to it
and so because I'm not gonna use this I
couldn't use it but I mean I hell out of
here I'm gonna give it away in order to
enter that and it's not gonna be like a
facial giveaway just leave comment on me
a little saying hey I want the hair
maybe just say something nice I don't
know just come to my level and you
automatically be entered and pick
someone at random to win these 3 bundles
in the frontal and I mean I I let you
guys keep the long ones I pick the
shortest bundle of them so these are
supreme wrong and nice bundles the hair
is really nice I will go over the
details and everything this is like a
review I will review the hair in the
video when I'm showing how I like you
know I do
I do but I'm giving it away so like I
said if you want a way to just comment
on below you I'm not the intern if you
want to see how I got this ponytail keep
on watching if you have any like
feedback or things I could do
differently to make this look better let
me know just say in a nice way like a
makes positive way to and be mean about
it but like let me know if I can do
something different because like I said
it's my first time doing this so it's
not perfect but I think like I did a
pretty good job for my first time but
yeah I mean I'll I'll accept instant
feedback you guys have if you enjoyed
this video you find a helpful give it a
thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see you
guys later
so first I'm sure the bundles in the
frontal because this is a review so I'm
gonna give you guys my thoughts on this
hair I personally this hair but more so
I like how the bundles were constructed
they were constructed really nicely and
I'm going to show my self slaying the
tracks just so you guys can see how
nicely these bundles are constructed
they're very thick but not too thick
I'll show you guys so I showed the
bundle now here I'm just showing the
frontal like I said to begin this video
I'm gonna give three these bundles in
this front tool way so if you're
interested in winning this just come to
me little paisley nice I don't know say
anything and you're automatically
entered so I'm going to take away like
the frontal and through these bundles
and just work on one of the bundles I do
it to diet in order to make it match my
natural hair and so on first I'm gonna
take this little silvery thing off and
then I'm going to unravel the bundle and
as Justin see I'm rambling this wasn't
that hard at all um not really any
tangling it was pretty simple so that
was cool
so here I'm splitting the track now this
is always a good test to see how well
the bundles are constructed and I feel
like if the bundles are constructed
nicely the hair is usually nice as well
and so I use an exacto knife and I just
split the track all the way down and I
got no rips no tears the track literally
split so easily all the way down so this
is definitely good bundles good hair
good all that because I didn't see like
I mean I had no issues at all if a
bundle is constructed nicely you'll rip
like halfway or even like a quarter of
the way but this literally like cut the
whole way through so I love that because
makes my life easier I hate when the
bunt like the track splits like in the
middle of me doing this is like the most
annoying thing ever so here's the bundle
it's one by split into two pieces and
I'm gonna lay down some foil because I
plan on dying this hair lay down fall
first but then I'm going to spray some
like this got to be spray underneath the
foil just so it kind of like doesn't
move and doesn't slip around this fall
always does that it's super annoying and
then I'm gonna die this hair using this
I think it's dark lovely it's dark
lovely yeah dark and lovely this is jet
black I have two boxes one for the
bundle and then one for my real hair
because I want to die both in the same
day so they match accurately and
perfectly and so it's super simple
I mean it's box sides really simple just
get your little ingredients out the
developer app or the color in shake it
up I'm taking forever what am i doing
what am i doing Oh
shake it up then in this little paper
thing I don't read the instructions but
I do grab the gloves that are inside put
those gloves on and you just start dying
the hair it's super duper simple because
it's black like this like the easiest
color you can do like this is foolproof
there's no way you can mess this up
so let that stuff like 40 minutes and I
died my real hair my hair is gonna shine
was lately yeah it's cool though
I just like conditioned my hair and let
it air dry so that's what it looks like
that and so now I'm gonna brush it out
containg we kind of heard it first and
that's why I guess I was gonna blow dry
it I want to do the style without
blow-drying it but my hair it would just
do a little too rough for me to not blow
dry it so I had to blow-dry it and then
I'm gonna starts licking it down
so I'm starting my hair down I use my
kiss edge control my favorite stuff ever
I'm just taking brush I'm speak I'm not
gonna talk this whole part because I'm
like doing the same thing but I wanted
metal part because it makes my forehead
look less bigger do you have a big
forehead don't sleek it straight back do
a middle part and trust me it makes it
look like smaller now I'm just looking
back I'm really just gonna work on
making this pony tail part look perfect
so I'm gonna slip my hair back just
keeps licking and lay my edges I'm gonna
let you guys watch
you
all right so I'm gonna twist my little
pony tail I ain't really able to do with
it like yeah this is my first time doing
this so I didn't really know how to make
it perfect but anyhoo tzer's coming to a
setup put a ribbon on it I'm gonna take
the track and we're gonna work on the
ponytail now while doing this ponytail I
think the best angle of it all though
it's like super straightforward I'm we
were just wrapping the track around the
ponytail I wish I would have showed it a
little better however whenever and
you're gonna see this whenever I get too
much to the side the way my camera set
up I don't know how to work it like the
best but like if I if I turn around to
the side show the back I couldn't like
ensure that it would be in focus because
whenever like my face wasn't really in
frame it'll like D focus I don't know
what that's about all I just wrap the
track and then I grab some of the hair
from the track and wrapped it on the
ponytail so you couldn't see the actual
track itself and so I added one piece
first and I looked at that and I want
the ponytail to
ponytail to be thicker so then I grabbed
the other track I had I wrap that around
the ponytail so like I said I'm sorry to
get the best angle of this however um I
knew be blurry the thing is my old
camera
I had a 17 and a flip-out screen but
with the mark series this mark four it
doesn't a flip-out screen now though I
have a monitor it's still very hard to
like make sure everything's in focus so
I'll get better at this but like I said
it's super simple I'm just leaving
wrapping the track around the ponytail
super simple
so I've I did this I brush the ponytail
to got a little tangled while doing this
and then I'm gonna do something else
don't brush too hard when you do this by
the way you want to pull it off I take
this like I don't know these are called
but I'm just trying to make it toward
the ponytail doesn't look so perfect at
the end life like that looks unrealistic
so I'm kind of cutting it kind of making
a little shaggy cuz I that makes
look more real and I could do that um
I'm pretty much done and this is the
ponytail so hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you guys found it helpful
and super simple like I said if you have
feedback let me know tell me but be nice

style leave a comment below and let me
