beauty desert dust palette now and Phil
my initial like initial initial review
first press the video on this oh sorry I
never write see my balcony it's like my
bamboo stick however many ways I film
this review like a week ago however when
I went to edited my Lynch was making the
most annoying sound ever it was so
annoying to the player like I can even
edit it out for the most part it was
almost happening too much so if I just
um went over and use a different lens so
it's not noisy and I've already done my
brows so I'm going to do is I'm going to
do one I have camera and then I'm gonna
come back into the other eye and show
you guys how I do it and I'll do the
rest of my face get my founder review my
thoughts on who to viewed in general
because I posted to my snapchat I first
got it if you fought me on my solution
me platforms you know I'm not the hugest
who DVD fan I have my own personal
reasons for that and so I post on
snapchat i asks you guys like okay like
do you want to see review if knowledge
do giveaway I said a screenshot is snap
I think it's a hundred screenshots that
I'm to do review it got like 600 some
screenshots I said okay I'll do the
review and then I'll discuss like my
feelings about her overall brand at the
end of this video so I'm gonna do one I
really fast
I'm just to get idea what kind of
looking what I go for and then I'll come
back to the second thing all right so
we're zoomed in to do the next eye I get
this I have camera I think looks really
nice um I swear this the NYX lip liner
is always very minor
you ended the second night it's gonna
burning right now so let me do this and
that's I I wish this operate so I've
been using this shadow shields lately
and we like them not only does it catch
the fallout I feel like if you're not
like this super best I shout out which I
mean I'm in erisa came up pretty good
but if you're like that not the best
shadow shields help because it gives you
like a guideline which I like um so yeah
I'm using them a lot lately I like them
it's awesome that the same as using tape
but shadow shoot
alright so first I'm going to take this
concealer and place it on my lid as a
base I'm going to place it like all over
I used to only place like directly on
the lid area and wonder why when I was
blending like in the crease area why did
it look so smooth that guy wasn't
cleaning it everywhere so I've learned
to put it everywhere so my base is a
smooth
ooh which these hurt sometimes and I'm
using this make a dish cosmetics classic
shader brush not the stuff that I'm
going to take this shape desert sand and
I'm going to just really pack that on
top even bring it up to the brow bone
next time take this makeup dish
cosmetics expert blender I'm gonna take
the shape eat in and focus it towards
well I'm gonna put a like on it
everywhere but I'm gonna start at the
outer crease and then just blend in
words if somebody's blazing and focused
at on the outer crease area then I'm
gonna take the shape amethyst and I'm
just gonna really pack that on the eye
it's like the main shade I want you to
see
then I'm going to take the tapered
blender brush all spike make with NYX
Cosmetics I'm gonna like pack even more
of that amethyst shade in the outer
crease area and I'm going to mix that
with the shade dude I hope that I
pronounced that right just to darken
that they're gonna make the NYX glitter
primer and I'm going to use this makeup
but dickish Cosmetics concealer brush I
am going to place it on my lid my entire
lid and then I take the sheet Twilight
burst it kind of folks that towards like
the inner corner of my eye
now on top of them and take this glitter
pigment clot Cosmo and put that on the
rest of the lid now this shade like has
a bit of Fallout but that's because it's
a glitter so that makes sense like a
press litter then put more of a Twilight
shade on top just to make sure it's
really blended and then I'm going to put
the glitter primer on top of that to
seal it in so it doesn't transfer up
here okay I'm going to take this small
tapered blender just to make sure this
all looks nice and blended
cool I'm gonna take this off my eye
because it's irritating it oh my god oh
oh such relief UT my whole entire time
hmmm let me take this NYX liner in this
in the shade Oh Sam shape
tapping it's a purple liner and we can
do very small winged you honestly wanted
me to see it too much unless you're
looking very closely based if you asked
a little detail I like it
I just apparently I'm not gonna go
across the whole entire lid
that's pointless just a little wing
that's it and that is it will not that
side my final outlook but I'm gonna do
the rest of my face really fast and I'm
just gonna spin sparkly as always let me
do that and then I'm gonna go back and
finish the rest of my eyes dual Ashton
all the extra stuff
um my focus i cannot tell these lashes i
can see so i did my last I pretty much
do it
most of my face I tried to speak Oh stab
it up because I wants to be super long
so once in the main focus on palate now
I'm not gonna put out a shout out
underneath my eyes I like I like it my
eyes look right now I do want to add
more hey I tried to add it earlier but
it just didn't pop the way I want to pop
so I'm sad brushing had and me make you
what it was studying spray to get to pop
if I could fight the British I'll use
especially used earlier and I'm gonna
put Twilight on my own on my inner
corner thingies like that look really
pretty this is not the best place but
I'm like fine I'm gonna put while late
and my whatever those things are called
flips like that look really pretty in
stream those likes knock there and take
you turn to the side
I like it alright uh what else I have to
do it oh yeah my lips alright so first

thunder review and let my thoughts on
the product and all the other stuff
alright guys so I put my tiragon the
earrings why there's like pretty like
folly not father but a really chilly so
I love it I love having excuse to wear
turtlenecks um so I thought ball says
palette with a bit train to go by and
don't mind like a little sounds Milo's
out he's chew anything you can find so
don't mind that alright so um wait a
fried go I want to put some of this
gloss on top of the stove it's part of
my home
sorry it's part of that the new kit max
in me I just want to use today so I'm
gonna pull you in the middle if I said
you look pretty alright so um sorry you
guys don't mind him so my final thoughts
in this palette I think it's a super
nice palette I knew that when I first
filmed and I wish I would have kept that
know you as a haven for their videos too
much noise videos really saw my first
impression the pouch super nice honestly
ever site first views that I've been
used at cry every single day even notice
I've been wearing more purpley
eyeshadows it's because I believe this
pack it's because I've been using this
palette so what metal they're here come
here come here
that's right come on come see on the lap
make it too much noise over there
anyway smiles on my lap now he's making
a lot of noise what's it chew on this
brush yeah did you brush all right so I
really like to palliate a lot you guys I
like the lip strobes I use a live show
of the first time I did this look and
I'm gonna insert pictures of the first
look I did with this palette this one's
pretty similar I guess
switch dips a little bit but I'm gonna
insert a picture to of the look I
originally did as well as a clip strokes
I used and so I love this palette it's a
really nice pad you cannot deny that
however is regarding my feelings towards
huda beauty I've expressed that I do not
think that don't drop your brush in my
love I've expressed I don't think that
huda beauty is I don't think she
supports women of color enough I don't
think that she posts enough black women
on her page it's one of those things
when she posts them just enough to where
she's not being called a racist for not
posting them you know I mean like
honestly her page really reminds me of
how Ana stassi's pages to be an
ant-sized page to be the same way until
people kept saying you guys never post
black girls while blah and so she flies
started and now like look how successful
her bread is even more and so that's my
thing I was like CUDA I'm gonna send
this link to the PR so they'll see it
and that's the purpose of me honestly I
made the review because you guys asked
for it but I also want to talk about
this see it um it's okay to support
women of color and it's okay to support
them where they're not doing
embarrassing videos I'm nervous that you
dropped your breasts bunny now you have
to wait I notice that some of the deals
that they would posted when I color any
videos were it it would what's the word
there'll be a lot of negative comments
on those videos or big video where
they're like doing crazy extreme coffee
like you know like it's just
embarrassing videos and if you look
you'll know that I'm not making this up
I don't know if she done it recently cuz
I haven't been our page recently I
didn't ask for this pack but it was sent
to me super randomly and I posted on
snapchat I was shocked
my Vincent stuff from her before two
years ago and so when I got this package
like I don't know if they're going
through old addresses I really don't
know um but I thought it was weird I
really thought it was weird I still
think it's kind of weird but I'm happy
because I mean I wasn't gonna buy
anything of hers and so I'm heading in
the palette because some nice palette
however I probably will well I know I
won't unless she changes the way she
operates or page I won't like use it or
promoting on my social media platforms
or anything because at the end of the
day I don't like supporter and promoting
brands that clearly don't support one of
color and awesome-looking page it's
clear that's that's kind of clear and so
that that's the only sheriff had with
her and the only reason one watch of the
dresses is because my posts on snapchat
a lot of people clearly a lot of people
wanting to do review but there were some
people saying that if you feel this way
about her and they were agreeing like I
feel that way too I think that too then
almost the video is a free promotion but
I mean the way it is this yes it can be
seen this with promotion because we like
the palette and I mean I like the
palette you may go out and buy it but
the way I see it is this like I feel
like I'm using my platform to speak out
on the fact that she doesn't really post
on my color and because I will be
directly sins to her PR there's no way
that this can be ignored and hopefully
it's changed say at the end of the day
look at it a lot I'm gonna make an
Instagram into the careers I wanna
makeup artists you know they make into
the careers and everyone knows that when
you get posts on these big pages they're
really who's your courier it helps you
I'm not saying we need anyone to boost
our careers or help I didn't dates
helpful but you can't deny that she has
like over 20 million followers on
Instagram so if you get posted you're
gonna be helped your any more exposure
and everyone wants exposure and I
noticed that not honestly not many
brands post women of color it's like
it's almost like a thing whether they
try to keep certain people on top you
know I'm trying to say
and so yeah that that's my take on 2d
booty I feel like honestly it'd be smart
on her behalf to postpone a color
because like Finn T Beauty proved we do
buy makeup we spent a lot on makeup and
we feel like we're supported by the
brand that we have no problem supporting
you as well and so those are my thoughts
I don't want to miss two negative video
I'm not trying to bash her whatsoever I
don't know her you know as a person I
saw at a party a man it feel need to
introduce myself or anything um I don't
know her so I don't want to make
something I'm just back to her she may
never under Paige I think her sister run
some pages I'm like that all I'm saying
is that I will like for to see her
support more women of color on her page
because you know people in exposure you
know they're trying to get out there
they want to be known they want to grow
their platforms and at the end of the
day her page helps that's the bottom
line and those are my thoughts
um the palette is super nice I would
never deny that I think if credit words
do even if I do have you know maybe
negative feelings towards the brand
light it's a good ask products of the
product and the palette is super nice
like I will give it that the lip jobs
are really nice um I think it depends on
your skin tell which one's a work for
you she comes there's a lot of different
shades though she's singing like five of
them so there's a lot of different
options her lashes are really nice too
um I'm a shocker like these I like these
ones these are called Samantha and
there's another one I like as well
because they're very dramatic but they
don't feel heavy they feel really
comfortable in my eyes so I like that
the lashes a lot um and you guys know if
you for gonna fall in my channel I'm not
a last person at all
so I approval washes I approve all her
products um she has great products
there's just you know what I said before
so that is the video um you got the
phone review give you guys my thoughts
if you enjoyed this video please give me
a thumbs up please subscribe
I have to go my little keys moving
around but uh yeah
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
