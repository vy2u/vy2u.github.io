new welcome so today's video I'm gonna
be doing this challenge of some sort
I saw many in you a do it and I thought
was a very cool concept and he used all
of his mom's makeup rocks to his makeup
so earlier today I was my mom's house
and I robbed her off her makeup products
I actually have to herb into this video
because I've to drag this back to her so
that way she can get ready for work in
the morning tomorrow and so I'm gonna
just do my face using her products now
after it texted me the way she used
these products that way I could like do
with someone how she does a sauna just
follow her routine and we'll see how I
look afterwards because our routine is
completely different and you go see that
now if you follow my channel for a while
and you can see how doing makeup I don't
kind of scared but we're just gonna do
it cuz we're already here so let's just
get started so the first thing she does
is use a big powder brush to put her
powder on she does not use primer um I I
don't know why she says news primer so I
guess I can't the powder used this is
bare minerals bare Pro this is the shade
nutmeg 24 it's a powder foundation and
she used this big fluffy brush and I had
grabbed that I don't know why cuz I'm
not gonna use her brushes only because I
feel like that's how you break out some
like that and my skin you can't tell but
it's kind of not necessarily breaking
out but it's kind of itchy so I want to
make risk curved skin so I'm gonna use
another brush that is similar just
smaller she's had this brush for years
by the way I don't know the brand I just
know she's always had this brush it
feels old so we're gonna take this
powder and apply it all on her face I'm
at the baikonur with it she's hit pan on
this I'm gonna buy another one
how does she get to stick to her skin
and she doesn't use primer
well what she's darker than me but this
actually looks like it matches but I get
this like me tan my god
she doesn't use primer she's nice
concealer you know liquid foundation no
nothing hiding with her left eye
concealer like imma just kinda powder on
it I get a good amount of coverage
although there's not to be much because
I have no framer and house making them
really stick to my skin without a primer
by the way I have my hair slicked side
ponytail because I thought she wears her
hair so tribe be like my mom yeah okay I
feel like this is as much coverage as
I'm gonna get so that's the foundation
that's all she does for her complexion
this is it
she doesn't wear blush just contour this
is it okay next
she else uses another powder oh I forgot
to grab that some powder by Cosette what
is this it's an invisible powder and
gets translucent why did she meet this
on top I don't know if I'm going to use
it anyways cuz it's what she does
who uses a powder to set a powder I've
never even heard that before my life
she probably use it because she just
think Alyssa got this for her gave it to
her trying to use it just because she
has it one pellet shake my mom I'm sorry
mom
I just I don't get this routine what you
do next lady so next use this makeup
geek shadow palette this is the in the
nude palette you guys see she'd be using
this like crazy oh she's a bigger you
guys see that fall out
she's bigger she used to shout out from
a geek on my other Brown corners of my
eyes then this shimmer on the corner so
I know how my mom does her makeup she
why didn't she have it she doesn't seem
so white she just she puts stuff on her
eyes before of her house okay she's just
English she likes to highlight her brow
bone a lot somebody do that oh my god
I'm looking like her Jesus
yes she's that show a lot I could tell
the shops uses based on how much they
pressed in then she put some light color
in the corner of her eyes she always
does that
then an orange color kinda from the
middle to the outer parts okay what
color and here do you see that's Warren
gee maybe this one okay oh yeah looking
like her this is looking like her
eyeshadow for sure oh my gosh I'm
looking like that woman for sure this is
what she does okay what does she do next
then the color image from the 39
palettes
I have no idea what she's talking about
um I do not take her 3980 palette she
used that palette to I think that's what
she wants to use color loving to do what
she typically does so what she typically
does what she would do gets his little
brown shimmer in her and she dug into
like she was mad she puts it on her lid
looks shimmer on her lids somebody do
that she guys if she mad at his palette
or what look at this poor little patty
put shimmer on my lids like her
these brushes how'd she do so I'm an
aside uteri brushes because those away
she applied for other shokan brushes and
actually the eye brushes are safe I
didn't use a face brush tool that's
completely different but I am using her
eye brushes cuz yeah I wouldn't use
these I do my brows with benefit okay I
got that so she uses these to benefit
pencils that precisely my brow and the
goof proof proof brow Lord I can't
believe I cannot believe she doesn't
like bronzer nope no color in her face
nothing mom she does her brows pretty
interesting she she's not with the ombre
movement per se like she did on the fake
ombre we're like it's kind of ombre but
it's not you know what I mean we're kind
of feeds she kind of has like one solid
color all the way through it'll get a
little light in the front but not like
your traditional brow and she does not
use concealer at all to clean up her
brows like no concealer
okay I guess this is where the precisely
my eyebrow comes in and she uses number
four which is convenient that's when I
use that's not whenever ELISA and I we
get packed some benefit she'd be the
first one on it like well what is it
what is it she thinks his brow pencils
as she wants them to and it's like a
loosely used a lighter one of the
pullback a chevron hair so it was never
issued but she goes the up my pencils
because I use number four
okay this products darker we don't want
that well how does she clean up her
brows she doesn't use concealer and you
know for a woman who does see so much
new routine she take it how long do her
makeup and I'm trying to figure out how
and she doesn't do anything it's like
typically I can use concealer to clean
my brows and these were like come
together but I can't because she does
not own concealer
she just doesn't sorry I guess these are
my brows I don't think it's a terrible
then she's the benefit roller lash
mascara I don't look that bad though and
then is this use a little sponge to
clean it up and shape the lines this
shadow
I'm assuming she means oh yes interviews
before so you just lunge I don't know
where she needs that clean up because
there's not much clean up but you know
this isn't that bad like it this doesn't
look terrible it doesn't look terrible
oh yeah that's probably can't do my mom
around her lipstick my mom likes these
lady lipsticks this is by motives
it's called kinky matte she asked two of
them I cited both of them one is like
almost out and this is one that's been
used but it's pretty new so I'm just
gonna she likes you dark red color so
I'm I said get napkin pad and I put some
back on because I had gloss on my lips
and she doesn't wear her lips glossy so
so that's it she doesn't set her face
she's not putting blush on she does not
contour she doesn't only in that these
these are products and that is what I
used
um I don't know you probably thought
this video be longer it's not she there
he doesn't do anything
sometimes she takes like 40 minutes to
get ready but this is this is my makeup
using my mom's products um let me put
alia you coming real quick let me see
little league things tell me my makeup
you saw my mom stuff it looks classic
like a classic Glenn B so I have some
two-timed it did lipstick like your mom

lightness you're like yeah no it was
