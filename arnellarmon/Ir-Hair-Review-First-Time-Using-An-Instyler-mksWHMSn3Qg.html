just got done filming this hair look I
know looks really simple but it's
actually super duper duper cool and like
I really really like this way but I
liked it before because I mean I I've
had it since me no I'm a internet' right
now
well muscles that will not talk about
March I've added in March on pictures
because this is sames ecwid and I got so
many comments on this leg I'm not sure
why it took me so long to even make this
video but since I wore it in Vegas it's
been one of my favorites I just I just
find our mom's to style it in and like
gods like it so the hair quad is so fun
I'll get it back in background okay the
teres been to me I want to say in
December pretty much a long time ago and
when I first got it I was like what the
hell is this because it before I can
actually remember this I don't have the
pictures anymore leave all my snapchat
and you'll remember we're talking about
where I described it so a hair came to
me three bundles in a frontal and the
bundles are wrapped in like this
styrofoam in order to hold the wave and
so the frontal was completely different
text in the bundle and out comes on what
the hell is it look I've never received
here I got you for and so I honestly was
just like okay like this hair probably
sucks like whatever and I just I don't
know I just kind of like put the video
off because I did wasn't really
interested in working in the company we
were having a disagreement so I was like
you know I'm not gonna worry about it
and so around time I went to Vegas
I made this wig right before I went and
Clery all up like wow like this is
probably the nicest frontal I've ever
like frickin war and I was kind of mad
myself it took me so long to even work
with my hair because I was turn in the
picture this frontal I didn't have to
customize it yet I bleached it a bleach
did not support evolution yeah I did
Lucian us by that's like plunk or
anything and I thought it looked so good
in the wig literally gave me no problems
of whole time out in Vegas and so when I
got back because I've worked on what I
was in Vegas and I didn't wash this
course it kind of had like comprised lit
up and so I kind of took it off and I
laid to the side I haven't touched
but I decided to film a video on it
today because I know I've got a lot of
question about it when I did wearing
vagin and so I didn't cut some inches
off and I wash it in disgust so
beautiful
now this hair all just so beautiful and
shrimpy Oh anyway this hair is from and
I hope I'm saying this right caramel is
there cause I don't know if it's here
it's perhaps I our hair but it's like
I'm in love with like here or earth I'm
not sure it'll just be right here and
I'll let the title speak for itself
in fact words from and it's make three
bottles of sounds like I said the actual
like hair details will be down below
because I got to do this never ever
remember what kind of work or genesis
what length I just know that they have
really really good quality hair it's
funny because they told me that cuz I
got the hair in the mail like what is
this and they're like you know it's kind
of weird but our hair quality is really
good and they weren't lying because this
is some really nice hair has a beautiful
natural luster to it is not too shiny
it has really nice like flow and just
everything and I mean of course there
was more flow because it's shorter now
but in Vegas it has the same thing I'm
telling you guys like did you guys
follow me on snapchat now inserts and
snaps if I can find some you guys know
my hair is popping that whole freakin
weekend and this is that hair and so in
this video I just show you guys how I
style with this inspire I've never
actually styled my whole head with the
Installer and it's actually pretty
friggin cool kind of tricky to use and I
think I used it completely right but it
got me here so yeah I thought this will
collect my own hair and it's really cool
my mother shared lots of the video if
you enjoy it please give a thumbs up and
subscribe be sure to have this company
cuz I really do like their hair like I
would die I don't even want to try out
this wig this style this limp is
absolutely perfect for when I talk throw
away Vaughn and because the frontal lace
will get on my head I don't even have to
do much to it you guys see how simple
that is like this is going to be the
complete throw on wig so yeah I'm
excited I'm sweaty I've hot these legs
are killing me and free late at night
but I just think
to so many weeks I want to get as many
videos as possible for you guys so yeah
how's it under this video I cannot wait
to my makeup with this hair because it
looks I'm taking fire with your students
but eyelashes lessons video and I've
enjoyed and I'll see you guys in the
next one
so this is the hair is natural state now
I'm going to stand up so you guys see
the bottom like the bundle details two
different textures is not like horrible
but you could tell the difference to the
textures I'm the frontal is way more
wavier an actual bundle and I mean when
I was in Vegas I dig with a pool party
and I did let this hair get wet nails
perfectly fine you couldn't really tell
the difference I mean if the pore is
like you know which you guys know
everything about the hair but yeah Here
I am just blow-drying the hair the hair
is dried pretty fast which is a good
thing in my opinion you know because it
makes my life easier when I want to
style it so yeah I'm just blow-drying in
and I kind of spent this part up because
I know it's nothing entertaining
watching blows your hair but then I'm
going to show you guys how I cut the
hair and I literally just kind of like
cut off I don't know math man maybe like
two or three inches maybe 400 I cut off
those ends because I just felt like they
were messing with the vibe of the style
I was going for and I cut it just right
because I could totally mess without the
cut a little too short and it would have
been that awkward length but I felt up
as a perfect lid but it looks like it's
my natural hair like the lid that I cut
it at so I cut it perfectly and some a
potato blow to the hair to dry it and
then we're going to work on using the
InStyler which is like my new favorite
things
all right it's instyler time somebody
funny about this that just sent me
literally over a year ago this isn't to
me in January 2016 and also when I got
it I'm like okay like I don't remember
responds to the email I think I just
said yeah go ahead as bended just
because and I got it and he made me used
to like once but not on my whole head I
just tried I thought okay like I don't
realize it and I I didn't really give it
a chance
I just love my older sister used it come
on okay maybe she would like it more
than me and I don't even know what made
me use it for this video I saw it on my
floor if I come you know maybe I'll just
dial with that you know just do
something different a video and now I'm
so mad at myself for not using this
whole time because one one thing I knows
what has been stellar is that you could
pretty much straight in or whatever this
thing does like super thick pieces all
at once like a thicker piece than you
can do with a flat urn so you could do
your hair super duper fast this and it
gives you so much body and I don't know
which is the hair or in style and pretty
so it's a combination of both but I mean
my hair is still soft and just so full
of body and so fluffy but it really
reminds me of my natural hair when it's
a little longer I think that's not like
this looks so much because it reminds in
my natural hair when it has a little
lint on it
rhiannon so it's really easy to use I
was kind of confused because I didn't
know if the little spinny barrel should
go on top of the hair or underneath the
hair if you watch the video you'll see I
kept switching it throughout the video I
didn't know what made it curl the best
or heat up the best but you guys have to
work with it and I mean I don't know
what there's a certain technique that
you have to use for this but you know my
hair turned out pretty nice so that's
all that matters and I was able to do
this literally in like 15 minutes
yeah I'm just going to let you guys
watch me style this hair um honestly I
have no complaints about this hair about
the frontal I have zero complaints I'm
trying to think
I got no shedding because I remember a
whole
help lore was like a light handed color
so I know it was kind of white morbidly
actually yeah I know our floor was white
so I definitely would have noticed
haired and I was sharing the hotel with
Jabari and other guy friends oh I was
being extra neat and I wouldn't remember
clean up hair okay so I got no shedding
tingling no when it was longer Ulis
curls if I didn't brush it it would get
maybe like I wants a matted but of
course I kind of like tango a little bit
in the back but then you know what I
brushed it out is perfectly fine and I
happened to allow my wigs but I've been
bad I really can't think of anything
negative to say other than how it came
packaged I thought it was really really
weird but I'm you can't judge a book by
it's cover and that's definitely the
case with this hair company because I
was just so not impressed by the package
but when I find to make this wig I was
ok like the actions have good quality
hair they're frontals are really nice
you know without you having to
customizing too much so I really had
nothing either to say like I you guys
can wear this wig a lot of times when
I'm not filming or posting naked -
toriel's you guys don't always see the
wigs that I wear but I really have a set
of wigs - I wear consistently and it
maybe I'll do a video on wigs that I
always go back to and so that'll give
you guys an idea of like my favorite
companies or my favorite hair yeah
that's a cool video I'll do that but
there are some wigs from companies that
although you may not see them on my
channel often I'm always wearing them
off my channel so if you're not doing a
video of wigs that I go back to all the
time just comment below and let me know
if you want to see that and I'll try do
that but um yeah I'm just out of my hair
since Tyler and I'm seeing up some kind
of the same thing I just you know yeah
you
so after I'm done styling with InStyle
I'm going back and I'm going to really
define my part and make sure it's
perfect you know lay my baby hairs
figure those out I'm a sweet just part
up sorry I have a video like a detailed
video 100 my baby hairs but what I
pretty much do is I take like little
section of hair out and then I gel it
down and get idea of how thick and looks
against my skin and I'll get a tweezer
and I'll pretty much tweeze most of it
off to dices splash my nose cut that out
I'll please most of it off to make the
baby hair spin or if I just feel like
thinner baby hair is looking much more
natural at least on me and that's how I
like them so I'll tweak most of it out
and I'll lay them back down again just
to see how they're looking and most the
time it turns definitely fine and that's
how I do it
Oh
you
best player my hair you know instead
lead a little bit more and I'm gonna
take some sense I might cut it just a
little bit not too much who you know is
the difference too much I just want so
it's a little more layered when it's
curls I will say this hair it curls so
beautifully with a flatiron
I'm probably not like butter in it not
tomorrow but maybe the next day but it
costs so nice with the flatter and if
you looked at the beginning a video
where I answer my pictures those are all
curls of flatter and then it closed so
easily like oh it's messy excited
thinking about it I just love doing here
so much and so satisfying watching this
like watching it come together and look
all natural nice right now I just tweet
a little bit by the part to kind of
lower the density so it looks more
natural because my real hair is breathes
in but after I perspect this little part
you know I'm cutting in to do my looping
that's pretty much it that's all I do to
stop this wig um I really enjoyed in
this video I enjoyed it more than I
thought I would enjoy it only cuz I
discovered that I love the InStyler
and I missed wearing this wig it reminds
me of Vegas and it makes me want to go
back and I mean this is a perfect travel
wig so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you let this hair please let me
know down below you know what you think
about it be more positive comments I
really do enjoy reading those and I'm
yeah a subscriber you haven't already
and if you have inspired let me know if
you like it if it works so much natural
hair pretty sure does but I mean my hair
isn't long as he would see that be a
