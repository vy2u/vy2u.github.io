like off the shoulder top
this is coffee ruby ridge rush Propst
colored black obviously in its eyes in
UK and 40s car back okay fits nicely but
it's kind of tight on the arm it was
kind of art thinking this off its kind
of tight uh I should have been a bigger
size I don't know why I feel I sold out
of the sold out of why why I pick spec
for
because you want to make the transition
to the front tight on the arms exactly
sure itself stretch even the our
material is tight as hell like it's
completed materials here's what and the
already shirt of these cool hums I pay
for it
I've seen
$8.00 filming that's cool but I take
about the archetype kind of feel away

short minutes hours next up is this
petite great big newspaper jumpsuit they
got our no clip for this because this
one in go cab my ass okay um a Consuela
petite is newest bit I don't understand
mr. list so she smile should be fitted
hopefully but this point I'll pass my
ass at all like other fools
so it's cannibal all right now I'm kind
of mad I draw for a trial one little
thing money over with that hey I only
heard a twice I have these
already I'm talking before I just pause
my cameras and Rackspace but I don't
think and before they're really just
plain white pants happy because they're
kinda cute is really comfortable so
there's there's east-west routers and
these are $13 a dozen or thirteen
dollars already have a pair i was i
forgot i in order see that wasn't a toy
company but 3559 capri stretchy you can
wear with plain shirts or dress t-shirts
course emerges because the material but
they're still nice I left him I just
every way to maybe try wanted point so I
filled the Pearl tire blows flossing is
a shirt that means really mad um what's
woody called pity at the $18 person at
the economics of this shirt my best but
it up
co-pays a little office office shoulder
collar ever call this is does God we
channeled Katie off the shoulder sharing
way about medium I'm going to meet
everything it is to smaller is not a
necessity
I'm aware you Adams time you can work
out some finesse and differently
welcome sad because I let's try some lat
constitute the most forward to it and in
this victory room so I mean kind of
cancels it's not feel like it is Aspen
is right is that cream loves me no
choice
oh wait Paul this is will ask me oh I
cut off the realizes comfortable
what is it call Oh God that's a tag on
acting and John let's see I does not
want them that one to go me one things
has been a point
oh this is the car long freeze embargo
laptop I still had it all fit very
comfortable I'll be shocked this one
because when you first did you like if
you'll tell us in and chief anything
we're not reversing like an old foot is
really cover my nipples which is what I
will shock about this left either
I like clearly some wearing is very
comfortable add on the fact that it's
like it's been it's not too big so it's
comfortable but it covers you with so
it's definitely assuming now we discuss
in movies can survive I was going to
uncancelled loose contrarily alright
because I understand the shipping kind
of stuff do this after Holly pieces
although I feel like that the case they
should not offer service and we should
not deliver um there's some places
you're even you're not even that
opportunity should be in a situation
today or forty eight whenever they're
offering to look like although I
understand I was worried about quality
time of the very first module is new
ever super bad
this one event superfast I paid a lot of
favors no fast shipping I dialed in like
two or three days but your highlighting
time time you wanna work stuff and you
want to get to you immediately and
that's why sites offer fast should be I
don't think they'd be shocked at
shipping if you can't give that shipping
and that's the issue now as far as some
nice stuff having holes in them and a
heavy overalls every cute with a gross
weight so bad that same time when your
order confettis that I would be happy
for clothing um you're going to get that
time you guys have to deal with it it
sucks but a dirt has been like $10
overall the economy you can expect to be
the best father ever see their life is
their voice yes did annoy me holds
equipment yes you know no one knows how
to fix it but it kind of like you kind
of expect sometimes ordering really
cheap stuff it doesn't like when you
like are ordering hair and you order
cheap place to find and then you have
some problems with it but it got
happened sometimes you know you have to
if you want good at columns just enough
it was more I don't want a little more I
want to buy Google so if I get we don't
close the have some issues I can't want
it to head so um yeah I'm a Canton guru
and then try to order me around holidays
time I fight one before them of course
but I'm going to do another video run
all the time to see if their chicky has
improved I will be that kind of repair
is cool to the sit respond to you they
give your refund for your money but
boobs on ripple you speaker all it
turned off area this is our cancel so
now rule is no double check is your
solid concrete their shipping don't
mutter but until then I'm going to
kind of videos will turn on closed with
organ stuff extending my money for
