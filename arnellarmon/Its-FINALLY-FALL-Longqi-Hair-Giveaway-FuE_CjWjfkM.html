I've been talking out what this in
should be super long hope you guys
enjoyed this video like I always say
don't subscribe all that good stuff and
I'll see you guys later alright so I did
one eye off-camera i notice i looks
pretty simple well it kind of is well it
actually looks more detailed but it's
actually really simple so first it means
a shadow shield and I absolutely hate
these things you got to see why and then
I'm going to conceal my lid with my Mac
Studio I think it studio fix or finished
concealer
in cw35 and I'm you see I'm just
readjusting the shower shield because
it's tricky putting these things on
because they could really hurt your eyes
you guys like they're kind of annoying I
kept having to take it off put it back
on because it kept it was just
irritating the heck out of my eye but I
just put concealer on and then I like
set that with a powder for this look I'm
using the tortillas Pro palette and I'm
gonna start with the shade innocent and
whimsy and I'm gonna use that shade as a
base just kind of like warm up the eye
look and then I realized hey I've got it
far away so I decided to zoom in I
didn't want any complains then I'm at
the shade mod which is slightly darker
than whimsy and I'm just gonna start
building up that color now I feel like
like this eyeshadow look it was nice
however the pigment wasn't really
picking up on this I because I had tried
a different eye shadow look before I
filmed this one and didn't work out so I
feel like why my eye with shea butter I
think that's why the shadow wasn't
sticking like it usually does you never
know when you messed up on your
eyeshadow they do it over and it's just
not the same that was the case for this
and so now I'm the shade drama which I
love if I'm gonna focus at towards like
my crease area and I'm gonna like make a
wing kinda out of the shadow and then to
deepen that I'm gonna just play with the
shades drama and vamp and I Bri what I
think those lowly shadows I used first
look I just I'm gonna keep building it
up to darken it will to pretty much
match the other eye yeah I sound
confused that's cuz I kind of am I
always forget what I do
so after I built that color I'm going to
take this concealer brush and I'm going
to take my concealer and cut the crease
I kind of messed up on this part it's
supposed to be longer but because I kept
having adjust the shadow shield the
shadow shield was higher then the other
one was on my other eye find the fixing
the later so don't mind it but I'm
pretty much just carving out my entire
crease area and I'm gonna set that with
this shimmer color from the joy a
cosmetics candy palette just to make it
shimmery I didn't want any other color
there I wanted to just be kind of like
white but still shimmery and so I find
too that annoying
shadow shoot off and as you can see you
guys see I kind of mess my wing a little
bit I fix later though and that's all
that matters but this eye looks pretty
easy I just hate that I messed up
originally so I feel like it made it
hard to do this eye on camera because I
had messed it up but I mean can't go
back now I still think this look is
pretty I think the final look once I do
like my own to her face and everything I
think it came together what I'm learning
with eye shadow is that when you do an
eye shadow look if it feels like okay
like this is not the best just do your
whole face because sometimes like your
eye shadow when you first do it it may
look a little off because it's the only
thing on your face but when you do like
the rest of your face to go with it it
kind of all comes together so don't give
up just keep practicing you know take it
from me I'm really not the best eye
shadow at all but I still do it so you
could do it too so I'm gonna do my
entire face now to prime my skin I'm
using my radiance bronze primer by Laura
Mercier I love this primer I'm sure Prai
buy new one I wonder if it's expired I'm
gonna still use it but it's probably
expired cuz I've had it for at least two
years now but I still use it and so here
I'm just fixing my Ike I realized the
wing was shorter on this side then it
was another side so I was just extending
it using that same concealer brush with
a little bit of concealer then I'm
adding the powder on top because I was
bothering me and it was probably
bothering you too so I think
and then after I'm done with this I'm
gonna put my foundation on and this is
one by Becca the the feeling of this
foundation is really great it's super
full coverage if you don't like thick
foundation you probably won't like this
foundation cut it's really really thick
and creamy however I like it this shade
is a little too orange for me but after
I put on my like sealer my powder it
toned it down you know it worked out but
I'm gonna look crazy for like a couple
seconds but that's okay because I fix it
but yeah the shades kind of orange by
notice that some of my foundations even
if they look a little off don't if you
really really like it I would just go
for it and then once you put your
concealer in your contour it just kind
of all comes together I notice that a
lot of videos like sometimes I'll watch
someone's video and the foundation looks
like oh god it's terrible but then once
they do their entire face it like comes
together it looks great so just keep
going for concealer I'm taking this
heart-shaped tape I use two shades not
sure why I thought medium would be too
light so I asked the other shade on top
and I also want to tone down the
foundation to you and so um yeah I just
concealed the place that you just
concealed and highlighted that those
areas areas and then I just blend that
out with my Tarte sponge
so the contour is I take this Kat Von D
concealer it's not a super dark contour
shade but I want it like a bronzy conic
contour shade I also didn't want to be
too harsh causing these powders to
contour on top of this so I decided to
use the lighter concealer shade but I
like what this did it's like a naturally
like bronzy color then I said the place
that concealed like always I'm taking my
Laura Mercier translucent powder I
thought I can't talk I need to sleep I
haven't been sleeping so I'm kind of
tired
that's why I'm kind of stumbling on my
words but now I'm just using my um Laura
Mercier translucent powder to set and I
do one thin layer first and then I do
another thick layer on top of that so
that way whatever shadow I use on my
lower lashline it doesn't mess up my
concealer and so the shadow decide to
use was from the Tarte palette as well
and it's the shade mod which is like the
more orange color and I thought that
would look nice what you did I actually
put a little too much on but that's why
I put the powder there because once I
like brush away the powder the mistakes
that I made you can just wipe it away so
that works and this only shot I used I
didn't want to go too dark because I
didn't think that would like flatter my
eye shape I feel like sometimes I like
put a lot of pressure on myself to like
do the traditional eye look and it is
almost a good on me because my eye
shapes different so do work for you I
sent my Thai face I'm using this makeup
forever mattifying setting spray if you
have oily skin you will love this powder
you guys it's so nice it's so fine it's
amazing and Here I am just fixing my eye
shadow a little bit so I know it's at
the glitter was starting to transfer
onto the eyeshadow I should have like
use them to seal this glitter I almost
forgot I had it lids sorry I'm just kind
of fixing that those bothering me now to
contour I'm going to take hoola benefit
bronzer and it won't show up too much
but the thing is it's really cool tone
so it really does contour its it doesn't
really bronze me and then Here I am just
contour my nose a bit
to add blush I'm going to take plum full
ear and Mac it took everything in me not
to use my fin team Moscow Mule that's
the only blush I've been using you guys
finta beauty like I'm not saying this to
riot Brianna the products are so nice
every side guide that's all I want to
use but then I realized I have to use
other products in my videos or they'll
become repetitive but off camera I'm
using off into beauty soda brand on my
face a little more I'm taking hotel
heiress by Tarte only a little bit
though because I don't want to go too
crazy then a hile I'm taking my Dior
highlight I want to use fin T beauty and
I end up using at the end I used the
kilowatt I'm the hustle baby that
highlights so nice you guys it's so nice
so I use this for now but I end up
putting 50 beads on top a little later
this Holly it's cool too but I'm not
sure if it's worth $54 I don't I have
drugstore highlighters and better than
this one
but anyways for my skin I'm taking my
bad my big bad I think it's called a big
backlash by Mac and I only used this
because since my lids were essentially
white I didn't have to our lashes
because my lids being so light in the
mascara being dark and made my lash look
extra long so I decided to not wear
lashes I thought my lashes look really
nice just with the mascara on its own
and Here I am just placed a little bit
of highlight in my flaps I always have
to do it tell me if you guys tired of it
I'm not please don't say you're tired of
it
but after this I am going line my lips
I'm gonna take plum lip liner by Mac
first and on top of that I'm going to
take the shade of vino fun fact Vina was
the first Mac lip liner I ever got and I
paired it with Ruby woo ooo I was my
favorite combo we was the first MAC
lipstick I ever got to you and so I love
my lips of that and I'd take this NYX
Cosmetics liquid lipstick I don't know
the name but it wasn't my favorite so I
took this Mac liquid lipstick and put on
top and just kind of like blend the two
together I don't know the names cuz my
first time using these I want to use
like a nude lip product in this video
that I have a use before so these are
both new to me but the names will be
done below but here I am just kind of
like mixing together
make them you know look more um breed
out and so um had to clear that
foundation out of my hair of course and
I'm gonna set my face using my morphe
setting spray in like one second oh oh
here's why I add the highlight here I'm
just taking kilowatt hustla baby I said
a little I had to add a little more
because I felt like the dr1 wasn't
popping enough and then take my morphe
setting spray set my face and according
to dupe that this is now in stock again
it's sold out I'd have a code but
totally buy it if it hadn't sold out
already it's like my favorite science
BRE ever and after that I'm gonna put my
hat on and that completes this look I
