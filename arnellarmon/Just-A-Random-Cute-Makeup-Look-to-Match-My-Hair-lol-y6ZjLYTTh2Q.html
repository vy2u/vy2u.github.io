welcome so I just have done story why
didn't just get done but I texted to so
I've been filming this makeup look I'm
kind of Chambal right now it's right in
the middle of getting ready I'm in a
rush but I remember that I didn't like
my intro so yeah different estimates
look I'm out of breath
it was very fun to Duke I haven't really
done done my face in a while so um yes
you like it which I hope you do potato
watch and if you liked the video please
give a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll
see you in excellence alright so first
time I take my Anastasia Beverly Hills
cream contour kit I'm going to use this
banana shade as a primer I don't know
what inspired especially like how it
worked and so then I'm gonna go in with
my loss Pro palette and I'll like list
the shades down below cuz I don't know
them by heart but um yeah it's a pretty
big palette how I can't remember all
these names but I'm pretty much using
this same row and I'm going on like the
lightest color to the darkest color and
I'm just kind of like building a base up
and so you see like each imma grab a
color I just like get darker and darker
colors kinda like built the color I
never start with like one dark color
first and this theme is pretty orange II
honestly I really enjoy do my eyeshadow
looks with orange bases because I mean
it kind of matches my skin tone and it
just I don't know it always looks for me
and so once I made like the darkest
color with me using that's why I really
start to focus it in my outer crease as
you see I'm doing here and I just use
the same dark color and I just keep
blending and blending until it gets to
the point where it's like the darkness
the color can get now I'm going to take
this shade and plant it right here if I
can't explain it is a kind of rosy but
it has some gold in it it's like perfect
I can't explain it but it's a perfect
shade and I take my Mac mixing medium so
that way the shimmer sticks to my lids
without transferring to my crease area
and I'm just going to pack my shade onto
my lids and now I'm going to take this
shimmery like mousse by butter LONDON
and I'm just going to put that on top
where put the shimmer and then put the
shimmer on top of that you pry can't
speed in camera but it pretty much made
it look more
boiled after that I'm gonna put my
lashes on off-camera these lashing her
by my friend Kaitlyn I'll link her
website down below I relive these lashes
I almost lost some other night when I
got drunk anyways going to prime my face
these are my favorite primers ever it's
the laura mercier radiance bronze primer
i hardly used only cuz i want to last as
long as possible but it's like one of my
favorite primers and then foundation i'm
going to take my Anastasia stick
foundations in the shade caramel and
amber I'm learning that Amber's asking
my perfect color now and that I have a
tan and caramel slightly lighter for my
winter shade but I still mix with two
just out of routine because I don't know
it's like mixing them I'm going to blend
it out with my Tarte Blender sponge like
the best sponge ever
and once I'm done bleeding that I mean
for my heart-shaped ape concealer just
under my eyes I didn't really do much
concealer and like usually I put on my
forehead my chin but I guess I decide
not to at this time so oh wait I totally
lied I know what I'm going to do next I
just remembered I feel miss look better
days I almost forgot
I'm gonna take my Anastasia Beverly
Hills cream contour kit again and use
that banana shade just to brighten up
under-eye and then I put this on my chin
of my forehead whoo I hope I plate
something's weird so I always conceal my
tune in my forehead so I thought it was
weird at first but then I remembered I
used this and to contour I'm going to
take this shade right here this kid is
so used I don't know I may use it again
I just I go into my makeup but I found
out I can't have used in a while might
as well use it so yeah I use that to
contour
to set the place I can sit I'm just
going to use my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and when they use my
same Tarte sponge to apply that powder
and I'm not going to bake because I've
already on my show so I don't need to
now to send my entire face I'm using my
black radiance soft focus powder it's
one my favorite products ever you guys
know that even watching my channel for a
while it's like five six dollars and
it's flawless now to bronze my face i'm
using this Tarte bronzer I was really
shocked by how big today was when I
first used as it was shambles it was
totally samples but it works really good
for blush I'm going to use my Bobbi
Brown I think it's pretty coral blush I
just applied that super fast now for
highlight I'm using my new favorite
highlight it's by Dior
I forget the name I think it's like
shade number two because it's on like
two shades I think the other ones called
for I don't know it'll be down below but
it's like my new favorite and I paid a
lot of money for it so I'm going to use
it as much as possible for my lips I'm
going to first line my lips use this NYX
lip liner I'm pretty sure this is the
shade Brown because like the one I
always use and then I'm going to put on
this Mac lip gloss I don't know the name
off top my head they'll be done below
and I love this was bought so much I
might locate it to their glosses at the
moment I don't know why but I love them
now I'm going to put some same highlight
in my little like inner tear-duct areas
or what Alyssa calls when she calls them
like flappy folds or something weird and
yeah I'm going to apply that excite I've
been obsessed with doing this lately
because it makes my eyes just look
brighter and more wide and I don't know
I just think it brings a look all
together I'm gonna blend it out a little
bit so it doesn't look too strong and
I'm a semi face is my friend Joelle new
side sprays um they're really really
pretty and they make you glow and that
pretty much completes the makeup look
I was totally filling myself I felt
great nothing to my hair
honestly like I like the hair color but
I hate how it's all braid it I didn't
even do this on purpose like I don't
know how I messed up but the contrary
really really bothers me actually end up
cutting his hair and fixing operates a
little bit because it was
we bothered me in like my family they
all like my hair and they're gonna
comment so I'm just kind of like I don't
like it ever like what's wrong with it
I'm like you guys wouldn't know because
you guys don't do hair but it was really
annoying me like oh I heard it so much I
went trying to fix it I mean I like the
hair itself and I wanted to review on
this hair soon but yeah and I still
tie-dyed to hair too and I mean for
those who want to see it I'll post a
video but the ombre I was not diggin
that at all after finishing my hair that
pretty much completes the look if you
guys want more make pectorals from me
I'll definitely do this will re kind of
plan to do them because I really miss
doing them and I'm yeah if you enjoyed
this video please give it thumbs up and
be sure to subscribe and I'll see you in
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
