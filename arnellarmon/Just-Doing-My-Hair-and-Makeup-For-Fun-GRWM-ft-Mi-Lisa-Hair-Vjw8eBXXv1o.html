are new welcome today's videos gonna be
a get ready with me I'm gonna get ready
I'm not too much J I'm gonna just get
food missed at it all day and now I'm
going to the museum later with my friend
and I'm through watch it so I had to get
ready
I made this lip today and I showed you
guys how I want curly because in my
previous video I did want curls and you
guys really like them and I axe in the
video if you guys want like a video on
let me doing it I will do it and so I
wouldn't call it a tutorial but it's
super simple so I showed myself well
comb this hair this hairs from me my
Lisa hair I'm Sami Lisa hair but I'm
pretty sure it's my I've worked with
them so many time before I'll link all
the videos down below in which I'm
wearing their hair I work with them all
the time to like their hair and so I
just decided to feature the hair in this
video and show higuaín killed it this
hair was like perfect to on curl this
hair came as a loose wave now loose wave
is like tricky because loosely bundles
I'll show you one lose weight bundles
comes like this and they're really
really really really nice however by the
time you let make the wig and like take
this apart
you lose this curl pattern however
because this is process to be this curl
pattern when you go back and curl it
rather than your kernel with a flat
earner wand the curls are so tight I
would definitely if you wanted like
really nice long curls I would
definitely recommend using like hair
like loose wave or body wave I feel like
I mean you can get wand curls with
straight hair however I noticed that
when I want curl hair that is alright
process to be curly I guess you could
say the one curls last week longer and
they're just more defined because the
hair wants to go in that curly direction
anyways if I'm making sense so basically
four bundles in a frontal I clearly only
used three the bundles sablon bundle
left and I made this wig and I have no
complaints with the hair I did notice a
little bit of tangling I think it's
because of the hair it's so long and so
full that like we run your fingers
through it just a lot to run through and
I also notice that usually when I get
new slave bundles from any company they
tangle more than straight and kirlyam
bodyweight bundles that's just from my
observation from working her hair so
much but other than that that's pretty
much it I
daya blushes hair so I can't say how
takes color however in the past when I
have had that for my lease and I died
and bleached it the color cannot really
move really nice I'm I did a bright
orange if they're here before and so I
know they're here to take color so I'll
say that but other than that I mean
that's all I have to say others has
watched video I might just show myself
do my makeup this is a pretty simple
like this is average make you look a
priority before however um if you want
to see me do I'm making my hair and go
from a 10 to 15 see you watch this video
and give us a thumbs up subscribe all
that good stuff by the way if you ever
wonder why use I say 10 to 15 so that
I'll believe in people going from zeros
to 10 I don't think people are zeros and
I don't like that like mentality of like
going to 0 without makeup and attend
with makeup so I believe people should
feel like a tin without makeup and then
you put on makeup you're 15 I said
explain that kinda want to come off
that's like you're arrogant I just
don't think that people should call them
some zeros I don't know if they're not
saying that literally but that can I do
something to your mental if you say it
enough so just say from 10 to 15 anyway
delicious what's this video and I'll see
you guys later I'm super excited cuz
like I feel good or whatever it's time
talking really fast and really excited
I'm sorry I should calm down I'll just
watch this video and hope you enjoy it
long coat half my hair off camera
because that'll be unnecessary to want
curl the whole entire head on camera
because it's like a very repetitive
thing to do so I'll show you guys you
know me one kind this half of my hair
come do the same thing so I'm you just
wand by Bellamy and I'm using this one
it's like a very skinny wand that's how
you get these super tight and defined
curls and this one it's so skinny I get
so hot that you literally only have to
keep the hair around the wand for like
five seconds literally and you get super
tight curls you guys see like I'm
literally although this video is sped up
I'm only holding the one I mean the hair
around the wand for like 5 to 7 seconds
no longer than that usually with regular
wands
you have to do it for at least 10
seconds to get defined curl because this
one is so small it's defining the curls
super fast and it's awesome so all I'm
doing is I wrap the hair around it and
uh yeah it just it's like the most
simplest thing ever
there's different ways to get different
wand curls based on how you wrap the
hair around it so when I right there
around it I kind of like twist the hair
as I'm wrapping it if you leave the
they're flat on the barrel of the one
you'll get more like a princess type
curl however if you slightly twist the
hair as you wrap it on the wrong curl
you get these kind of curls so it's
tricky I'll do like a detailed wan curl
video sooner or later I just need
someone to help me film it because as he
doesn't see you know when I move too
much with my new camera I get out focus
it's weird so I definitely need someone
helping me film that type of tutorial
because I want to be very detailed and I
want to get cool angles and all that
good stuff but um I'm just uh you know
just want go in the hair I love this
wand a lot I got this one like a few
years back you can like change the
barrel so I have like different
attachments and this like my favorite
one because I mean when you do want
color and more defined these want curls
arcs are still in the wig I filmed this
video yesterday and I wore the wick
today and the wand codes are literally
still there although I've like brushed
my hands through and everything this
hair is also very easy to work with I
love my Lisa hair I've worked with them
so many times before I'm if you've been
subscribed my channel you've heard their
brand before because I work with them at
least like four to five times which is a
lot because I work with so many brands
like it's rare that I work with a brand
over and over again but I work with them
so many times
they're Cara Lee hair is really nice so
um I just Carole doll that and then I am
I want to go finesse the wig off camera
I will shoot guys me putting this oil in
my hair I'm using this kiss argan oil
when I separate curls I use a lot of oil
don't wear it Vince is like disappears
it won't make the hair heavy at all in
fact the hair does not look super oily
at all at this point but um I finished
my baby hair stuff off camera because my
new setup I need to be closer to a
mirror and it would it look are tricky
so it's add to my makeup to prime my
skin I'm using this Mac skin base
I like this primer I haven't used in a
while because I put in my freelance kit
and I went through my old kit and I just
found all these products that I missed I
forgot I put into my kit so I decided to
use that the foundation I'm going to use
the new NARS foundation mix up my 50
beauty I don't mix them for any
particular reason I just don't want to
you to lob the NARS foundation and I
don't want to use a lot of the Finn tea
so I mix them so I'm using less of each
I just used two pumps of each foundation
and it was really really nice I love all
these foundations my
favorite ever this new nomination is
honestly like the same as a shear glows
so I love both equally yeah it's like
the same to me I could be wrong but it
applied to same to my skin
so to consume and take my kevyn aucoin
concealer this is s x08 i use use zero
six but zero six is so freaking light
especially right now um to be honest
though I feel like this concealer I
don't think I blended it out enough I
don't know what I did all I know is that
when I was taking my photos it uh it
looked to like light underneath my eye
it was heavy it wasn't like I like this
color and I could see was your lighter
than this oh my god that frickin train
sorry guys but it looked heavy I can't
explain it
I had to facetune the heck out of my
photo because of it but I finessed it so
to set that I'm used my Laura Mercier
translucent powder um after I checked
myself out a little bit use my powder
maybe that's why I did it maybe I should
use my Patrick's powder I don't know
because my Laura Mercier powder I love I
love my Laura murmur just wear this
concealer it wasn't the best combination
I don't know what that was about
uh yeah shambles
so for my eyes I'm taking my domine
Cosmetics palette the latte pal I just
got this this is my first time using
this in this video I love the packaging
and Krista does such a good job on this
packaging it's so sleek but so still
super cute I love this packaging it was
very well thought out I loved it so I
did why I've camera now I'm doing one
eye on camera so don't mind the lion
difference um pretty much I get
complained so I do my eye is too far off
the camera so I decided to get closer
however when you get closer the light is
more in-your-face and it kind of looks
super overexposed so I just do a lot of
editing to this like the light in this
video so you guys can see the true color
of what I was doing so I mean like I'm
sorry next time I'm gonna have to like
turn down my light my ring light when I
get close to the camera I just I didn't
even put two and two together and so I'm
gonna show you how the shades I'm using
one second I wasn't insert the power to
the screen however I end up finding a
way to show you guys the shadows in one
second early want to show it it looked
way too bright because like I said I was
like 2 inches away from my ring light
but don't worry I'm gonna show y'all
what I used I like this palette the
shadows blended very very easily gave me
a really nice smoked out I when I took
pictures my eyes were extra green
because of the purple shade I use in the
palette so I really like that so here
I'm just showing you guys the colors I
used I figure out a way to do it to
where you can actually see the palette
so um I'm gonna put this orange shade on
first and I'm gonna show you guys each
shadow I can use before that which were
just three basic shadows so look at I
started off with this light shadow right
here then I move to this next shadow and
then I move to this shut over here and
then I added this shadow so I use those
shadows in that order
so after my base I decided to add this
purple shade I really liked it a lot I
noticed that it got more pigmented the
more you like put it on of course
I almost butcher this whole eye look
though you guys are gonna see and so I
make this orange a brown shade to kind
of deepen the crease just a little bit
though but I didn't want the eye look to
be too dark I'm not a fan of super dark
eye looks I'm really not it's not my
thing so I grabbed the wrong brush you
gotta see this like one second I
couldn't believe I did it to myself oh
wait it's not happening yet alright it's
not there we did my brows I decided to
join brows after I did my eye shadow
because it helped me just clean up the
overall I share a look and so I quickly
filled my brows using this precisely my
brow by benefit I use the shades six and
four six towards the ends and four
towards the friend the brow to create
like a easy ombre effect and I like
doing this helps me like you know clean
up my brow and then I add this shimmer
shade on my brow bone to highlight it
and this is where I messed up cuz I
grabbed this brush and I forgot a hat
product on it and I almost ruined my
whole entire I look and I was so
terrified but luckily you know it wiped
off pretty easily oh my god I was in
shambles I was really sad I couldn't
leave I did that cuz I already I'm not
the best eyeshadow so I mess up it's
super discourages me but because his
look was kind of like blown out and not
perfect anyways I worked out it wasn't
terrible and so um yeah that's the eye
look now I'm gonna do the bottom of my
eye look by to kind of back up cuz those
lights are pretty bright but all I did
was you know take the purple and orange
shadow and just use it's like pencil
like brush to put it underneath my eyes
and then I dust off the powdering for my
eyes and you know just cleaned it up a
little bit more I don't wanna put too
much though I just want to put just
enough to complement the top part of my
eye and now I'm gonna set the rest of my
face using my Sephora micro smooth
powder before I get comments analysts
put me on you guys I was using this
years ago I put Alyssa on ok I just
stopped using it ok God Jesus no I'm
joking but I mean I'm being serious at
the same time my friend Jasmine that
worked as a for Ashley put me on this
powder back when I worked as a for when
I was like like 19
or something so to contour because I can
no longer use my Tarte hillarious
contour my favorite bronzer ever I'm
uses one my Urban Decay it's actually a
foundation powder
it's just slightly darker than I am so I
like using to bronze my face and on top
of that I'm gonna use my hoola bronzer
my benefit to just choose on my cheeks a
little more
so for bloosh I'm taking this one by Mac
caught peaches and I definitely
different that I've done before I just
decide to do today I put on my cheeks
and I put on my nose too
I don't know why I think all my nose is
red I look super cute don't even know I
like it on top of that I'm using peach
twist I feel like that blush wasn't like
popping enough so I added this on top
just a little though put a lid on my
nose as well and I was good to go to
highlight I'm using this to your
highlight although I don't like on my
highlight applied on my skin today it
looks kind of like I don't know it
didn't look smooth I can't explain it I
wasn't a fan but that's okay I'm add
more highlight later you guys have seen
so said my face and using my more if he
said he missed and I sent my face and
also sent my closure I always the same
screen my closure
I don't really show the videos though by
put on my closure cuz I put makeup in my
clothes or like concealer and shadow so
gotta set that now for lips I'm just
grab my lip liner and some gloss I am
gonna take this lip liner by NYX it's a
shade brown then I'm going to take this
gloss by Sephora I can't think of the
name off top it is really cute like
Sephora brand like pink gloss that I
would like it looks really nice I like
it a lot and it looks really good with
that eye look I did but now I'll play
another gloss on top because I'm like
indecisive and I love glosses so I add
this one called Leslie by buxom I'll
strangle for it look I didn't know was
going for it but I one more glass so on
top of that I added think to be the
spacesuit gloss and that kind of gave me
more of the effect I was going for
I'm and another class later you see so
hurry I'm trying to figure out which of
these ones are like the newest ones I
love this mascara by Mac it's bad and
bull lash or bold and bad lash I have
like three the milks I was buy them and
I didn't know which one was the newest
once they all look the freakin same but
I'm gonna apply that to my lashes like
my favorite mascara ever like I love it
it's nuts I don't know why I like it so
much but I like it a lot
you
so to some eyebrows I mean just like elf
brow I don't know what to call it ELISA
had it and I really liked it
it turns out I had it already they had
sent to me in PR and I didn't realize
that that's what it was
so I'm like you know curling my curls
not curling brushing my curls a little
bit changed my shirt actually just took
my shirt off and I kind of liked how I
looked so I decided it back on
I'm not do something else what I do next
Oh add more highlight I'm using my lip
each by artist couture
Jackie ina because I want my highlight
to pop a little more I just wasn't
popping the way I want to pop so I had
it something that blew peach on top of
my Dior and it looked really really nice
it gave me the effect I was going for
cuz I just felt like a Dior I didn't
look the best
then I got to put on my hoops these
hoops are by my friend in New York I'll
tag the brand below
I actually super like these are so
comfortable I love them and then I had
another gloss on top because um I want
the lips look different so I added this
like nudie gloss by buxom just on top of
that to kind of like nude out the lip
because I like nudie glosses and after
that I was done now my slo-moes are
super awkward because I don't in order
to look I'm over here I don't know what
I'm doing i'ma show you guys my two
armpit moles cuz I like them they're
