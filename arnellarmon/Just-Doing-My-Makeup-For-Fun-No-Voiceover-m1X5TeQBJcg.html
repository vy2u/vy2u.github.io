you're new welcome so I just got done
filming his makeup look I just want
there and make a systemic board I really
I came out I just Mulder liked it so
much and I like to make videos now I'm
about this hair this is a reviewing
thing my channel I talk about it because
I'm pretty sure you guys will add I got
two pair like last year December and our
interview up for it I'll look either a
link to thing up here and link it down
below I don't have it on how I died to
tear however I just bleached it from
what I recall I do have a video on how I
dyed hair similar just to this color and
almost in the exact same solvent that
down below if you want a hair color
similar this color no puddles in filming
I'll try this one with my cat wearing
room but yeah I just wanted like you
know I want to start wearing more of the
width I reviewed a while ago because I
want you to think I was more than my to
stop wearing them actually where a lot
of the wigs I review like off camera I
shall always post pictures or what and
she gives them to me shut up look so and
I give some I look too unless you guys
but you so annoying anyways I don't want
to think that his review here it's going
away like no I really do like have some
of my favorites at a cop see where I
remember I first made dislike I
automatically knew I really realized if
I could tell the hair quality was great
like it's super the hair is really thick
I don't know if you even tell the
difference by case I worked a lot of
hair I just didn't like the way I made
and I actually spent like an hour to
half of my revamp in it I pretty much
reboot the tracks back here because the
way I angled them I just wasn't that
great at making my wigs back in December
and I had a sign part and he wasn't
working so I made a middle part I'm
going to add some black eyeshadow to
karke in the roots a little bit because
I saw it the original tooth life and I
meet this way like brand new
so I'm yeah I just stay tuned for more
videos like this where I wear some older
wigs kind of update you guys on them you
know how I feel about them I always like
this look and that's not going to change
this one best ways mess please link
that's what I call it it'll be linked
down below and I like their hair in
general have another wig by then I'm
going to wear again soon so I'm the
allergy of West tutorial if you enjoyed
