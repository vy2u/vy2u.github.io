welcome I'm sorry I feel a little full
not feel if I look a little stuffy the
Sun being six I don't even mind that but
I just look video on how I lay why make
this 360 lace-front awake oh my god I
sound weird out of hair from China hair
mall and pretty much they send me at 360
front to land two bundles now this intro
is going to be tomorrow I'm gonna give
it really really quick review it's very
simple um their hair is nice is it like
the absolute best hair quality ever had
I wouldn't say that but I only feel like
the hair feels like nah my favorite is
because I send me two bundles I think if
his hair if I had three bundles it'd be
perfect but with two bundles it feels a
little thin of course or feels thin
that's gonna affect my opinion on the
hair but I think the hair take yourself
is nice I just really wish they would've
sent two bundles you know what I mean
cuz like I'm not two bundles three
bundles because I'm used to having three
bundles so just to it looks more natural
because it's like thinner and more flat
I guess you could say so that's like
kind of like imitates my natural hair
texture more but I'm just used to
bundles but what I will say about this
hair in general is that they've had my
favorite 360 front told thus far I've
tried maybe two or three and so far this
is the best one I've tried and that is
mainly because of the size now most of
their 60 frontals I've tried will all
them besides this one they're all way
too big now I'm not sure like how big
they think people's heads are I really
don't know but they're all so big to the
point where even when I sold a middle we
got it it was so big that I had to cut a
little section on it if you watch these
videos you know I I mentioned this a
dependable section every so it in order
to pro tip in my head whereas this line
it I had to kinda at also want to
customize little Mark's and I ready to
put up the bun just yet but what I
customized a little more um at least
I'll be able to put up in a ponytail
whereas the other 360 front knows I've
tried because I had to cut in to them to
make them fit my head even with the
adjustable straps I can't wear a
ponytail because I mean it's cut it just
it doesn't work that way so I will say
that I had a very good experience with
their 360 frontals they actually are
normal sizes that you know it's very
easy to work with it kind of sucks when
you order
front on it's too big because if you're
not even good at doing hair you're not
used to making wigs it's a real
challenge I even have challenges with it
so if you're going to order this with a
frontal I would definitely definitely
recommend order from them because at
least I know for a fact that they
actually have accurate head sizes if
you're going to buy this hair I also
recommend buying three bundles because
their bundles aren't super thick and not
many companies are but I mean I'm just
not realizing this because not this
little first coming that only send me
two bundles instead of three but what a
360 lace frontal you only need two
bundles but if you want your hair to be
full and nice get three bundles just do
it but um that's people taught to say I
had no product in this wig like I said a
360 frontal was a breeze the bundles
themselves were nice the tracks very
easy to work with I mean I really the
only been able to say is that I want to
get two bundles and need three to give
the fullness and I'm used to but um
Alice had last video I showed you guys
how I lay this down using the where is
it
I'll turn the got to be glue I finally
realize I was doing wrong and I'll talk
about the video but I finally I find
know how to use this and make it like
work you know what I mean I'm not going
to pull too hard but I probably know how
to use to correct weight and show you
guys how to make the front to look more
now and everything so if you guys enjoy
this video please make sure to give it a
thumbs up at the end and please
subscribe while you're here right now
and I'll see you in my next one
so here's my hair in its natural state I
have no product in my hair at all now
typically I will gel my hair back for
this process but I kind of want to stop
doing that I kind of just want to start
braiding it I'm just waiting for it to
get a little longer
totally happens fast because I want my
hair to be thicker so I want stop any
oils and all that our stuffing in you
can't do that when it's deal down so
first I'm going to take my Black Raven
soft focus powder in this brush and I'm
going to put powder on the inside of the
wig where the frontal is now this is a
360 front oh by the way and I first I
put powder on the stocking cap to bring
obviously later guy end up changing this
because I just felt like the powder on
the lace was good enough to tint the
closure I didn't need to do this step at
all so just skip this unless you don't
want to put the powder on a lace then
you could do this but you don't need to
do both because ends up being too dark
see right here and my scalp isn't that
dark so I end up changing it by the way
I did customize the 360 frontal and like
it looks so good well to me I'm getting
better at customizing it it's like I'm
getting better I'm just I'm having more
time because for the longest I wasn't
customizing the front tolls not exciting
I want to and I'm excited to know how to
but I get sent so much hair and after
the reviews so fast I don't have time to
customize each and every frontal that I
get and so with this one I was just like
you know I'm just gonna take time and it
something about 30 minutes to really
pluck the front tool and make it look as
natural as possible so that's why when I
part it it looks like scalp and it just
it's really good so here's why I decide
to just move my stun cap to the back
where there was no powder because I just
feel like I looked a little too dark and
it just didn't look natural looking and
now looks much better in my opinion but
yeah now that I realized that it only
takes about 30 minutes to customize a
frontal and I guess like that's not too
bad
I plan on customizing all of the front
tools that I have and I plan on making
all the wigs that I have to make them
more neater because I just feel like you
know with my review because I'm always
trying to just get them done I brush the
wigs that I make and yeah it's a lot
that goes into it but this looks really
good
Oh
what if you like she reader might feel
me way to me you recording that well I'm
filming if I didn't respond to you in
what did you guys doing over here no but
like oh my boyfriend her to come over to
me and just give me a kiss he's always
like showing random acts of love I don't
know he's weird but he burned I have a
ring light on the back of my chair to
give it more brightness and he didn't
know and he touched him burned his
finger baby ways that's the more
important stuff I am just laying my baby
hairs doesn't look more natural like am
I not getting better at this like like
I'm feeling much better
well I'm just taking more time I just I
know next year I want my wigs be like I
want them to be crazy I want them to be
perfect okay like I need to come into
the New Year looking like oh my god her
hair grew so fast see this looks good oh
my god oh yeah and I bleached the nuts
on this frontal as well you have to do
that and I'm getting better at that too
it's really it's really a technique when
it comes to that like man it's not as
easy as it looks need to have a lot of
patience but right now I'm just showing
off and showing you guys just how
natural looks and so at first I just
like curled the front I didn't know what
to do with this was uh let me just glue
it down with it got to be gel and I
finally learned how to do that better
too because I've been using the gel and
I've been doing it completely wrong I've
been putting the gel on and I've been
blow-drying it to dry it with warm and
hot on my blow dryer settings but you're
not supposed to do that you're supposed
to blow dry it on cold and yeah just my
whole life has changed okay
all right so I'm going to take the wig
off and I'm going to push those time cap
a little back to place the first layer
of gel and so I'm going to like two
layers gel I think um I just know that I
feel like this is like safe for the hair
you know when you put one layer and then
dry to mold onto that I flick more hair
it's it's like a risk to pull out more
of your hair which by the way like I
feel like yes I have pulled out some of
my hair using this method but it is my
fault
you have to be really patient when
you're moving it and you have to let it
soak in warm water it's really like not
terrible um but I know I used to pull a
lot of my hair using the was that stuff
called the lace tape I would not
recommend that to pull so much of my
hair but yeah I'm just put on layers I'm
using the cool setting on my blow dryer
and then I put the wig on to figure out
where I want to lay it now I'm gonna put
the lace on where I put the gel and it
was kind of sticky but I decide I want
to put a little more to make sure it's
really really on there cuz I feel like
it wasn't enough
so I'm doesn't mind that and by the way
I sounded stuffy and that's like really
really sick like I don't know how this
happened why it has to happen right now
I know last year around New Year's time
I was literally sick literally like I
didn't do anything for New Year's I
stayed in bed and I slipped because I
was so sick I to fever or something
it is terrible so hashtag pray for now
then I get better by New Year's I can
actually do something of my life but
here I am just you know putting the gel
on and then just blow drying it to make
it stay very simple
you
you
by the way you're supposed to do this in
sections like I did the front section
first then I do the other side um and I
just do it in sections okay it just
makes it easier even though I really do
not like doing the sides something about
the science is very annoying I think
it's because it's a 360 least frontal I
feel like welllet's frontal Italy easier
but yeah I just I was like yeah let me
finish this but I was really like shook
at how like I've been doing it wrong the
whole time and now kind of makes sense
you know I feel like if you put the heat
on the gel it'll warm it up and make it
even more liquidy so now it all makes
sense but I would just mad that this
whole time I almost gave up on this gel
and I've it I just been doing it on the
whole time
you
and so I thought this is okay but I
thought I needed like a little more baby
hair so I take a little section where
I'm going to I'm going to get this
eyebrow razor and I'm just gonna thin it
out and kind of like make baby hairs
just to make you look more natural in
the hairline I'm a I'm getting better
but I'm still not perfect at this don't
worry because the better I get the more
I'll show you guys why do but I mean I'm
such a long process like learn how to do
wigs like I'd even when I first started
I wasn't smart up to watch a lot of you
to tutorials so I really know I was
doing but yeah just watch these
tutorials and you'll eventually learn
it's not too hard so yeah I'm just
making baby here to make this look more
natural I think I did a pretty cool job
so I was almost done but I'm
perfectionist and I just felt like this
part
it just wasn't long enough length along
the part the more it looks but with
frontals you can't always part all the
way back because then you can see the
lace so what I do is I part and I make
it curve that way it makes the part
longer and it makes it look even more
natural there's something I love doing
because it just looks really good then
I'm gonna add a little bit the
foundation powder onto the part so you
can't see the stopping cab through the
lace and I just like it made it look
much better
after that I just go I just like do
little more fixes I'm just trying to
make it look as much as possible now
when I do get better at this I will make
more videos on customizing these faces
to frontals but if you're beginner I
using these I would totally recommend
buying it from this company and of
course when I find more companies that
sell you know 360 frontals that are more
accurate and sizing I'll let you guys
know but it's the first one that I've
had that was actually easy to work with
all the lumps I had the only reason why
I was able to work with them is because
like I just have a natural knack for
hair but if you're new like it probably
so hard to figure that out because
they're just way too big so um I hope
you guys enjoy this video and if I'm
getting better at this please give a
thumbs up and please subscribe and I'll
see you my next one hopefully I'm
feeling better and I hope you guys have
a nice day or night or whenever you're
