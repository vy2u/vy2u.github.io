got done but a quick video on me styling
this wig that I made of hair from long
hair now they sit me and I have a bundle
because I only use two bundles and
frontal they sent me three 12-inch
bundles I purposely Axford him to send
me short bundles because I wanted a
short wig like honestly I need scissors
until I get them I kind of suck at
cutting hair and so it's like why I keep
cutting long hair when you can just
request shorter bundles so that's what I
did and I'd really cut this here you go
see I cut a little bit but that's cuz
the hair was a little bit stringy at the
ends about go over down the video and
I'll give my little review during the
video but uhm yeah quick simple style I
really love this look so natural it
looks really really good like the more
you can see it it's like short hair it
gets more body you know what I mean like
I just really like it and I mean hope
you guys like it to you and that's about
it
I'm hope you guys enjoy this video if
you do please give a thumbs up if you
don't I'm sorry oh and I gotta take a
her but I can't talk I have a new tattoo
I'm just gonna address announcer I know
that in the video you'll see it on the
comments I would run so when the Kitty's
doing my kids on my bed and they're just
kinda crazy this says a word half or
Fanny in it but it's not really like
okay
it has the f-word in it but it's like uh
Neth word winnable and it's a song by
Kid Cudi it means it's a phrase that's
been around for a while the sonic hit
Cuddy it's my favorite song the whole
wide world
literally I'm list to it as it came out
at least once a day I was just too AM or
at least five times a day when I say at
least five times a day on the set song
it's only something to feel empowered
whenever I'm sad or like down everyone's
like a hard time and you want us to turn
songs those certain songs make you like
think about other hard times well this
is the only song list to be like I was
too when like my pet died or when I was
going through a breakup set it's almost
on my list - that doesn't give me any
bad memories but makes me feel good each
and every single time so yesterday is
how emotional Loki it also kind of
reckless I'll spend a lot of money on
stuff I really didn't need I need it now
cuz I mean I got out if I return it so I
got this and I mean I like it okay
it's I will never get it ever in my life
because it's how I feel all the time so
yeah I'm
let's get to the video please enjoy it
see my next one alright so first thing
I'm going to do is take my gorillas
snipe gel and I don't want you to gel my
hair back now on a previous video of
mine someone comment like a whole essay
and I hate them I hate those I'm a
cosmetologist is how you do it kind of
comments and I get those a lot and I
delete them because they're knowing but
I said this is the wrong way to do it
however is the right it's the right way
for me because my hair is shortened it's
very hard to braid my hair this length
so I learned this work the best for me
when I just gel the front and put a
Stein cap on it's very easy very quick
and it just it's right way for me so I
think that when you're doing your whole
wig process do what's right for you okay
don't think that there's like a certain
way to do everything I didn't they like
different things work for different
people so yeah you guys stop this cut a
carpet cuz I don't like them anyways I'm
gonna put my wig on now I usually why
used to cut the lace from the front or
closure off of my head I haven't seen
videos and I noticed that a lot of times
people cut the lace Walt steel on their
head and so I kind of put two together
and I realized that when you cut the
lace walks off your head you make too
much and you may like screw them over
metal whole wig so I learned to just put
on my head first and then I cut a
section of it whilst on my head and then
I take it off and cut the rest off that
it's like I just don't trust scissors
around my hairline I'm not a pro at that
yet but I learned easiest when I just
cut a little section to get myself a
guideline as to where I should cut the
least like I'm doing right now and so
yeah I cut the whole section I'm going
to take the wig off cut the rest off
camera and then I'll be back
all right so I cut the lace off and I'm
putting the wig back on and so I really
tried my hardest to make it to where I
know my room has left out maybe it's
just my hairline like I don't know
because it's like every time I try to do
it it just never enough like it's just
never enough and I have to like take a
little bit of my baby hairs out so you
guys see me do that right now I hate
doing this guy really I'm trying to find
a way to not have any of my hair out I
mean as long as no heat on my hair I
guess it's fine so I mean I won't
complain too much so now I'm game I got
to be glue gel we're back and these like
to lay down this wig now this thing is
laid but we're gonna test the strength
of it tonight because I'm going to the
gym for the first time in like forever
and I mean I'm probably gonna sweat if I
really do workout and so we're going to
see if this like totally holds or if
it's a flop and I'll leave a comment in
the video down below you know what's
about the gym of course and I'll tell
you guys what happened so we're gonna
see but yeah I put the glue Nathalie
they gel just around the hairline area
and then I get a blow dryer and I put it
on like high heat just to speed the
process up cuz I'm a patient and oh my
god does that count as heat on my edges
oh okay well yeah too late now so just
dry that until it gets a little tacky
and then I'm going to move the wig and
I'm gonna put it directly where I put
the Gillette
alright so now I'm assure you guys it
ends okay so wait pause
totally oh my god I strained the half
camera okay so now I'm sure guys and yes
see how gets their dant almost like pack
hair like there's no body in the hair we
straighten it and this could be because
I use two bundles so let's throw that in
there too that's a possibility but um
yeah I was like whoa what am I gonna do
so I got a scissors and I just chopped
off the string ins I didn't want to take
off too much lint because I thought this
month it's really perfect very
natural-looking but very like okay her
hair is kind of nice her hair
quote-unquote but um I'm just cutting
off those drink ins cuz that does not
look good
oh my god my kitties like jumping in my
door hold on guys
alright so I did that and I'm just kind
of like fixing my edge a little bit
because I just feel like they're a
little too long now you guys there's a
hole like ten minute section be messy
with my edges but I cut it out because
I'm sure you guys are tired acts I do it
every single video I just I'm not good
at making like edges all my wigs
I have not mashed that yet oh my god I
had to find a video but it seems like
the edges look better on everyone else
but me cuz I follow all the rules I
follow the tricks I tried doing
techniques and still they just look
weird or maybe I don't know man I'm just
tripping you guys let me know but yeah
we're just gonna roll with these okay I
guess
alright so the hair the friend was also
a little string you get see what I mean
this is total exome Milky Way
this is not like Milky Way hair you guys
like the thing is it doesn't feel like
pack hair though and I really don't
think it is I just think that I just
don't know I don't know what I did
maybe okay okay I have I have an idea
because when I plucked the front toe a
little bit before I filmed this and I
just film that prostitute is a little
too long and it didn't come out how I
wanted to come out and I put in this
leave-in conditioner so that could be
wide stiff but that is an explained wat
why the ends are a little thin so I
guess we'll never know by mist kind of
ends off I'm not cutting it too short
I'm just trying to just get rid of that
stringiness like that takes away from
the body of the hair so at this point
I'm just like oh my god it looks ugly
look string out like a freaking emo kid
right like look at my bangs right but
yeah I don't know I'm just like okay
what am I gonna do so when almost fails
and this is a great tip if you ever
experience hair that's just not working
for you or if it's like thinner no you
want to be or it doesn't having a body
you just curl it with a flatter now this
flatter is from Remington I don't know
that name um I took for Melissa but
everyone keeps asking me and I really
don't know like you type in Remington
and maybe look for the purple Flatiron I
don't know the actual name of it
lightweight axe diamond go look and see
if it has name one second
it doesn't have a name it just I was
dreaming tonight I looked all over the
little platter and so named so I'm sorry
guys but I'm pretty sure to go to her
site you just look for one that looks
like this and I'm pretty sure it's that
but here I am just curling the hair
actually I kind of like doing this cuz
they reminded me of when I actually had
hair this length well my natural hair I
let it grow yeah it'll about this length
and I used always coat like this yeah oh
my god memories so hopefully hopefully
my hair just long by like this time next
year we're gonna see but yeah I'm just
gonna curly I'm gonna speed up this
process cuz honestly it's like it's
really simple but yeah I'm going to
smooth the process and I'll be back once
I'm done killing the whole entire thing
you
all right so this is pretty much it when
it's done now after you curl your hair
if you want to just like curl few more
piece just give a little our body can go
ahead and do that but this looks so cute
like does it not look so much better
than looked when it saw strange stringy
now this is a wig that I'll actually
wear because it looks so natural like I
can't believe it's not mine you know
like it looks great it looks totally
great and yeah I'm just so happy I was
able to do something to it because
honestly like after straightening I was
like you know like what the heck am I
gonna do with this but this is perfect
this is toy perk for me like I freaking
love it
and if you do - please give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this video give
