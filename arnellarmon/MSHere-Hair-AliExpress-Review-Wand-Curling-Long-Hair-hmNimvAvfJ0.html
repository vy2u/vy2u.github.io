welcome if you're new I just got done
filming this little tutorial I guess you
could say or just me want comb this hair
because usually when I review hair which
this is a review I don't really like
just talking about the hair that's in
thing that's boring so I'm trying to
like find fun ways to review the hair
and like show myself doing the hairstyle
in it you know what I mean
so this hairs from Miss hair virgin hair
and I have a lace closure not a frontal
lace closure which is why I did a middle
part and the lace closure is 22 inches
and I have five bundles of 22 22 24 24
and 26 inches of body weight no this is
a body wave what is it oh this is water
wave see a new hose off I got sent at a
to review so during a video I'm gonna do
a most my review I just wanna like it go
over a few little things just negated
video in case you guys really want know
about the hair um do I like it yes I do
however I do not I'm a big fan of lace
closure only because I feel like it's a
different texture from the bundles it's
wrong coat it looks beautiful and you
can't even tell that's a different
texture however in its natural state
which you guys have seen a video I
noticed that the lace closure was a
different texture than the bundles and I
noticed that a lot of companies are like
that and so I guess is not a huge
disappointment I calm expected at this
point so I noticed that the lace
closures frontals whatever lace it is
it's always either um it's always more
dryer than actual bundles I've really
noticed that I don't know that's about I
really don't but I am NOT a huge fan of
it I'm just I've gotten used to it so I
want to point that out um as far as
tangling and shingles I feel like the
only thing that I had was with lace
closure I think that because the texture
of Islam were dry on the bundles and
shedding I dig it's shedding I'm getting
shedding from the ends I feel like
whenever I run my fingers to it I get a
few pieces uh and that's the ends are
pretty dry so I'm probably gonna cut
this because I like the hair it feels
really soft enough like I could do a lot
with it but um with it with it God but
um yeah that the Shea at the ends I can
I can't be out like oh yeah run it
through here and so I okay you know I
don't want hill hair my fingers you know
I mean and I almost got shedding from
the closure now I don't put this on the
hair company because it's partially my
fault - well this is why I'm assuming
because when I made the wig I noticed
that I was cutting the wefts um I was
cutting the West I was cutting a little
bit of the hair - like a does cutting
the bundles you know how bundles come
and they're wrapped up in the little
string the roadman I cut that completely
wrong
I cut it like going upwards I did notice
I was cutting some of the hair so that
could be where the shades coming from I
won't know for like a fact until I die
they are I do more stuff who deceive
haze does shedding because I my diet and
I wash it all the hair that actually cut
should have washed out and so we're
gonna find out but I haven't gonna
shedding and I think it's parsing my
fault I'm just gonna I think it's
pressing my fault so we'll see but we
kind of dyeing and washing all that
stuff I want you guys to help me pick
out what color I should do this hair
because I don't know like I want to do
something cool My Mind's on burnt orange
because I really want to that color I
just um
I've loved hair so I don't know which
hair texture which where am I do it on
also this is the lace closure and if I
do burnt orange I'm gonna want to do
style look little buns stuff like that
so I may do on a frontal so if you guys
yeah I'm gonna do Burton order another
hair you guys have any other suggestions
for this hair like what color should do
name anything besides blue gray silver
and lavender and purple because I have
plans for those colors Oh an orange so
if you have any other colors please let
me know cuz I don't know but I know how
I do something cool and I wanna do
something you guys were actually to see
so come below what color you think I
should read his hair and I mean I guess
whatever gets the most comments or likes
is what I'll do
so yeah and I'm talking I don't want
it's gonna be super long just want to
get quick blue review I'll talk a little
more about the hair during the video and
if you have any other question about the
hair comment down below and let me know
and I'll see you guys my next one if you
guys like this video give a thumbs up if
you don't at least tell me what I could
do differently I mean I really don't
understand the purpose of disliking it's
like a Peggy if you don't like it
at the same time it's like if you don't
tell me what you don't like I'm gonna
keep doing it and you're gonna always
dislike it I mean do you want to always
just like my videos I guess so I mean
sighs with five minutes so I'll I'll go
now and I'll let you enjoy this video
well this is a natural texture of the
hair now look at the closure you see
it's kind of loose waves the waves
aren't that defined it looks kind of dry
now I'm going to stand I'm going to show
you guys the actual bundles and you can
see the difference in texture and this
was referring to the begin of the video
and this is something I noticed with a
lot of companies the closure or frontal
is usually different than the actual
bundles themselves I noticed that it's
very very common not sure why I'm not a
huge fan of it but hey it is what it is
so just want to show you guys that now
I'm going to be doing wand curls so I'm
going to section the hair in two pieces
I'm going to braid one side and work
another side when I ever whenever I do
in class now just like sectioning the
pieces so it's easier to do
and so here I am just showing a little
bit more of the texture I really do like
this texture a lot I'm going to see if
it goes back this texture once I wet it
I'm very care to see that of course I'll
let you guys know that I'm gonna have to
wet it once I dye it so I guess we'll
see if it goes back to a texture I mean
I hope so it's a really pretty texture
but you never know so I almost want
curled the hair with this wand however I
end up switching it because once I did
this first wand actually did a whole
little section I realized that they were
looking too similar to the neck the
natural curl pattern and it's okay if
I'm going to spend like an hour and a
half wan curling my hair I need to see a
dramatic difference so you can see the
first curl it just looked way too
similar to me now I know it's not the
exact same but I knew that if I were to
brush it out it would be very similar to
the natural curl pattern and I was like
nope not boys my timeline that so I end
up getting a smaller one and one that
cascaded you guys dude I mean it kind of
looks looks very similar to the natural
curl pattern so yeah I switched ones
the a switch wands are taking this
smaller one from Bellamy I really the
first small wants over big ones small
ones they create more defined curls and
I feel like with big ones like you can
get big waves however if you one curl
your hair with a small one if you want
those big waves you can just brush the
wand curls out so kind of gives you
option
so as you can see I was very happy with
that curl that I got and I thought I
mean if I did the whole head it would
look really pretty which I mean it
looking really nice so I just end up
curling the rest of my hair now this
part can be sped up pretty fast I don't
mind that and if you want a more
detailed want comb tutorial I have one
up and I'll link it down below so check
that out also I have a lot of other
videos and I always get questions that
regard the videos already have but maybe
you guys don't know that I have them
like questions on what line I use what
camera I use I have a whole video
dedicated to start a YouTube channel so
I'll link that below - I have a lot of
videos you just have to go to my channel
to really see because I have more videos
and you know I have vetoes on how to
make a wig just just look in you'll be
happy because most likely I have the
video you're thinking of and if I don't
it's coming
so I did most of the head off-camera - I
felt like I mean it was just getting
very repetitive however I included me
doing the front section of my hair
because I feel like um it's easy to do
also you guys can see that the closure
is a little dry as you can see it kind
of like took me some time to untangle it
because it's just a little dry and I'm
not sure why that is
but hopefully when I die and I did you
dish it and I you know do what I do it
improves it because I mean I like the
wig overall I like the Lind of the hair
I like everything about it I just I'm
not digging the closure
you
by the way I'm sorry look so mad when
I'm doing these videos I'm not mad I'm
just really focused a lot of times I
don't even notice I look bad until I'm
editing oh my Wow I look really mad I'm
not mad I'm just I'm focused okay I'm
trying to get this done
so in this part this one I discovered
the shedding because a let's do my hair
I didn't realize it was all falling on
my sweats now that looks like a lot it
is kind of a lot but also it makes it
look a lot when you bunch it all
together I just have on light pink sweat
so I could really see all the hair and
it was shedding a lot from the ends and
the closure what I notice so I was like
okay let me put some oil on this hair
just to you know make it to it's not so
dry oh and by the way my hair's not dyed
my hair it reflects is blue-black
because of my lights I'm not sure why it
does that and everyone was listen to a
diet use but this hair isn't diet at all
literally I literally just check out the
packs and I am made this wig so there
you have it it's not die it's my lights
so I tried to fix my edges a little bit
bunny and there's nothing on the
toothbrush I had no products I really
don't know what I was thinking I just
want to make it look better I thought I
could I made the clothes a little better
and I guess I'll do that when I died
I'll show you guys that I'm worthy and
doesn't always look bad but I'm you look
decent I just know I could do better
yeah this pretty much end of the video
you guys I'm just showing you guys the
hair I'm kind of playing around with
dicks I thought it looked really pretty
I've done these kind of want curls
before I was on short hair I really like
how long hair because it just looks so
big and I can't wait to pick these curls
out I'll project pictures within you
never see them I Instagram if I decide
to post them because I feel like once I
pick these out it's gonna look so cool
oh yeah if you guys like this video
please give it a thumbs up and be sure
to suggest what color you want to see me
die this hair because I will be paying
attention and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
