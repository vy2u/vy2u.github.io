this cool right now my bed let's talk
about this thing really fast all right
um I move this remote put the remote
right here so I got this bed frame from
Amazon but that's what camera angles but
you know put this in action
alright so I'm go saying I'm gonna put
so short right now that's to my cameras
England on me and there's his best
friend from Amazon like $70 plus I have
like a canopy that's a small so they
have a canopy thingy but I those panels
aren't there so it's totally like not
going to work and then I got my
bedspread from Walmart I can't say
warmer out think of that song if you
know that song YouTube I think is a
mister ghetto Walmart anyways
got this best spread from Walmart it's
really beautiful to eat eel it's awesome
of course and I got my pills from
Walmart and I'm yeah about my mattress
which is super duper duper duper come be
cute the sponsorship I can't be a
youtuber without let's watch it it just
does not work that way so let's zoom in
on my face this is wanting to care man
see
camera zoom then add acid zoom 9 I do it
myself
alright okay Michael's not cool
so this match is from wool that pythons
familiar my sister has her match from
there too and that's why discovered them
when I helped her film her morning
routine like over a year ago I was super
tired and Dave she was so annoying amuse
hilarious that's nice and so I laid in
her bed and my food is super comfortable
Sheila's yeah too low you know a couple
of the boys I love why I changed my
voice and imitate her but we had the
same voice baby way she's like school so
when I moved to that part man decided
okay Lee you need the bedroom asleep and
I thought you should reach out to mold
because I match they're super fired and
so I emailed them and I really loved
your matches I've ever tried before you
know my sister has one like you know
let's do the YouTube thing you know
sponsorship extreme la blah and I mean
Here I am so I'm gonna search a
never-before-seen video of when I first
got to LA matches
don't mind the best in the background it
was when we first moved his apartment so
it was kind of in shambles but imma show
you guys how the metrics come to how
convenient it is it comes in a box
you'll see in the video not me back to
my opinion on the mattress alright so
the mattress comes in a box it comes
rolled up in this like plastic and then
once you put it on the bed you cut the
plastic off and the bed pretty much
expands right in front of your eyes oh
my god almost reminds me of those little
dinosaurs that used to like be so at the
dog store and you put in water and you
put in the bath and I'm off topic
anyways it's pretty cool and like super
convenient so I had Jabari kind of do
all the work I mean I helped some parts
you know but I when we went to the
apartment he was kind of in charge of
all the heavy stuff you know I wasn't
but to do all that I helped him you know
I do what I can do but then I had to you
know I had to be on my job at you know
film this whole entire process I look a
mess sorry don't mind that but that this
mattress is focus on that this mattress
I'm not gonna go around the specs on
their website because I feel like the
sound to sponsor however I'll go over
one spec that I did notice I have to
read this that I i noticed that okay
like this is legit and that's their
temperature this mattress has like a
memory foam top
that's injected with Jill polymer
specifically designed to transfer heat
away from your body and when I read that
online I was okay that totally makes
sense because in my previous match so I
always get too hot just when you're
sleep you know you can just get too hot
this never happened to that mattress so
when I was reading over the specs you
know to be prepared for my video whatnot
I was like hey like that's totally true
because I noticed that when I sleep in
this mattress great thing I have to
mention is that Lowell is so confident
that you'll love this mattress that they
give you a risk-free trial meaning after
you give this mattress you can try it
risk-free for a hundred nights which is
like three months some change and
forever reason if you don't like it you
can return it free free shipping and all
that good stuff so I think it's great
a mattress is a big investment and that
I match to something you keep for like
years my mom she just changed her
mattress out and she had her match since
we were living in my old house well we
were like kids so a match sum that you
keep for years you want to really like
make a good investment and I mean you
have to drop someone if you want a good
match that's gonna last you a long time
I think Lowell is totally worth every
single cent and I mean it's just
something you have to test out you got
to see that I'll have this match to me
when I move on to my next apartment
I will happen with me where I'm moving
to my apartment after that and so you'll
see the quality of this mattress over
time if you continue to follow my
channel but here are more of my thoughts
on this mattress alright so now you guys
have seen the third of you hear me talk
a little bit more about the mattress my
father loves this I knew I liked the
mattress before I even email all I mean
like I said my sister had a night later
her bed so I knew I was gonna like it
regardless I liked it before I got it
it's super comfortable I sleep very very
well I had those kind of sleeps where I
ever sleep so good that you've heard you
forget that you fell asleep and you wake
up like when I fall asleep I'd get those
kind of sleeps in this bed and the older
two I notice that it's my last mattress
mom's living at home was like from
Walmart now doesn't want more I love you
longer spoke to me but it was like I was
like 200 off something super cheapness
and super easy it's like excellent 169
and it was super uncomfortable I never
slept
how they never slept it just wasn't
comfortable is too hot it was just it
wasn't the right mattress I'm super
happy that I experienced like them not
so great mattress cousin I can tell the
difference between that good okay
matches you and a really really quality
one and so I would totally recommend all
all the details and everything way down
their Skoosh box you know and I'm that's
my thought
so let's move on to the rest of my
apartment alright guys so we're now in
my living room my favorite part of my
apartment because it's so bright its up
cute you don't see more on this camera
my camera I'm not gonna get the whole
entire room that's why I have this
personal buddy right here so let's start
already let's get some angles okay no
it's living-room time okay so let's
first off with this clock that I don't
use I don't see why don't I clocks
anymore we have iPhones anyways as I
came and talked and then how am I then I
have or by the way you guys these
remotes are connected to like next-door
neighbor whenever they they're fixing it
though and it's annoyed because watch
this like we let play light tag we're
like oh I want the light on and they
want to off they'll turn off on their in
and if I want this fan off like you guys
see the fan just kind of turned on I in
turn on they'll turn it back on and it's
it's annoying cities anyway um having a
lack shelf here there's not much on it
because it's kind of just like there I
don't know if it's on it by how my
Febreze cuz I'm puppy and I gotta keep
this place selling good have my workout
stuff to apply that a workout when I
actually do not know still there at all
use one me then have my fabrics my
backdrops and they have them color
coordinating so I think looks really
pretty but they're kind of messy I said
I'm not going to fix it because it just
it is not that deep and then I have my
light moving they have some flowers that
are slowly dying but I love dying
flowers I appreciate that flower that I
still think they're beautiful so I never
do without those flowers over there
they're like I got them in June so um
yeah there are a few months old by still
be really pretty
then I have my wax burner I burn
waxes old like every small day pretty
much because they just smell really good
and they're safer than candles totally
recommend them have my sunflower and
really addictive sunflowers I have my
arm and on my back as well then I have
my little eating area a couch with my
keep pillows see how the theme of like
teal turquoise and like peach I find
those probably disappear then have my
little table he was my those bathrooms
at my table some books you'll need some
candles here some miles a little share
his toys it's it's like I'm so so
annoyed because I try to keep them all
clean I try to keep them like together
but whenever he starts playing they
somehow end up all over the house I
don't know how he does it
then I have this little sign when I sign
it else guess it's brilliant got some
pictures that color you know another
side yeah had little storage bins
exploding gram stuff and they're like a
petition when them to pick up Milo's
poop because like I said keep trying it
that is cool TV the whole thing I want
my TV let's see it's cool if I have an
Apple TV and you turn it on and then you
can show a promote it's pretty cool I'm
only showing this cuz I mean supposed to
be Apple oh oh a little one bit and it's
cool because you could pretty much like
it's up your phone you know go your
photos you don't add someone consider my
hurting Instagram it's pretty cool that
was worth showing all right that is my
living room I'm trying to make these
really fast I don't want to be another
forty minute video so let's go to my
bathroom which is like right next door
alright so what a bathroom now I'm
actually happened
I thought this over because I have my
room light with me and when I first
filmed it was no ring lights and it'll
just look tall doing like not cute
all right camp time leaving the bathroom
I had this little thing right here it
turns mom I think it's dying actually
it's dead it'll tell it that's on this
thing
all right you know it's it usually turns
on to be cool and night I had three of
them there somewhere I don't know and
then I have you know my cute
toothbrushes not toothbrush toothbrush
holder I so that thing doesn't work but
I still like it cuz great and have more
wax burner those you take your boobies
in here you don't want to stink you know
gross then I have yeah
q-tips are balls I have myself that's
why I clean my view two blenders with
the right brushes with clean them in
this thing so I just keep it in here I
use this sponge a lot to wash my face
I'll do it a skincare routine soon so
finally I went down that is Dial soap
and acid don't like it up here just for
the messes with mics please put it down
here and here do I have my panel clean
and stuff sprays I have wax and hearing
so whenever I change on my wax on my wax
burner
I poured them in here and so once it
gets filled up I'm getting exactly
nothing cut it open and see what it
looks like inside because on my laxer
different colors I learn this really
freaking cool and I like weird stuff
like that oh yeah then I have my lotions
and my washes conditioner and hair stuff

shower my little Pete on my freakin

dining room now um let's just get
started small but still keep so
all right so we have here my dining room
table my keys and my phone are here not

decorations going
I love skulls oh my god you know short
time okay so quick story time I used to
be heavily like strangely addicted to
skulls my whole room Meldrum was painted
a blood red and their skulls everywhere
school posters actually Nonna actual
skulls not like people schools it was
there as skulls everywhere
I had to have close to schools and I was
totally emo you know my fish tank that
dude he is so in a freaking school I put
school late you know sculptures in his
fish tank so he liked what I liked as
well I just loved school so much and
then I thought one day you know in the
midst of my emo miss my mom said you
know maybe those skulls are bringing
your negative energy so I got rid of
them and I paid him I Rubin I haven't no
mother since not really but kind of sort
of normal enough it was back to my table
how many candles look you to form IKEA

much I paid for it though anyways I have
my DZ which turned off so pretty much
when you use you pull water in this me
and then you add your essential oil and
then you just press it on I'm turned off
with no water in there that's pointless
and it pretty much the team in a fire I
call it the fuser it's humidifier and so
in common here's the air marshals $40
worth it and I'm last in my dining room
is this little picture and I from Ikea

entertaining I just still think it's way
too long so let's go to my final room

a freaking tablecloth it took a backdrop
but I didn't have one then I have my
microphone I know what these are doing
here I cut those out and I usually have
tissue right here right on tissue but I
usually keep tissue right here because

anything else so I usually have tissue
right here now I have these two boxes
and that those all have hair products in
them like hair styling tools hair

most out there because I'm not a fan of
like nude pink so I pull I don't know
what I plan on wearing those then I ask
foundations most things belong to my kit
