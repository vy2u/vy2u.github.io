I like this eye look you snap up the
freak out of my nose and your makeup you

I brought the contour shade and closer
you put it too far out what are you
trying to say or ABCs Beck do me I made
your nose look skinnier why do you do

I'm just saying you're too safe I just
naturally but like what am I doing wrong
