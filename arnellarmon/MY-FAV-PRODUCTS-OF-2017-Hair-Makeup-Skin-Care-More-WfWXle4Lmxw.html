2018 I can't wait like rise time go by
so fast it's like it's sad and then
super cool at the same time because I
can't wait to 25 but that's besides
point today's video I'm going to go over
all my favorite products of 2017 I want
to do this last night however I don't
think people watch the video on the 31st
because they were going out with their
families little stuff so it's a it's
just um due today on January 1st
and so this video give me like a little
bit everything like skincare makeup hair
then one one so like with your hair
brands a lot kind of stuff and so always
other random stuff that I use really
love throughout the year so let's get
start so I put everything in my bag let
me just grab random stuff out cuz I
really don't know okay so the first
thing that's a favorite of mine last
year
aka yesterday um is this bugging me a
good soil moisturizer
I am added to my skincare routine a few
months back and I mean it obviously
lasts forever I've been using it every
single day like the last few months you
guys see like look how much time left it
looks like I can use it a lot but that's
because you literally me like like in my
sink here to you know to see how I use
it however I really really love this a
lot I put it underneath my moisturizer
and just something about it makes my
skin feel really great um it didn't
break me out which was a it was a
shocker but it's like awesome that I did
pick me out because typically oils like
this they always break my skin out I
don't know why however this one did not
break me out and their blackened prints
a or you know go show my support and I
just really felt so BAM favorite prophet
last year cool one of them so next thing
because it's right here is this candle
now you looking at it right now if you
want to like if you want it because it's
like a seasonal thing it's a marshmallow
fireside my Bath and Body Works
it is smells so good it is a look that's
enough section this candle tune I think
it's cute that we both like have a weird
obsession this candle I have like 20 of
these because I never want to run out
the smell is just it's perfect year
round
I can't explain it you'd have to smell
yourself to understand it just it's one
of the best
handles ever wish they have my freaking
marshals I'd go ham but I something
recommended they supposed to forget it I
think it smells good year round you know
to certain candles where you can like
burn them in the summer like the winter
like just certain sense I like the scent
although I guess is more of a holiday
isn't it it smells good year-round okay
and I'll see your mother Melissa cuz
like vacuum I used to go to hurt old
apartment dumpling you walk in on this
all you smell it so I don't know maybe
that's why like so much makes me happy
in my bag okay it's as flattering this
is one of my faves of last year I got
was last year however like I noticed
that love like you guys I haven't missed
ten Flatirons earns you know I'm just
say straight Mary I'd like to say irony
Morgan's ever sees me I have a lot of
straighteners and this one always seems
like grab like out of all those I have I
think because the size of it it's like
it's thin I don't know dude it's just
the worst thing on my the Flyers other
straighteners it's awesome it's like
kimchi and it's it to me yes it's even a
few months back I mean I'm dirty and
whatnot but this flyer is really really
good just to make a video so a lot of
time ago they gave me a code I gotta
find the code so you go save money I
know it's Commission base for me I also
don't care but if you wanna buy it you
can save money and it's really really
cool I love it
I wish I can explain why I like it so
much I just look and gets my hair really
nice straight and soft and it gets me
close to the root it's just perfect
sizes and I really love it a lot and I
noticed I always use it so I have to
include it in this video
alright next thing next thing is this
hair mass which is actually empty all
that having one more mask mm-hmm and I
noticed that this is one of my favorite
master last year only because I have a
lot of masks I buy a lot of hair mask
however I use this one before I
straighten my hair for the first time
and I use it quite often and I know
that it keeps my hair super moisturized
and hydrated and like I didn't
straighten my hair then go back early
and let my curls still pop I think cuz
this mask is by Amica they sent back
sweets right here they send me this in
this blow dryer and I always use a blow
dryer the splitter is cool but it's at
three dollars forward catch something
that's however this mask is really
really amazed and this isn't sponsored
by the way they just send to me just to
try it out and I try it out and I really
really like it a lot I'm kind of sad
that it's almost gone but it's a really
great hair mask
Amica it'll all be done below if you I
know okay see men sing weight knows the
best for last
well okay next thing I put this brush in
this bag because this brush is the best
highlighter brush in the world I had
this brush we need to clean her you kind
of see that the old highlighter coming
off I had this brush for like at least
almost three years now it is it's never
shed on me I washed it and maybe they
get what I sign up Russia to wash a lot
anyways but this time gonna have some
shadow means by Cosette I don't know the
oats s 165 it's perfect for highlighting
it's perfect about this at IMATS like
like three years ago it's perfect it's
like my favorite brush I try to
highlight other brushes and it's like I
just I can't look out this one so I
thought it needs to be in this video
it's my favorite highlighter brush 10:17
nobody's all here's your two so it's a
fav okay next thing that I discovered
last year that I wish I would have known
about for a long time and it's her hair
is got to be glued styling spiking gel
so for last year with the year before
last year oh I think was doing weeks to
16 anyways a lot of first I've been with
I took the black one and honestly they
know she ate the black one but like it
does not work as good as this one this
one it's like it's so nice I cannot
believe it took me a while to like even
like be put on so
I think I'll leave space with me on to
this and that's when I finally would
have bought it and ever since then I
this is perfect if you wear wigs and you
want you should just stay on if you
wanna hear newly this is perfect it's
like one of the best hair products for
weights ever in my personal opinion and
so I felt like it needs to be in this
videos when my favorite products of last
year
BAM and sling $5 and Walmart don't let
him use my story nice nice don't be
taxing go to Walmart at $5 Oh put that
over there but that's not the big tube
the other tubes are kind of smaller so
all right
next teen so next so next product that
was one of my faves last year is this
fin TV foundation on the top is the
primer top but that's because like it
looks dirty and I lost to talk to this
so whatever this foundation like it's
crazy because when we when Rihanna came
up with her mind
of course you you expect a lot from
Rihanna but celebrity camera without
make ones before and it's like it's
never what you expect it to be it's like
okay it's gonna work and so obviously
when she first came with her lying on
like damn I hope that she's not working
it's Rihanna I really want her to come
through and I promise you ever set my
foundation I wear it at least at least
like four times a week it's like my
go-to besides my NARS sheer glow nursing
well that's always going to be my number
one foundation however this is like
coming really close I don't know it's
something it has something to do with
the fact it's made by Rihanna - this is
like another brand I would still be like
this is like one of my favorite
foundations because it's something about
it that's like perfect it's just I wore
today like it's just it's one of the
best foundations I've ever tried and it
was for surely was my favorite remedy to
kids 17 so I had to gloom this video if
you have tried to get if it depends I
would I'm not gonna say I we weren't
gonna try it because I have seen some
videos of people who don't like it the
most face in their skin type so if
you've SuperDuper dry skin I don't know
recommend it because basically bills
that I watch that people who don't like
it have really dry skin so I'm not going
to say like yeah go buy it because it
may not work the best for you however
your skin's more normal or even oily it
may be your favorite I mean if your skin
is dry I would say at least try to give
it a chance to maybe combine it with the
more moisturizing primer so it can work
out for you but let me just give it a
chance of me it's nothing you for
everyone but it's my life so explain the
video okay okay next product which is
one of my face up 2017 these pixie
these sticks these fixie glow tonic pads
anyway anyways next thing I - are these
pixie glitter on it to go Pat's
obviously the glow tonic is hella bomb
you gotta see some I think your routine
kind use these every every every every
single day I mean I'm almost done you of
course you can see if I really only have
like a few tags left I use them every
single day it just I don't know I don't
know why I like it so much I feel like
if I started using it my skin complexion
is even more clear I think my skin's are
clear as it is but it's even in my skin
tone a little bit
there's balm I didn't think things I got
out on their PR list last year and I
didn't think that I would like these
this much I was like you know like a guy
said to me max we'll try it and as I
tried it I can't stop using them I have
the liquid form too because they have
these ones look of course to go and I
like them or they have the bottle and
you could like use your own cotton pad
or whatever a con thing to you don't do
it yourself and so I'm done it all it's
drugstore so it's definitely affordable
and it's awesome for your skin you'll
see my skincare routine so have that
that okay a few more things okay I'm
seeing my favorite things for us okay so
next thing is this matte ties Patrick
Starr powder this compact spot right
yeah so all of this just came out like
last a month or so I'm crazy
it it quickly became my favorite setting
powder so I felt like I had to clean
this video I love Patrick Pat just
awesome but this powder is so so so so
good I didn't think I would like it this
much it just I like how it looks like my
eyes it like brightens up underneath my
eyes it just it looks it looks good it
feels good and last literally all day
and it seems to hold well no I haven't
compared it to the Laura Mercier powder
they're both they're both promising home
I know this one cost a little less bye
baby this one's super awesome when he
first boot release a collection I was
looking forward to this the most I'm so
happy I like it it's the bomb are they
is his collection limited edition oh
don't think I'm not playing me
I don't know buying this like for these
because I don't know if it's collection
limited edition but if I run out and
they don't have anymore I'm gonna be
kind of pissed about it so I need to buy
at least like four to stock up but this
is definitely like one of my favorite
powders last year so I had to include it
alright okay this is hella random well
it relates make it related these two
sponges they're hella dirty but that's
cuz I use them a lot because they're my
favorite so I discovered these two
sponges last year first of this Tarte
sponge is purple however you can't see
the color but it's purple this Tarte
sponge so bomb no shady but there but
this is better and it's four dollars
cheaper and they had an old so they
don't have Missa for whoops and support
but it's one of the BET honest it's one
of the best like talk to you this is
known to you it's the best sponge I've
ever tried it gets super soft not too
soft could believe I might not have try
sponges that were too soft
it just it's awesome I love this bunch
of him try it I mean I've talked about
my videos before so if you haven't tried
on like why would you trust me but
totally buying it so Ulta I know my
friends try mine and sold out the old
too near her house so hopefully I sold
out around yours but it's awesome man
love it and in this bud to discover
towards in this year this is more peace
punch super dirty I use every single day
it is so good like I don't think well
like five six dollars for it or maybe
three something crazy I don't wanna buy
like 10 DS it's so good it's so soft
this the tip of it I want to look
closely but it's so dirty it gets into
the crevice or crease whatever it gets
into my eyes over here like it's perfect
it's so good for the price you guys um
this definitely onto this video honestly
like
need to buy more knees go to more of
your story they don't want to say I was
a now so I've gotta go over there but I
get this bunch you really can't lose
like it's like $5 something crazy so how
to have those know one of my favorite
things are the cou funny Instagram you
know my B honestly respond to me but um
I never thought of ever cash out on
headphones I used to hear about the
price of these now that was the hundred
dollars fight me I used to get helmet
mat is thing with the funny they're
taxing through in Javas for these but
how to bottom okay one my ex had some of
these so I could use his my baby's gonna
slap and then but they're his look at
that cute color so like I want you cuz I
wanna buy them and so one day I was
driving and I left my headphones at home
if you guys know the iMeet music my ears
at all times
that's like somehow I'm filming I do the
I do voiceovers I be playing music a lot
over in the background just need to hear
something oh and so I was driving I
forgot my headphones like oh my god like
I can't even like I don't like being out
of public without headphones on cuz they
just music helps calm my anxiety so I
was like okay like you need headphones
but see I already had the Apple you know
the plain Apple web one tells okay I
don't buy the same half was already half
so I bought these and they're beautiful
a nice I totally recommend them another
three dollars like that's a lot I tell
you it's so worth it it's so worth it
like I've never thought I would ever
spinach me on headphones but they're so
worth of they're the best they're
awesome and they were definitely a 2017
favorite so gotta have those
settles down nicely alright my next
favorite thing hair product is this form
of coma cream this is a new bottle looks
like I went like three DS already this
stuff is so nice and it's crazy because
I use a lot of hair products and so sum
of money would be peeping the difference
is I'm like okay this offer was good to
me however I keep the difference like I
see what this does to my hair if you
curly hair I mean animal I will you know
my hair texture I'm something see or
something crazy if you have my hair
texture evenly I don't know you know I
can't really speak on um how this work
under hair textures I'll just be for
myself because I don't want to like sale
work for everybody you're not you guys
go get his more greatest however I
definitely is worth a try it's like $10
at Walmart $11 is same thing and it's
awesome like makes my curls so defined
if I could I record and click on
snapchat before using this we can find
out inserted but don't expect the insert
because no always forget my inserts I'm
still the same person new year same
person jokes but if I can find it I'll
insert it I will say that this year I'm
going to actually do my inserts okay but
this product it's so like it just it's
nice like my office will soft so curly
so moisturize whenever my hair salon
super dry you never know when your
hair's kind of on the drier side and no
matter what property put it in it just
does not make it feel as soft as you
wanted to feel it is kind of like they
located this kind of subs this is not
like that it's awesome so man like get
it basically okay laughing in my bag
well look no no wait okay so next thing
Gemma going as quickly because it's just
eyebrows stuff but my favorite parts of
10:17 was definitely benefit precisely
my draw
these products are awesome there's a
bomb um people is asking me how I feel
and be like how how is it appear
Anastacio
I still like love a massage his up Rahul
is at a Sousa however I did peep that
all my bra was man saucy and they were
always freaking break on me they're very
fragile
benefice does not do that the only time
it'll break is if you're like you know
being hella hard your brows which why
would you even want to do that but other
Matty's are Matt's 30 or whatever the
word is they're they're like super
durable they're awesome they're like
three more dollars than especially
Broadway's buy click they last longer as
well so these are definite my favorite
bra promise to 1017 you know totally
recommend it I mean although I'm on
benefits PR I actually went on bought
these before because I'm too lazy
acts like a key somewhere at bucks I'll
be buying them so if I if I'm buying
that means I really like them so
recommend oh okay
so laughing my bag and I'll tell you
guys my favorite hair companies hello
mrs. video then 18 minutes oh no okay
we'll turn day 25 so if I sing my back
which I have to mention it's totally not
sponsored you guys look at my hair it's
sugar bear hair this is my favorite
product of 2017 hands-down my favorite
product of two in 15 because last year
and I said a picture I'll do it um my
hair was shaved now I've come here to
ponytail my my shirts hanging is lengthy
reliefing gank um it's it's awesome
because business it held bothers me but
a hell and get it because before I start
to share there I would see that the
Kardashians promote like that work
and I get it I get it where you see like
healthy promoting you don't think it's
gonna work and so my friend Jasmine
Jasmine Brown she's a cheesy to to I saw
I was watching cerbigd watching her
videos and I was like like a super old
one I was like wait her hair like it
grew this much in a year and that's like
Pete like sugar bears look heal it I had
something to show you everything work
because you guys know she promote them
as well she was yeah well he works on
likes past that email so I hope that you
know and I emailed them and I want to
work with them and I don't even plan to
like get sponsored by them I really just
want to freak on these and so they were
like oh what to rates per post I might
Hamill get the check too while I'm at it
and so I told my recent post and that's
how we you know started a little
sponsorship thing but I mean I was after
taking them this is one of my like
putting my 8 bottle 7 prep myself I've
been doing it for at least like 7 8
months now and so I they no longer
spawns in the only because I mean my
rates increased and they were trying to
you know love mm-hmm and so they're not
sponsoring more higher than I did oh

hold on a couple
wait website can I record a quick video
yes hold on what I say okay you so much
anyways guys um they Nolan responds to
me however I still take them they still
send me gummies I think they do this any
ones that could come months ago so
hopefully I'm just doing a fearless
however I think that concentrate
Bob because of you okay why it's okay
however I recommend them like they're
like $30 per bottle and I'm on to say
that for whatever is it took me up a
pair list they stops and then to me I
would go out and buy them because I mean
I I tell you I have to speak too much
onyx I'm like literal proof that they
actually work and so I mean if you guys
want to trust me or trust this you can
do so will buy them if you don't I
completely understand because honestly
bloggers they lie and they do pay a lot
of people and I know that I'll be taking
it and concise for an end because it
could be taking action through their
hair however that's like my favorite
product of last year I'm gonna take them
all this year and I'm like hell excited
to see how much my hair grows we'll see
will like do like Linda checks and all
kind of stuff because I feel like you
know the longer my hair grows the more
like natural hair videos I'll do and all
that good stuff so that's definitely
like my number one favorite product of
2017 so uh uh let's see what's next
I have taking on my favorite hair comes
to 10:17 I'm do that let's see this
videos like 22 minutes I'm going to name
three of my favorite hair companies and
then we'll in this video okay what's
that okay so the first hair company
that's my favorite that is literally
like it pops up in my mind first is hair
company I will insert a picture right
here right here of the hair workmen's
when I did that the unicorn like purple
hair their hair qualities honestly the
best I've tried to and seventeen in
regards to straight hair I have other
favorite curly hair but they're straight
hair and I got their blonde but most its
I see the best hair I tried last year
and regardless like thickness how it
died everything that's like the number
one favorite hair company of last year
number two hmm let's look coat on let me
see I don't know so my second
favorite company every year has to be
her given hair I'll insert a picture
when I was wearing her hair everyone
loved that hair I mean I love that hair
I'm me it was perfect it bleached so
nicely I know for a fact it's like human
version hair a lot of companies claim
that their hair is version of human and
they lie
however after like experiencing the
hairline bleaching it and like you know
working with it it's definitely the best
it's super nice if you like super kinky
curly hair I would definitely recommend
that hair company I actually want to
revive that wig I haven't worn in a
minute because you know I get sent so
much hair it's hard for me to stick to
one style because I have to switch it up
however I did when I was like in that
phase of wearing that hair I kept going
back to it and it's like yeah that's
number two so number three also make
this list number three I have kind of
have four let's see number three would
have to be I yeah number three out of
four cuz I I'm thinking two companies I
don't know which one I want to say first
but like it's the same so number
three would have to be beauty forever
hair I first start work with them I
think like at 216 and I've gotten sent
hair from them at least like six seven
times I've gotten sent their Wiggy hair
their straight hair the curly hair and
every single texture has been nice
either Percy like that was a brand last
month they almost ruined their whole
career they they made a post I'm gonna
dress it only because I feel like people
comment on it and I'm gonna comment on
it first
they made a post that had Donald
Trump in it but if you read them if you
read the caption you know that they only
post six I think they don't they're in
China I don't know
don't with him over here and so I
think they were trying to meet cute
maybe they thought we supported him and
we were like nice so they didn't they
apologize no I really thank God it
because if you look their hashtag the
hashtag Barack Obama they were just
trying to be cute and it was a total
fail
and I even emailed them it told them you
guys applause I think this down
recognize square should come anymore I
do not I don't with that and
they're like oh no dear we understand
you know we're trying we don't know and
I honestly believe them so I'm gonna be
addressing that because I know I may get
a few comments and we support that brand
they make this post however their pop
they apologize for it and I definitely
don't think that they've made any harm
by it so they're my for last year
they're like number three as as far my
favorite hair company goes and number
four I would have to say it's better
length hair their company on circuits
right here where they sing the black
curly clip-ins
and although I've struggled using those
clip into that video you guys know I
wore those clippings all the time they
were there - clintus i have for my bone
proof buttons and so i definitely the
clip ends and I definitely like their
texture I think I'm gonna work with them
again soon because now that my hair is
black it'll be much easy to put the clip
in because if you guys watch that video
it's like use black hairspray to get my
color to match the clip in sand so I'm
definitely gonna look at them again this
year and yeah the number four I do plan
join a video of like other favorite
companies I have and companies I won't
recommend however I don't want to
include on this video because I article
in this videos gonna be super long as it
is and I think that could just like
piece every video and so um yeah those
are my favorite products my favorite
hair companies my favorite makeup my
favorite other little random that's
my favorite stuff of 2017 and i'm yeah i
don't know how i would take the close of
this video I plan on doing a lot of
different videos to see I'm gonna do
more vlogs I made a post on Instagram
asking you guys what you want to see
from me to see it I got a lot of vlog
like trying hauls just want different
stuff and so I
be more consistent this year and just
doing more like stuff outside of hair I
love hair I'm still new hair videos
however I don't want it just strictly to
hair my channel I went to her makeup
more like teaching type stuff just more
cool stuff in general and so expect a
lot of cool for me this year if you
