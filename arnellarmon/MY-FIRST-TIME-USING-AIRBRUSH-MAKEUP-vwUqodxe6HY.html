welcome today's video is going to be on
my first time tried airbrush makeup this
video is sponsored by Jeunesse global
was kind of to send me their foundation
primer bronzer and highlighter in which
I used to create this very nice super
easy almost like no makeup makeup look
in fact if my brows ones that weren't so
harsh this would take me be a no makeup
makeup look because although I have two
layers of the foundation on it later
looks airbrushed it is foundations
weightless I did not use any setting
powder at all so what you see is only
jenessa products and I got a pretty
flawless so before it's talking this
ears off I'm gonna let you guys watch
this video it will be a voiceover but it
is the first impressions during this
videos my very first time trying this
makeup so I will be giving you guys my
first thoughts my first impressions all
that stuff during this video and I'll
shout back in with you guys when I'm
done so first I'm going to prime my skin
using the Jeunesse global primer now it
is recommended that you shake this
primer and hold it 8 inches away from
your face however as you can see I did
not do that
I don't know math I do not know you know
how far 8 inches is however although I
did overspray it was fine and blending
into my skin very easily all I have to
do is rub it in as if it was a regular
eye cream primer and it you know blend
in my skin perfectly so if you do make
this mistake like I did it is totally ok
as I stay in and began this video this
is my first time using makeup like this
so I'm not perfect I'm a professional
just yet
after prime my skin I'm going to take
the Jeunesse global foundation and now
this foundation comes in nine shades and
I am in the shade warm honey this
foundation is awesome because it uses
the brands exclusive youth enhancing apt
200 to rejuvenate the skin foundation is
both moisturizing and hydrating and it
has buildable coverage from light to
medium so I start off with one layer
however I do go in with the second layer
but to be honest after the first layer I
felt like my skin looked flawless and
you know properly covered however I like
you know a little more covered so I went
in with a second layer after I did the
first one but if you're wondering this
makeup is suitable for all skin types
oily dry combination you name it it will
work on all skin type this line was
created and backed by celebrity makeup
artist who on a Hostin who create this
line or to give people access to makeup
that is able to make you look both
airbrushed and flawless while being
super easy to use and long-lasting my
personal opinion I think this makeup
will be even greater for people who have
more mature skin of course it works for
my skin type however I think this we
really beneficial for people who have
you know more mature skin who may have
you know fine lines and wrinkles because
it is not heavy or cakey at all however
it gives you you know your desired
coverage and it makes you look really
flawless so I would definitely recommend
to people with more mature skin because
it's very easy to use and like I said
it's not heavy it's not thick and creamy
it won't highlight your lines and
wrinkles and I'm just kind of speaking
as a professional makeup artist you know
cuz I did used to freelance so here I am
trying to apply the makeup a different
way I sprayed it directly onto a little
poof just to see how that worked as well
and so I learned that appliance
foundation works both ways you can apply
it directly to your face and blend it
out or you could apply to the poof and
blend it out by the way um when I would
send his package did it come with you
know a little hair tie in order to
protect my hair but it didn't dawn on me
that that was that's what that was for
until now so you can protect your hair
from this I know the foundation to get
in my hair a little bit but there's ways
to you know get around that
so now time to bronze now the only like
I wouldn't call this a negative but I
guess it wouldn't it doesn't work the
best for me because of my skin tone this
bronzer wasn't as dark as I need it to
be in order to really bronze my skin it
looks dark when I first sprayed on
however once I bloomed it out it kind of
like blends right into my skin it kind
of like almost mix it with my foundation
by the way I use like a little card to
kind of create a sharper line because I
thought this will be darker than it was
however once I realized that you know it
wasn't too far from actual skin tone I
realized I didn't have to use a card
because I mean even if I you know
sprayed it in a place where I didn't
actually want it to be sprayed it was
gonna blend out anyways so I decided to
spray this bronzer around my hairline
just you know bronze my for in a bit
although this makeup isn't waterproof it
is water-resistant so I feel like even
if I do sweat my makeup won't budge at
all so that kind of you know it gives me
a little bit of security and whatnot so
here I am you know just kind of blending
it out and now I'm going to spray the
highlight this is called simmer and at
first glance I thought this highlight
would be too light or too ashy on me and
I kind of sprayed a little bit too much
when I first sprayed it on but once I
blend it out the right way it actually
looked pretty nice it kind of gave me a
very nice airbrushed glow so in the
future on uses product I'm going to
actually follow the instructions which
actually say to spray the spray directly
onto an applicator or onto the palm of
your hand and then blend it out you
could use a applicator to win this out
or your finger so that's kind of where I
went wrong but as I continue to say this
is my first time trying up these
products and I forgot to read the bottle
however the rest of products are pretty
straightforward each product you just
have to shake it for a few seconds and
then it holds it eight inches away from
your face however with this highlighter
you do have to spray it onto an
applicator or your hand because you
don't want to look like you know
in man or anything crazy so after I
realized that I did not follow the
instructions for this out of my face I
sprayed it directly on some applicator
and I blend it out and I thought it
looked much better than the first side
of my face so after applying my
highlight I went off camera I took my
brows and mascara and put on a gloss and
that is the completed look all right
yeah so I did my brows mascara off
camera I did not touch my face at all
outside of that I got to set my face
anything you guys I am so impressed
mainly by the foundation because I just
kind of nervous at first I was told that
with this foundation you not in this
setting powder and I was kind of iffy
about that because you guys know it
always set my foundation but instead of
Russia put the powder on
I tried splendid dry you know why do my
brows I mascara and you guys can see
that like it is dried down but it's not
matte it's not dewy it's like perfect it
looks like skin and it feels like it
does it oh oh well this is my first
outfit to my face it doesn't feel like
it's gonna come off either it feels like
skin oh wow it isn't sorry you guys
it literally feels like I have no makeup
on but that look flawless oh wow okay
this is literally flawless ah let's look
good close-up me I just don't see this
leary looks like skin I can blend it out
a little bit more around my nose area
this camera is so good you could see my
pores but look at the foundation it
literally looks like skin it does not
look like I have on foundation at all it
looks flawless you guys you can't tell
me this doesn't look flawless foundation
is flawless the bronzer
whistles a tad bit darker I didn't see
it lightly it's more of a natural type
bronze note I make you look more a
little more tan I flip I could actually
mix it into my foundation during like
the summer time like a little darker
I'm definitely do that however if I want
I really contour I would have to use a
powder the highlight is really nice and
very nice natural highlight when I first
got a nice pan on my hand I thought it
would be a little too light for me cuz
it's more like this silvery side however
when I blend it out I mean it's on my
nose as well it doesn't look like
metallic or super silver it car blends
right in the skin with the foundation
the primer is really nice as well I
thought that's why the foundation is
just sitting on my skin so nicely
this foundation is super weightless it
just it's honestly well it's also one of
the best foundations I try based on how
to make my skin look and it's like I
almost to an extent hate this video is
sponsored because I don't want to come
off as I'm just trying to sell it I'm
just over height bit but I feel like my
face is speaking for me you guys and I
literally look like flawless this is one
of the best foundation I tried I just I
almost wish that it wasn't sponsored but
sponsored content it can be so hard
because you can get sent a product and
really really really love it but it's
almost like I have to tone down your
excitement a bit because people think
that with the video sponsored you're
bound to like lie or over exaggerate I
just want you guys to know that that's
not one turns you I am like so blown
away with how good my skin looks and how
good this foundation works
so those are my final thoughts because
you guys are gonna see me use this again
you can see me like a flawless some more
but yeah because interests in these
products definitely check them out I am
in the shade w7 warm honey like I said
earlier in this video and yeah all the
