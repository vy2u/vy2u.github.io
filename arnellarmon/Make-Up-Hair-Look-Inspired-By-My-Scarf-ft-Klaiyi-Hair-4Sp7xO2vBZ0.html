new welcome today's video was actually
inspired by this scarf I'm wearing right
here because I've already seen the scarf
so I posted a whole bunch of stories in
the scarf my Instagram I actually bought
this car from a thrift store yesterday
for this like 70s themed party I was
going to and then when I got old I
noticed that it matched this wig that I
recently made and so I decided I'm do
kind of a cool video to kind of just do
a look based on my scarf and I don't
know I decided we like satisfying to
watch maybe and just fun to do and very
easy to do and so before I continue
before you can say watch the video this
video is sponsored by clay hair and this
is the hair that I'm wearing I've worked
with them before I believe the hair I
dyed for them before he's like teal is
really pretty if I can find the photo
which I cannot guarantee because this is
some time ago I'll insert it if not just
look through my channel because I've
definitely done a video with them before
and so they sent me three bundles on the
front till I made this way now I
originally did fill my video of me
diamonds hair color however I delete the
footage I don't know how and it kind of
super obsessed me actually because I
really took my time whatever you however
are gonna Kim I'm not gonna get mad at
something I can't you know change and so
I will list and dyes I'm use to get this
color down below and the order I place
on the hair when I start this video with
no makeup on and no scarf on you gonna
see if the top part of the hair is
actually dark on the bottom so it's a
really nice I'll brake going on it's a
really really beautiful color if you
gotta like me to film this over you guys
let me know I'm not gonna do it you guys
don't want me to but if you want me to
just leave a comment down below and I'll
totally do it cuz I don't mind was
acting very easy to do
pros and cons on this hair really fast I
have no cons at all like literally no
cons at all when I made the wig that
track splits super easily it was no
issue with that at all the hair bleached
super easily as well when I only delete
the bleach in for like no longer than 20
minutes it was about 15 minutes cuz it
processed superfast is and it was
perfect and I put the dye in I let it
sit overnight and the dye took really
well to the hair and you guys can see
the hair is
SuperDuper like silken soft more silkier
than than usual not to say I've had an
experience like silky hair cuz I would
say having work with so many companies
before but this hair it kind of like
stands out and it's silkiness like its
luster it's movement it's beautiful to
me it's a trip because when I first got
out I open it from the package I kind of
didn't even wanna bleach or diet because
I thought that what I did that I would
lose a silkiness had going on but it is
still there so I have no cons only pros
and so if you order from is coming
before like I always say like I always
recommend to leave your review or
comments down below and brushes company
and your experience with them because
I've only one opinion and me personally
when I used to actually go and buy hair
I would never trust one opinion not a
sandwich I wouldn't trust me but when it
whatever you buy it here you want to
like you know get multiple opinions on
it first before purchasing so you know
listen to me and if anyone else's
purchase here before it comes them a
little to help anyone out if they are
interested in purchasing his hair and if
you are super seen all the links to
everything we description box below and
I would watch this video now hope you
guys enjoy it
alright so this the hair straight as you
can see it is so silky like it's just so
full of body guys you see the motion and
everything it's beautiful like it's
absolutely beautiful I love it don't
mind my dress arms have eczema okay I'm
not perfect but anyways I'm this hair
kind of did an even chop job but that's
besides the point I'm gonna fix my baby
hair when second beat you hombre it's
really nice I'll list the hair ties used
below but it's not I tried to like a
plum to like a reddish ombre so that's
color I got but I want to put some quick
waves in his hair and also speaking just
do not take me no longer than 10 minutes
which is nuts I decided to do like maybe
75% curly in the end street I don't know
why it's something I like about this
look it's kind of like beach wavy you
guys are probably seen this before we're
like the top part is curly then it just
get straight ends like you would think
that looks ugly but something about it
looks nice to me and so that's the style
I was doing and so yeah you literally
just you can grab big pieces if you want
that's what this takes like this half
side only took three minutes
looking at the little camcorder thinking
ding like that was only three minutes
and so I just curl 75% of the hair and
then I just leave it in straight and you
go see at the end I'm gonna show you
guys um what it looks like once it's all
done but it's super easy to do so yeah
like I said in the beginning this video
I literally have no cons on this hair
had a really pleasant experience with it
if you've had you know an experience
that is opposite of mine like I said
comment down below or if you also had a
good experience comment down below
that's always helpful but yeah my stop
talking I'm to let you guys watch me do
my hair really quick and then we're
gonna do the makeup
you
so I finished the hair and this what the
end looks like I don't know it's
something about this look that I like if
you don't like it don't tell me that cuz
I do and if you do tell me that at least
say a nice way don't be rude about it
you know what I mean so now it's scarf
time this beautiful scarf I have it's so
easy you literally just put it on your
head like you're a genie and then oh I'm
moving slow but it's not a good ankle of
me and so you're trying your head you
know cover your desired amount of
forehead in my case I have a lot to
cover so I'm gonna cover a little a
little bit of half of that thing not too
much though and then all you have to do
is just tie it in the back like so and
you got your somebody scarf that will
stay on all day long and it covers your
forehead it's totally cool I dig it so
just a heads up this tutorial
I don't want caught I don't want to call
it a tutorial it's kind of a nice
finished look type of video so after do
this scarf I actually did my brows and
my foundation and concealer my main base
off camera because I do it every single
video and I'm just gonna pretty much be
finished you look from there the
products I use on my face everything we
down below including the foundation but
I don't show myself do that part so take
a look at this now I'm back and now it's
time to enhance this whatever I'm doing
so I'm gonna take this a mini naked heat
palette and i'm sure you guys sheets i'm
using i pretty much use this whole
entire palette for my eye look and my
goal was to kind of just go for a vibe i
was trying to go for something cool i
wanted to do a look that matched my
scarf and my hair i was kind of going
for like a monochromatic vibe as well i
just i don't know i was just inspired by
my scarf so don't let you guys watch i
don't need to really talk too much this
is very simple it's very straightforward
so getting to watch it
you
after finish off the eyes I am going to
bronze my skin using my Tarte Hotel
Ayers bronzer is tart on cancel yet
because I would really like to use shape
tip again but they gotta let me know
because I don't but for blush I am using
plumb fuller by Mac I kind of went ham
on the blush because I want to look
really blushed up you know I thought it
will my vibe and because I kind of like
when light on the eyes I thought it was
acceptable to kind of go a little harsh
on the face region usually when I do
more dramatic eyes oh wait pause I
blessed of my nose cut that also with my
vibe but yeah you just only do more
dramatic eyes I go light on the face and
if my eyes are pretty simple
I feel like it's totally cool to like
kind of go ham on this on the face so
yeah for highlight oh no to contour
skipping steps I just can't turn my nose
very lightly nothing to created just
want to make it look more defined and
then for highlight if I hurry up
I'm using this Anastasia Beverly Hills
and breezy highlight and I just did very
light highlight I didn't really go to
ham on the highlight because I wasn't
really pressed like I said I wanted like
a monochromatic matte look so I did want
to go too crazy on a highlight but I did
want a glow cuz I didn't want to look
too matte but anyways yeah did my
highlight use this little eyeshadow
brush so to mascara I'm using my milk
makeup cush mascara and I am going to
apply it like looking down so I feel
like it applies best that way most
mascaras do actually it just kind of
hard to do this every single video
because you know you're filming you want
to look into the camera but I'm applying
my mascara I'm taking my time because I
do not plan on wearing lash this look so
I really want to make sure that all my
last were coated and go tit that's not
even a word I just wanted them
to look really nice so yeah
and then to decrease my chance of
getting roasted for doing a very simple
look I decided to add blush to my inner
little flappy thing so I thought that
that would make a look look a little
different and I thought it would gold my
vibe as well I don't even know what I
look like but I look like something but
I can't pinpoint it so not for lips I'm
going to take off my chapstick first so
that way it's easier to apply my
lipstick I'm gonna line my lips using
cork and I'm gonna mainly focus on
lining the top part of my lips because
that's the main part that needs lining
and on the first lip color I'm using I
believe this is called henny thing I
don't know it has some do Hennessy which
is why I grabbed it and it matched the
look good so I'm going to apply that
first as like a base color cuz it's kind
of like a deeper mahogany Brown and then
afterwards I'm going to grab this color
by Kat Von D I don't know the name of
this either and it matches the scarf
really nicely so that's why I chose to
use this one and then after this one I'm
going to use this like little lip crown
by.bite it's like a softer pink and I'm
replaced on the middle just to kind of
create an ombre effect and to pretty
much just add more definition nothing
serious and then I am going to add a
little more blush on my nose I just felt
like you need a little more blush and
uhm yeah after that I was pretty much
done I was kind of turning like okay
don't need to add anything else and my
lame my boring I was like mom good let
me set this face so I'm using this Urban
Decay all nighter spray and after I sent
my face I let it dry I put a little
shirt to set the vibe and I was done so
