rid of me I did my hair and makeup I
really love this little customary salon
to native target quick recap then
looking pretty much I will go to some
Brown war ground like the glue slows
report my wig from Wow African it's
plenty accessibility on this red months
ago well months ago like April begin up
April and I edited everything and then
my computer I Rob never post is on how
to fix posting out because this wig
literally looks so good as you guys like
it's late it's not going anywhere enough
to hurt out until a windy outside those
rooting through the test - time to go
anywhere but yeah I'll talk more about
the wig as I'm doing my tater which I
show you guys how I do in the video and
our our trims
a little bit some was going to be a
listen recording this whole
properly ever she wants be a bit behind
these cameras man and they'll take a
woman a camera glowing six fingers and
it's so awkward
oh my dear box videos into it please
Severson subscribe and as New Year's
alright so first I'm starting my hair
already have the wig pretty much mostly
curls and what I did to get these curls
I just pretty much curled it with the
wand and I use a slope clips to hold the
curls and I just took all the clips out
once I was done to get these like big
wall curls you just want to twirl just
let me know
and I just put the wig on I have a lash
advance so it onto it and there's a clip
in the back there were cliffs in the
front of the way by coupled off because
I just didn't fight them there now I'm
just kind of figuring out how I want the
way to do styles
anyone wanted curls I didn't know what
direction I wanted the hair to flow and
this one honestly sucks
Alyssa took my favorite one and good
thing that she came to my house like
while swimming this because she brought
my other wand back because yeah this one
it's not the best like the barrel just
the OL wand kind of sucks are you either
going to see that I'm trying to make
something work and I joined I'm not
liking it so it's kind of waste of time
so instead of folks and my hair I pretty
much decide you laid flat so I got my
got to be free spray and this on to the
best method to get your lease to hold
you want to get the spray and then you
wrap it with a scarf this is way better
than blow drying it because it just lays
flatter and it stays longer while leaves
from for my experience and it's just
easier so you can do this before you do
your makeup by the time you're done with
your makeup it's completely dry and
completely like stuck to your head so
it's perfect alright so now for my
makeup to prime minis my saundra luxe
peach deluxe gleam by Melanie Mills I
don't think this is a primer I just like
using as one because it makes you glow
the foundation means my hourglass stick
foundation I'm just going to swipe that
all over my face and then use a start
sponge to blend it out I love spa base
because very creamy and super easy to
blend out and I mean it's kind of my
shades in the most part it is alike a
now but once everything is set and
everything um it looks pretty good
so before I do anything else I'm working
my eyes I'm using this new pause and I
wasn't really sure how it's going to
turn out this by sneza my rigs the
24-hour matte cream color and pretty
sure you use these on your lips and
cheeks as well I'm gonna try in like
another video but today I was gonna use
as an eyeshadow and I only want to use
one product for my shadows so what I am
doing was I put a layer on and I learned
that it blends best and you use your
finger but then it kind of like sheers
it out and so I would just put a layer
on work on the other eye why that layer
dried and then I went back and I kept
layering it and layering it until it
looked like super blended eyeshadow but
like you know it went from dark to light
you know what I mean you have a receipt
but I pretty much just kept layering and
layering it and I'm it lasted literally
all day so that's a plus that was pretty
much it for the eyes now suppress the
face so I'm going to conceal using my
Tarte shaped a concealer you guys know
the drill
just going to put that on then blend
that out and then later on in order to
make it a little brighter I'm going to
add my Kevin a clown concealer which I
always use but I use a little left this
time I just want to add it to like
brighten it not to really conceal so I
just did my sponge and it just got very
very little and then put on top of the
place that are concealed just to make it
look brighter so I really love the
bright concealer effect
to set the place I can feel it I'm
breaking at my lure murmur and power I'm
just going to simply set the place that
I concealed
MSM entire face Huai black reading soft
focus powder sorry it was like in this
camera super short it's because Alyssa
was there she was literally distracting
me during this whole process it will
kind of threw me off that's not my
editing's got the greatest now to
contour slash broad using this Tarte
bronzer the man we down below I said
Raymond I never look the name I just
call it bronzer Christmas photos to me I
put a little too much on so I busted out
my foundation brush and just kind of fix
that now to contour my nose I'm using
hoola I would not use the Tarte Bromwich
contour my nose because way too warm so
I just used my little cousin or like a
cold tone bronzer for blush I'm using
format by Mac which is like a rusty
brownish red color blush I started match
the eyeshadow so I was just trying to
kind of kind of a monochromatic look oh
that it is kind of mock my look okay
anyways to highlight I'm using on my new
favorite highlighters by Jake at beauty
it's called Twilight I use it in a
previous bit of line where I did like a
look using drugstore products this house
really good you guys
all right so - why my lips I'm using
this black radiance brown lip liner and
then I'm going to mix it with this eye
liner by makeup geek I don't know - a
name for his darker Brown I didn't want
the Brown to be too warm and just like a
cooler darker Brown so I just kind of
put on the corners of my lips and I'll
say this look alone look kinda cool but
I said that my Milani look lipstick and
it was really watery and has some weird
consisteny to it but I really want to
use such made it work I've kind of sterk
I've never seen a like a lipstick do
that but I mean once I shook it up a
little bit it worked so I ended up using
it anyways like I'm at a leaky rusty
color and then I'm going to add this
political lipstick and this just to you
know add dimension to my lips I never
just do one color will rarely I always
mix colors for most parts so um yeah I
just must do that and I'm going to stick
to my line a little bit with this lip
liner and you know to perfect the lips
and that's pretty much it so for mascara
muses on my mask it's actually really
cool you guys um I cut up a clip because
I spent way too much time on it but it
acts as a little tiny brush you know see
me use it I didn't know since I open up
the red little top on top of the mascara
wand but it has like a tiny little piece
for it um and that's like for your lower
like your bottom lashes right here and
uh those really cute and cool mascara is
really good as well I put like two coats
I believe maybe like three and I didn't
wear any lashes which is great I was too
lazy to put them on anyways now I'm
going to add a little bit at Tarte
bronze or just to the outer part of my
lower lash line just like ah so it looks
a little weird with no like shadow on
the bottom lash line at all and then I'm
gonna take my highlighter and put on the
inner like tear ducts just because it's
like my signature and I love doing exit
brides in my eyes
I'm also going to put that highlight
underneath my brow bone as well I
usually never focus too much and
highlight it I make my brow bone but
this actually looks pretty good with
this look so I'm happy I did it all
right fine oh the makeup it actually did
take that long at all and now I'm going
to do my hair is gonna look crazy at
first you guys that looks none and I'm
learning that an issue that I am have
with my wigs or my lace frontals is that
I don't tone like the frontal that I
released them which caused them to look
orange so I have to figure out how to do
that
I've try use a purple shampoo before it
didn't work the way I thought it worked
but mimics try it again and just you
know improve cuz that's one thing I
don't like that it looks orange but
anyways I'm just you know working on my
hair laying my baby hairs you know I'm
so much you guys watch his wigs actually
very easy to manage the last night war
it was back in April I think it's really
cute style I wore like sleek and
straight and it gets really sleek and
straight and then I had like two little
space bugs in the front you know such
cute while you guys you have no idea I'm
actually really pissed off that the
laptop was stolen because I had edited I
tend to do my voice my voice over and I
was procrastinating on that but um yeah
this would you do a lot of styles with
it because that style I had a middle
part and it look you know just natural
this one she's gonna insert pictures of
that style right into my snapchats I
noticed a day and I found some some
insert pictures of the same leg two
different style to show you guys the
versatility but this link was very easy
to work with I detected like really
something this would leave your
situation and so here I am just putting
black hairspray on my baby hairs to make
it blend with the hair a little better
because the hair is darker than my
natural hair and so yeah I spent a lot
of time finessing that and I had a loose
in the background faint oh that looks
good oh that looks good
patience know it but um yeah this is
pretty much um the finished style for
the most part I'm just going to go back
and just like you know perfect a few
pieces but I was pretty much was going
for you know wild kind of carefree curls
not too carefree but I didn't want them
look too uniform and then to get rid of
that warned you look I took up concealer
and just put up on my part I know you
guys are probably like stressing over
that I know I was but um all you mental
concealer and then it gets rid that
orangie brassy look I really even start
toning but yeah once I did my hair I was
done with the look Wolfe wait that's a
lie in like 10 seconds I'm going to add
more highlight give me like one second I
was just running my fingers through my
hair because I was like in love with how
it looked
buddy I popped earrings you know now I'm
a concept and I'm I just added some more
highlight on because I just really load
this highlight a lot and then I realized
I forgot
thanks spray and so I use my own gql
second spray the name of this we
definitely expect forget what shade this
is and after I set my face that's when I
was down to look and I'm in about 10
seconds you're going to see some pretty
fire slo-mo and if you enjoyed this
