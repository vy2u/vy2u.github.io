welcome so I in Finland what the favors
I don't have an hour these in like a
while the thing of it but months go by
so fast can I believe are in July APA
it's like we're Dan your past past year
yeah what the seven-mile on my
oh yeah it's July this is my favorites
from last month a Katy tune that I'm
using work some becomes active things I
like the most
during June so first things first I have
in my hand is this it's on the box okay
so this is creamy gloss call first away
soft and cost less appeal now I've heard
about this in March I was in Vegas
shopping the back story I thought was a
cool I want it I think I don't know the
woman to turn it off but I bought it and
then when i was leaving Vegas on the
plane I don't know what happens but I
pretty much lost it well I thought I
lost it and so we get out in Vegas maybe
let's publish after that know who after
that I don't another mask store and buy
it again and then I music like a mom and
then I find the one that I saw a lot so
I have two Z's I don't know whatever it
is I like blues more fine one to suppose
he doesn't know that goes but I use it
very very often of its likes my favorite
an agreement with a hit town this one I
used so much any already like it is
under radius Riesling world mascots that
I'm not going to be ruled on said even
know who's existed but I think they're
great as we have panic was $17 for
somebody like me like not too expensive
and I've looked at laughs I got
considerably a long time it's almost a
chapstick but a gloss but like it gives
us a high Sheen that's been time and you
guys know I like very very glossy and
like she lips so that is the one I'm a
monkey baby mess up its spin birth
now you guys I'm looking real they're
sponsoring this video well look it for
just click away it's not sponsored
because they send me this one but are
gonna have these two because I work with
them before meaning I like them a lot I
work damn for like almost two years I
was working with them I like 20k on
Instagram do the math that's 100
35 cables and I'll just talk about my
scripts because I really liked every guy
says no maybe there's no I will offer
furnaces because no need you've noticed
I work in fragrances I could sell them I
can work I feel more they know that
they're wearing that come with I spend
smelling great assistant perfumes and
colognes I really love this so let
me talk about so the first rings I ever
got from Stanford and he's come like
this they come apart like you can change
them um I got quite handy and devices
all thought I'd use it all and you want
to right after I finished it music
server I walk around a champion so
that's why I think temper is great
because my friend next showing Prada
candy but if you know any but Frances
you know that different thing smells
good and battles people ever has a
different pH style so you never know
what's going to work the best for you so
since ERISA pretty much try new
fragrances every single month that's why
they become part because they sing you
feed every single month interest in you
annuities Zeppelin that's kind of
wasteful so those in your the noodle
glass file each month menu just switch
them out like a clearly switch these two
out right now and they all fit in within
that piece of hair they all fit into
another but what's different it's cool
because if you never know what brings
going to work for a few songs so you can
try for any customers see if you like it
and if you don't you don't get into do
you get it I bought prior to Andy that's
one of my biggest Prince Tuesday's on
this month they send me this rule by I
don't want me to cause these little to
be dinghies and this is McShane white
they have other colors like blue and
like pink I don't know why I went
between me to paint your colors but
what's cool and this is this is a
fragrance Narciso really great room
readers I was out I was being this is
the name right but it's for her or call
it and it's made of friends now this one
I haven't I just got it so it's like
dinner school but I haven't use it that
often is really strong like I get
probably take this this rubber iris oh
 alright need to smell this from
rubbing a lid on your wrist clips very
very strong is bit selling fragrances
smell good
but I was
then you spray on you and you smell it
for a while but the entire space away
but other people who smell as if you
can't endemic agents at all you'd ever
know how come in this fragrances when
you smell that you smell yourself the
whole day I love the fur traders like
that I defer fragrances that Lake I
forgot to have it on - so tell me are
you sold up your mind okay I just bring
all your days I hope making sense but oh
yeah I got this one this month and next
month I watch is different when I can't
yeah this is the first for this month um
personally I was not finished because
really strong
however IV knows that these little
bottles in last you a very long time my
part cannula lasted a month because I
believe like crazy my see one lasting
about two and a half months pushing
three I've looked a strong enough radius
less he'd use a longer last year so I
mean I mean that's pretty cool and they
have a little beyond every single phrase
in Topeka they have a one selects for
250 plus phrases of colognes and
perfumes oh yeah I left inferred I've
definitely something to try out honestly
they didn't even have a supposed to mean
working or we talked about it with a
tiny little videos in mind where I
actually have been dismembered and they
have no idea of it and it wasn't
specifically realize them by using
friends I dream of you I talked about
the sort of love so loss the next
product because I don't want to talk
your ears off at a paper here effective
now nesting is this tea now that's why I
think again interested being more
sponsors and thing as if you guys they
did swap into a post for gonna knock
sponsor aging this video and it tell
them I'm issues in the video because I
really think that I'll pay for every
type of deal I personally like it so I
thought about out more talk about this
inserts Instagram teens in general and I
have a lot of things on that kind of
stuff I'm gonna share with you guys now
this skinny misty on this t2 so tell me
feel like less bloated and completing
more energy which it does it doesn't
make you feel like you're excites
you in the old series but it does give
you more energy and makes me feel like
less but will you show that commie
feeling a drink it is for my taste
I got an example also but think of it I
want some of these teas because I
it sucks that these companies make
 everybody wrote it because it
makes people think that they don't work
and that's kind of annoying because in
what they do people like myself you can
say goodbye to because you see
everyone in the boss moment and
it's like bad you get and you know that
I'm drinking it's so obvious when
they're peep out it doesn't the bad
events the little clear cover doesn t is
an open and it the post can be a month
apart and the T line is still right here
I didn't set up but I look and so it's
Saturday because it's actually a really
good team and you won't even know it's
good if this is good because you see
your favorite local every mornin and
it's like you know realize riggity I've
seen celebrities moments he is lucky
park with no teapot and cup around them
and somewhere you're going to drink it
we're even going to make a seat it makes
no sense sorry I'm triggered but I like
to see I feel like it I actually you
know that's not right and I don't have
too bad I'm going to be showing it but I
finished it up I slice MIT okay and I
know like a melting it work I I love
tape it takes he'll the only thing this
team doesn't have much flavor sauce of
mixing with all my other tea and I
haven't here just to show you the video
I just I like to see a lot it tastes
like raspberry I mean really good tea I
mix these two together in order to some
flavor black committee has natural
flavor if you have analysis is just some
people will probably never buy it
because they see if you like being leaf
moment and like other people that you
know aren't drinking it and I think it's
so misleading I think that that I
thought companies also they think that
they are good at marketing they don't
realize they're not when you get when a
company gets almost rights most
same thing they think oh yeah they're
going to buy it
everyone's drinking it but we being
close I think a right I'm coming here to
that they're paying people to wrote this
tea they're trying to get our favorite
people to show their dream so we could
buy it and we're not buying it like it's
not conducive at all that's my personal
opinion but I don't
that I firstly let's vitamin T awesome
do a beautiful a long time ago but they
ever asked me I'm not with that new is
not gonna make me say let us say you're
not going to say when you always say if
I'm with the middle to make this video
and give me some time to drink the tea
we're should have forced me and drinking
on his pain so I never do I'm never just
admitted for them but even though they
didn't believe me I will create I
couldn't let your tea it's really good
maybe feels that it gives me absolute
severity same skin even teeth so you
could choose which everything you want
to buy a flat you see I've got a flavor
but let me see you have to let you look
a little draining thing where this key
comes in is almost tea bags it's more
convenient and quicker so how much you
guys choose but those messed up next
thing is this cable I don't know you're
like why candles by random but I love
candles together peacefulness snapchat
you know that I'm a candle court over I
love candles I love it at t.j.maxx
we have in that market been robbed this
is $7.00 who is well so did I own a
Michigan oh I only own tell me okay
there anywhere I have one over and we'll
get a one's own Bible paper right there
I have so my cabinet and extra stock
because I'm as I know I'm running out of
my candle candle smoke really really
good it's comical luau in spite of
easily home Allison we know they are
never seen before with Marshalls and so
these candles sword that you guys know
when you smell candle die so we're going
to candle shop - I just love fragrances
is all kind of pay I want to dig tea you
know city you know you know the teach
pride that money but notice teak you
know they're really serious about about
their candles so I know a lot of candles
um I'm Ken let's rope am friggin
expert
but kennel they can be very misleading
signal and make like you know be small
candles first of all the Sydney smell is
here usually is it but the truths in God
I mean I read into that that's what
that's like lets me technical
cables like higher candles but usually
when you smell this pin it could smell
really good but you don't know if you're
about a candle in
this is you fire and burning don't smell
anything five notes I would never buy
pants for my kids because I can't be
noticed and keep all the candles they
have handle a candle on that each other
so when you walk by I guess you smell
that because of the hundred candles of
course you smell it but you go home you
burn it it doesn't know if anything that
is my personal experience they don't
touch anything
they're variously even so a lot of
candles they make more become a little
bit of the burdens you can't smell
anything at all don't come with this
channel so these channels actually have
a lot of fragrance um the second
carburetor but after like five ten
minutes you could already smell it so
identity they're worth it
I love this I recommend them you want
your apartment or house it's noise mine
keep the candle in general opinion it's
doesn't build things I want business to
prolong I'm going to have next month
talks warm up so is this blend Lindsay
I'll meet Lindsay Lohan this is the
Canon thirty-five millimeter it's one -
eats you out into the links at office QC
anyway the next strategy got into an
email but I have to swim up QC enough
CBC kind of cheap and I was not dropped
six and I Drive all in one setting TV is
perfect lesson gloves our channel and
all instant you all come on another
video because I have any already by
critics the quality is terrible but some
of it another one like some do tube and
helping you guys but cute it's perfect
if you don't either yield water gel cool
Miami or you look at Ellen money at the
time on onion counselors time about this
and so I'm making monthly payments on
one sixteen six month detain at the 1/16
and so it will express it out and I mean
it's cool out of the notice out came
since she likes and they're 700 furlings
because of pain Felix split up in six
months and it gives me more time at home
with the money and I was don't have
stress about so I like this lipstick for
beauty videos I'm going to switch it off
and show you guys how to look is show
you their secular denim so let me switch
wait one sec so I put the way that we
see I'm going do min on closer this lint
this is close as far as gift you have to
move your tripod if you want before the
way from you it is not being
like you know you can't do this and do
that maybe it's like you know further
and closer this was just what it is so I
first you the different beauty videos
not other videos if you can't really see
much and I don't know much chocolate to
be too far away from a product control
things on it and so let me give you the
example and exactly those all right
let's see you little to work but yeah
this is all you guys see what a fun
three how it wears me out and it's so
strict analyst off and that ticket away
and it zooms back on visas that a great
view squirrels because once I hair up
quite the body that is great for these
tutorials because you want for the
products like most teenagers you exam
Austin who is movie going to the room
takeaways you're back on your face and
it just is really really great I love
this place um and i'ma show you I the
difference I'm going to push that mother
went off of show you guys I like this I
was low Roman I asked this to my work
banks to finance or want this one this
in action Jabari one and is a can zoom
in EFS 18 by 20 millimeter owl eyes
invited via home where he got it from

cheetahs prices I'll put a link between
the low but I'm sure as well as I like
this with I just showed you analyze this
month actually recommending inch on QVC
Filippelli you could come and give
without having chocolate money
I think hello a lot oh I'm just put this
lid don't show you guys more like it too
alright so back to the first one man
have any on far away um I'm sure you
guys I'm so weird I can do all
the link all to my face just like that
and it doesn't pretty well now I'm gonna
tired an exact angle of where I lost
earlier let's see this in order to put
the same with walking to the screen now
ill focus on it but not as crisp and
clean as the other way as you can see
and it kind of goes back to me pretty
fast Michael to other lens a done job at
worries like it knows that resulted this
was pretty close as well but I don't
know
and use them for a while so that would
look more crisp and clean you guys told
me best in my personal opinion let me do
this back out trust to be back in my my
where Bob would but yeah I think looking
with our this one's sitting for hair
details because with hair he doesn't
want is going to list at all that extra
stuff and I used on when to fill my
little video for this government book as
well
I cannot go a little book with that lens
I could still be a shuttle sauce like
please my tripod very empowering for me
so I like this lens for more like what I
want you to see more not less than then
from what I want you to school personal
seen offers the business so that's why
