taught me this trick on how to make my
highlight pop she'll be she I think she
planned I made a video about seems I
won't even give it away but it's legit
cuz like my goal is every minutes right
before anyways welcome back to my
channel you guys if you're a new welcome
this visit be a monthly favorites video
plus clarifying the rules of my giveaway
because the last video I post on my
giveaway um it was until I got this one
comment i me realized that like my rules
are stupid they weren't stupid but they
weren't really clear and I'm sorry for
that
so stay tuned and in this video and I'll
like go over everything so they're clear
but um monthly favorites let's do this
it's my first one so hopefully I'm doing
it right I'm just gonna assume that you
pick out what you'd like for the month
and you talk about it so first product
gonna grab over here first product is a
perfume this is fancy by Jessica Simpson
if you have this tell me because I mean
you probably do this smells really good
look I just sprayed myself a minute ago
so I won't spray it again but this
review is bad for very very very long
time because I have an older sister who
actually got this perfume one year on
Black Friday and she got a set she got
the perfume I roll a ball in a lotion
and ever since then I loved it but I
back then it's like perfume like that
was a lot of money back then but then
one day I was like Ross yes Ross Ross is
legit you guys like I never I hadn't
been in Ross I'm like oh I don't even
know but we went there and I was like
Ross like they will get into another
video
I'll find you like a Ross blog cuz I'd
be going crazy but anyway they hadn't
seen Ross for $20 and I was like oh yeah
I'm getting it but I was kind of mad
because they had marched for like 15 so
if you don't get this good of Marshalls
cuz I mean save $5 we like saving here
anyways nonetheless
perfume is awesome um how do I describe
the flavor
I mean flavor think about food how do I
describe the scent it's like you gotta
go smell it it's it's perfect I'm very
picky cus perfume so I thought the lot
of them are too floral and I I mean it
has to have the right amount of floral
spices so
I want to waste my time to explain this
because I really can't but go smell it
it's worth it it's beautiful if you're
like Flowerbomb my Viktor and Rolf you
probably like this because they're kind
of same family in my opinion it's my
opinion okay next thing how many items
were supposed to do in these videos I'm
going to like not that many alright
shampoo conditioner now this is my
violet era
I actually did a sponsored video for
them but with all spots of products I
get like it's not like a thing where I
use it one time for the video and I stop
using it like no dude like I'm gonna
keep you safe to see if I love it okay
and I really love these and I love the
mass that comes with this series I just
used it all so I threw where the tube so
I can't show it in the video but it's
awesome
these are $10 each of Sally's so that's
super duper duper duper inexpensive it
smells great I like it because I feel
like it really is damaged care my hair
is really damaged got a wig on this
isn't mine
my really hair is really damaged doesn't
mean it curly anymore so I noticed I
when I started using these they're just
beautiful you know and I really love the
mask the mask my all-time favorite I
just feel like when you use a certain
product it's good to use the whole
entire family it's like like it works
the best so they have a second monthly
favorite I mean it's probably gonna be
like every monthly favorite cuz I'm not
gonna stop using them cuz they're so
cheap like wow alright next monthly
favorite it's just the Goss really
simple this buxom gloss in the shade
Sophia you guys know well if you don't
know if you know me I love buxom glosses
they're awesome they plump your lips
not that I need that I just like the
tingly feeling and uh just they're just
they're amazing like it's like $20 for a
gloss and even now it's a lot of money
because I'm really cheap I don't like
spending money but if I could spend 20
hours and gloss you kicks
I'm extremely cheap when I first start
trying this gloss like four years ago I
used to always look and this is back
when they had them in the tube they put
them in this form now but these having a
tube goes to floor and I'll get a sample
the same gloss
every some time I went I would not buy
the gloves I got a sample every single
time until I got my financial aid check
when I was in college for like one
semester and then I decided to buy it
because I felt rich but favorite gloss
this is shade selfie it's like a perfect
everyday gloss I have it on right
on top of my lipstick so it's just it's
perfect it's it's perfect and if you
want one that's move shimmery there's
just one clap sugar and house like a
more like shimmery Sheen to it but
honestly they're all awesome check them
out
best class ever buxom if you're watching
this please sponsor me cause like I love
you and I won't even charge alright next
monthly favorites now visit two products
to the by the same brand wait knowing
yeah three but like they're by the same
brand so same stuff and this is stuff
from the nubian bar now I have their oil
makeup remover you can't release it in
the screen cuz the gold is like reflect
the light but this has even oil argan
oil jojoba oil now I've been used to
remove my makeup in it you guys will see
it and might get unready with me because
I kind of like um you to omni products a
lot of oil base and i don't know why i
just i've been used a lot it would be
based products lately but this truly
gets rid of all your makeup like all of
it and here's how I test it I wore
benefits they're real mascara when I
first got this is okay yeah even get rid
of makeup but kind of really really
really really really get real makeup and
one of the hardest things to get rid of
it's benefit they're real mascara I'm
gonna get us heard I'm pretty sure you
have it's like a really popular mascara
but that mascara is awesome but I
literally will avoid wearing it because
it's like I hate taking it off because
it won't
it's like waterproof how do I think they
promote its waterproof I'm not sure I
don't even know but it's so hard to get
off
it's an it's one of those mascaras that
you wear one day and then you wash your
face in the next day when you put a
mascara on your mascara won't really pop
because it's still leftover residue from
the mascara that's the mascara doesn't
so I use this take it off and you
actually took it off and I was okay you
know it you cooled me because and if
take off their real is it's it's pretty
real in my opinion so oil makeup remover
you got to see it in my next video or my
next get ready unready with me video so
I won't jock it too much but I have to
jot these lashes then I've been a same
brand and they're perfect they're
literally perfect like I'm gonna go
totally emulsion
because you guys you guys know I'm not a
last person I know I'm not wearing
lashes right now I have mascara on I'm
not a mess I'm not a last person because
lashes they irritate my eyes even if a
ban is too thin and so it's difficult
putting the last honor but ban is too
thick so they're gonna come to my eyes
but I love these and I have two pair one
is Juno and one is Serena and I were
these uh ladies wait yesterday yeah I'll
insert a picture but the ban on these
lashes is what makes you loving the most
because I'll show you they're perfect
they're literally perfect and I freaking
love them I wish I could find a
drugstore dupe but I haven't been able
to because usually drugstore flashes
they have them they have a pretty thin
ban I don't know I'm not a fan of thin
bands it makes it harder to put on but
their last band
it's like focus see how it's not thin
but it's not the ear you guys say that
it's like because they're made like this
it makes it so much easier to put on and
they feel so comfortable like I could
wear them all day anyone who knows me
knows that whenever I lashes I end up
rip them off within like two or three
hours because they just irritate my eyes
my eyes are already naturally sensitive
as it is they're sends it to light gets
into everything so I'm very picky when
it comes to lashes and yeah I just I
really love these a lot you know let me
close it like I know I knew I love these
when I took them off and actually trying
to put them back in the case because a
lot of lashes I have I have a lot of
lashes you know and I don't I don't
really wear all that most of my last
boxes are new but a lot of left I had
I'll wear they'll take them off and I
like put them on like a dresser or and
you know I'll just pretty much put them
anywhere because I don't care about them
and I'm gonna lose them or Vanna
dripping but these ones whenever I wear
then I come back to the box because I
actually value these lashes and they're
just I really love them and I appreciate
them a lot you know lashes it's crazy to
think that I actually like these cuz I'm
extremely picky with lashes I hate them
alright I have two more things cuz since
I've been talking for ten minutes that I
don't want this meal to be super long
next thing this brow Wiz vansice Beverly
Hills just in the Shay don't got a piece
of hair on it my
gets everywhere Oh God we've life
anyways this is Broadway's manses
Beverly Hills and this is shade
everything now I have every single shade
but Evan isn't my favorite because it's
like I used a used chocolate dark brown
because they're warmer brown so I learn
because Evan is darker you have to use
you can use less product and still get
that really nice brow and it's it's I
just really love brow Wiz now honestly
there's some dumb sites abroad was nuts
it doesn't last that long if you use it
every single day consistently lasts
about like a month maybe a month and a
half depending on what you use but the
ebony scopes lifelike evidence has been
lasting me longer than chocolate and
dark brown has has lasted me because you
use less of evany because it's darker so
if every one of my brow is I would
recommend maybe getting a shade that's
slightly darker than the one you usually
use because you'll be more light handed
with it and you'll use less so it'll
last longer
yeah that's a pretty good tip ah I think
that's good too but I love this good
pencil last thing cuz my camera's dying
so we've gotta hurry up now I don't know
if I've ever seen someone do this in a
monthly favourites video I'm going to
you and it's kind of dry right now so
don't mind it but it's a wig okay this
is my favorite wig for the month of
October and you guys see this you know I
I did a video cutting this it's it's
it's beautiful islands in a picture
right here this is my favorite width for
the month of October because it was so
it was just so easy to wear you know
like honestly I like that kind of dried
out I didn't really take too much time
doing my hair kind of look that's why I
don't really like put too much product
in this wig because I kind of like the
natural curls I'll let it do it I'll let
it do its thing but I I talked about
this wig and you guys know I'm I wore it
oh my god this was like my go-to wig
like film or take pictures every single
days so maybe you guys didn't see it but
whenever I'm gonna go to the corner
store or somewhere quick and put the wig
on it's easy it's a it's a closure so
I'm not too worried about really the
party because it's just the middle part
so only option I have has a very simple
elastic band on that's very comfortable
it doesn't give me a headache it's just
yeah this is totally my favorite month
favorite wig of October so it
to be in my monthly favorites because
yeah I started doing that with my wigs I
have so many wigs it's like but there's
some I just go to continuously
continuously cumbersome that's my
favorite and this is October favorite so
yeah alright so now that we're talking
about here though let's just transition
into me clarify my giveaway rules you
guys already know I'm giveaway bundles
um don't have those bundles on me but I
post a picture on Instagram I'll set it
right here I'm giving these bundles and
Anna said in my last video I take down
for whatever one hour choose I'm open to
make it a wig for you now you didn't get
the bundles if you want in the closure
and you know get get its own in do what
you gotta do however if you wanna if I
made by me I'll totally do it ya know I
think it's nice I think I'll be having a
nice thing to do for you guys since
you'd be my videos you shouldn't we love
all that stuff it's a way of me showing
love that now rules that I do not
clarify I said the game would be for the
month I did not mean that the giver run
all month okay I don't even know like
I'm sorry it came off that way I
wouldn't wait a whole month for bundles
what I meant to say that I want to do
these giveaways every month that's what
I was trying to say now this give it run
from November 4th November 18th November
4th is why I made my Instagram post so
if your interview already good my camera
died anyways I'll say the giveaway run
from November 4th to the 18th all you
have to do is of course we subscribe to
me and follow me on Instagram and I
asked you guys tag one or two friends
are new to the post the owners why did
that ways because the last time I did
the giveaway I asked people to leave a
comment down below underneath the video
and I thought like those very difficult
picking the winner that way because um
it will just I can't explain it I just I
didn't like that method so I said you
know just tag one two friends and I'll
just look through the Instagram post
it'll just it's easier to look at the
Instagram post and to look to the
through the YouTube comments because
with my youtube comments I have it set
up to where I have to approve all the
comments and everything is just it's
much the more difficult on YouTube than
it is on Instagram which is why I said
tacker one two friends I would have said
leave a comment down below in the
picture but then you get those people
who leave paragraphs and they spam you
and I didn't really want that either and
I
having any people that have been spam in
the comment section you know tagging the
same people over and over like three
times and I will say that is not
increase your chance of winning I think
it's kind of unfair to do that because I
know people do that you know so they
show up the most but it's like I want
this meat fair to everyone I want to be
to see everyone while I look through and
pick the winner so don't do that just I
have to just comment once you still be
there you'll still matter just I want I
will actually be the CI people - I don't
want I can't see the same name for 30
comments in a row that's not there in my
opinion so don't do that you don't have
to do it I'll see you do not worry but
that's very much it for this video I
hope it wasn't too long and hope you
guys enjoyed it if you guys like this
setup where I'm in front of my makeup
let me know um I just I don't know I
felt like my plain white wall was kind
of boring so I decided to move my camera
and film it in front of this of course
I'll set up making more pretty next time
like the other bloggers do you but this
will do for now so if you guys liked it
let me know and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
