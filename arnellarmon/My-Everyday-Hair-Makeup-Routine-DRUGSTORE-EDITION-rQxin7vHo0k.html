you're new welcome so Jays videos went
to be on a super affordable drugstore
everyday makeup look I mean please look
I have right here I honestly do the same
makeup look every single day so I
decided to do the look I typically do
which is like my signature glossy lip
kind of like glowy
but like semi matte skin but I'm used on
drug store products this video is
sponsored by kiss and so I used a lot of
kiss products and Ruby kisses products
in this video to create this look so if
you want to see my god in the continued
watch and all the products I use will be
down below like always and I mean like I
always say if you like this video thumbs
up subscribe all that good stuff
and I'll see you guys later so it's
prime my skin I'm going to take the Ruby
kisses never touch up good bye pores
primer this prime is actually really
good my makeup literally lasted the
whole entire day so you can see I'm
taking my Ruby kisses concealer I've
actually used before if you have been
tried in my channel for a while you've
seen this on my channel before but I
bought two new ones you know because I
ran out of my other ones and taking two
shades
although the lighter shade I could have
used it by itself I just didn't think it
was the right color because the tube
looks lighter than actual concealer and
so I just apply that to the usual place
I conceal and highlight and I blend that
out with my sponge
well after I blend out my concealer I'm
going to take my 3d face creator but
Ruby kisses now if you subscribe to my
channel so I very first started YouTube
then you've already seen this product
I've always use product it's one of the
best products to use to contour and to
no bronzer face up
I actually purchase a lot of the Ruby
kisses products I used in this video I
love this a sponsor I purchased a lot of
this stuff because I mean I love it so
to set the plates I conceal I'm using
this set and forget for said and forget
powdery kisses it was my first time
using this powder but it actually works
really good now when I first put it on I
thought I looked a little too yellowy
but after I set my entire face my
foundation powder it's like perfect
I underestimate this powder because it's
set perfectly and I promise you like my
concealer do not move so inside my
entire face I'm using su because mineral
powder
I've already owned this powder before
you guys have seen use it and both my
makeup and hair videos cuz I use this
powder to conceal my parts so for my
eyes I'm going to take this sad kiss
lipstick and it's actually a newbie down
below it's just as brown shade I decide
to use as a base now this would account
better if I took more time blending if I
applied maybe like one or two more
layers to darken the color however I
plan on using this Ruby kisses contour
kit in order to you know if the Messiah
look I choose to variety of the contour
shades in this palette I want to go for
a very look washed out brown brown eye
look because usually on an everyday
basis whenever I do do a little shadow I
just do a very basic Brown that way it
looks like I really like put effort into
my eyes when I actually didn't so um
yeah I just decide to do that
so I'm done my eyes I go over with my
powder brush and then I'm going to
contour my face using that same palette
had to snatch my cheekbones I do that
every single day because I need we need
to snatch jawline and chi so we could
look up cheese little one not so got to
do that it's a highlight I'm using all
over face slippery kisses like I said
I've boned a lot of these before so in
order to get the pigment to really show
up you kind of describe the surface
because when you first open these and
they're brand new the surface is almost
too smooth to pick up the product so you
kind of use your finger and scratch the
surface in order to like really get the
color and the pigment to pay off so
that's what I was doing in order to kind
of get this to show up better on top of
that I'm going to take my kiss halo
strobing palette and I'm just going to
use a few of these shades in order to
intensify my highlight just a little bit
more
it's for brows I'm gonna take this kiss
brow pencil now this is my favorite part
of this whole tutorial because this brow
pencils so good
I bought up the abuse most over my house
I think I paid like seven eight dollars
for it something super affordable and it
works like the Anastacio brow is but for
like you know how much less like fifteen
fourteen dollars less than that so it
worked really really good I was super
impressed by this brow pencil because
you guys know like drugstore brow
products they're always a hit or miss
for the most part they're always a miss
so the find out this was a hit was
awesome now to conceal my brows will
clean them up I'm gonna take my room
because concealer I used earlier I'm
just gonna clean my brows up
her lips I'm taking that same brown
lipstick I used earlier and I'm gonna
put that as a base first and then I'm
gonna put a gloss on top so the first
class I used I should have used by
itself I didn't think this lipstick was
let me still pigment on my lips and
these cloths of everybody kisses and so
um these two together it was too dark
for me for like my everyday look you
guys know I typically do like a brown
liner with a super glossy lip now let's
do dark for me so I patted some of that
off and I took another gloss which is
more like on the clear side and I put
down top and that was more of like you
know my everyday type of look mascara
I'm taking the Subic it's a super
mascara now on this mascara was okay I
think it would look better it feels
black because like from my view from my
mirror it looked like it was making my
lash look really nice however this is
the brown sheet I don't know why I
picked Brown and so uh it just wasn't
popping do I wanted to but I used some
eyebrow so I mean that worked out and
last but not least I'm going to take
that highlight shade to kind of put it
in my inner tear flappy things like I
always do then I'm gonna set my face
really fast and that is it for makeup
hair first I'm taking my kiss argan oil
I love this stuff I take off my headband
and you know just rub that all through
my hair I just straighten my hair this
day so had to put some oil and you have
to see how nice this oil makes my hair
look at in this video I'll point it out
for you guys because it makes it look
all shiny and cute now I'm gonna take my
edge fixer I shoulda showed you at the
top Milo has chewed all over this and so
I will lay my edges
I lost my freakin edge toothbrush you
guys really liked em in my previous how
to lay your edges video I don't know
what happened to it I literally lost it
I'm so upset because it's like whenever
I really like something I lose it but I
know I'll find it you know it'll come up
soon later so I lay my edges and I
decide how I do my hair so I decided I
wanted you know half-up half-down that's
pretty simple so I get a rubberband and
I tie half my hair up and then you know
I perfect my edges a little more
and then I take my flat iron and I kinda
like bump my little ponytail just so it
looks more you know better I don't know
the word and I bump the ends of my hair
too
then I take a little bit hair on the
sides guys this makes this style look
much cuter and then I have my hoop you
guys know I always have to add my hoops
you know once I'm done I like it was
linked together and I have to do that
that is the complete look my everyday
hair and makeup look it's so cute I love
it when I turn to the side
people shiny and healthy and beautiful
my hair looks is that argan oil look at
that oh alright so if you drew this
video thumbs up subscribe all that good
stuff and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
