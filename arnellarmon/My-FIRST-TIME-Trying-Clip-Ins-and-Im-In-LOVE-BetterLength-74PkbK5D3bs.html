hair this going to be a video of me
starting my hair using a Fulton Clippers
for the first time ever this video will
become a Lindsay because I struggled you
guys I really struggled by deciding to
cut out those parts because I mean
honestly I never want to make it seem
like what I do is hell easy and super
perfect it's not I struggle to and so I
solutely like every single tick on me I
include everything so if you want to
learn how to do clip ins especially if
your hair texture more that's inner side
and this will be very helpful question
you guys how did you do different stuff
to make the clintons actually stick in
your hair and so yeah that is clipping
they're from Thailand hair on their
spikes specializes and clip in for women
of color and they have a whole range of
textures they recommend that I try the
key curly based on my curl pattern so
keen curly specifically made for 3b is
three-seat curls I've never actually had
my curl pattern or type identified so I
might make sure but I'm assuming it's
either through via greasy with of these
clippings with perfectly with my natural
hair texture so that's very convenient
all the Clippers been with a - human
hair and based on how acting when I
detangle zit and when my condition I
believe that it really acted behaves
like natural curly hair and ass in my
hair
in my opinon actually accept rid of the
dry facts in my hair to my hair be
drying out super fast and all that
tracks I mean they're little less are
all double wefted but without super
thick and bulky which is what I notice
they lay very flat and surprisingly
they're very easy to conceal mind I'm
more concerned with doing the style was
bad when I got to the top my hair would
be too thin and it wouldn't cover the
tracks or the West and I should have a
trick on how to cover that as well but
the wet aren't super bulky it sticks so
my nephew covered it just fine I mean it
looks perfect how much I just watched
video came to because either those
prevent kid was ever tried or for better
than others because it's my first time
use equipment so I couldn't accurately
say that I sure the hair looks really
nice and I trust the company based on
what they have fitted me I definitely
recommend it watching assistance if you
have really kinky or curly hair but as
far as then you know be better than
other clip inbred I can't say that I'm
honestly I've never done Clippers before
Solyndra's Leslie
nassim you struggle a bit and then
doesn't see me come up with this cute
little hairstyle right here as you live
you place your thumbs up please
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
maxvill today IM going to trying out
clip in irise my curl pressure my
haircut let it sit because I didn't
wanted to be too wet but I also don't
want me to drive so I'm going to get
started I'm kind of nervous because I've
never done stripping before I mean I
tried clipping it into my hair already
but I never like for a full set of
clipping so these equipment different
better live hair it comes in the bag it
did have a little spring on it but I cut
it and it comes wrapped up as if it's in
a bundle but like I said I try these
already but I'll explain why I can do
can I try them and so yeah I come to
little pieces like then it make much
comes with two clips with money counting
I'm pretty sure I remember but I want to
I want to be wrong so come to to pieces
with five clips on them languages and
then I get two pieces Brooklyn like this
or I make sure like so and then you get
two pieces with three crisp and then you
get four pieces that come with two clips
and one if I sit with my Vista prima but
they all have to quit so one is the
longer see how this one's slightly
longer but they both have two clips on
them so why don't I do this so I've
already checked put into my hair and
kind of difficult because one detected
and matched that well and also on my
hair it's so hard to get things to grips
because it's very silky like and so I'm
going to do is when I go and I'm going
to try to loosen up this curl pattern
I'm going to go rinse these icons wash
them with conditioners to get this
proton I kind of loose because it's
super duper kinky the third pinky curl
and then I'm going to see if I put them
into my hair
I'm not sure I saw wanna do yet I'll
move on to like a half a pest down but I
don't know if I'm valid experience of
quits and just yet by little bit like
rinse these conditioner so just lose the
patter a little bit and I'll be right
back
as I went and pretty much condition my
hair and finger tangled it and this is
looking like now looks much better when
sweat I was dry it looks a little bit
drier side I mean kind of my father
tangles because it quits all those place
in the back but this looks really pretty
when sweat so now that pop into it
because I don't have to dry out and get
dry
I mean use machine moisture coat
enhancing Suzy well using this because I
mean I bought more products for my
actual hair so when we use this I'm
action here anymore I'm pretty done this
I suppose saturated product that way
when it dries down it's not too poufy
because my hair is there only poofy want
to drive down so I want to get this to
match my natural hair texture as much as
possible all right now another reason
why I struggled you want my hands yeah
another reason why I struggled with this
clip it because they darken in my hair
color I know how you feel it's dark
right now gonna drive down it becomes a
weird light brown and so I bought this
hair spray that's black so I could spray
my hair that's exit tribally right now
so they mess with a little bit common
face not nice
come at my natural hair is smoking light
for the clip in film I was spraying a
test to see the work and look like it
will so I'll spray my hair with I solid
so now the style I really want to do
half-up half-down only I've never done I
saw before and I just let it look cute
uh uh I don't know pretty okay let's see
and I want you some dramatic baby hairs
with that for now
cool and the java.util a my edge emily
is not leavin when they already have a
whisk got a bit easier and even funny
event
alright i'm using eco styler gel on the
black cash defeat and capture see custer
black pastor flaxseed oil it smells
really good lay my edges with that it is
a very own light it's kind of annoying
if annoyed because ok they're light
because my natural hair color that a
light brown blondie color and build
annoying because that's the time where i
have died my edges to be black but for
two darts let they're not meant to be
dark so annoying
alright so clip in time I'm kind of
scared but I have some that I hope will
work alright so I'm going to part a
section in the back to do the first row
by my side my limbs making it weird
noise I'm actually bought a microphone
in order to record my audio so that you
don't hear too clicky sound of my lens I
just don't want to work it yet I was
almost told me she loves Wi-Fi that you
never got to work if I bought it anyways
so me I have to YouTube how to work it
but till then I'm sorry to do with the
clicky sound alright never clip
you know my way alright so I said
earlier my hair texture is weird like
it's hard to get things to look stick in
them because I'm just slips right out so
I ran into this thing I don't know where
kind of some I think I had like a little
goodie bag because tiny it is dry
texturizing spray so I'm going to spray
that at my roots where I'm going to put
the clip eating in and I'm hopping out
and sprayed this firm hold spritz I love
this stuff it reminds even of the kid I
just know that once you dry it it gets
very hard and so I'm going to spray that
and put this on like medium heat
I don't want to be too high and whistle
blows right right
alright see it's dry right now I'm just
gonna try a key to make my life easier I
was separating my pieces in front of me
on my desk I'm gonna put the ones with
three be sweet with each other the ones
at five those afford to separate them so
it's easier so this is back piece I
think one of the longer to pizza should
work practice it through be a little too
long so I'm going to go and just lift
the clip art in this method Alliance I
think my words could've definitely
stayed and better than the first time I
did this and I'm going to also kind of
paranoid because it let me flip out
you don't know alright so that's how
something's pretty cool I'm gonna spray
some cold spray on top of that I'm just
really trying to get this to stay so and
this is my Chi I'm gonna go back over
with a bull drive one more time
okay this seemed really in there so
we're going on the next beat
all right so now I'm going to get a
three-piece clip and I'm a dude same
process you just try to clip it we could
see all right pick the piece down kind
of put a lot more I may have to pull up
one I'm able to cut one the TP clips and
then put one of the best to sort of look
like Homer space if you to memorable
hair but I'm just honestly it's okay
during doing this I kind of came to
courage but I'm just going to fish all
the way through and see how to spin so
I'm going to speak this next part up I'm
just going to let you guys watch me do
this cover throughout focus on it and
then you will just see how it turns out
alright guys we are getting somewhere oh
I just pretty much finished the bottom
half and I'm going to do it I need to
cover those tracks right there so I'm
going to do that by parting out here
like this may ask you turned out pretty
good and we will see but it's kind of
better than is it the first time I get
to the first time I distance I don't
like oh my god I like come again do this
like I don't know like why don't you
even agreed it is okay crossing hair
cover those pieces you guys yeah the
more my hair dried the letter started
good I was talking about all right so
now love that and then tiny braids is I
try to be very gentle because I mean I
don't want that clinches slip out
I'm going to take a little bit of it
stuff a little watch it you know what no
I'm not I wanna use it I'm taking a
little gel gel for surely make it lay
down the way I want to
yes
gel works good I really don't know how
I'm Vanessa's I don't I'm still a little
piece like underneath here though I just
thought was kind of weird I don't know
if you guys know from I suppose empty
space that I'm not really feeling so
more than the cam now I'm going to take
this hairspray and kind of straight like
all over my hair and with a clip in just
so like fuse together and my hair it
also spin I'm glad you listen here me my
hair also spin so spring this will help
come to attract more and then I like
spray I'm going to get a little tooth
brushes brush through it so it's not
obvious a different hairspray there
that's let me be the spray into the
first image and it makes it look extra
obvious
really Coolio this makes me coming out
pretty nice
alright no time to do the you know I'm
gonna do you brick in space bones
because I mean why not when I do space
buns I feel like that little extender
examined before so that's what I'm going
to do I sneak scrunchies alright ones

brunches but you know I'm gonna make
some work and I feel like they'll make
my hair the blue more cool so I mean

one I'm going to tie of time I can I
thought I'm literally like this now like

love that you guys will I use clippings
begin
often probably not it was very hard to
get them to fix my hair I know there's a
product that Bellamy sells it's not the
only good thing they have um and it's
their texture like a texturized powder
because you guys know who wears Bellamy
I'm saying it do you guys know who wears
them and cause the big stadium is with
our hair so Bellamy makes a product that
gives their hair to be a certain texture
to get the clip into sticks I may have
to buy that because I know it works I
tried out my hair before but I mean if I
buy that then I'll wear a couple times I
like how my notches are out it feels
good that it's growing and it's looking
at healthy would not but I don't yell
like a stylist you guys like it two
years go Boop and thank you for watching
