take my shower I've already washed my
face using my purity face wash is only
face wash I use now first my take my
sunscreen from benefit I'll put the
actual names in description box below oh
my god oh no for your stuttering and I
just put that all on my skin because I
want to protect my skin from the evil
Sun that wants to burn all our skin and
give us a spots and all that evil stuff
no I'm joking I love the Sun but yeah I
don't want to get age spots and read
that stuff now I'm gonna take my eye
cream also from benefit I just love
benefits in Caroline no they didn't pay
me to do this I don't even know I'm
using all this in my video I'm just
use NYX I love their stuff okay so take
my eye cream I'm patting in and I'm
rubbing it I just don't want to get like
fine lines and wrinkles you know and I'm
trying to avoid the whole Botox thing so
I'm just trying to be proactive about
this stuff and if you know I would
recommend doing that too because there's
nothing wrong being proactive right now
and I put eye cream on my neck sigh it
might look like I'm in pain if it
doesn't look like it I'm telling you
right now that I was in frickin pain
because yesterday I was so determined to
film a look for you guys but the eye
shadow kept messing up so I did over six
times a bomb line is I really messed up
my eyes around my eye area they're
burning which is why I look so red
because I'm really jacked my stuff up
but you know it's okay I'll get over it
anyways after to my eye cream I
moisturize my whole face with his
benefit moisturizer and I use two
different ones this one is um more
lightweight it's like a facial emulsion
so it's SuperDuper lightweight and then
you got to see me use the other one
later on in this video as a night cream
because it's thicker so it's more
moisturizing but yeah just use all of my
face it's very lightweight and doesn't
feel sticky or heavy and now 7 hours
later here is my nighttime routine now
I'm taking my purity face wash with my
many planets spin brush I know I'm
missing the back I left that Jordan's
house so don't mind that to put them I
pour it the face wash on the little
and I did the brushes some water and I
start going in circular motions around
my skin you guys will see that I avoid
my eye area because I do not believe in
putting this brush around your eye I
feel like it pulls at the skin and it
could cause wrinkles I learned that
while working at Macy's with 90 to sell
clear Sonic's
yeah I'm kind of an expert at this after
I'm done cleaning my entire face with
this I'm gonna go back in with a little
more more moisturizer cleanser and use
my fingers to wash my eye area because
it's a very sensitive area and then go
to my bathroom and rinse it all off and
then I'll be back right now I'm back I'm
just gonna dry my face a little bit with
this towel and now I'm gonna show you
guys a mask I do when my skin is a
little bit irritated first you want to
take some grinds it up oatmeal then you
wanna take some witch hazel if you found
my snap you see me do this mask before
everyone said they loved it so I had to
include in this video now you want to
mix that up until it's like a thick
pasty consistency and then you're gonna
wanna just place it on your skin now you
might be wondering why I choose oatmeal
and witch hazel you know like since
wouldn't do oatmeal and witch hazel date
you know what it means it's when they
start talking they start talking today
no they've been talking forever um
growing up at eczema so I had to use
oatmeal in my bath in order to like
relieve my skin to soothe my skin okay
cuz my skin would get inflamed a lot
it'd be red and brassy and oatmeal
helped to calm that down now which his
was a national astringent
and it also helps relieve puffiness
around the eyes and although you can't
see it my eyes are my eyes are a little
bit puffy and they're just overall
irritated so I decided to do this mask
and it definitely helped you know it
just this mass and I love those masks we
could completely see a difference you
don't always see a difference unless
you're really red but you automatically
feel the difference and I know when I
post this on my snapchat a lot of people
went out and tried it they mesh me let
me know how much you work for them so
I'm super excited about that so I had to
include it in this video so you want to
let the mask completely dry and then you
want to wash it off in the sink and this
is my skin after the fact now my
favorite part of routine I'm gonna give
this ice roll if
manney planet the same place I get my
brush from and I'm gonna go over my face
now I didn't mention this earlier but
when I wash my face I use like warm to
hot water and that's to open up my pores
and make sure I'm really getting up in
there and really cleaning everything out
and so when I'm done I like to get an
ice roller cuz it's very cold and that
helps close up my pores and tightens my
skin Oh
after I let my face dry a little bit I'm
gonna get my total moisture face cream
by benefit now this one's much thicker
than the other moisturizer I use during
the day I like to use a light
moisturizing of the day and a thick one
at night okay to keep my skin very
moisturize when I'm sleeping and yeah
that's pretty much it you guys my spam
care routine is so simple and do not
worry I will make another video on how I
got rid of my eczema scars as well my
eczema but I couldn't include it on this
video but yeah I really hope you guys
enjoyed this I feel like we're totally a
family now cuz you guys see me like
completely bare face you know I'm
totally vulnerable but um yeah hope you
guys enjoyed this hope you learned
