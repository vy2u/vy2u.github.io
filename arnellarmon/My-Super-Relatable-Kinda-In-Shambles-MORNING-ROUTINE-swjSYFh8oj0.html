light in the back I'm fake sleeping you
guys I swear you guys I never thought
doing a morning routine would be so hard
until I did it I was like wow this is
very intense
so I'm sleeping I'm sleeping then I
stretch it out and the first thing I do
when I wake up's get on my phone like
every millennial in 2017 now you know
sponsorship but to be honest like if he
goes if I'm my social media this tech me
isn't sponsored well it is but it
doesn't feel sponsored because I am
addicted to this game best fiends I have
been playing it non-stop which is why
I'm on level 119 I'm serious about this
this is not a joke to me best fiends
based like a free puzzle adventure game
where you collect and build a team of
things to defeat slugs I'm matching the
same colored objects currently best
means having their biggest holiday
update ever with over a hundred fifty
new levels I'm currently 160 although
this film two days ago like I said I'm
serious but I played like every single
morning whenever I get a break you
filming I'm playing this game I've spent
literally $200 on this game so far but
don't ask me how I'm saying they're
having a huge holiday update you'll get
a chance to win character exclusives
like sanitary soon you'll be able to
compete to be the champion of your state
read your country honestly I just might
inter who's this the game is so
addicting and as you can see like I'm
really like I don't lose any level and
when I do I just buy more gold bars
which is why I've spent so much money on
this game but that's optional this game
is free you don't have spend money but
when you're gonna addicted to it like I
am and when you don't want to lose a
level and when you're seriously into it
you'll spend some money cuz I have I'm
just sharing my personal experience
please if you would like a two down this
game which you totally should I'm so
serious you guys you'll become addicted
I can guarantee you you can use a link
in my bottle and you get five what can I
use this link it was look at five
dollars worth of gold and diamonds for
free be sure to download best fiends
like I said although this video is
sponsored by them I've been talking
about it non-stop ever since I started
playing it and you guys know I only
recommend things I truly
love and so I want to include this this
wasn't mandatory for me to include this
in this video but I think we just love
when you beat them you get keys and so
you could open up boxes and you can get
like little those are called like meteor
mites I don't know how to pronounce what
they're called and then you can upgrade
your fiends when you upgrade your fiends
they become stronger which makes it
easier to beat the levels I get really
into this this is not a joke so here I'm
upgrading my fiends you know I have a
lot of fiends so far but I still need
some more so it makes their attacks
stronger you give really into it you'll
see just click click my bio and you'll
see exactly how addicting this game
truly is
so typically I would play about like
five to ten levels but I had to get up
so I put my phone down and now it's time
for me to wash my hands so I can't show
me something this shower and Aleeah was
helping me film this so I can you know
really get my angles but here I am you
know grab my dove hashtag talk to me and
then I'm going to grab my conditioner I
love this organics one and I'm just
gonna wash my food and conditioned my
hair always conditioned my hair in the
shower I love conditioning my hair and
so then I dry off and I step out cuz I
can't stay in the shower all day then I
grab my dirty laundry so I didn't stay
on my floor cuz Milo likes eating my
underwear and then um Here I am I didn't
know we were recording but I just kept
its income like that's what I literally
do in the mirror when I like in the
mirror and so first I grab my toothpaste
in my toothbrush and I like put my
toothbrush my mouth and I start brushing
a little bit then I pause and I kinda
see where I kind of like hold the
toothbrush in my mouth and then I put my
curly hair products in my hair while my
hair is still wet because my hair does
dry really fast so I'm using my Carol's
Daughter form when combing creme which
I'm running out of which is why I'm
struggling you know getting out of the
bottle by the way don't mind oh you
could hecka see my lens oops
anyways don't mind the lighting it was
so hard setup lighting like for this
video because it's just every room is
lit up differently but this is super
accurate you know I don't have super
high tech equipment just yet I don't
have a team so don't worry guys like one
of these days when I do another winter
routine it's all super fancy and stuff
you guys know look back to this video
like wow she really grew she glowed up
anyways now I'm putting more curly hair
products in my hair because I want
summer here semi curly my towel most
fell off a glioma see my boobs I would
have been Shem Oh but now I'm brushing
my hair um you know to make my Carol's
plum and I not put a scarf on I think
well first of all my hand a clip and I
put a scarf on later cuz I don't like
doing my hair so on days when I don't
wear wigs I just you know make sure I
really moisturize my hair and
I put insult up an updo because I just I
suck at styling my hair at this lid
I put some clothes on so I can't film
this video naked now it's gonna make my
tea and I have these tea makers Teavana
and you guys need to get on ASAP cause
Steve on its closing down just FYI we
gots they told me so I gotta like buy
one get one free so I bought two of them
and Salil was here well there we filming
and I had to hook up some tea too
so first take my tirana tea and then I'm
going to add my matcha tea from the
matcha reserve I have three flavors I
like the vanilla one I just overall like
their tea because matcha one is awesome
and two he's like really nice energy and
it's yummy it has like a really nice
vanilla flavor to it so I just add on
top of the tea I already have and these
little tea things are awesome because
you know how matcha tea usually after
like waste whiskey really good to make
it smooth these tea things have like
drainers and so it drains out any of the
graininess of the matcha but you still
get the matcha effects so it's awesome
and leaves that oh I want one matcha too
so you know I had to add some Mata to
her tea too then I add my water that I
spilled but you know hashtag totally
relatable and then I let this tea brew
for a cool little minute
so while that tea brews I take my my my
on a walk now though on this particular
day I'm gonna be honest we didn't go on
like a super long walk because we
couldn't because I was filming I can
have my camera outside for too long I
was paranoid but normal days when I wake
up after I shower I do take him on a
walk I take him on multiple walks a day
you know cuz he's a little pup and he
has a lot of energy and he has to get
out I'm still paranoid by bringing him
around other dogs he got like kind of
sick one time from being around to me
dog so he's still very young so I take
my walks and I'm he's so excited listen
he does I got this cuz he does it each
time he starts to run out the door and
then the minute we get down to like
little down area he just runs it runs
and I dropped my food but don't worry my
screen didn't crack but he runs each
time we get down there so I had to get
that on camera cuz it's super cute now
we're walking you know um he peed a
little bit he's a little pup I get so
excited he pees it just it's really cute
to be so we walk well we fit we're gonna
fake walk but don't worry you guys like
after the video was done I took him on
actual walk and then we came right back
a minute later I thought it was really
cute seeing while the leaves and stuff
and Milo loves please like its when it's
windy he likes chasing after them it's
super cute it's it's his thing he likes
doing it so so when we get back on most
days he couldn't run around the house
but because this morning we were going
to breakfast and he could know why I go
to the breakfast spot oh they pissed me
off with that he used to call me all the
time dad know where there's like he
can't be here so I had to put him back
in his crate he just takes a nap I
watched him on a little baby monitor he
just naps and then we went to breakfast
I'm putting in hella sodium on my egg I
go ham other things are salt shakers
always messed up so like it looks like
I'm putting a lot of salt on but like
it's not it's a lot of salt and I get
the same thing each time it's one of
those things where I go there and they
know exactly what I'm gonna get and by
the way I don't know why I didn't record
his drink of the tea but we drink the
tea so don't worry that the tea it was
it was drunken that's not a word it
it was consumed so you know I'd take
some shots you know me cutting my
waffles cuz I thought it looked really
satisfying and I'm diggin I'm hungry Oh
oh my god Wow Wow
hey fun fact that guy behind me like I
could tell he thought we were like
interested in recording him and we're
like dude like you're not even relevant
he was so not here for it my bad bro
after breakfast I go home and then I go
to my desk and I write out what I want
to do for that day let's not do this in
the morning but sometimes like I won't
and I'll do it right before I film and
then you know I'll edit a video or two I
just do whatever needs to be done
computer video wise and that is my
morning routine so I hope you guys
enjoyed it this was super accurate I
literally do this all the time and if
