welcome today's video I'm going to be
reviewing the new covergirl trublend
Matt made foundation I'm selling this
now
don't mind me now but look at me because
this is me end of the day it's 2:20 in
the morning and earlier when I started
this video I did not fit my intro so I
had to do it right now I'm exhausted so
imma let you guys watch this video if
you want to see why I think about this
foundation this is the foundation after
eight hours of wear so if you want to
see how I got to this point exceed watch
this video and I'm gonna sleep now or
well because watch this in the morning
anyways I'll see you guys leaving
alright guys so I have the package on my
lap it's a very very heavy I mean whoa
this has to be at least 15 pounds so
near the box I mean not like you guys
will see that obviously gonna see the
foundations I'm so scared and fall out
here's what I'll do I think Harold if I
made shades pretty cold shade range the
bottom row boxes the darkest colors the
middle row is where like the me start to
come in and the top two rows the top two
rows of a lighter sheets which I would
not be touching cuz obviously I'm not
that she alright so finding my shade I
have an idea of which I think I am I
have not openings or even touched these
because I wanted my first impressions to
be first impression so you know I want
to react on here I'm like you think oh
shoot I'm almost positive karma because
typically speaking in foundations
I'm always caramel or tan by the way
sorry my audio isn't the best so I have
a microphone this guy right here but I
used him in my other video and he was
just like he sounded worse than actual
camera so until I find a better mic this
gonna have to work I know a lot of you
guys don't complain about them as some
people have complain about
isn't the best just know I try because
this wasn't cheap bitches yeah it's
English Venetian so by the way this
package did come with 4 primers comes an
illuminating primer a pore minimizing
primer a color neutralizing powders
powder primer so if you know you filled
redness and then a skin smoothing
parameter which I'm assuming is that the
most basic one they have so I'm gonna
assume I'm Carmel Oh
so the foundation the foundation bottle
is a glass bottle and it comes with a
pump
I love and foundations of pumps and so
really creamy
I haven't feeling this in my shade I'm
almost positive it is I'm going to grab
this shade in the shade before it which
is warm Sun and I'm gonna go with the
caramel shade but in case it's a little
too dark I'm gonna mix some of the warm
Sun in so I'm these two colors so primer
I'm going to take hmm I don't know if I
have the skin smoothing they're
illuminating one but I do like to glow
so I'm to look illuminating one so
squeeze some of that out of my hand has
that kind of like a silicone II smell to
it not not so much feel but you guys
know how silicone make a problem with
primers usually smell kind of uh smell
to it not too much though
it smells like and I've seen its a non
offensive way because some of our bad
thing but it kinda the air freshener but
it's not a bad thing I don't know if
you'd want to describe and make a
product in that way but that's what
reminds me up oh yeah for sure an air
freshener now which one I don't know it
could be like glad or wick hi wherever
those names are Febreze but it and
freshener nonetheless so so applied the
primer and now time for the fun part the
part that you guys are all here for the
foundation so like I said I'm gonna
start with the caramel
this foundation has a comfort mat
formula and it's a transfer resistant so
we are going to you know do a transfer
test to see if it gives on anything but
um it doesn't really claim to do much
else besides being mat be comfortable be
oil-free and um not transfer onto your
stuff so I'm gonna take this damp Beauty
Blender that I clean by the way so it
doesn't mix many other foundations I've
used it on and I'm gonna stop blend that
onto my skin um I can't describe the
smell it reminds me it smells just like
the other foundations that I've tried um
yeah nothing special but nothing that's
like oh my god it's most terrible you
know because there's like been a few
foundations I've had that I just cannot
tell her the smell of them that's
looking like my color but it looks a
little orange e um but we're gonna blend
it all out and see what it looks like
before we make any decisions yeah she's
looking a little orange coverage wise
it's looking like it's medium to full
coverage definitely not light weight I
definitely see that it's doing a good
job covering the scar I have whenever I
do foundation tests I want to see if it
covers that scar that's like an issue
for me I don't like it there so the
cover must go I've been is pretty legit
it's
orangie I don't know if it's picking on
my camera but it's orange II like but
maybe it's just a shave so what I'm
gonna do it's interesting though because
it matches like my neck area I feel like
but in here it's a little too dark so I
men together shade because simply
speaking the perimeter of your face is
usually darker than the inside so I'm
gonna make some of the warm Sun into the
middle to kind of like you know balance
it out I could do you know conceal aside
my face and do all that kind of stuff
and I'm pretty sure they told that you
tone down but I also don't rinse that so
I'm just gonna mix a little bit in this
just to play it safe that's looking
better huh yeah I mean I can hear you
guys but yeah caramel has a more orange
e tint to it
where this one has a little more yellow
so it kind of bounces that out I should
have started with I should use majority
in this one actually a warm Sun but it's
cool because it looks good now yeah I
like that I kind of feel a tingling
sensation on my skin not to where it
feels irritated but I kind of feel it
oh I'm triggering out but it I feel it
in here
all right so that's all blends out
it doesn't look matte to me I tried
matte foundations before or did my matte
foundation those typically speaking
after you blend it out it will start to
mattify on your skin I do feel it on my
skin I think that's whether the tingling
is coming from I feel it on my skin I
don't want to call it head you know
because it's not like it's not like
what's the foundation that's super duper
heavy like the Estee Lauder Double Wear
I've tried that before I was really
heavy for my skin I felt that it's not
like that however it's not lightweight
either but it doesn't look Mac to me
like I feel like for example they went
from I think CB foundation on because
that was a little matte I think that
kind of like it's matte on my skin like
while I'm moving it down here but this
one isn't mat just yet so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna let it sit for like five
minutes you should see the kind of life
slowly mattifies and then I'll come back
to doing you don't do that they're
concealing the rest of my face I just
want to see if it you know get some
matte because that's typically what I
expect from a matte foundation just
personal preference so we're gonna see
all right so let's sit on my skin it's
definitely where I'm at it's kind of
hard to tell my camera because my lights
are harvested Korean and natural
highlight but in person it's definitely
mad it's definitely not wet looking this
is this is mat this is pretty matte and
it feels pretty comfortable too and so
you can still take this Laura Mercier
concealer I wasn't using my other
concealers but I've been using them the
same concealer in every single video so
I just just had to switch it up and you
guys see how as I apply my concealer I'm
only focusing around the eyes I take a
little bring the concealer all the way
down a triangular shape however I don't
want to mix too much into the foundation
because I really want to like where the
foundation and you know see how it just
kind of like flows on my skin I don't
want a concealer or the the formula the
concealer effect the actual foundation
but I will say that the more this dries
down the more I feel it I could feel it
when I talk if that make
innocence at all I feel it's madness it
hasn't gotten to the point where it
feels uncomfortable but I do feel it so
I'm gonna blend this concealer out with
fast try to keep it bright in my eyes I
do have a covergirl concealer however I
packed up more than half of my makeup
for my move because I knew I wasn't
using it and so it's in a box so set
this concealer I'm gonna take some Laura
Mercier powder and just set it very
lightly
now while have this powder out I'm gonna
send my entire face with that I'm gonna
do a very light layer typically speaking
out using my Urban Decay powder
foundation to set my face or my Sephora
micro smooth powder however those are
both pigmented and I don't want to
affect the color of the foundation
because I want to see monoxides there
changes colors so I'm just going to use
the translucent powder and set very
lightly
it's very matte though you really don't
have to set it too much I thought about
not setting it for this video but that I
didn't think would be fair to review a
product and do like kind of switch to my
routine so like if I'd normally send my
foundation I wouldn't set it but because
I always have my foundations I'm going
to do that you know to give a fair
chance although it's really matte and I
honestly don't think you even need to
set it because it's what I usually do
I'm just gonna you know follow my
typical steps to make this reviews
honest as possible that's one thing I
don't like when people do reviews and
they switch their routines because it's
like I feel like when you review a
product you should kind of like
coorporate that product into your
routine that you always do not switch it
up because if you literally routine to
something that you're not used to how
can you really accurately review the
product if you're doing something
different
you don't mean I just like us how
something's go wrong just my person all
right so the the foundation set my skin
feels
really smooth I can't let you just rub
my skin and it's not budging at all this
was pretty good it doesn't feel too
heavy on my skin anymore I don't know
what that was about maybe my face is
kinda just getting used to it suggesting
but this looks good and it feels good
too all right guys so now that I've got
my based on I'm into my brows some
mascara and a little highlighter blush
off-camera I usually include that on my
videos however I prefer to watch the
reviews where it's only focused on that
specific product so I don't make this
video super long by doing it or oh well
that's not the point of this video
summit is you know go to them and click
and I'll be right back okay so I gave
myself a color what I do
oh yeah I do my brows I use this new I'm
not gonna show it cuz I don't know where
it's at
but I do this new Kat Von D remember
that actually ruined a lot if you guys
will like you to a video comparing that
to the anti socks and a brown it's kind
of sounds like let me know so once we're
doing videos kind of like battle the
brands type thing baby ways um put some
blush on put some highlight on didn't go
too crazy because like I said the main
focus is the foundation well before I go
out and about to test the wear this
foundation I'm gonna set my face first
I'm used to saying spray I've been using
like every single on my videos as a
lately to you know keep my routine
consistent and it's the Urban Decay all
nighter spray set my face with that a
set my closer to I know that's random
but I do that sometimes I just don't
show on camera because I put concealer
powder in that so I feel like that's
meant to be set to you right like I say
this looks really good in this lighting
though because when I'll try takes
himself leaders who boomerangs it looked
a little caste cat I don't know we're
gonna see I do I'm gonna get some photos
in natural lighting before when Sun Goes
Down to show you guys it looks like cuz
studio lights let me tell you something
they make you look good they do they
don't make it better than what you look
like
granted I I look great right now but
studio lights are gonna always make you
look more flawless than you typically
would without them so I'm gonna go
outside I'm gonna try to weather are key
to
I want to do something to require me to
sweat not require but make me sweat so I
could see this really stays mad stays
put I'm not trying to be acting I really
try to like you know get some tests
going because it's pretty late afternoon
it's like 5:00 5:30 today was a long day
took me forever to make this wig so I
spent my whole day doing that so I kind
of feel bad I mean I'm not able to like
wear the foundation all day and do like
a whole anti wear test but I'm gonna do
some pretty active things like at least
test it to an extent so I'm gonna go to
the arcade go get some pizza I'm just be
out and about take some bows for you
guys and marry Courtney alright guys so
it's been four hours since I sat on it
filmed earlier and I'm actually like to
leave my house again to do some drills
but I want to check back in because I'm
not touching my face felt a little oily
but I want to show you guys what it
looks like before I touch it so I
haven't touched in four hours
I am getting a little oily my t-zone but
it actually looks way better than my
makeup usually looks I keep looking up
like freaking marks herself it looks way
better and usually does
I will say that cuz usually speaking I'm
like after like an hour after start a
dab it on my nose can get really oily
around there but I think it looks I'm
looking this meristem looking up I think
it looks pretty good it still it just
started get a little oily kinda started
moving around like changing stuff so I
kinda started to sweat but on my ride
home here I eat that it still with Matt
is still look good so I will say this
foundation is staying matte I took some
photos outside in the mall silencer
close when I get back to you guys my
final update but I'm gonna touch it with
some powder before I leave the house so
I'm trying look good whatever and I
changed my shirt and I kind of like fix
my way just a little bit cuz I felt like
my closure like while it was what's one
of the kids say these days clocking wool
unlockable I thought I could do better I
don't know okay
let me I'm gonna take the same one
receipt powder and just damp on top I
want you to much competition I'll repeat
this foundation but I got I got a look
decent you know I'm singing and we don't
want to be a greaseball
alright better so yeah I'm believing now
and I don't know what I'm gonna get back
home but I'm gonna come back and let you
know if I lost this foundation who I
will II oh yes I'm back home it is to
11:00 in the morning it's crazy that's
my birthday in time I don't know why
they just that just mean really happy
Elevens my my lucky numbers anyways
besides the point
this will my business isn't like um so
let's see I put this foundation on
earlier like 5:30
I'm tired of swamp so let me do some
math six seven eight wait 6:30 let's say
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
one two that's eight hours that is your
average workday and this one my face
looks like this counts as a damn where
text even though I didn't go to the
arcade or do so much to ask reactive
take my jack off and I'm this is looking
like
I mean don't know my hair but um this is
this how it looks so my over Dawson's
foundation so first I'm gonna before
your like casino talk I'm an inter some
photos and I'm gonna talk over those
just have gotta go over my thoughts on
the foundation natural light and when I
was in the mall I'm just gonna talk
about that really quick and then I'm
yeah I'm so tired
so first photo I'll still my studio and
it's still a good with my studio lights
then I were outside and I thought the
foundation look great in natural
lighting I was standing directly to the
Sun which is why I'm looking down cuz
I'm was gob line and that's gonna foot
up close to compare my neck to the
jawline and Foundation is a perfect
match here's a photo of me throughout
the day I was looking kind of rough but
the foundation was still looking a
little good and then here is me and
Sephora better lighting but the
foundation still was on point I have my
friend take a photo of me in the mall
with flash and
like I said the foundation still looking
good and in the final photo my
foundation started feel a little oily
but as you can see it's still I feel
like it still looked good so all right
so my fire young foundation I actually
personally like it a lot now I got a PR
so let me Google how much covergirl is
charging for these foundations because
that would be nice to know something an
idea I try to fall in line to the cost
of this but I don't think it's even off
sale yet but the average price of length
is about $8 and so do I think this
foundation is worth any dollars yes I
think that it wore pretty nicely I feel
like the foundation pretty much stay
true to code the whole entire day and
you nested under my camera I think that
it did I get really really oily in my
nose area and I don't ever peep it until
I realized how much I dab throughout the
day damn
remember that anyways I'm so tired so I
don't like it did a good job staying
matter on my nose my nose is gonna get
oily regardless but with a little
blotting tissue or like a little powder
I'm totally fine so I flip the
foundation stay put it uh explanation I
actually do um I'm Scott will be $10
have to give it mine I'm not gonna give
it in only because the color isn't my
favorite but I think it looks good in
this lighting I mean I've let the look
in the other photo I took outside too I
just noticed that sir I'm glad to look a
little more yellowy but other than that
I like Foundation Tom I can't say
anything negative about it early when I
put it on I felt it coming feel heavy
our skin kind of like gay cut team it a
little bit but after like I said my face
and everything I didn't feel it at all
it does not make my skin feel like dry
or even to Matt trying to test the this
side enormous shambles that's okay cuz
you guys know I don't usually do videos
like this so please give me a break I
will get better the more I do these but
turn the test let's put a white color
towel on my face there's nothing on this
paper towel what that's freaking me out
oh my god you guys okay so it is
freaking
transit like I want to rub the scandal
yeah there's nothing on the paper towel
so when it says it's transferred that
prankster when it does its transfer
resistant they're they're dead ass
they're serious about it so okay I like
that I like that a lot because one thing
I'm a problem with is that my foundation
gets off everything
my shirts when I put them on my phone
screen my foundation using some
everything nothing like this other
phonation I have could I love them if I
use them all the time but those we make
sauce don't claim to be transfer
resistant so it's totally cool but if I
did this one claims to be transfer
resistant actually is is a major plus I
would read this in 9.5 so eyes
foundation um that's all I was saying no
this video was not sponsored covergirl
discs in the other foundation in PR like
I showed earlier video but with rinsing
you um PR packages it does not mean that
you were obligated to make a video or
even post about you guys use a product
they send you the package in hopes that
use it and hope so you do video like
this and recommend the product but I'm
Stannis to say that the video is not
sponsored anyway
covergirl going to actually make this
video I have to do it I just did a poem
I'm instagramming so guys do you guys
want to see my review on this and you
guys said yes what would you order you
guys did and here it is so I'm tired
it's it's like 2:17 in the morning I
love you guys I do this for you and I'm
gonna go to bed and I'm yeah thank you
for watching I will get better my friend
a sure you use you guys know this
probably the second foundation we've
ever done so I'm not the best when it
comes to new products I hope hoping it
miss anything if I did just come down
below and asked me and I was totally
answer it um yeah I'm gonna go now so oh
there's our this video if you did thumbs
up and subscribe and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
