you're new welcome i'm arnelle and say
i'm going to do a video on pretty much a
lot of new joy cosmetics products I
think they have launched with 17th it's
a day in the 20th so we three days late
movies oh sorry
so they launched new foundations and
they also made package of their new lip
liners and some new local live then our
glute glosses with pigment in them then
so here is the package they sent me is
very very heavy and open it oh God
and so they can't a brush put a
foundation which is very similar to the
art artiste brushes that are just fresh
out of our outset but you guys may be
and then here are the foundations so
they release let's count 5 8 well 17
appreciate open the box they're really
17 foundations now the shade range hood
being through I want to get that out
right now the shade rage could
definitely be improved oh my god most
definitely needs to be improved however
when now I'm not gonna make any excuses
for them the shade ring the shade range
needs to be improved we'll just put it
that way I believe I know I'm gonna be
the last row so they have fair light
medium tan and dark D and I'm gonna be
in the dark deep section you to them the
tan section so I guess this is what they
consider to be dark deep and I'm gonna
assume that I'm going to shade cafe
wonõt I'm in possibly cocoa which are
these shades I'm gonna swatch these
shades and see which one looks the best
on me I know I'm one of these shades I'm
not in darker than that I've gotta live
in that so imma stay with those three
shades put on let me grab the brush in
this box they also have this eyeliner
it's like a nude color I'm not short
it's poor but I'll figure out a way to
use it and so because all I need this
video start already I'll show you guys
the lip liner and lip products once I
start doing the lips but my one start
you know put the foundation on just to
see you know how it looks so I'm very
easy to shake match the shape well and
it says hi coverage cream foundation
coats high coverage comes with a pump
which i think is pretty cool and you get
you get 20 milliliters not sure how much
that actually is I'm not a math person
but hey let me compare it another
foundation hold on alright so compared
to my fav foundation which is an arched
share glow nurtured glow has 30
milliliters and this has 20 milliliters
the joy cosmetics foundation is $38 and
NARS sheer glow is 47 so I guess it
makes sense when you compare price wise
it yeah well I mean this nurse you go
last for ever so I mean you get less but
then you pay less you feel like nine
dollars less so that makes sense so I'm
just that five my shade I have a feel
maybe this one I'm not this this shade I
picked the cafe it has a water red and a
undertone to it so I'm not that shade I
know that already
I'm this Shana probably yeah I'm trying
to shade walnut this looks like that's
my shame Hana was blends to my hand and
I'm wanna but I'm gonna a vehicle they
got this last week just to be sure this
is a shade cocoa I'm just gonna swatch
it just to be sure I'm not cocoa I'm
walnut yeah so let's put those to the
side alright so not only determine on
the sheet walnut I'm going to prime my
skin how many of the lingerie cosmetics
products just because I'm going to use a
drink Osmond
its anti-aging moisture primer it's not
going to show up the greatest cuz it's
white but you guys see it's a whole it's
different
so this primer supposed to be
moisturizing and anti-aging
that's what happens mattifying one that
I really like I like my friend rice I'm
a fan of the crackers and you've watched
my videos before I have used the primers
many times because I feel very
lightweight yeah I like them
I don't really prime my forehead because
I really was a primary grade I had some
out stuff in foundation on I love trying
new foundations so fun so I did three
pumps you guys know I like a lot
foundation this brush it's it's
literally artist brush or like you know
cheaper handle it been
and it blends booing right this color
looks a little off right now I know but
it blends are really nice and smoothly
wow it looks off other crazy camera but
you guys know you need if I'm the HDD to
contour conceal after you do all that it
kind of comes together but it's blending
really smoothly I never do my foundation
with a brush because I like sponge just
like like splendas give you a more
seamless finish and I noticed usually
when with brushes what comes foundation
brushes typically work better with a
cream like thick creams and there's not
a thick cream but it's thick enough to
where this brush is really nice with it
is she it's not the best but like I said
we're gonna make it work
or maybe I'll mix a lighter shade in hmm
that's interesting
this is bleeding out like a dream though
oh my god this is blending out really
really nice and even I mean you guys see
I don't have to say it it's it's weird
oh the yellow I'm gonna get another one
of these shades mix it in I'm a little
crazy I'm going to take the shade
bronzed um this doesn't look bronze to
me but yeah I'm not seeing anything I'm
gonna mix that in
still light on some ideation well this
one's not too dark because it's look a
little too dark
help me a little better
the into your neck but it's very it's a
very nice foundation the shade range I'm
not a fan of I'm not even for me it's
like what the heck but it is a nice
condition I'm gonna go over in my nature
like a sponge just to kind of make it
seek to my seat a little warm but let me
say this I feel like when we as in women
of color we kind of complain about lack
of shade ranges and brands that people
tell us oh you know just buy from that
brand brand they make your shade it's
not about that it's about the actual
product itself and the quality of it
like this is a nice foundation but it's
unfortunate that people that are darker
than my contour shape probably won't be
anywhere because their shade range so
it's not always about like oh you know
go to go find my brand that makes a
shade it's like what that brand doesn't
make a foundation that that is this
consistency that has this much coverage
that feels this good in those super nuts
then what you know so I think I'm you
saying that because I like seen those
kind of comments and I think that you're
watching us and we've made those kind of
off before thinking about that you know
like you can have a very very like what
if not she glowed in have that machine
so it's like oh man
it's not one of the best foundations out
there if you're like so just thinking
about that next to me make those kind of
comments if you do if you don't then
you're fine and thank you for being
thoughtful all right so the foundations
on it feels so good it feels so good you
guys it feels so good I don't think I
have anything on it's full coverage it
looks flawless it feels so nice it feels
so nice this is kind of
okay this is kind of nice the brush I
like the brush I'm not the best person
though so I probably won't use it too
often I'm like a sponge but this smells
really nice it's like it's nice so now
I'm going to conceal I'm going to speak
this prior up so this video isn't too
long because it's mainly about the
foundation and the other nuke launches
so I'm gonna conceal how to use my color
pop concealer I use two shades I use ten
fifty and white twenty so I'm gonna
conceal those really fast
all right so I've concealed the
foundations weird like now here is a bad
weird but it's like I almost find I
don't have to set it like I plug it in
it's like something into my skin and it
feels matte it feels like it's not gonna
go anywhere
that's a nice foundation all right let
me help me I'm gonna set I have to you
so someplace I can see how you use my
Laura Mercier translucent powder okay
I'm gonna use that
and what I'm gonna do I'm going to just
spend my entire face with this client I
don't really want to alter the fundation
ship's lever you want to see how it
wears come and wear this for the rest
tonight tell you guys what it's looking
like so I'm just gonna lightly say you
can see I'm barely studying I'm just
using like the excess powder I have this
foundation you it's also you don't have
to set it but you really don't set this
forehead though it's building
well it's like a part of me I have said
this that this foundation feels so good
because I'm really mad the shade range
like that that sucks I don't like that
oh yeah I don't like that you know what
I ought to make this video really long
so what I'm going to do I want to be
focus on this foundation and how long it
wears so I'm going to do the rest of my
face off-camera watch these kind of goes
before and this is what you do so I'm
gonna do my makeup well Kim I'll come
back I'll tell you guys what to cover
the line the lips so I'm pretty sure you
just want to know about fundage that's a
good main thing and then I'll come back
show you guys what I'm looking like then
I'll go on about my day and I'll check
back in in like 6 hours or something
crazy I have plants and I believe it or
not I never really the house a little
weird we'll talk about another video so
move is my face then I'll be right back
all right guys side the rest of my face
and I'm that it's gonna matter they
record it cuz I think this looks really
pretty it's kind of basic though so I
don't know if you guys want to see it if
you do all do it over so for my eyes I
use both these joy husbands I show up
house I use the matte and shimmer
essential palette one of the shades of
broke don't judge me
and use this palette and then I also use
your screen time palette which looks
like this and I got this I like and then
I use their polish I use the shades
peony and I don't have to see that but I
use these to the this looks bright but
it's actually not too bright at all it's
about that pigmented and then I use
their skin did palette I pretty much use
a lot of in cosmetics please yeah I'll
believe everything I used on my eyes on
my face down below just in case you're
curious but for my lips I used two of
your new liners I used a liner closer
shimmer and sable their line is really
creamy you have to use very little time
or if they look great because they're
really really creamy so um don't want
that to happen so comer broke on me a
little
Samos perfectly fine and I use this
shear pigment lip gloss diamond walk now
I like the formula however I thought
after the application would have better
if it was um I'll explain it it goes the
brush not this I think this is great for
lipsticks there are lip Stoppers there
you know this shimmery lip times they
have this works for that buffer gloss I
feel like it kinda like it puts the
pigment down about the same time so it's
kind of stiff it picks it right back up
so what I do is I have to pretty much
get it do like that and then rub my
finger and that's how I was able to get
the opinion on my lips because this time
puts it down and picks the right back up
and if you really want the laws like
pigment and you have to use your finger
in so that's the only thing I would say
I don't like the applicator but I like
the product itself it looks nice its
sheer it's not too heavy perfect for
every single day they have other shades
as well but I really like this one so
that's why I chose and so now I am gonna
oh this one D she is so pretty yeah they
were gonna wear tests before I'm going
to go on buy my day I'll try the old you
know here and there I'm gonna go eat
food my little sister that we're gonna
see a movie so um that's pretty active
if you ask me I don't know I'm kind of
mad flash song cuz it's kind of hard for
me to see and these lashes these last
really nice though there for me final
boss the actual main will be down below
but I'm just gonna wear this foundation
I'll check back in and I probably took
Megan to let it right now it is okoma
coups called me right now it's 431 my
sister just called me
let's see it's 431 and so I'll check
again probably like 12 the later the
better because then you could actually
be an actual opinion so I'll stop
talking eyes ears off
I'll go about my day and I'll see you
guys later or maybe sooner I don't know
keep looking up like freaking view fires
up here I was gonna be the house that
was like oh good good so I'm on your
team picture this mighty you it's inside
concepts so to say what should I know
that yeah kind of important anyways this
is happy oh shoes anyways I have
this jacket from Lulu which I
uncounseled if you want to back if you
haven't got the memo at this hoodie from
f21 these hands of you yeah anyway don't
care this is a wear test so this
application looks without my studio
lights looks beautiful app should do a
flash test I don't mean I don't I don't
think anything but I'm gonna do it
anyways I look at white in the forehead
that's my powder I'm insert a picture it

and this - crazy its peak hour it's like
507
you know me i'ma take some fire I should
have put some mixing in on my lids cuz
the shimmer on my I show is already like
transparent I knew that would happen
when I did it so I wasn't thinking
but um yeah let's check in I'm trying to
this block getting the right way and
using fog like the whole entire time so
that's what I'm doing but foundations
good looking crawlers I mean it's been
like 15 minutes so I check to let you
guys see this lighting now I'll take my
fire and um I'll check back in when
we're back here by you I'll I'm sure the
camera sees I'll show you so you guys
I'm a back here body what's her allowing
here so I'm able to boil
crap it was mighty I've been in
I'm gonna go now I'll show you guys the
food's don't want to get it right guys
but our freakin our we're test was
almost destroyed because some of the
sauce which is very spice by the way
splashed my I almost got it my last stop
coming off now we're missing that
concealer in the foundation but I'm safe
I'm okay you guys know that I haven't
finished my food now to the piece I have
left her traumatized my eyes with a
burning stone
get in focus
I guess the movies done what time is it
it is 9:40 other crazy because I just
took my bun but I feel sick sure you
have a fetish looking so very cool I
thought it's kind of going more into my
skin well I can't tell if it's looking
like it's faded my skin I mean of course
when maybe it was the most fresh as I
did earlier but I mean I think this
one's pretty good
so Umbridge a cofactor they made one by
my house and because I feel you're here
just look around when I combined enough
it'll be home to do my fried chicken
very nice so I'm back home these lights
are really hurting my eyes so much
because I've been out it's been dark so
sorry groups when see they're not
looking like these less humanik ceramic
is fast my phone busters foundation is
that is a wonderful foundation I said
probably the best one you ever tried
nitrile - I didn't get paid for this
video they just do this little PR box
like they say never an awesome apparel
is nothing special I have to be real
I've tried a lot of clinicians from
high-end drugstore from cream to liquid
I tried a lot of foundations and this is
this is a top 5 when it comes to the
quality of it consists iam it aware of
it it's a nice foundation period the
only thing that sucks is the shade range
but it's like how many times have we
heard this story it sucks
I actually I want Instagram on my online
land even osmond aware tested my
laughing for it asking what's the LA
color one what any claims do you guys
like to see that and it's like I it made
me think that I want to do that but I
also see there Shane rates there Shane
rank isn't nice as well so I don't think
this is like a drugstore high anything
it's a grand thing at the end of the day
yes some of these brands and I know from
just being in this image
some forensically asked some of these
brands don't even have black we working
for them I've been to some of their
corporations and not one black person
inside but that's another story but
sometimes randomly don't know anything
when it comes to formulating a
foundation or a pigment that's the
character darker skin they really don't
know and some brands have got a
knowledge that have gotten help in order
to you know expand their shade range of
other brands simply have not which is
joy how's max I just I don't know if
they don't know how to make duck shades
or they simply don't want to I don't
know I just hope in the near future they
do because they have a great crop of my
hands and I just wish these prints I was
thinking good they make more money if
they care to everyone like it's almost
like they're limiting themselves to how
much money they can actually make if
they make all these shades and then say
say to me like every you know it's maybe
more shades to care to everyone and
you're watching my video and you hear me
that I love this property you trust my
reviews and you want to go and buy it
and you go to their side and have your
shade they just lost something on forty
dollars plus tax
thanks miss down your money so now what
she's branded seeds like if a products
good learning we're gonna buy it but
it's like we can't buy it we can't buy
it you know our shea does it exist does
hold s sons this is a great foundation
like I wish I could talk all day about
how great this foundation was it just a
shame Raiders the only make me I could
say so hopefully drink this max gets
together hopefully a lot is way to get
together started was eighteen I want CMU
these friends with this whack-ass chain
reach I I don't I simply don't it's
getting really old and ski nearing the
old and as a beauty influence earner
who's actually in this world and it's
like I matter that I go on to read but
so many brands did really it
I'll offer us another video it's so
India really obviously sucks for a
minute color it really does these brands
they have their black girl budget it's
so much time goes into this that's well
it's almost like when you see these
foundations and you see the lack of
shade range not only does it know it is
upset you as a person but when you're in
this beauty influenza world and you see
how these brands really get down and how
they only take one black person per trip
because they have that budget it makes
me even more upset we're just okay like
when just just include us it's totally
fun to do that but I don't get it almost
I race and I'm tired these lights are in
my eyes I just almost say that this is
Joey you guys have a great foundation
great parking your hands just please
expand the shade range I hope I didn't
offend you in this video by expressing
my thoughts I'm removing the Pierre list
and I mean hit it is what it is but it's
a great foundation just expand this a
great so I'm gonna say if you guys
