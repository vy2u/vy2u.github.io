obviously but I lost 13 and then it kept
falling out and so kiss wanna blow the
glass fell out I let it go out then I
got it this pier 16 round 15 and then it
kept falling out and so I thought who

new things I got one first I got the
first mile of 17 and then I detect who

your nose ring on that hole for
interface tenses up and you get my ball

know he oh god Whitney was a good time
dumbass over 18 hear that what happened
to your house dude okay dude the goop we
were at like a fun date he's a lot of
weird not weird but probably okay you're
trying to win you over to play me
um so he didn't our dislike boat day
read the heck it's not walking you know
I'm over here like wow he's sitting in a
bow that's not cool you know not that
cool but um yeah that's my hair my leave
out this before closures and those is
really windy at state several times when
I leave out it was nervous
well we were welding an empty shop
airplane I guess unit I'm just talking
out of my ass I actually mean it and so
he was really blah blah we go in there
the shop and it's too defended like 60
an hour and we're late 18 when I'm
bothered he's pressed another ball that
I deport now but anyways I'm talking
shit no one's paid 16 hour I mean I
wouldn't I don't know I'm tea anyway we
didn't get that day but the next day we
children I don't think anything about it
they randomly go both about the tattoos
above all he's absolutely took me in a
tattoo shop and Shea for everything and
I'm like my data about to get this I'm
gonna show you guys it because I'm not
sure the cover-up at the same time and
so I got it but by the way he got my to
you l know he still has a pregnant he's
a little bitch and it hurts him is like
luckily he got mine
he just did now cry I like to name your
again some art anyway I'm not sure you
hold on okay so it was very closely it's
the name under there and this is a rose
I cover it up I'll say guys why but the
name is right there
tell us stupid don't ever do it I am
yeah anyways so I did that and so I
covered it with that rose and not
colored prepared too much to cover it up
but I covered it one time
I was walking out looking in Walgreens
and like my stall curtains were tingling
I started lurking on his best friend's
Twitter cuz better uh bad news with all
the beams at peak I think a picture of
hinge best friend and other girls friend
that he had and I looked at date I would
go he was wearing have them displayed
welcome day the rear so getting out in
the beautiful day looks kind of time
Raziel banging out and he looked
literally cat on me and told me that he
was sick in bed the whole day on Sigma I
feel good
leave this mean hang out him and her I
knew it and I was like I'm so pissed
like mmm
that pissed me off so I found out I was
like I was like yo and I went okay I
wasn't looking and I did ask literally
walk to the tattoo shop I'm covering
this shit I really covered that Dale
would talk about like know what cover it
out I'll let you know I come as you go
along and I saw him maybe like two
nights after that I told him that yeah
cover your tattoo here willing to keep
the whole Maga but make it look great -
never to remind me
no I covered it and we got show him he
was just like and ego so brutal it
earlier and then he's like I never
thought you'd do the broom oh god I did
it and I'm that's the story right back
to my other tattoos so I guess what else
is 506 this too shall pass
honestly it's kind of obvious I got that
because I believe that this too shall
pass but the plane to get when I first
got it I felt too wrong out so most
marketing spell and the guidance time
yep Eagles Africa has two O's I know I'm
sure it's one sweetheart I know how to
spell and you put one out and I'm right
I hope that if I got in a song dog I'm
started tell you if I think you started
wrong I think it's T oh oh my Google did
and it was and I was like and so I went
back the next day and I got six BAM I
had them a covered thought oh we like it
alright I'm going to stop counting I
don't even know where I'm at right now
next a to love yourself I got the same
date oh why I get it I was emotional
knowledge I know you need reminders I
need to love yourself at all times
do I you look at this aunt I'm going to
run myself hell no though it's a mistake
I don't know what I'm looking for why
you can just anyways I should I got a
bracelet this set it by that I got had
to you then mean it's mama to cover so
I'm going to cover it but that's we're
at right now okay now when it's my Nexus
you owe me a new orleans okay my nest
touch you this little tiny thing right
here if i can't see it it's what their
tattoos so I saw I got went to a better
artist because I mean it's not as
straight as it should be but it says
pain is inevitable suffering is optional
it's very tiny I doubt you're going to
be to see it but it's the words that
count and I got it because I lived in
this church and so look for a two-year
straight I would drive by this church
and they have a little little thing the
most your just have we're outside they
have a globe of light overcoat or
whatever and I can't see that quote and
I'll read it it's my mile drive path to
fasting or read it
so as our reading our I like that yes so
chair like pant is inevitable like
you're down to Obata Bert oh I'm about
to get deep okay it was pain it's like
you can't avoid it and you have to go
through things
just stop turn through it like that's
totally your choice and so do you mean I
mean even though I asked you to self do
stuff like when I'm in a bad mood or sad
I was obsessed want to make me more sad
that's the key might sound itself but
this one might gonna text you is good
like to start out and I think it means a
lot and I wasn't evil when I got it I
really look like I really want that
alright now I have to because it sounds
long but hopefully you're still here my
favorite as you what else second
favorite this said I don't work hurt but
I'm gonna do it it's a unfuckable
that is kick a dog it's like my second
favorite song of all time my first
favorite songs as khadija rapper Siddiq
but this song ever came out I literally
listen to it minimum once a day but
tomato listed 30 times literally I'm the
song repeater Sunday 7 to 10 times there
are three times or how do my cosmic
looks to it but the thing I like on that
song is that I can't explain it but you
know you're going through that time and
you can't lose
music that music remind you of either
the fat time they're currently going
through or another fat time you'll
experience so it's most critical so it's
kind of like hard to assist during songs
with me almost everything with song
around restaurant time period that's the
only song that doesn't bring any
negative emotion so no matter what I'm
going through those tests on like no
matter what it does not remind it
anything bad it's all good it's super
powering the whole violin entire song
it's like one static cameras to rap
music it's my restaurant once I help us
to like like softer or deep but it's not
our D song it's like its own genre
within itself so that's well as long and
I'll Jack got it well I got about math
but I warned for three years so and then
my last had to UM allows you to have an
accent like what that's a you you read
it correctly you know look I know it's
beautiful right I love it when I'm
Michael Nyman all right snapchat
yeah that's me I said to you uh because
is joining in
yes that's it for now I'm more tissues
plan I don't have any piercings plan I
have on my septum
I have something ring that's not that
special then in her that guy who pierced
me he didn't give me a chance freaked
out he literally told me I have other
clients way to need to get this together
and he just did it a little bit on but

really lose oh really guys I really hope
you guys enjoyed this um yeah
I'm falling I'm doing this coming after
