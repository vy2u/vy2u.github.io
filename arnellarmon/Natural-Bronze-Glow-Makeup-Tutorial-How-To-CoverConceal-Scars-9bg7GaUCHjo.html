three guys the really nice bronze
natural God is look or what I'm gonna
call it is it's a look it's a super easy
look you guys know I'm Alex wheezy um
new hairstyle alert
I have faux locs I did them myself I
post this on Instagram and kind of broke
they're in it dopey but a lot of you
guys like this and I was really shocked
so I know you guys will like us so much
right maybe you guys will like it so
much I would've been did these but I'm
gonna I'm the talk too fast too excited
I'm gonna do a tutorial on these because
they're actually really easy to do and
you'll save so much money like doing
them by yourself even though it's hella
hard it's annoying it's difficult and
your fingers start to hurt because of
the hair um it just you go with that or
you pay 250 you tell me what you want to
do and we'll go from there but um yeah I
just want to say thank you guys for
supporting my channel I know I'm not the
most consistent person that's because
like I do a lot outside of YouTube but I
just wish you guys for being here
um one little thing before I go I've
used only one set of brush during this
video I will grab them but they're kind
of a little bit please but I want to
start using like certain sets of brushes
so they're easier to purchase for you
guys so you guys know I use a tube is
placed brushes all the time I use some
Sigma brush some work your brushes I'm
gonna try to like use the same side
brushes during video so that way it's
easier to keep up with the first try
using this video from any planet you
know you guys have benefited you guys
following me bloggers you know veining
plan the ones that make the little
spinny brush thingie then make it
brushes now and the settle who I was
like a hundred dollars but if use a code
you can use my code alright I'm pretty
sure a lot of other bloggers we all got
codes out here you get the bursts up for
thirty dollars so if you want to do that
go for it I use the brush thing I heat
the red block I use a brush so you get
to see what they do and I also cook over
the Jewess plis brushes to up with them
a little description box
to mention that anyways that's all I
want to say I'm done talking I'm gonna
enjoy this look and I will see you guys
in my next video I'm still feeling this
hairstyle you guys from a hoop earrings
gotta keep going on but he has been
three minutes so so first I prime my
skin using my Laura Mercier radiance
bronze primer you guys know I used all
the time it is my number one favorite
primer it is a primer that I'll buy
again and again and again because it is
amazing now for the first time ever I'm
gonna show you guys how to cover up my
scars not only do this what I really
really want to be covered I've been bad
just put foundation on it I don't really
mind if you kind of see through them but
I wanted them to be like non-existent
today so first I'm gonna color correct
using this concealer palette by Mac I'm
using these two shades one is like a
darker orange and one's like a lighter
yellow after I place that concealer over
the desired areas I'm going to blend it
out very gently with the Beauty Blender
and then after that I'm going to take my
Laura Mercier setting powder and I'm
gonna lightly set those areas because
when I put my foundation over I don't
want the concealer to move from those
areas this is legit stuff right here but
you have to make sure you put the powder
on very lightly or else to look very
cakey for foundation I'm using NARS
sheer glow mix on my cover FX custom
enhancer drops in the shade sunlight and
I'm just going to mix that my foundation
to give it a nice luminous glow and I'm
gonna apply that to my skin using this
flat brush by Vinnie planet
after I'm done applying that with the
brush I'm just gonna go back over it and
blend that in with a Beauty Blender
now to contour I'm using the core FX
custom enhancer drops and the shades
sunset it's pretty much like a contour
shade now I made the mistake of putting
around my forehead and for some reason
ever since I waxed my forehead it has
not been the same and nothing blends
right up there so I put that on there
you can't tell in the camera but I was
like I'm not here for this so I just
fixed it with a little foundation but I
did like how it came out you know for my
contour my cheek area I just didn't like
it on my forehead but maybe it's because
my forehead is on some other stuff right
now for concealer I'm using this
concealer from bare minerals the bare
skin concealer and I'm just gonna place
under my eyes on my forehead a little
bit down my nose and where else do I
place it they can place a match into you
yep and underneath my contour just to
clean it up a little bit
beside my concealer I'm using this
custom powder that I made I mix my
banana powder with my color effects
illuminating sign powder in the shade
medium and yeah I showed in my last
video so if you're interested just go
see why did I honestly just mix it to
powder it's nothing fancy on my eyes I'm
just using these two color prop shades
first let me use bronze me from the kpop
collection that I'm gonna use the shade
game face was a super shock shadow oh my
god that's a mouthful super shock shadow
ice one of my eyes to be very very
simple very bronze very simple very easy
didn't want you to much to them so yeah
I just use my fingers I didn't use
brushes on this part now to bronze my
face I'm using the same broad to use my
eyes and another Veni Planet brush it's
kind of like a buffing brush and I'm
just going to bronze up my face
to set my entire face amuse my Ruby
kisses mineral powder in the shade mocha
and yep that's about it oh and another
Benny Planet brush all the brush I used
our fav any planet like a sign the
beginning of the video and you can use
my code to save money
check my description box for that code
because right now to remember the code
from the top of my head but I got a code
for blush I'm using my favorite NARS
blush this shade Taj Mahal it's pretty
much like a shimmery orange blush and it
is beautiful as you can see I can't put
too much on though so it kinda it's like
you know fix it a little bit not gosh I
myself do my brows with using products I
use their the new brow parks from
benefit non Suhaila I'm using gilded
honey by Laura Geller I'm gonna spray
that with my slay all day setting spray
from draw cosmetics and I spray my
highlight because it makes it pop so
much more I definitely recommend doing
it now now with every highlight like say
you have like a Becca highlight you
don't have to spray those kind of
highlights because they're already kind
of creamy and pigmented but if it's a
high that's less creamy if you spray it
I promise you
it just it will change your whole world
it would change your whole life it's
amazing
and it sticks back to the skin
now for lips I'm going to first line my
lips using this lip liner by Tolley
deluxe called hot cocoa then after that
I'm gonna use this lipstick by Mac
called rich maroon it's not an actual
lipstick well it's like a lip stick
slash has a glossy feel to it but has
like a chapstick feel to it it's from
their huggable line I just know that
it's so moisturizing and I just love
this shade
so I was already feeling my limbs but I
decide to put some gloss on just you
know make it pop even more I'm using
this gloss by draw cosmetics and they
won't be in the description box below
and now to set my face I'm just using
the slay all day setting spray and
that's pretty much it for the look this
look is so pretty it's so easy to do and
I think it'll look great on everybody
yeah I'm here for it I threw on some
hoops and I'm serving face oh my god I'm
stuck anyways I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and be sure to give it a
thumbs up subscribe do all that good
stuff I say to do it every end of the
video and I'll see you guys on my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
