it's hot okay welcome back to my channel
you guys I just had them filming this
look and they're excited I'm gonna
always like this but I'm extra excited
today because if you guys haven't
noticed I'm spinning
this is a guy new chair and we'll go to
chairs desk and what goes with desk
lights I got new lights oh my god
and it's like there's on my old
lights like that's a dismal lights you
know they they were with me on the
come-up I appreciate their time the
services to me but I found snapchat
comparison between my new lights I'm at
old lights I just let you say my new
lights put my old lights and shambles I
was like I don't even know you anymore
like I did it might listen for this and
my old lights each slide I had three of
them they all have one switch my new
lights they all got five switches each
their light the light bulb size like
times two I upgraded completely and I
wanna pay the $200 to do it and so side
note I do kind of make it a video on how
to search a channel because I feel like
like I kind of comfortable sound now um
I go at the camera I had cool lights but
I just felt like my setup was just like
stopped me from filming because how I
had things set up I would always make a
mess but now I have a new desk
haffley's organizers I have new dressers
my lights up everything under control
and I just I feel like I'll be doing
videos lemon if you guys might see that
I'll put like a little thing up here to
get some vote for my next video clever
know what you guys gonna see next
but anyways I got new lights so that's
why I haven't filmed because I was like
you know I don't want to accidently film
some fire with these weak-ass like that
guy now let me wait till my new let's
come in that way if I film some fire
it's actually fire because I have better
lights that make sense
are you with me so whole thing is these
lights are super duper bright I'm a
blinding person you know I'm going blind
I'm gonna have a glass about I'm thirty
this is my prediction this is these are
facts I know this and they're super
duper hot like there's heat coming from
them and just like I need my fan but we
need to talk threes you can't put fans
on because you could hear in the
background many ways someone talked
enough
I exist Toria look at everyday look plus
both freckles now you guys
to see the freckles there
super-duper-duper light hopefully I can
edit the video in a way we get to see
them more am i trying to zoom in more of
my face but I kept the line on purpose
because I didn't wanted to be too
obvious I wanted to be very natural and
because I'm not used to being on my face
if I did them too dark it would be way
too much for me so I couldn't very light
um I did it because you guys asked me to
do it I do and they have this plan so he
is like it
and yeah let me know what I should feel
next I'm gonna start feeling a lot more
cuz I got these bonus lights and I'll
see you in the next video ok wow it
looks weird to some eyebrows then first
huh ok let's put some stuff on so they
don't too extreme first time I stopped
with primer I'm using a Kat Von D yes hi
oh snap walk it walk it hydrating primer
how do I breathe the me when I was
useless
so for foundation I'm using NARS sheer
glow foundation the she Tahoe
ahoo so blended I'm use a wet Beauty
Blender I prefer to use Beauty blenders
to have brushes I used to use brushes to
blend my foundation but and that's the
very karlie brush brush of leave streaks
a lot I just done with the Beauty
Blender you really blend it into your
skin it just looks so perfect and
seamless it's awesome
okay so I have a little bit left in my
hand so you know I'm gonna do we do what
everyone should do just gonna rub that
back in the bottle this is $50 I have
none to waste no shame not to conceal i
musn't seem to conceal as I used in my
last video the Kat Von D lock concealer
cream and the shade d31 warm and white
out I use the white out to make the
concealer look brighter and I'm starting
to get dark circles because I don't go
to sleep I'm like a vampire ago today I
stayed up till 4:00 in the morning 2:00
in the morning but actually I've been
drinking flat tummy to you like the last
almost a month now and I plan to do a
video on that how it works I really want
to just give my opinion on it I used to
hate it but I have my reasons
it wasn't cos actual tea itself I also
talked about the video but it's actually
like I won't say I can't talk about too
much I don't want to spoil my video but
I don't say one thing it gives me energy
and I need it when I go to sleep like
for the more now with the next friends
to retired like that's one thing if the
tea is really really good it's almost
like addictive it kind of rounds you in
McDonald's fries but you know you
shouldn't eat all the time but like
something about it hasn't gonna predict
an agent I don't know like the tease it
has a really four that's so good to me
and I hate tea but I'll take us about
that at my next video
I know a lot of people never I know like
hey does this crappy work crap this is
definitely work is it worth it and it's
really hard to tell with that kind of
stuff because you know celebrities
always getting paid to say it works and
you never know like
they're telling the truth and it's hella
funny though one time I've seen someone
promoting a t it was a flat to me T
those another t it have to promise you
guys in her pinchers you can kind of see
where the t stop and the you have to
really pay attention it was like the T
wasn't moving it was at the same entity
in the back each time she promoted it
was showed that she was really drinking
it like she ripped it open to make some
it goes open but it was like the same te
it stank you may have a drink in that
ish anyways lets blend this out so the
contour using Ruby kits is 3d face
creator in the shade level 12 I'm gonna
use this Kat Von D brush this eye
contour brush to apply that I want to
come to my forehead I want to disturb my
baby years so I'm just gonna pass on
company double chin
you know this actually works I used to
do it now I just not really pay
attention if I really work and I just
did it like for my own comfort but like
I did this other day I took pictures and
my double chin really wasn't there
I think ass fooling these people
you think I'm skinny losing weight just
contour my jawline it actually works
it's great you can't really tell in the
video well it's in my opinion but in
pictures you could tell but good really
does work so to set underneath my eyes
in the place I concealed I'm using ler
bursts a powder translucent powder I was
use it and a Beauty Blender
okay so since I'm doing like a natural
like a freckled look I'm not gonna wear
much I sent her today I just I do want a
little bit of color my lips I'm gonna
take this Sigma blush called core DeRosa
and a little fluffy brush from morphe
this is the morphe in five eleven in
five one one no no I don't want it we're
gonna cuz everyone's nice them
differently but this one I'm using I'm
just gonna take this it's like a soft
pink blush I'm just gonna put that just
kind of all over my lid just to give it
some color I use just all the time back
where I did not do eyeshadow I would
just pull on color and kind of fluff it
all around and it'll make people think
that I actually took the time to do my
eyeshadow the secret is so set my face
i'm using my soft focus powder my black
radiance and the shade golden almond and
then let me use his Kat Von D powder
brush I'm just gonna Pat that on the
reason why I like to Pat my powder on
first before I start rubbing is because
I feel like when you have liquid on your
face if you die on up and start rubbing
it I feel like it is moving the product
or on your face and I don't know it does
something about that that just seems off
so I like to Pat it on first and then I
like to dust it away kinda wanna move
the Proctor on my face I want to stay
set you know
now once you set it and you feel that
it's dry then you can go and you know
brush the brush on your face you're
going to bling that in it's again in my
eye to really get underneath there I'm
gonna get this morphe m 509 brush and
I'm just gonna dust underneath my eyes
to get rid of that powder so caveny
brush it doesn't really get under your
eye I mean it can but it's just so much
work I'd rather get a brush that's like
mint for that so now before I did my
freckles and put some blush on I'm
getting this city color be matte blush
caught toasted coconut and get this
morphe in 500 brush we use this blush
because it barely has color but it has
just enough just to give my face some
more I don't really want to go heavy on
the blush I'm trying to keep this look
pretty natural so yeah it just simply
highlights my cheeks but not it doesn't
overdo it okay I'm gonna do my freckles
before I just like to highlight and go
any further so now time to zoom in so to
do my freckles I'm using two different
powders they're both brow powders I'm
using the ancestry of the hills brow
powder duo in chocolate looks like this
has a light brown shade and darker brown
shade
I believe you like that shape and then
I'm using benefits brow Zing's the shade
medium and I'm just using the powder
this is a cream I'm not gonna use it on
my face I'm she's in the powder and to
apply the freckles I'm using this Tarte
brush doesn't have a name it's just a
tart liner brush oh my carpet
and as an ankle and and illustrate in
and use the street
so first miss dropper taking this shade
just to play it safe and then let's
start I'm in the middle my face
now because I'm going so late you guys
want me to see it until I'm kind of like
really putting them on so I'm keeping
this powder and I'm just gonna like
pretty much to tack it pretty fast I'm
going to speed up this part just so I
know you guys will be I see it I want
you to see it so I'm gonna speed up this
part and then when it's visible I'll
come back
I guess it seemed kind of bring it on my
forward area just a little bit though um
I wanted to tell folks them right here
but I also note that realistically
speaking people typically they have
freckles it's kind of like spread out a
little bit everywhere so I'm just gonna
bring it up on my forehead a little bit
party might bring some down here my chin
haven't decided yet
I just want all flow
so weird if I take a layer on many of
the powder brush and mostly I love my
trans Lewis transyl or trans lower
powder translucent powder I think sounds
pretty cool and I'm gonna just take a
little bit my brush and dab over the
first layer cause I did
now I do this looks like I count on my
freckles look layered um I don't want
just look like okay I don't know I feel
like when you do it the first layer
first and then set it with powder and do
another layer it looks more realistic so
that's why I'm doing now I'm gonna take
the shade from benefit and then I'm
going to draw some more on this shade is
a warmer Brown um I feel like freckles
there are different color so a lot of
times so that's I'm that's I'm using two
different colors because I want it to
just have more dimension and I want them
to look real as possible
I think I'm more than a freckle so I'm
going to the same thing I did last time
and I'm gonna take this powder brush and
this transistor powder and then just set
over the freckles over I drawn
because they're not I've drawn my
freckles I'm going to take this my scare
bite art it is called lights camera
flashes and I put that on okay so after
a very light coat mascara now it's a
highlight I'm using colourpop's churro
with this more feet in five in one in
501 I'm not saying this is the first
time I light a little bit my nose very
little kind of undisturbed my freckles
so if your lips losing the JT glow lip
licker and the shape purp it's beautiful
head for a while now and I've only worn
it once I don't know why it's an awesome
color
and select my lipstick on to set my face
it means the NYX dewy finish setting
spray to give me a really like nice
natural dewy glow I'm gonna go do my
hair Mae pond choker it's action is
going on and I'll be back for Iceland
loose okay my heart would never be much
faster before you came round I was ready
to stop before you came</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
