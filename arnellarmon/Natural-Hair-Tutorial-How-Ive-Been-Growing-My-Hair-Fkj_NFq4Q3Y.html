don't know what to call it but I did saw
mammy welcome elected and I asked you
guys on snapchat you want to see it and
a lot of you screenshot it so I just
decided to film it cuz it's super easy
it's a very very simple style now this
video is also going to be me talking
about how I've been growing on my hair
it's going to be very simple because I'm
let me doing two things and let's just
get right into it all right number one
is this and this is not sponsored
although I have work this coming before
and they do pay for me to post on
Instagram this is not sponsor at all
this my opinion I'm just talking about
it has only work for me and that is a
sugar bear hair vitamins may be a little
too bright don't mind my nails you guys
on my sixth time
but um yeah I've been taking me this is
my fourth bottle and you can see it's
looking pretty empty in there
I'm kidding for four months now and I
have literally seen so much growth it's
like neither funny like I'm pissed off
but I haven't taken a while ago and to
be honest with you guys
for a while I didn't believe they worked
because I mean they're promoted by
people like the Kardashians and I don't
trust any of the growth because elderly
they'll promote anything they're paid to
promote and so it's really hard to like
determine what products really work and
what doesn't work especially like an El
loc is promote them a lot of people that
you know don't really take them they're
just guinea pig to do it so it's kind of
tricky I understand you know this is
like three dogs per bottle so it's kind
of like a driver less spend money on
that if I'm not sure if it works all the
celebrities promoting it and you know
they like my hair tell you that it
worked for me I cannot guarantee I work
for you because everyone's different
everyone's hair fall cool lots of is
different like people may take in their
hair and they grow even faster than mine
or a little slower than mine it all
depends but I know it's been working for
me so I decided to just talk about it
because I mean it's literally my
favorite thing I take them every single
day I think I was working um I don't
even know if it's necessarily the brand
itself I mean they're great brands but a
lot of like hair vitamins so I know they
all have a similar ingredients I think
it's the taste and just the fundus of
the vitamin because they're cute little
bear gummies I feel like I call the page
on Instagram and it just always inspires
me taste
they posted cutest little pictures and
they taste like candy
um that's another thing if you've never
tried them before you kind of know like
initially they look good but it really
tastes good yes you take a cup like a
very tight flavor I can't explain it I
don't just a candy and it does not taste
like a vitamin at all and they're much
better than I take you know like pills I
like taking pills um I don't I just
don't take them they get stuck in my
throwing us uncomfortable so I'm I'm
still taking a person and you're not
definitely recommend this but with
anything if you want to see results you
have to be consistent
that looks amazing um consistency do it
every single day and you'll see results
and the reason why position with this
because it tastes good
and that's what it is now number two is
the fact that I don't touch my hair at
all
I barely weary out because I mean I just
don't want to bother it I don't want to
be tended to bother it I just won't
leave it alone um I haven't dyed or
straighten your dat to my hair Oh in
months I hadn't been counting I I'm
going to encapsulate after this video by
having the Kelty whatsoever but I
haven't anything to it that's because
one because I don't once he likes one
let it grow but to excite my boyfriend I
might year because he knows that I want
to grow my hair out so he's kind of like
helping discipline weeks I'm going to be
less discipline that's one thing I do
not have I suck but he is always on me
like pretty much toast rating it don't
diet
don't touch it I'm gonna pay you right
and I'm ever since I've been doing that
it's been growing and flourishing I'm
gonna follow me on my channel for a
while you know that what my hair you
know you've seen the stage in my hair
and how short it used to be and so it's
destined grow and flourish II and I'm
going to keep my Porsche
I know I need to add some type of like
face mask mask face mask hair mask
deconditioning and so my regiment i'm
just i'm structural - you said i
probably with DIY one and i'll film that
and let you guys know how it goes but
for now i should be doing those two
things them taking my vitamins it is
being consistent wearing wigs every
single base kind of styles not touching
my hair whatsoever and it's been growing
so unless I've watched tutorial I don't
want this interested be super log I just
want to be informative and very helpful
but on if you like this video if you
want more like natural haircare videos
let me know and I'll do them and I'll
see you guys later all right I'm trying
to move fast I just got the shower my
hair's already drying my hair is very
dry dries very fast
so I don't have to like pretty much I
mean leave a prize in it before it dries
out and so the first problem we use is
that diva curl ultra defining gel and
just hair gel in my hair right off so
fast
that's like will be like get it before
it dries Sark is my little tractor
cutting grass conveniently oh mighty
almost and bother me and wipe them off I
believe you're like how do er it looks
types of cross and you brush it through
before add more I'm just using a little
comb to brush it back part my hair so
dry
alright so the test I don't have my
cream I'm going to use I don't know if
they're still cancels or not but I got
to use it
my Shea Moisture a curl enhancing
smoothie I'm going to use that
alright I like using a cream in a gel
keeps my hair more moisturized but the
visa curl drill I usually use I mean the
cream it doesn't last long
I always run out of it like it is on a
roll
saturate my hair that you know I'm
careful looks white right now I'm just
try and make sure that my hair is
saturated and I focus one product of the
front than the back because the frustum
is showing the back I'm going to gel
that up anyway so doesn't need a whole
bunch of product but meets a nice little
fresh cut through with my comb to brush
again
I'm pretty messy while doing it
all right so now it's time cart okay so
I made this gel it's a newer one it's a
black castor and Black Sea oil but eco
style you're not using with the right
vehicle style but I try try this line
segment here to bat in the drought and
then I'm going to take a brush and gel
up the side I have more flick and my
hair like it's looking rowing so much
like if you don't watch my video then
you've seen videos of me my natural
before you could tell that my hair is
really been growing a lot and I know
it's ruined just like when I wear my
wigs you guys know how I split my hair
back all the time it's getting harder
and harder just looking back like in a
minute I'm gonna have to do braids
because it's becoming harder to slip
back and that's because being longer so
I also draw the back
I split that part up I can't move all
the hair sits front
like so
we're all to the frame
all right and then I get a toothbrush in
the same gel and kind of like this
buying the slice little wife I can make
the prettier I like will lay my edges to
your in this part like so
and make sure it's really laid like that
mouth has a scarf now let me put the
scarf you a sandwich from and you know
food review over here brought over me I
actually kind of want it make this car
became business card by turns when hair
scarf till pretty much I've ever
American Apparel unlimited so much about
for American Apparel and it came with
like Anthony scarf but I've left expert
really thick and big and we love the
textbooks because they don't have a neck
up here anymore so I'm not sure what you
can advise kind of scarf for the
advanced mini scarf and I pretty much
cut it in half well I see I'm like three
of these because they're scarf is so big
I believe it cut through piece out of it
and um yeah just make this alright guys
so I've already done this like two times
already but it keeps slipping so I'm
kind of working with it um it's not
really perfect the first time you'd have
to do it over until you like have it how
you like it
so instructions over I'm going to cut
the other two three tries out so you get
a scarf and you want to let flip it in
words you can't see where it's messed up
where you put a little bit I mean I'm
just keep up this and maybe then it
won't slip off my head then you want to
wrap it around like so and you pull it
to the front like that now make sure
most of the hair is out then you have
twisted like these
and then you slowly start to put it into
a knot now my issue we're not we're all
doing it and when I always do it that
it's list them on the side and so
instead of like making a tight nut I'm
just going to go around I'm going to do
it very loosely cuz it's how he pulled
the not the tidy pulled the scarf my
neighbors were tattooing a little that
noise oh why
anyway the tire cover not the tire you
pull the scarf so I'm just not going
pull it tight
me make sure I'm looking perfect and so
now I'm going to pull some hair out or I
have to get a little rough but it's cool
cuz it's put on my style now become my
hair dried out a little bit put the
scarf on add just a little more at the
shade moisture gets all the scarf but my
flame is gone
you
that's the main styles done I'm gonna go
back in and kind of lay my baby hairs a
little more
and then why let's do those to get the
comb and out pull a little bit of hair
from the side now get the toothbrush and
this kind of curl inside
and I have some pieces from my hair
that's straight I really don't know why
I have it touched it and take care of it
I'm just going to like curl them just
let it get form into a curl more defined
curl all right now now quickly we'll do
some makeup on parts of the other kids
moisturizer eyebrows and then my then
the club should be dried and it won't be
whitey more and then you know just
finished look all right so don't make it
really fast quick look everybody will
come I did very like foundation I'd see
the stick foundation and I just rub
through my hand
so what they'd like to pigmented and I
just put a little highlight on that I
can't brush away to my brows they're
like la mascara that is it and the hair
dries so the hair my hair dry and so
