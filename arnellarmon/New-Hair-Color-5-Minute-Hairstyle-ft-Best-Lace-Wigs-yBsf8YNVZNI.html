meet hey guys welcome back to my what I
do that
hey guys all right put your hands down
hey guys looking back to my channel if
you're new welcome hello
I'm ray now if you can't tell by my
channel name um I just got done filming
this look well actually I've finished an
hour ago then I went out took a burrito
break still gets a burrito and somewhere
China so that's my lipsticks different
because I mean burritos and liquid lips
just don't really work well together so
I've learned so I have a glass eye right
now but in the video my lipsticks was
different so quick little thing about
this hair cuz obviously have a new hair
color I change my hair every single day
I got this hammer best placed wig so
this is a little review for them but
honestly it won't be much review because
I have I don't really have anything bad
to say about the night I mean it's all
good
pretty much you guys see the color it's
beautiful the hair came like this this
is the remainder of the one of the last
bundles I had and so it came like a it
looks black but in the light when I
really look at it it's like a 1b and I
still see some Gray's so it's pretty
natural to me and so I just like to dye
it because I I'm planning a little wig
and you know she loves her hair I'm
light and so I decided to do this
practice so I didn't feel myself doing
this however I'm gonna feel myself do a
little wig and her color and all that
stuff so if you like this color just
take you for that video which would be a
very very soon but um yeah I literally
just got this hair by bleached it and
then toning it and it was pretty simple
so I made a wait I have a 360 lace
frontal and they sent three bundles but
I used two and a half and so this is
like the remainder of the bundle now the
only thing I could say that I guess I
guess this will count as a negative is
that when I post his hair on snapchat so
I got this hair in the mail I was so
excited cuz the bundles were thick as
hell like I'll insert a page right here
they're super duper thick so while this
hair feels beautiful like I already
planned on bleaching NYX I knew the type
of hair dye can really take bleach and
still like be healthy and nice so when I
first over here I put on my snapchat if
you don't follow me on snapchat you
totally should it'll be in the
description box but um I got a message
from a girl and she asked me where the
hair from I told her and she said she's
alright from them before but her bundles
were as thick so it could be a case
where
you know sometimes I notice haircut
maybe I'll send the reviewers more you
know to make it look good
I think the hair quality itself is nice
however I wouldn't expect the bundles to
be super thick now that's the only one
person experienced so it may not be
everyone sequential order for them I
just thought it'd be you know helpful to
tell you guys that but I mean hey it's
your coin I'm here till you I like the
hair not which I do and you could decide
what you want to do after that so um
yeah I think that's pretty much it
oh I found this makeup look I'm oily
right now so don't mind me okay
yeah I feel let's make a look so that'd
be up pretty soon too probably tomorrow
we're never finished editing it very
much it over I like the hair and meat I
love this color that's the first time
I've ever had hair like this light all
the way around I've done things when I
have like um braids and did a tip slide
but that's the first time I actually
like have the whole entire headlight and
I love this wicked own anyone take it
off I'm just gonna have to exact other
hair to review and I had that's what's
with my hair so much you have to like
put out so many videos but Oliver I love
this hair you guys will see where this
way again trust believe that and I mean
I'll when I do wear to can I give it
updated review because I notice when you
bleach hair it may feel nice when you're
first bleaching but you kinda have to
give it time you know to see what
happens a comic what's your real hair
when you bleach it it may seem fine at
first and then it takes a while for the
damage tickin so we'll see what happens
with that but so far so good look I
don't really see this hair you know
going bad I hope not pray for me but
yeah this interests been pretty long so
I'm gonna cut it right here the video
will be really short I'm just show you
guys how I got these quick curls like
they're quick five-minute curls it looks
like you put a lot of effort into here
when you really didn't and yeah if you
liked this video please give a thumbs up
and if you don't sorry
but if you're not subscribed please do
so right now and I'll see you my next
video alright so this is the Heron
Strait looks beautiful Street ik o my
god but you guys know I can't keep one
stuff too long I taught to switch it up
and see how looked it was curled I
didn't looks beautiful both ways and
this is just a beautiful color so Harry
I'm just brushing and be a little extra
you guys see those highlights oh my god
it wasn't on purpose but I'm gonna take
these scissors so don't worry
oh my god oh don't worry I'm going to
I'm not going to just chop all the hair
off I'm just
going to cut some beans well they won't
be to bangy I just want to cut the front
part it's a little shorter just so it's
more body in that front part so you
gotta see this I just cut little bangs
but like not too baggy you know what I
mean
I'm just really obsessed this wig I'm
just the hair I'm gonna test with the
color it's so beautiful they'd never
want to get off and I'm really sad so
I'm gonna have to but I just love
everything about this it just it's so
easy to lay so flat it hasn't given me a
headache at all so it's just it's
perfect I love when I make wigs that are
perfect so anyways I'm taking the
flatter I'm gonna pretty much pull the
flattering back and curl it backwards
that way when it falls and drops it's
more body like that I love those tie
bangs you guys like it's my favorite
thing and so this style I used to do all
the time when I was in high school and
having up until now because it's so
simple like you literally just take
random pieces and big pieces you don't
have to take small pieces and you just
curl them and you mainly you mainly
focus on the front you want the front
slit the best once you get to the back
you kind of just have to curl the ends
of it you don't have to curl each strand
by just like this style because I'm
Dieker lead you guys see at the end I'm
just gonna brush my fingers through them
and just give you these really nice
natural soft waves and it literally only
takes five minutes like the video sped
up is about five minutes so when you
slow down it it's like about ten minutes
but that's because I was filming alright
so um yeah it takes like five minutes
like literally literally five six
minutes by seven minutes I feel like
slowing you're new at this but once you
really get the hang of it and you start
doing it all the time it's so simple
it's like the best hairstyle you could
think of and it may look kind of like to
traditional at first because it looks
like waterfall curls but you gotta see
like once I like run my hands through it
it just like the perfect waves
by the way you guys best lace wigs they
are still having their little Black
Friday so which ends in like a few hours
so if you're interested persons hair I
would totally do it right now have you
honestly always purchased the hair just
so you want to save some money but this
sounds awesome like the more I look at
this video a little more I realize how
much I like it I never know how much
like hair until I'm filming the video
that I'm editing it I got actually see
it from like you guys point of view and
it's just so beautiful like the lustre
how it's curling it's just so easy to
work with I just I'm so obsessed
once again I'm curling the hair you turn
to run your fingers through and you get
to see you'll create these really nice
waves which looks beautiful with this
hair color and I'm it's pretty simple
like I don't even know why this video is
so long oh yeah until if you're me and
you want to look perfect or you want the
curls to be a little bigger once you're
done you run your fingers through them
you can kind of like assess the
situation and so I assess you I realize
I want to cut one more little piece
straight body in that bang area and then
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna just
define some of the curls a little more
and you know you guys said I'm doing I
just like I like the hair to look
perfect so this how perfect it
all right so after you're done feeling
myself playing with the hair this is
pretty much the finished look and I'm
gonna go put on some clothes and Here I
am I really love this hair color I love
everything about I love the hair I love
everything I love this whole entire
videos actually really fun editing
because I'm just like wow this looks
amazing
although it's like my under-eye
concealers a little too light but we're
going to talk about that well we'll
discuss that and make a video so yeah
