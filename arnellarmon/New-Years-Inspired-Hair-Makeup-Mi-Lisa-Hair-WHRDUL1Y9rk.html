days the first day when I had just made
the wig that I'm wearing the beginning
this video this week is so nice you guys
you gotta see in one second so first I'm
going to put some godspeed glue in my
hair that way when I put the wig on it
like stays on my head so I'm just like
squeezing a lob down my head and I'm
just kind of brushing it through the
front section I don't have to put on the
back so I'm gonna put a wig stocking cap
on anyways so I'm just brushing through
the front and first I'm gonna show you
guys just what I did I don't like
getting out my mistakes first I put on
this super light pale wig cap by
changing it because it's almost too
light if my scalp isn't that color so
here's the wig this hairs on my Lysa
hair they sent to me five bundles and a
closure the Lintz and all the exact
details will be down below but they send
me this closure that's like pre plucked
which is awesome because ought to do is
bleach it and that's the only
customization to do this closure came
pretty much pre plush with baby hairs
and everything and so it was so easy to
work with and you got to see that you
know as I style my hair but it was super
easy to work with so this hair is like a
body wave texture by end up straining it
because it was just easier to manage
that way and I'm gonna want curl later
so I treated my son cap and it looks
much better now I'm going to straighten
the hair which didn't take too long I
enter the best job though like well I
did but you able to see once I'm done
straighten the hair I didn't get the
middle but that's cuz I can't see the
back of me so it's not perfect here I'm
just oh my god sorry guys had to go tame
my child so I strain the hair you guys
see it looks really good except for that
one little middle section but it looks
so nice so now I'm gonna customize the
front and I'm gonna talk too much during
that because I mean I didn't really do
much because it was already customized
for me this part came and swam the
closure and it already had baby hair so
I had to do is kinda like put powder on
the part and I had to like tweeze the
baby eyes just a little bit but it was
so it was just so easy to work with you
guys I'm just you know use some edge
control I'm using my favorite ash
control at the moment it's my kiss and
I'm just really kind of just finessing
this whole situation so let's just watch
me now check back in later
goddammit DJ DS you did it again so I
finished you no finesse in the close
situation put some oil in the hair you
know brush it through the hair just to
make it look more silky this hair so
nice it's it's beautiful and so the next
day which is why I glad you changed and
you know my whole setup change because I
I'll explain later but the next day I
decided that because it's a New Year's
look I didn't want to just kind of like
do something boring and simple like
straight hair not saying that
straighteners boring but like for me I
feel like for a New Year's look I just
want to do something that's more like
extra so I decide to want to curl my
hair so I'll show you guys meanwhile
curling one half of this wig and then
I'll do the other half of camera I just
want to show you guys to show you guys
how easy the one the hair wand curls and
the reason why it's so easy is because
this is hair came as body wave it's
gonna be easy to wave it back up and the
waves are gonna actually hold so I don't
have to you know use any spray or
anything I just want coat this hair and
I just got the prettiest messy messiest
curls like they're super pretty so I'm
stop talking and check back in when I'm
done
goddammit DJ did it again
throughout the hair looks so good I know
so time to start the makeup which is
surprising quite easy so first time
prime my skin using the Finn T pro
filter primer this is all I use right
now so I'm just gonna prime using that
for foundation I'm using the Finn T
Beauty foundation mix with my Genest the
airbrush foundation I have receded video
on I mix these two the other day that
really light them together so I decided
to just go with that it kind of creates
like the perfect base so I pump a little
foundation on my face first and I spray
some and I just mix the two together and
it like creates the perfect perfect
canvas so to conceal I'm using my Kevyn
Aucoin sensual skin enhancer now it's
gonna look a little too light which it
kind of is but in order to kind of fix
that I just use the same sponge I used
to blend on my foundation and I kind of
like I don't add any extra foundation I
use the excess foundation on the sponge
and that kinda like just tones the color
down and it makes it look super perfect
and flawless so to contour my news my
Anastacio stick foundation I always used
to contour I don't know why I just I
love it and I mean I have a whole bunch
them cuz backhauls on her PR list they
sent me like a whole dark set so I just
I use them because I have them so I'm
gonna blend that out really fast and
then after I blend out my contour I am
going to set the place I conceal and I'm
using my Patrick Starr powder I love
this powder as you guys already know and
um yeah let me use that I'm gonna set
the place I can seal first and we'll put
an extra layer on top of that in order
to do my eyeshadow to like you know
avoid fallout so I did one I have camera
I came up with this looks I feel like
you could do any type of lip look with
it and so I'll clean up a little later
and so to prime my lid I'm using my
lemonade prayer my benefit it's a color
correcting primer so if you have like
reddish lids which I don't however I
still like to use it this primer is
perfect cause it kind of like tones out
any redness or any like discoloration
and then use my violet Voss Pro palette
this is called hashtag and I'm gonna
start off by using this light shade
called fresh as a base I'm gonna put
that all over my lid on top of that I'm
going to take this shape sauce
and I'm going to just kind of place it
on top because you know I don't want to
be too like to build up the color and
you know just slowly make it darker and
darker and so I'm just gonna like buff
that in and then I'm going to take this
shade test and G ot built the greatest
of all time it gave me and I'm just
going like focus that towards matta
crease its I look just kind of messy and
it's okay if it is I just I did like
Browns and burgandy's that way you can
do a red lip with this you can do the
burgundy lip with this you can do a
brown lip a gloss you could kind of do
like any lip color with this if you're
really thinking about it and so that's
why I kind of win from these colors now
I'm going to take my morphe 39a palette
and I'm just using this palette for the
Browns because the violet balls they
don't really have the Browns I'm going
for and I'm just gonna take these Browns
and put that on top of where I put the
purpley color because I want to be like
a mixture of brown and burgundy
goddammit d jb --lv did it again
naps in my fancy beauty galaxy palette
let me use this brown shimmery shade
which inspired this eye look Evan makes
a little bit with this gold and I'm just
gonna like use my finger I'm gonna grab
the brush in a second and I'm just gonna
apply that to my lid I like this because
it kind of a mess he doesn't really use
me neat because the color kind of blends
right into the shadow and then once I'm
done I'm Chino taking a little bit of my
foundation powder I kind of like helping
diffuse the outside just to make it look
more blended you know some of the best
and blending now to send my entire face
I mean I make it for ever ultra matte
loose powder it's super rad loose powder
it's it's a loose powder and it's matte
and I'm just gonna bump that to my skin
and dust away that powder underneath my
eyes
and then I'm gonna go back to my house
just to fix it to Little Mix I felt like
I could bring this shadow just a little
bit inwards because I felt like it kind
of stopped and it looked a little harsh
so I took a like a light brown shade and
I kind just fixed that a little bit so
it's bothering me and then um yeah just
kind of like perfecting the eyelid right
now so two cent on my contour I'm taking
my hoola bronzer by benefit I like using
this to contour because it's more cooler
tone so it kind of really makes my
cheeks look super chiseled and then for
blush I'm gonna take my Bobbi Brown I
think it's pretty coral or peachy coral
this is one of the first high-end
blushes I ever bought it actually is the
first high-end blush every baht and I'm
kind of gonna go crazy with that blush
and kind of like use a little bit that
blush underneath my eyes too so I feel
like my my under eye looked a little bit
white so I you know took some that blush
put underneath my eyes just add a little
more color so I'm gonna do my brows
off-camera BAM did my brows now to set
my face i'm using the mac fix+ I sent my
face before like I do my mascara I
noticed that if you have a blush that
looks too light set your face and it'll
kind of expose the real color makes it
brighter now I'm gonna like remove the
excess chapstick for my lips and I'm
gonna line my lips using this morphe
lipliner it's the Orpha or I forgot your
name
but it's her collab with them it's
called vinyl i'ma line my lips using
that and I'm gonna take two lip colors
one is my huda beauty and I don't even
know the name I just got us into me and
I saw the color and I thought it would
kind of go with the look I'm going for
so I'm gonna use that first and on top
of them uses she Tiger lactic we're just
lighter like purpley she and even I did
these colors I thought it was a little
too red it wasn't I wanted it to be more
burgundy and so I'm gonna on top of
these two colors I take color pop
teeny-tiny which is Oh kind of like an
odd purpley shade and I mix that and to
kind of get the color I was going for
and I was pretty satisfied with that and
so I had to put that on I go back and I
kind of like just perfect the lips you
know realign them and I'm take concealer
and kind of clean up around the lip area
I know that when I do bold lips I like
to clean up around the lip area because
it just makes it look so much more
neater and just like crisp so I'm going
to do that really quick to highlight I'm
using the artist couture times Jackie on
a clap this is lip peach I love this
highlighter it looks so good on my nose
I hadn't mastered using artist couture
highlights just yet though because since
they're a loose powder I'm not used to
using loose highlighters so I flick I
haven't mastered it there was one time
where I got it riding it looked so good
but like time like this I don't think it
looked as good as it could have looked
because I don't know like I think it's a
brush I'm using I just I haven't
mastered okay but it looks nice so for
mascara I'm using these two by mac one
is called in extreme dimension the other
one I don't know the name cuz I just got
it at got it at Nordstrom Rack but it'll
be double of course I'm just gonna use
the in extreme dimension for my top
lashes and then the other one for my
bottom lashes because it has like a
smaller applicator
so after do my mascara I noticed that um
don't the look so I don't go change to
my outfit and this is the final look it
looks like pretty this also cry one of
my favorite like tutorials ever cuz
they're just the whole look from the
hair to the makeup everything just looks
