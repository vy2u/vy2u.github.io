super excited for next year um during
the tutorial and I'll see you in my next
video
one more shot for this highlight okay
right so I already have my foundation on
I'm wearing the Bears game by bare
minerals foundation in the shade bear
honey mixed my custom cover drops by
cover of X in the shade in 70 so to
conceal first I'm gonna take my
Maybelline instant age rewind the color
fair and then I get my la girl Pro
concealer in the color warm honey and
I'm going to apply that using a real
techniques concealer brush I've had this
brush for almost three years now and I
honestly Real Techniques afraid the best
burst I've ever used because they
literally don't break down ever so as
you can see I'm just placing tool over
my mouth under my eyes on my chin I kind
of placed in place I typically don't
place them but I just don't watch a lot
of tutorials and I see these different
tricks that I want to try so that's what
I'm doing
and so after I placed that in the areas
where I want the consumer to be I'm
gonna blend it out with the Beauty
Blender yeah and you did yeah you just
wanna pretty much this blend blend blend
and as always I'm use my Ruby kisses 3d
face creator to cream contour and I'm
gonna place that on my cheekbones on my
forehead and I'm gonna place on my
jawline as well and my nose are those
things called cheekbones I thought it's
it's the wrong thing I just I know
there's another name for that where I
please come down my cheeks I just can't
think of it it's like in the and the
depth of my cheek I don't know usually
word that that's all that matters now
the brush I'm used to blender my contour
is by Sigma it's a 3d HD kabuki brush
and yeah this time is my first time
using I can put on my contour and it
works amazingly I even kind of slow mode
this part so you can see how its
structured and how is made which is why
it's able to really do that blending
then it's doing yeah it's a really nice
brunch honestly to really blend out my
forehead contour and use my peter bergna
sponge I honestly just want anything for
them look as small as possible
cuz we can see the thing is kind of big
if you know what I mean
then I want to blend on my nose contour
I kind of blend in it
mega much but you know it's all turned
out fine and that's all that matters to
me
so it's not the place that I can feel
and I'm using a banana pad web in my
life always and I'm pretty much gonna
put that powder everywhere put concealer
on but I'm also going to put it
underneath where I placed my contour
just to make my contour look more
intense now for the eyes first you wanna
start with the prime - I use my lemonade
primer by benefit and I'm gonna get the
shade by makeup geek in the color
Barcelona Beach and I pretty much place
that shadow all over my lid and I'm
gonna get the shade Morocco by makeup
geek I don't know what it's what's up
with me and like eyeshadows called
Morocco but they're always my favorite
and I'm just gonna place that on top of
where I put the Barcelona Beach and then
I'm gonna get Coco bear by makeup geek
which is like the most popular shade
ever and I'm gonna place that kind of
like in the corner of my eyes just kind
of deepen that so for my lid I'm gonna
use two blues I'm gonna use center stage
by makeup geek and houdini by makeup
geek and I'm gonna play center stage
starting from the inner corner of my
eyes and on to the middle of my lid then
I'm gonna get the houdini color and use
it towards the edge of my eyes I hope
I'm explaining this rate but you guys
are see what I'm doing anyways I haven't
got used to explain me what I'm doing it
and then I'm gonna take the shade now to
come and make a peak to put it on the
outer corner of my eyes to deepen that
and by the way to put on the shadows on
my lids the shimmery ones I used my
mixing medium by Mac just to make sure
that the shimmer stay in place and it
doesn't get all over my lid being that
my lips are kind of hooded and very
freakin annoying I have to use that
stuff in so for the bottom part of me
I'm going to use a shake cocoa beragon
and just sweep that all underneath my
eye and then I'm going to get the shade
not a
on the outer corner of my eye just to
deepen that part so back to the face I'm
going to set my entire thing using my
mac mineralize skinfinish in the color
medium deep and the I'm clean dust all
that powder that I let cook yeah I'm
doing it I'm letting cook now I
don't know who I'm becoming but yeah I
guess I did it whatever I got a little
with I'm gonna get my Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour kit I'm just gonna place
the shade banana underneath my eye just
to brighten it a little bit and I'm also
gonna place the powder on my nose a
little bit on my forehead I'm gonna go
underneath my contour just to intensify
it a little bit more then I'm going to
take the shape Ivana and I'm going to
just go over my contour just intensify
that
and for blush I decide to use spellbound
by a makeup heat it's a really really
really soft pink but I want to do really
soft blush because my eye look is quite
intense so I didn't want to be too much
going on my face it's a highlight I'm
going to use my colors pop list and as
you guys can see I put a lot of that
stuff on yeah this stuff is amazing it's
yeah it's it's highlight alright it's
definitely highlight my god guys so
please don't mind my unlaid edges I
don't know what I didn't do my hair
honestly I don't know what the heck was
going on through my head I also placed
that highlight underneath my brow bone
at first I put a little too much on and
yeah this wasn't the right brush to do
that with but I figured it out and yes I
highlighted my brow bone which is
something I don't do often no one ever
realizes it though but I never really do
it now for lips first I'm gonna line my
lips using this lip pencil by eyetality
deluxe and the shade Brown now guys
these pencils are some of the best ones
I've ever used
and so after I get done lining my lips I
get in drogyny by jeffree star cosmetics
I'll just place that all over my lips
and that's pretty much it now if you're
not a blue person you could easily
replace that lid shade with another
color the base colors I used are pretty
neutral so they can kind of go with any
shade maybe green meet purple or gold
but this look you can honestly do
anything with it
and this is it and I hope you guys
