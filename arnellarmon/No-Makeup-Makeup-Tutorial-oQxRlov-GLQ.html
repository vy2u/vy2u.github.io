I'm going to prep it first using my
vitamin C serum by Mabel and Meg I've
been using a serum for about 17 days so
it's a little for two weeks and so I'm
just gonna give you guys my opinion on
it one thing I noticed for sure is that
it leaves my skin feeling super hydrated
also notice that unlike other serums
it's very lightweight and it's not
sticky or tacky at all because sometimes
serums can add I like sticky tacky
filling to it I've also note that's
helped my skin tone become more even
which is like one of the more things
that care about when I'm not wearing
makeup when I'm done applying my serum I
get my h2o + Beauty hydrate remittance
pretty much is like a super duper
hydrating moisturizer and I've been
using it for about a week and a half
ever since I got it I literally I
haven't used anything else I've been
neglecting all mounted moisturizers
because this one it's super hydrating
and it gives my skin like a tingling
feeling I can't describe it but I really
like it
so to prime my skin today I'm using a
black Ravens true complexion shine
control primer oh my god it's such a
long name and this is pretty much like a
mattifying primer it helps with oily
skin so I'm going to apply that all over
my face
for foundation I'm using my Ruby kisses
3d face creator and the shade level 11
now you guys know I've been using the 3d
face creator since like for freaking
ever for over a year now and I always
thought that it was just for like
contouring and highlighting but turns
out it's actually a concealer /
foundation and I did not know that I
don't know how I didn't know that but um
today I just decided to just use as a
foundation I really like it you know I
was always scared to try this foundation
because very very creamy so I assumed
it'd be cakey but when you blend out
with your finger first you know it kind
of like warms a product up and then when
you go over with the Beauty Blender
which you guys can see me do it makes it
super duper smooth and seamless and
natural-looking as you guys will see
soon
to conceal I'm going to be using the
Ruby kisses pure mineral concealer in
the shade warm honey now this shade is
pretty much my foundation shade I did
that on purpose because if I'm going for
a no makeup look I don't want no makeup
I mean a no makeup makeup look I don't
want to look like a half an sealer on so
I want to just use some that was super
close to my skin tone wool that was my
skin tone so you can't really tell that
I'm actually wearing concealer now I'm
going to contour and it may seem like a
leg where I see contouring if she
doesn't want to click she has makeup on
but the way I'm going to contour is
gonna be very natural and it's going to
just define my cheekbones and the shade
I'm using to contour is just one level
up from my foundation shade so it's
actually very natural I just I have to I
have to contour okay I want my cheeks to
be very defined so after I'm done
playing on my contour I'm just gonna set
underneath my eyes my forehead and my
nose with my Laura Mercier powder I'm
pretty much accenting places that I
don't want to crease or places that
typically get oily because I don't want
my makeup to get aurélie I need to last
all day which by the way it did I filmed
this video the other day and yeah it
definitely lasted I used mainly
drugstore products all super-impressed
now to set my entire face I'm using this
Ruby kisses foundation powder in the
shade caramel and yes I'm just setting
my face with that
so to slightly define my little natural
contour I'm just taking this Ruby kisses
foundation powder in the shade chestnut
and I'm just like kind of going over it
but very very very lightly now I shall
put on blush to give my face of color
I'm using this Sigma blush cloud quarter
rosa now I put too much on well loosen
my opinion they look that natural so I
just go about back over it with my
foundation brush and just blend that out
to make a look all seamless now it's
time for the brows I did one broth
camera you know exciting want this video
to be super long I'm taking the new Ruby
kisses Goa brow brow pencil it's very
similar to the brow definer manis s
Beverly Hills and I mean like by the
shape and by the quality of the pencil
now you guys know if you've been on my
channel for a while I act like I've been
on here for a long if you've seen
somebody did you know I'm very picky
when it comes to brow products because I
feel like it's very hard to find it was
a pencils a lot of brow pencils
typically they're too creamy and
pigmented so it's very hard to like get
a natural looking brow with brow pencils
unless they're good quality and I was
super impressed by this brow pencil
because as you guys can see it's going
on very light but you could still build
up the color and that's what I look for
when I'm looking for a good brow pencil
so I was like okay Ruby kisses like come
through with the brow pencil by the way
the shade I'm using is rich chocolate
brown if you own a Nastasia pencil it's
pretty much like the same shade as
chocolate just to give you a little
reference yeah so I'm just going to
continue to my brow you guys will see me
kind of mess up and fix it I don't
really like cutting out my mistakes so I
just kind of like go the flow of things
but if you want a more detailed brow
tutorial I do have a broad tutorial
using a pencil and I'll leave the link
below
to clean up my bra Muse in the same in
second still I used underneath my eyes
earlier and I'm just going to just go
underneath my brow and clean that thing
up and then after I put the concealer
I'm gonna need a q-tip and wipe it away
if you've watched my bra tutorials you
know why I do this
I just hate concealing my brows I don't
like it so I just get rid of it the only
thing is I actually wiped away like half
of my brow so you guys are gonna see me
go back in and add my brow back we have
than that you know my brows were looking
low-key lit
to set my brows amuses Ruby kisses brow
gel and I just put on very lightly super
simple super easy to highlight a and
color pops glow up from the kpop
collection and it's a very nice soft
golden highlight I'm just playing my
nose I live with my Cupid's bow and on
my little cheek and I wouldn't take my
finger warmth the product just so kind
of like seeps into my skin a little more
to make it look more natural because I
don't want to be obvious that I've
highlight on but I want some highlight
on my face to set my makeup uses when
wild size spray that would not show up
in the camera so I was like you know
what eff it it's when wild okay they
only have like one setting spray so
that's what I used and then I'm waiting
for my students pretty dry and we'll
take my black radiance lip gloss and now
it does have a name but the number on
the little bottle or whatever lip gloss
thingy it's 30 to 54 for those of you
that are interested now I'm taking my
mascara which is by Maybelline and I use
this color black Brown because I feel
like black Browns more natural than
black
so after I put the mascara on that's
premise into this look this look is so
easy and I've been totally digging
natural makeup so I'm absolutely in love
with this look it's perfect if you don't
have much time do your makeup because
honestly this look only takes about five
minutes so I'm not recording so yeah I
really hope you guys like this be sure
to like comment and subscribe and I'll
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
