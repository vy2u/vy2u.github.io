you're new welcome first things first
this year I'm talking slower because I
just film this intro like three times
and I realized I do have a talking fast
problem and I get some of those comments
I see them try to ignore them I don't
want to change but any talk slower so I
just got done filming this look this
look right here this really nice bit
like simple globe heat see look and I
use a drugstore products and the props
and use are from when wild who are
sponsoring this video so thank you too
and while they send me a whole bunch of
their new products and I was able to
pretty much create this look out of what
I got sent and because their new
products and they're the first time I'm
using these products my it's a Saints
right because I own this um I'm going to
give my first impressions during the
video now I'm going to be doing it over
voice over which is kind of weird
because usually first impressions are
talked ters but if you could tell them
my voice I am sick and I don't even know
like why it's taking me so long to get
over this cold but hey where the case
may be
mmm I wasn't gonna talk to this video
cuz I have a coffee not been sickly and
I just thought that'd be weird
so my first impressions will be given on
my voiceover and I'll talk to you guys
about what I think about their new
product so if you want to hear about
what I think and you want to see how
creepy this look just keep on watching
the video and if you do like this video
please give it a thumbs up please
subscribe and I'll see you in my next
one
alright so first I'm going to my brows
using the one wild ultimate brow
universal stencil kit I'm gonna use a
wet wild angle brush in order to do this
now I'm gonna use these two Brown shapes
and I play that and I'm going to pretty
much focus the darker shade towards the
end of the brow and the lighter shade
towards the beginning of the brow to
create a gradient effect so yeah but
before I continue to my brow and take
the concealer this also I went wild and
I'm going to place a little bit
underneath the brow and this just to
give me more guidance to make it more
sharp I'm gonna take another wet wild
brush to blend that out now as far as
their brow products my first impression
on the products I think it's pretty nice
for a brown powder however I'm not
best at doing my brows with just powder
only because it's just I don't really
have a lot of brow hairs as it is so
it's hard for me to get the powder to
stick so this brow kit will be great if
you already have brows however if your
brow hairs already sparse it may be a
little tricky for you I mean of course
you can make it work it just then take
you a little longer versus if you had
like a pencil or cream so yeah that's my
opinion on that but the concealers nice
I like the concealer because it blends
out very easily so I did that brow and
I'm going to the other brow off-camera
and I'll be right back so I did both
brows by the way it looks very warm in
the front part eyebrow but it doesn't
say that in person um I don't know why
my camera makes it like that but it
looks better in person
now I'm gonna take the one Walt coverall
primer now this primer I really like I
felt on my skin because I didn't have
like a silicon primer feel to it it kind
of rubs right into my skin like a nice
moisturizer so I really did enjoyed this
primer and after I primed my skin you
guys see how easy it just kind of rubs
to my skin like every like it I'm gonna
use a new wet water foundation now I
already have my opinion on this
foundation because before I from this
video I use it a day before in order to
get my shade and the foundation is so
nice look I'm actually out looks kind of
shocked because you know it's drugstore
and adjunctive foundations are really a
hit-or-miss and you really never know
until you try to wear it for a day but
this foundations
awesome it blends out super easily and
by the way I'm using a wet wild buffer
brush but it blends out super easily and
it just I can't describe the finish it's
not too matte but it's not dewy it's
like right in the middle which is
perfect to me you guys see that you guys
see what I mean it just looks flawless
and it feels very lightweight but it's
full coverage is a really good
foundation
though after I was done bleeding on my
foundation I want to go back and fix my
brows is really bothering me and I
finally figure it out like why or what I
was doing wrong so in this brow kit it
actually comes to the wax now I didn't
know that it was a wax because it's like
a pink shade so I thought I don't think
this belongs on your brows but when you
mix with a powder you can't actually see
the pink tone so all I have to do is get
that wax and he mixed with the powder
and it helps the powder stick to your
brows even more and so once I figure
this I was much happier because another
thing with powders that when you don't
have brows the ends of your brows they
always end up smudging or getting wiped
off so I'm happy
I would like decide to not be scared and
just use this wax
all right so now to conceal I'm taking
this one wild photo folks concealer and
I'm going to get underneath my eyes and
my chin by the way all the shades and
everything I'm using will be down below
so if you're wondering that don't worry
everything we down below but as far as
concealer goes I liked it I noticed I
was very easy to blend out and I used to
brush to blend this out because I was
really committed so only using wet and
wild products so typically I would blend
out with a sponge but I used to brush
and it blends it out super fast so I
know that if I were to get a Beauty
Blender or like some type of sponge it'd
be even more easy to work with but you
know I had to do I have to do by the way
these wouldn't want brushes are really
nice like they're so brilliant I it's
like I haven't used brush to blend out
stuff and I don't know how long I just I
just don't do it cuz sponges are easier
but they're actually really easy to work
with and they blend the products out
super easily like as if it's a sponge
so now it's time to contour I'm taking
this contour stick now to be honest at
first sight I think this will show up in
my skin um because I noticed usually
things in these kind of packaging
there's another brand I will mention
that has similar packaging like this and
it does not show up at all so I was like
oh my god I know one of these but when I
put on my skin you guys see it's like
the perfect contour sheet because it's
not too cool but it's not too warm so I
place that on my cheekbones on my
forehead and a lot on my jaw line to
really you know get rid of my double
chin and this actually works I noticed
that every single time I contour my
jawline and I have to like phase
tuneless so yeah but anyways I'm going
to blend it out using another went wild
brush it's like a stippling brush you
guys see it's like perfect like the
perfect shade for me
all right so to set my entire face and
using this pressed powder now about this
um I use the flat brush to really send
with my eyes because you know concealer
creases so you want to make sure you set
it really really well but that's why I
notice that this powder has a little bit
more red then you can see by just
looking at it so I got a wet wild fluffy
brush to like um I didn't want to
concentrate the powder too much into my
eyes cuz that's when the red is showed
up because when I set my entire face
with this you can't tell that this has
any red undertones but when I was like
packing it on the brush and placing it
underneath my eye a lot of redness was
showing them so that was weird cuz it
doesn't look red when you look at it but
that was my observation so that's my
impression on it but let's make it
pretty good so that's what I'm doing but
now I'm took another pressed powder and
this one is just slightly darker than
the one I just used on my face and we
use that to set on top of my contour and
I thought it looked really really nice
it looked very warm I kind of warmed my
face up and gave it some color and it
was I just looked perfectly bronzed as
you can see
now I'm taking this one what I shall
acog nude awakening scheme and let me
take the lightest shade in the palette
which is like this white I'm gonna use
as a base now you guys see that this
palette is very pigmented because you
see how much the whites showed up my
lids and without any primer oh that's
kind of shocked by that but it worked
out so I am going to place that white
shut up all over my lid just all the
other colors pop even more now I wanted
some warmth of my eyeshadow look and
this palette is more on the cooler side
so I decided take the bronzer I use and
I'm going to use as the base so I'm
gonna get the same when wild fluffy
brush I used to apply the white shadow
and I'm just gonna brush it all over my
lid as a base
you
next I'm gonna take this plum II shade
and I'm going to focus that on my like
outer corner crease area
now I'm gonna take this brown shade I
know it looks kind of great on camera
but I took a brown shade and I'm going
to place it on top of where I had that
plum you shade using a flat brush I'm
going to take this shimmery like peachy
shade it is shop on my camera but I'm
gonna take that sheet and I'm gonna get
the wet water setting spray I'm gonna
spray it onto the brush that way this
shimmer really packs on to my lid and
I'm going to use that as my lid color
so once I'm gonna put that my lid I'm
skip the fluffy brush again all the
blender brush and I'm just going to go
over my crease area to make sure this
shimmer didn't get into that area now
using that same brush I'm gonna take the
plum color I took earlier I'm just gonna
like give myself a light wash of that
shade underneath my lash line I don't
want to get too dark so I want to be too
smoky but I couldn't not push out under
there cuz I just feel like the look
would look unfinished and I'm and take
the powder brush and I'm just going to
dust off any fallout which there wasn't
much at all actually I just did it
because it felt right now I'm going to
take this 1 watt cushion highlighter and
it comes with like little sponge and I'm
going to press the highlight it's like a
liquid highlighter it's got cushion and
I'm going to use that to highlight my
nose and my cheekbones and my chin a
little oh my opinion on this highlighter
is a it's a really nice highlighter but
I'm not used to using the highlighters
that are liquid like this I'd like this
how to be perfect with the texture if
you're using it with like a BB cream and
you want to go flick everyday glow a
natural look with no pattern no contour
but I mean for this look it worked I
just I'm not used to this kinda
highlighter Bielema had to pop a little
more so I took took an eyeshadow which
is like a highlighter shade and I use
this brush to place it on top just to
make the highlighter pop just a little
more usually when I use cream bases of
anything I like to put powder on top so
the same apply to this situation
so for mascara I'm taking the when
Wallace renegade mascara I'm as far as
my first impression this mascara I just
really like the brush I think that
because it has a little ball to tip it
makes it easier to a pleasant mascara
and to really coat every single lash
hair that's the last right oh my god I
keep having braid parts but yeah I like
the mascara a lot I wish I would have
put lashes with this look but I didn't
have any drugstore lashes so couldn't do
that so the mascara we're just gonna
have to work now type for loops my
favorite part I'm taking this lip balm a
tinted lip balm and it's the shade love
and these tend to the bombs are so cool
you guys they have a clear one they have
a peach one I have a purpley one they
have a red one but they're so cool
because they smell good and the Chi
tastes good I know I'm weird but I had
to taste after I smelt it I mean who
doesn't do that and I just like the fact
that if you want to be darker you just
put more on or if you want to be even
lighter like even lighter than this I
could just put on a very thin layer so
it's perfect like I really like the lip
balm I really do and I'm super
comfortable but yeah I set my face use
the LED wild setting spray and that
pretty much finishes off the look um
overall I enjoyed using all of the
products I guess the hardest product I
used was the brows I'm not used to using
strictly powder but other than that
everything worked out perfectly fine I
think this look looks really good for
drugstore especially when walks everyone
knows when wild they're like one of them
least inexpensive drugstore brands so if
you got store this look please give me a
thumbs up and I will see you in my next
