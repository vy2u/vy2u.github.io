you're new welcome so today's video I'm
going to be using some of the new 50
products I'm not by the whole line
however I bought what I felt like I
would love the most and you could see it
on my face right now I bought this
really nice kilowatt is sangria sunset
in the most of sunrise Italy and I
bought the 3 lip colors that kind of
match the kilowatt that I bought and so
I can with this look if you like to see
how I got addicted watch this video and
what about this hair alright have a
video on this hair I always picked on
below as well on how I got this color I
just do this wig on in this video
because I thought in cooking with the
look and if you agree be sure to give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe and
I'll see you guys I think this video huh
alright so first I'm gonna pry my skin
using this fin T Pro filter primer you
guys already know the drill I use this
all the time it's actually lasts in a
very long time my opinion had this for
so Wilson's whatever 50 launched and
it's like only halfway done and you guys
if you like my videos you guys know I
use it all the time so I've never been
last in a very long time definitely
worth the money
sure
I can't wait to like be done with this
chi want to see how it's on come
together alright so I want to use
majority 15 in this video well as much
as I could
I have 250 foundations I have 330 and
370 I recently bought new through 70 and
I lost it I believe it's probably packed
up on my boxes so you guys know I'm
moving so I'm gonna use my 330 which is
slightly lighter however I'm gonna make
it work because like I said I want to
use often T wool as much mint tea as I
can't I'm gonna take that I'm just
blended out with this beauty blender
it's like both 330 and 370 work for me
however I don't know how good this
microphone is let's see you guys hear
that they will work however 370 makes a
little more tan it's more true to color
worse 330 is just slightly lighter but
like when you add your bronzer and other
stuff you can't really tell I guess you
can say 330 is like more than my winter
shade and it's obviously not winter so
I used hella foundation you know it's
weird but I actually like up my nose a
little red I don't know I actually
enjoyed the color of my nose so I hate
to see it go or the foundation on it but
I can't neglect it so this gets mad on
your skin so fast almost forgot all
right so I look a little crazy don't
worry about that so two cream contour
i'm gonna use this vinci beauty
matchstick that's right in the shade
truffle it's like a dark brown shade i'm
going to contour my cheekbones my
forehead and my jawline and so I've
learned from using this that it's best
blended out with a brush so I'm going to
take this brush leave this BH Cosmetics
I'm not sure what collection it's from
just says number four and I'm going to
bloom that out actually you've never
bought any of the Finn T Beauty brushes
only because I didn't want spend that
much I like saving my money they look
really nice so I know I'll interest yeah
I'll buy them just not yet
this make the foundation look better too
so we are good this coming oh nice I
like it alright
are you working microphone Lake hello
alright so to conceal I'm gonna use my
NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade biscuit I lost my other my little
50 matchstick that we used to highlight
or conceal so much use bregma concealer
for that if you ever notice that look
down on my videos is because the Mars I
have it's on my tripod
it's like facing downwards and I don't
know how to make it to where it's on the
side of my camera so at least I'm
looking up I feel like I'll have to like
tape it however I don't wanna do that
just yet because I'm moving soon I'm
packing up soon so I just feel like
that's a little extra right now but
sorry if I look down a lot I try to look
into the camera but I also have to look
down and make sure to focus you Linda
out really fast
all right to set the place I can seal it
I'm going to use my lure murmur powder
one more layer first I'm gonna set my
nose too
okay I noticed that my new eyeshadow um
depend on the shadow I use if I get fall
out its it doesn't it doesn't always
just fall any through eyes and I'll flip
over to your nose and it's annoying
getting rid of that so um I'm gonna set
my nose that way if the shower does get
on my nose it has a stick to it and I
could just dust it off all right so now
I'm gonna do when I have camera just to
get idea what I'm doing and I'll be back
to the second eye alright so I did one
off camera I'm not done with just yet
cuz I'm gonna add more however I like
where this is going
so did you the other eye I'm gonna prime
my lid first using my NARS concealer I'm
gonna just place some on my liddie
putting it out using this brush by BH
Cosmetics just like a fluffy flat head
type brush
all right so for my shadow base I'm
actually gonna take these to make a big
shadows they're like pure pigments I'm
gonna take this one right here which is
like a pinky purple shade it looks more
pink on camera but it's actually more
than purpley side and mix it with this
other purple shade I like using pinks in
order to enhance Purple's I noticed that
with shadows that usually does a trick
let me take this morphe m3 30 brush it's
like a kind of tapered blending brush
and I am going to start packing it on no
at first so I didn't set my lid with any
transition powder because I learned that
it works best when I don't it looks
crazy at first however you just keep
blending and blending and they will come
together so I'm gonna take it all the
way inwards to you see and then just
keep filling up the color until I feel
like you know it's where I want to be
now I'm gonna take this clean morphe in
502 brush has no product on it and I'm
going to just blend out the edges this
brush is fluffier than the first one I
used so it's good for blending and
diffusing so there's no harsh lines and
I'm just gonna keep using the same color
and just working on that till I feel
like it looks like they smoked out it
just nicely blended I'm noticing this
brush Jets on me though I keep that and
it's a little rougher than this brush
but I still like it
so that looks cool alright alright so
now I'm gonna take this 50 Beauty
kilowatt coil this isn't the most of
sunrise and sangria sunset my lights are
really bright so it's pretty much like a
nice purpley pink shade kinda like this
shadow actually just with shimmer and
I'm nice like born in G here
it's at oranjee but like has yellow
undertones and so I picked this one out
versus picking out the other one because
I know that this these are close and I
would actually use I did not buy the
whole collection because I want to be
realistic you know like I'm not other PR
I'm spending my own money and so I'm not
gonna buy things I know for a fact I'm
not gonna use and also I thought about
buying the products and demo in the
video but I also don't like buying
things just to return them cuz I didn't
get used then they could damaged out and
no one else to use them again and that's
just wasting products so I only bought
the products that I knew for a fact that
I would use after this video so I'm
gonna take the sangria sunset take my
finger and I'm going to place that all
over my lid I'm gonna take this morphe
flat brushes the r43 brush I'm gonna use
I just to get like in the corner where
my finger can't reach and just pack on
that color it's really nice and I'm
seeing minimal fallout it's not crazy
like at all yeah not at all so what I
did next was I took this NYX liner this
is a strictly vinyl liner in this is the
shade extra it's like a purple shade if
my camera focus on it's too focused on
me it's a nice little purple shade and
so I took that I'm not gonna do bling
however I because I don't plan on
putting on falsies I want to do a very
thin line by my lash line just to make
my lashes look fuller
I'm not put on false because the wig I'm
wearing has bangs and I don't like
wearing false lashes with bangs cuz it's
just super annoying and they constantly
touch each other so I'm not gonna do
that however if you're not gonna wear
bangs or you know wig or whatnot you
could do false is if you'd like and I'm
just gonna put a very thin line like so
like it's so thin to the point where you
won't really notice unless you're very
close to me I lie and then what I
actually did on this side is I put this
powder on top it doesn't really get rid
of it it kind of sets it but I don't
know I just like how it looks so I'm
gonna put that same sangria sunset
shimmer right on top of that and that's
why I did I doubt you guys can't see it
but I could see it it looks pretty cool
so for my lower lash line I'm gonna use
the same to make these shadows I use for
the top part of my eye and I'm use the
same word feet r43 brush and I'm gonna
blend that and I'm going to take some of
this boring shadow right here too and
mix it into the purple shades I'm using
because that's going to play a big part
in like my blush or whatever so I'm
gonna add to orange these shells are so
pigmented oh this size one picked on
this side let me add a little more on
this side
so it matches yeah that's looking nice I
like it I love purple and oranges
together I'm kind of blending this
outwards to kind of create I don't wanna
say it winged but I kind of want to be
like a little out this side and now for
mascara I'm taking this milk makeup push
mascara which actually like a lot and
I'm going to put a thick coat of that on
my lashes oh I just got some on my
freaking powder it's cool
I won't freak out
sometimes scarce so good and like it
gets better the more you use it I don't
know I like a lot though all right so we
have our eyes done for the most part
we're now a little more as we go but
time to do the rest of my face and I'm
excited to the lips the blush and all
that good stuff all right so to set my
face and just powder opportunites urban
decay powder foundation this is a shade
dark warm I never have to say it in the
videos because I never look but it's
caught dark warm now I'm just gonna use
this big morphe brush this is the e-40
tooth brush I'm gonna set and dust as I
go my under eyes look super bright I'm
gonna take this flat low ever see brush
it's a cheek color brush or blush but I
want to really dust that powder with
buff it in that's like you can see the
white caster into my eyes I don't like
that much better so for blue so before I
take the I'm actually gonna use them in
most of sunrise for blush blush I'm
going to use this Mac devil blessed
first it's like a nice orange color I
mean it has a base because this one's
actually very shimmery and I just feel
like you look nicer with a little bit of
this underneath it take some of that I'm
using this big Sigma large powder brush
put some on my cheek first
bring a little bit of my eyes to because
I'm looking washed out now I'm gonna
take the Moses on rice ooh I'm excited
that's pretty it's not as intense as I
thought it would be which is actually
cooled me so I thought it'll be way more
tips in this I thought I have to use a
light hand but you actually don't and
I'm happy I put the matte blush
underneath I think I brought it in a
little bit too much so I'll take my
brush and just kind of picks out a
little bit I'm happy I used that blush
underneath Catholic it's definitely
helping to bring up the color I kind of
might add some of the purple one to you
so why not oh that's more like me oh
that's nice sorry it's a weird these two
together are nice he's really good
together
oh that's nice you you could really get
carried away with this color that's
I'm gonna keep adding more until I feel
like I shouldn't anymore and the way I'm
dipping in it I'm dipping to we're
touching both of them because I like
them both put some up here
that's
and one carried away but I like it a lot
it was like I bought this one see I knew
I would like it I knew I liked it so to
add to my eyes I'm going to take this
mimosa sunrise with the same morphe in
three thirty brush no I'm gonna put some
of this and my inner flabby folds I feel
like that would complement the eye look
and like why not have fun you and to
make it pop actually cuz you seem a
little bit but I wanted to be the
shimmering it's going to take my pin to
beauty galaxy palette I'm gonna take
this little gold shade right here place
it on top that way doesn't really take
away from it weren't but it makes it pop
would that make it pop do I like that a
little bit aren't you gonna see it
mm-hmm you just add a little something
so look isn't so plain just blend that
on my fingers a little bit I'm gonna add
some of this pink right here
just see what that will look like like
how it looks a little more yeah that
kind of gives me the pop I was looking
for so I'm gonna stick with that I may
even use a little bit of that I need my
brow bone just soaked have a little
shimmer but not too much typically
speaking I usually wouldn't highlight my
nose use either these shades but I'm
gonna try it and just mix it too cuz you
got I put blush on my no sometime so
they it might actually look cute so you
know it's key I like that I'm happy I
gave it a shot you know do stuff a
little bit on my nose I like that okay
just doesn't live on my lips - now it's
time for loose self ellipse I bought
this pack because it matches the blusher
the kilowatt duo this has ready to
mingle bilingual single I'm everything
but by lingo the lingo all right so I
inch so I missed you in these two colors
I know myself I know this is not my
color I'm gonna put it on for you guys
anyway just like I see how it looks on
me this is the shade single I know me
and I know like this isn't my style of
color but if you want to see how it
looks this is how it looks
I'm gonna take it off now I'm gonna take
my Mac Devil blush
and please on top of my lips tiger that
blue color I don't know why my lips too
harsh because I don't want to like you
know make them sad or whatever so I'm
gonna just use some blush to cut that up
then you're another drill aligned with
chestnut lip liner very lightly though
nothing too crazy which one should I use
first I'm going to take ready to mingle
first the texture of these are
interesting I actually like them but for
some bees I thought they would be
thicker um I don't know why something
about the color and the shape I thought
they would be like they can have them
lips but they're actually very smooth
like we actually feel like now this is
not this is no shade cuz I don't know if
the people take this as a bad thing but
I know that everyone knows what this
particular thing feels like it feels
like a softer version of Vaseline but
like the good kind um that's the only
thing I can think of that I feel like
everyone kind of knows what vaseline
feels like it feels like like the
Vaseline little chapstick so you guys
know a little chap so they have not
actual vessel assassins very oily you
know how they make me like a little
chapstick lime it feels like that just
not as heavy but like that texture
reminds me a bit I like them I
personalize them and I'm gonna put
bilingual on top of that just for fun I
like this more than I expected to you
not say I didn't think I would like them
but like usually like props like this
it's kind of like little too thick I
noticed that like you parked it too much
on it'll probably build up in the middle
like I start to put up a little bit all
you have to do is wipe a little bit
about your thing and you'll be good yeah
I actually like these a lot
I don't know how I'm gonna wear for
because I just put them on but we'll see
I actually like
these a lot and I think the colors I mix
look really nice together I like how
this came out I really do
I don't think I need anything else cuz I
want to look too crazy too colorful I
think this is just enough so I'm gonna
send my face using the settings where I
was use the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and now I'm gonna throw my
wig and I'll be back for the final look
alright guys so I'll put my wig I feel
like this wig looks prep for this look
so I put it on I love it look like a
little character from like like a video
game or something I don't know but this
is the finished look this wig is so not
hold on to my head I Lee just threw it
on like come off any second now so I'm a
close to this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it my thoughts on the Vinci
beauty products I actually like them
like a lot oh well what if they actually
it makes like I wasn't like them I knew
I liked them I just didn't know if I
would like them enough for me to wear
them more than once because I feel like
they're very like bright they're not
like natural and typically speaking if
you follow my channel you know I like
the naturalness whatever you want to
call it and so I wasn't sure if I'll
like the procs enough to like wear them
like after I filmed this video but the
lip props really myself with the lip
products while there I guess you want to
say bold they're actually like you can
wear this wooden in time makeup look
even worse without a full natural face
not like no makeup like you don't
actually be with no eye shadow I thought
this like blah so actually very very
good with that very miserly gloss I
already wear so I guess I assumed who
glossa me more pigmented like I thought
that purple will be even more purple
than it was but it's actually perfect
because it has like an iridescent as to
it but it's not too much you could
definitely wear it on everyday basis and
the blush duo or the kilowatt aqui con a
blush the kilowatt duo
I don't livi tailback she added more
because I'm obsessed like I'm actually
obsessed their beautiful sangria sunset
reminds me of a more pigmented version
of plum flavor Mac I've used plum folder
in my videos before I don't know how
many videos you've seen in mine but
Bulgaria's we're just like this but it's
like this is like what you want plump
already be plump was really nice but
this is like like plump full degree on
steroids I don't know I just really like
it a lot and I'm probably gonna put some
more on for my photos cuz I just I love
it so overall I think the naproxen great
I did not buy I know that came up with
like you know another set they came up
with another kilowatt and like other lip
products item by those cuz they're not
my style like my personal taste and they
came out with these cream shadows and
they didn't really appeal to me too much
when i swatched it it didn't select
something i would like it was for my
headed lids I just didn't I wasn't a
huge fan of the formula and from the
videos that I've seen it seemed like the
formula kind of separates on the eye if
you use too much so I just I stayed away
from that however the products I did buy
I totally love them I recommend them
they're definitely cool enough to wear
every single day if you're wondering and
I'm alone now hope you guys were this
video if you did give it a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
