you're new welcome so today's fetus went
to be on how I got this really nice
beautiful red color this video is gonna
be super easy to follow along I show
myself
bleaching his hair and putting the
dyeing I not show the process and I blow
dryer and strain the hair making this
would almost like on that other videos
before and I have other videos on making
wig which I'll link down below so I
strictly just show how I got this color
this color is so beautiful I didn't
think I would like it as much as I do I
mix a few dice that's why you know some
parts the red looks bright another there
is some hint orange I'm gonna see you
but there's like it's different tones of
red I love that kind of like style so
adds more dimension it's not just super
flat it's like like this looks super
pretty this hair is from to not you hair
they sent me three bubbles in a frontal
I don't know we have nothing bad to say
about the hair I bleached it twice and I
died you get to see the hair it's so
nice and flowy it's still so healthy I'm
getting no tangling those Schedeen oh
nothing I did add my kiss argan oil to
his hair that's why you know it looks
extra shiny and you know super full of
luster and whatnot but that's pretty
much all I did I just straighten his
hair
um make the wig and that's what it was
so about this wig I am going to give it
away you guys have noticed that and a
lot of my hair videos from here on out
I'm gonna start giving away more my wigs
only because I have so many wigs and I
just I don't need them all it's I love
this wig it's super nice I think about
the customizes frontal and they're just
like bleach the knocks I made a part of
the foundation powder but it's not
plucked or anything and the baby hairs
we're already on the frontal and so this
wig wasn't really ought to it I did cut
two tracks out of the back so the back
looks kind of funny
however it's only because the way when I
made it was too big for my head so I
acts like minimize it or are supposed to
be loose in my head I mean if you do
when they give wear that
second you could always you know take
this ring apart and like reuse the
bundles I don't know you do what you do
anyway so saying I want to take it away
more my wigs because I just have so many
and it's like I don't love this color
this color is so beautiful but I know
myself and I know that I'm not the type
of person to wear red hair every single
day on a daily basis so I probably wear
this wig like maybe like two or three
more times in fat and I like will get
new hair and like worlds into another
wig so I just don't want to keep holding
on to my wigs kind of like you know
being a hoarder when it comes to Miller
I know that there could be someone out
there that like love to wear red hair
every single day so I'm gonna give this
lick away in order to win you want to do
anything like crazy just comment down
below that um little wig and I'll pick
someone at random act like a day or two
once the comments you know completely
you know fall in and I'll leave a
comment and I'll pin the comment who are
whoever I pick see doesn't know it's
almost picked or not or you know you
could still enter I'm just gonna wait
because I mean some of the next wigs
super nice hair and I know some will
wear this more than I will so anyways I
was talking about this video to be super
short super quick exclude to the point
if you want to purchase hair on links
everywhere down below like I said I have
no comment nothing back to see I try to
think of something but I have nothing to
say at all especially with how this hair
to the color so well solid let's watch
the video do you find it helpful if you
enjoyed give me a thumbs up and
subscribe like I said when I wear this
wig just comment down below that you do
and how pigs when I random I'll see you
guys later alright so here how the
bundles come they're so nice you guys
like okay so this is videos kind of a
shambles by shot on my mark for my mark
for it isn't that if you find her so the
angle is not the best however one do you
guys should really see the quality of
this hair you guys see how ghosts like
from like thick to thick all the way
from root to tip it's such nice hair you
guys and so to bleach the hair I'm gonna
take my ion color brilliance 45
developer with my ion color brilliance
powder Lightner there's my favorite
bleach ever so I tried it honestly like
it's kind of all I use because it does
make me sneeze doesn't give me allergies
it's super safe this smell isn't too
strong or like you know it doesn't make
it's like I'm gonna die so like it and
I'm going to mix you know a lot I
honestly use like this whole little
bucket for this process I didn't have to
but I did because like I said earlier I
bleached his hair twice I only show
myself bleaches hair once in this video
well when it's a bleach it twice I mean
I bleached it put the fall all at a
process then I put more bleach on top of
that I didn't like rinse into a whole
another session I just bleached it twice
in the same setting to try to get you
know pretty light so the color could
show up very vibrant so after I mix that
all up I'm going to show how I bleach
one button don't know this is always
referring to when I said the angle of
this video wasn't the best because so
with the mark 4 I used to fill my hair
videos on the 70d however now that I use
my mark for the quality I just it's too
much of a difference for me to like
compromise and so I'm just my first time
filming a hair video with my mark 4 and
it was hard because the market for does
have a flip out so I couldn't see myself
I couldn't see that I was blocking the
screen so I'm so sorry guys next time
I'll get better but like I said this is
my first time using this I just want the
quality quality be good so you know I'm
just applying the bleach and I'm using a
brush to help make sure like you know
all the hair is like thoroughly covered
and you know coat it with this bleach
you want to just take your time on this
it took me maybe like 30 minutes to
bleach off four bundles at frontal what
I just did is very important so what
I've been doing lately I've been
bleaching most of the bundle and at the
top part I pour strictly developer and I
don't add any extra bleach to that
developer I kind just mix in and fuse it
with the bolita sorry in the bundle and
this is how I've been kind of creating
like a perfect ombre effect and how my
dogs have become better so definitely do
this if you want you know your dye job
to come out pretty good I just I don't
know what inspired me to do that but
ever so I've been doing it to like you
know the color and just the overall like
look of the die looks so much better so
I let that process and this was the hair
before I toned it have been so pretty
but I didn't own it because with regular
I need to tone it so first I'm using
arctic fox
artic Fox wrath and sunset orange and so
I'm gonna mix this add or Die this dark
chocolate add or die into this because I
don't want the right to be super
right but in the future don't do it like
this mix the dyes in a bowl together
first and then apply to the hair just so
it's my patchy or anything because
that's kind of happen to one of the
bundles and sorry if it's kind of shaky
you guys like I said that it's not
having the camera that's shaking it's a
table so I'm like I'm so sorry
like don't hate me so then I applied the
orange dye to the bottom just to kind of
create more dimension and I just really
like rub that all the way in and you
only need two of the wrath the red
bottles and one of the sunset orange and
one of the adorable
dyes and that's all you need and so yeah
you want to just like really rub it in
and then I let it sit for an hour just
to make sure the color really paid off
then I rinse it out and I was done sorry
for the noise in the background Milo's
plane with his treat so if you hear him
I'm sorry I have a child now so my bad
but um yeah yeah as you see I'm just
really just working I die in there did I
just let it sit and you can like this
overnight too if you left overnight that
color would be even more bomb but arctic
fox their dyes are pretty pigmented so I
didn't have to do that and so like I
said I let it sit and this is the final
result so if you enjoyed this video if
you didn't mind the fact that my camera
angles super annoying give this video a
thumbs up please subscribe know that I
will get better in the future but I just
I had to post this video because this
color came out so nice so hope you guys
enjoyed it like I say if you want to win
this wig just comment down below and let
me know and I'll pick someone and I'll
see you guys later
