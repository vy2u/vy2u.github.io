just got done filming this eyebrows
story for you guys this broad right here
Oh God would I do that um I know I've
been making you guys wait forever and
I'm so sorry for that um but hey looks
like Riley did it right um this one is
actually part one of three this one I
use a pomade now I do literally be quiet
Theodore my parents in here so please
don't my hair she starts not crazy
I use a little bit of powder in the
front that's because my skin is like
breaking out like with eggs I'm a little
bit so like around my brows a little
rough I'm not sure if you guys agree I
tell them in the video but if you see it
that's what it is but my next tutorial
will be how to use a pencil to get
awesome brows now that's true I'll be
perfect for someone who is super new at
doing their brows and they want very
natural eyebrows pencil is best so
hopefully I can get that up within the
next week or two and then my third will
be using powder I'm gonna do that one
last that's kind of like the most
difficult one unless you already have
full brows and powder super easy but for
brows like my powder is kind of
difficult so maybe a little difficult
even doing it on camera who knows we'll
see but I'm not gonna talk too much
because yeah my jaw hurts from talking
so much already and I hope you guys do
it tutorial now the brow may look a
little dark but that is because I may be
a little dark because I just got my hair
jet-black you guys know recently I have
my hair lighter um but yeah I need to
eat some food um but yeah don't worry
about the color anything just worry
about the technique and how I'm doing it
and then you can get your own brow
pomade whatever shade fits you best and
then you could just do the same thing
and you could have awesome brows too and
that's pretty much it I'm not gonna keep
talking cos yeah I just look I'll I'm
gonna get a corn dog okay um and I'll
see you guys in my next tutorial I hate
waving I ran through my peace sign so
first you'll start with nicely tweeze
brows or maybe waxed or threaded
whatever you do to groom your brows you
try and make sure that they're very
clean and crisp because the cleaner they
are the better the brow comes out but
first i'm going to take my anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in
chocolate and this is what it looks like
it's a very nice warm brown then i'm
going to take my Anastacio number 12
brush yes it is a little dirty that's
because I use it literally every single
day
it's the only brush I will use on my
brows so now I'm going to take my brush
and dip it into the pomade very lightly
I put in slow-mo just say yes and see
how lightly I'm doing it and after that
I'm going to take the brush and tap on a
napkin a little bit just get rid of any
extra product I'm going to start by
tracing over my natural brow shape
starting at the very bottom and working
my way to the top
doing the top part is always a little
hard for me because I have very annoying
hairs up there and also your arch can
completely make or destroy your brow
it's literally yeah it's definitely okay
to take your time on this part take your
time on the whole entire brow because
your brows totally make your face it's
the first thing people see what's the
first thing I see so yeah I definitely
take your time on this no rush at all so
after I'm done I lay my brow I'm gonna
get more product on my brush and start
filling it in towards the ends now when
I pick up cream on my brush I never ever
ever start at the front of my brow I
always start at the end and then work my
way towards the very front of my brow
because you do not want to have you know
harsh brows especially you know at the
very start of the brow you know so
whenever you pick up product make sure
to start the end and then just work your
way towards the front as you guys notice
I kind of leave the front part alone I
like working on that towards the end so
now I'm gonna take concealer and pretty
much outline my brow or underline I
guess it's the underline I'm gonna let
my brow and I don't like using a super
light concealer I do not like concealer
under the brows I really don't you guys
will see what I do later on in this
tutorial and it completely explains why
I do it because I just don't like the
look of it at all
I'll put a little highlight but you know
when someone has the flash photo and the
only thing you could see is that like
white line a kazoo and meet their brow
it's like the worst thing ever it took
one of my biggest fear so yeah I
typically don't like doing this but it
just helps the brow look more clean and
define and that's all the reason why I
do it
but after I'm doing the concealer I go
back in with the brush and I just start
filling in the front now I add a little
product and I get the end of the brush
and I use this fully part to blend that
product out and you guys will see this
time make that really nice gradient
effect I add just a little product and I
blend it towards the front of the brow
typically I never put Prag directly on
the front of the brow and lets the
powder I will never ever ever in my life
put a cream like directly in the front
of my my brow PS don't mind my dirty
spoolie it just picks up literally every
I put in my purse a lot and it picks up
literally everything into my purse but
anyways after I blend out that product
with the spoolie I go in with my brow
powder duo and I just go and make hair
like type strokes just to give the i
broug a little more dimension and make
them look more natural even though these
things like the furthest things from
natural but they still look good so
that's all that matters
and yeah I take the most time on this
part want to make sure that the front
part of the brow looks the best because
I thought that's what the main part of
your brow is that very front part
as Justin see it this part takes me a
while so I just wanted to look perfect
but the thing that sucked is that I was
breaking out with eczema and it was at
the very front part of my brows so the
texture of my skin right there was not
smooth at all so it was giving me like
the most problems and I was a little
crazy but I still made it work okay so
what I figured out about the best is
gonna get I take a q-tip and I wipe away
the concealer now a lot of people they
blend out the concealer but as I stated
earlier I hate concealer under the brows
I literally just used to make a look
clean and then I literally wipe it all
away I do not keep it there my brows
like I know it made some like a wisk
concealer but this just how I've always
done it and it just works best for me
and I use the technique on everyone I do
makeup on and I just love it like I
literally just wipe all look it's the
airway it just makes look more natural
to me me I don't know I just that's how
I do it and to really get underneath the
brow to get the rest of it see like I
ripped off some of the cotton on the
q-tip and I really got underneath there
you know cuz I just wanna make sure it
goes on I just yeah I hate it to set my
brows I'm getting this clear brow gel by
answering some Beverly Hills and I just
kind of been working through my brows I
find this makes the hairs on my brows
stand out which makes the overall brow
look very very natural so this step is
definitely needed then I take this hat
by Laura Geller called go to honey and I
just lightly highlight my brow bone very
very lightly I'm putting it on so
lightly that you'll barely be the seed
and less like it's at a certain angle
and that's what I'm going for that is
pretty much all I do you guys they
really hope this is worth the way and I
really hope you learn something from
this and
you can also browse now yes the brow gel
is still a little wet but when it dries
it looks much better and it looks
flawless so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and I'll see you guys in
my next video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
