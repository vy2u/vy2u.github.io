other tutorial featuring a pencil like I
said I would record for you guys now I'm
going to show you guys how I actually
grew my brows first kind of like it's
really important I didn't include that
in my last video and I was sent these
tweezers to try out so I figured to
feature them in this video
now first want to use the biggest pair
of tweezers which I'm showing right here
and I use that to get the longer hair
sky flick is easier you know I feel like
when you're getting like the shorter
hairs it's best to use Explorer tweezers
and you guys will see me do that a
minute so yeah for the long hairs which
I don't have mini exciton really have
brows like that I use the bigger
tweezers and then I'm going to take the
medium size tweezers which I'm showing
right here it's all glittery and sparkly
and cute and pink I think they're really
cute I think they're super cute and I'm
gonna get the medium sized hair so I
don't have mini I really wish I had more
brows betweens you guys but it does make
a difference because why don't twist my
brows it just it looks so sloppy and
ugly so I have to tweeze at least once a
week just to get everything all together
and whatnot and so after that I'm going
to take my favorite pair of tweezers on
its entire set and you guys will see
them in one second there they look super
cool like I could totally stabbed
somebody with these tweezers and get
away with it but uh I want to get those
super duper duper tiny hairs that the
other tweezers could not pick up and you
guys will see me do that right here yeah
dude but these tweezers you can kind of
kind of hurt to mine with these names
but they're awesome though because like
they get those super annoying hairs that
regular tweezers can't get so that's why
I like them so now that I'm done
grooming I'm gonna take my brow Wiz
pencil by ancestor Beverly Hills in the
shape evany will just like I like a
darker darker Brown it's a never d color
okay and I'm gonna like line the bottom
half of my brows gonna start outlining
these things creating the shape that I
want and then I'm going to draw a line
on the top you know just kind of like
just follow along you guys can see what
I'm doing nothing guru I'm not the
greatest at explaining how to fill in
brows I learned in my last two row that
I'm really not that great but um yeah
you guys see I'm do it I'm just create a
mushy
you know so after I am done mapping out
my brow I guess I'll say that I'm gonna
get my brow Wiz in the shade dark brown
which is a lighter brown and I'm gonna
start filling in my brows that way and
as you guys will see I start to like
move the pencil in an upward direction
and that's gonna make it look like I
have more hairs and I actually have okay
I pretty much like use the pencil and I
go the direction that my hairs are
actually growing so in the front I move
up because my hairs are you're kind of
going up in towards the end I move like
slant Italy because that's you know
where my hairs are going you guys get
the point
and so like Midway I take my concealer
which is Studio finished by Mac and I
start outlining my brows okay
I love concealer because you kind of
just come fix anything you mess up on be
kind of alter the shape it's just yeah
concealer I need it but anyways I go
back and now I'm getting the shade evany
and I'm making more 3d hair strokes
that's basically what I'm doing you know
cuz that's how I make my brows are going
nice and this is what you guys want to
see quick question you guys will champ
get your brows tattooed I kind of want
to get mine tattooed because I see like
but they have some nice tattoo brows or
fair nowadays I'm thinking about it guys
let me know if you guys let your brows
hi to you but anyways after I'm done
making my little hairs I give the
spoolie and I kind of just brush through
it and then I go back I keep making more
hairs
I honestly take forever doing this you
guys what up I really made like five
minutes but you know cuz I just take my
time and I kind of just work on it and I
think I loved Vienna sauces pencils that
they're super light like they're not
super pigmented so you can just build
and build and build and like there's no
way that you can mess up using her
pencils there $21 okay which is a lot of
money but you won't mess up and you'll
have nice brows so I think they're
totally worth it
I hear I am going back with concealer
because I'm a perfectionist and I I
don't know dude like you browser
everything man so yeah I just keep going
back and forth back and forth pencil
concealer pencil concealer now what I'm
going to do in a minute is I'm going to
make the top part my bow slightly larger
okay and you may look at it like okay
now watch do that you could let them
alone but it's because when I
consolidation on its gonna minimize my
brow anyways okay because the foundation
is just gonna it's going to do it okay
so I have to make a slightly bigger that
we're going to put the foundation on it
goes back to the size I want now I'm
taking my handy dandy q-tip and I'm
wiping away at that concealer you guys
know that I don't do concealer under the
brows well I only used to clean it up I
don't keep it there I don't blend it out
so I feel like we take flash photos you
could always see that very annoying line
and it drives me crazy okay so I'm just
cleaning with concealer and then I'm
going to take a brow gel and set my
brows in place that if my boyfriend
decides to take me swimming they don't
go off okay and you know he doesn't see
the real me I'm joking I'm always
braless around him anyways after I set
my brows that is pretty much it okay
this is the finished brow I think it
came out really nice give this video a
thumbs up if you think so too and I will
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
