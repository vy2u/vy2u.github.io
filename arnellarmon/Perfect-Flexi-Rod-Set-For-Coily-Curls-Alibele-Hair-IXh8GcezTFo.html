while like in the last six oh my god
it's been a week so that's kind of weird
bear with me exercise with YouTube you
guys always do it or else it's really
we're talking to caramel this is rude
word for me but they just on this hair
um honestly this is so cute to me I
decided to flex a flexi rod set and I
don't know if I have a video on
flexstretch set already but I do know
that I did it in a different way
I'm usage in my flexi rod where I wrap
the hair and the hair would kind of be
let me give you example like in the same
place like that but this time you have
seen the video on insert clips of me
will make I'll do that from them talking
I did it like this so the hair is not
overlapping so the curl is not follow
curl and that's how they believe these
like cute little bouncy is cute ass
curls and they're so cute like I cut out
a cool movement I want to pull them
apart a little bit so it's not so like
quisiera but I mean I like them I want
to help these last like some days I
hardly ever do flex drop this I'm too
impatient um it took me about 3 for an
hour and a half to put these all and I
only show myself doing the front part
because we were you're petting into kind
of the same thing but in like an hour
have to do all this of course if the
hair is shorter or you look less hair
then they should take like a little less
time but this took like an hour and a
half this hair and have my email open so
I know that in folks I never actually
see the info without is there the scream
I never actually see it this hair is
from Ali Bell hair and I'm surfing right
here I have three bundles own Malaysian
water wave and their 24 inches actually
actually cut um so that family stand up
I cut so I'm his hair feels way too long
for me I kind of look at it cut itself
because I mean when it's a cool limp I
thought it's like a pretty Alex Andy I
think it's pretty cool limp but it used
to go with all weirdos here but I was
likes a lot for me I don't know why axel
on one knows no one I don't
as well care so I just kind of chopped
it and looked great on my nipples and
near and then I have a 20-inch frontal
and still kind of crews that later
effect and so yeah I was hair to me
it's honestly I don't I'm not a huge
kind of waterway the hair something nice
I mean it was a it was easy work with I
just want a wave it's tricky you have to
be a water what type of person because
in Alan taskin waterways but it looks
going to pinch aside when I put it on
myself I'm not a huge fan of it it's
like it's not curly but it's not wavy
it's like when lady is just a dick to a
pattern that has to be your preferences
go work for you so I think it's a nice
pattern um do I have any of the puzzle I
think they I use like all three bundles
while we would have enough weight
actually let me see I may have a track
to show you guys what looks like a
natural state one sex so I just one
piece cut dry it was kind of like
working with the low left over but it
has a nice wave however you have to wet
it and North's kind of like really
activate that wave after you like re run
your fingers through so like that
because if you don't wet it it's a
little I'm going to drier side but when
you wet it is like it just it's almost
like with you when you have in the curly
hair I mean bleach it and so your stuff
with the look awkward waves and it's
like we're used to curly hair doing our
huge kratom would kind of like that and
so if you like wavy hair the water whip
is good hair but if you like if you're
used to curl each other hair like me
when you get water wave it looks pretty
but at all I just doesn't really look
the best when it's all on me um but the
hair this long so let's see yes before I
cut it it went all the way down to my
waist so that's how longer 24 inch
bundle is and a bundle the pretty fool I
mean this looks really cool and nice um
but yeah I was just let's drop that only
because I saw and I'll answer I'll link
her channel below I didn't watch her
video but I saw her to a flex rock said
I'll let you know clearly pretty it
looks perfect so I want to try it
and so I you know I try and just where I
came up with my watch some concerns off
are the hair go um it's soft the luster
nice clearly does it shed
yes however I haven't worn it long
enough to even to boo-boo-boo determine
that I'm going to go out tonight and I'm
going to be in the city and they're
their temperatures be trippy I feel like
I'll be a kind of tell how the hair
reacts out there can be very very windy
it's something about the city that's
different it is out here this in the Bay
Area so when I go out there you go cut
silly hair out like this a little dry
you know kind of get that out and then
I'll insert either the description box
below or leave it in a comment which you
guys know right think also if I do its
hair game if you're interested in
purchasing it but you want to see how I
feel about it I'm pretty sure I'm going
this way again so check back on this
video like me look four days to a week
from now and all I put in another
comment updating you guys I feel like
I've experienced this it's Matt you know
I mean I try to like keep updates in the
comments when I can't certainly in this
hair they just like you know keep my
comments but I'm watching I just watch
them is a quick flexi rod be a really
quick video very easy video but these
trails are really really nice and I hope
you guys like them this is so awkward
but I'm talking to myself I've got to
film again I don't have to tell that I'm
really nervous right now like I'm
starting to sweat I don't like it but I
wonder what video if you enjoyed do a
thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see you
guys later alright this is really weird
because I have to record my voice on my
phone because my final cut pro is
literally tripping on me won't let me
record audio anymore so sorry if the
audio sounds different but I kind of to
do this until I could take my computer
Apple to get it fixed
so what I'm doing is taking a leave
conditioner I don't think that this
matters however I would recommend you
use it a foam I would have used a foam
however I was kind of running out of
mind I didn't want to use it all cuz I
wasn't sure if I would like to run out
completely but a foam is best because
I'm recording his voice over days after
filming this and I did realize that with
the leave-in conditioner because it's a
more thicker product it created more
product build up and make the hair more
stiff than I know it should have been so
I would definitely recommend foam for
these kind of styles because foam it
just it drives in its own cycles never
in your hair to begin with you know what
I mean lady just feels very very like
light and fluffy so I'm just taking a
little section and I'm going to zoom the
camera out in a second I didn't please
think this through I'll fill in to my
living room because why did this kind of
style they take so long I
to keep myself entertained so I just you
know Ramallah mannequin in the living
room a fun level hip-hop and I just you
know I did this but just like hour and a
half but I pretty much just sprayed the
Prague on to the hair and you want to
spray enough to where it's damp but you
don't have it soaking wet because it
will take forever dry I actually I'm in
an infinite snap I let this air dry
outside because I don't know I just
wanted to hurry up and dry it I didn't
want to like blow dry for too long but
yeah I just put the product on and I
just roll it up like this it's like what
these cuts of tutorials it's better just
to watch versus me say it because I mean
I'm a visual learner so and I'm like
watch these kind of things I kind of
watch to determine what to do but I used
two flexi rod sets where I would roll it
and I like overlap the hair on top of
each other and those were cool too like
I'm nothing wrong with those but when
you do it this way i plus you get like
more spiral curls so i guess it's your
preference so yeah i didn't show myself
doing this whole thing because it's very
pettit --iv and you're kind of doing the
same thing over and over again
I prefer tutorials to kind of like get
straight to the point and just do it so
that's why I try to do if you want my
videos to be more where I like show the
entire thing let me know but then it's
kind of like I'm just going to speed it
all up and do the same thing and I don't
like that alright so once I finish
putting them in I listen to your
outsides and I put them up put the wig
on my head and I'm gonna dry it a little
more with the blow-dryer I'm going to
start with freaking long-sleeve shirts
long-sleeve shirts in my videos cuz I
always have like either bruise or eczema
on my arms out of my armpits and I know
why I don't cover that up
it makes mad when I edit anyways I'm
just drying with a blow dryer and I'm on
my phone to entertain myself I take one
out just to check and then if I feel
like they're dry enough I'll just
continue take the rest out now some of
this hair is a little dance however
because it's like a natural wave type of
hair that really didn't bother me
because I knew is going to hold the curl
now is this like straight weave aka hair
those process to stay straight I would
keep these in much longer because it
will just hold the curl different but if
you're working with like either like
the wet wave or curly hair that you
don't have to keep them in as long
because pretty much the curl pattern
it's already kind of like set that way
so it's easier for it to hold a curl if
this make this making sense so yeah
these took forever takedown I really do
like doing it but it was worth it I
thought the style was cute at the end so
I'm while taking me down I didn't notice
it in a certain way to kind of like make
the curve spiral so as you can see like
some pieces I think the flexi rod I like
unhook it and I just can't pull it out
kind of rough kind of rough but if you
take it out and kind of twirl the flexi
rod while you're moving it it helps to
curl stain test spiral curl like pattern
and so it's your preference some of them
I wanted that pattern some of my Denix I
want to kind of go for like a messy look
I like that some of the curls have that
like spiral definition but at the same
time I don't want to all see be that way
excited do they look that great on me so
it's all budget preference but if you
want that like spiral curl pattern
you're going to have it takes longer to
take them out because you can't have to
twist the Flex right around the hair but
I'm sure you guys know that that's how
you get that pattern
so after I took them out I just got the
blow dryer and I'm just like just drying
it just a little bit for the parts I
felt a little wet now I'm just going to
run my fingers through them and style
them I have to make sure that enough
hair is covering the back so that you
don't see the tracks in order to pull
apart the curls i'ma just taking such a
little serum it's my eye on I gotta have
values for ten dollars and I'm just
going to like detangle the curls with
that I prefer to use a little less cream
you're a little greasy but I can't go
back now but you don't want to like not
to tangle you don't want to like take
apart curls with like dry hands so
that's how you make the hair frizzy so
you always want to like use a little oil
on your fingers Oh God
you always want to use a little oil on
your fingers that way the hair doesn't
get super dry because that doesn't look
good
and if you happen to pull apart a curl a
little bit too much to take your finger
like twisting your finger and because
the hair is in a flexi rod it should
typically go back to the form a toes are
in so pretty easy and after that that's
pretty much the final look thank you so
much for dill being my shambles don't
worry my next video will be much better
than theirs if you enjoyed this one give
it thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
