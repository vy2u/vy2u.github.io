look for you guys I dip it feed it a
little bit different than I normally do
all my other videos I didn't show myself
put on my concealer highlight cream
contour anyway I just got strength that
I look because I feel like this is a
little bit of a different type of look
it's more detailed and more dramatic so
I want to make sure I enough time to
explain what I was doing
and I feel like sometimes what the
foundation concealer think it's a little
bit repetitive kind of the same thing
this video although I use different
products kind of same thing but if you
guys like when I do all that let me know
but if you kind of like if you guys
liked this idea style better let me know
and I will do that for my next one and
my neck clear that I don't you do
whatever you guys like doesn't bother me
but this I like I did it's the first
time ever filmed nakhon crease and third
time ever did one I think that look
looks really nice I think you guys will
enjoy it um I upgraded my lighting when
I necessarily I just kind of like play
with my camera a little bit to try to
like fix of settings to where my videos
look more vibrant and more alive so if
you guys noticed that give a thumbs up
or at least leave a nice comment so I
 I did something cool I don't want
this intro to be super long it's almost
two minutes I think I say if they got to
say let me know the videos you guys want
to see next and all that good stuff and
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
however I don't one I look off camera
it's like my second time ever doing a
cut crease so I feel like it's cool I
thought give me a little better but
we're just gonna we're gonna go ahead
and do that there I primarily using the
lemonade part by benefit it's a color
correcting primer so it is yellow so I
press the power onto my lid then I'm
gonna go in to get a translucent powder
and set that
so four days look I'm using an
acceptable Hills Modern Renaissance
palette I'll show you the main colors
I'm going to be using the main cause I'm
gonna be using this hot pink color cut
love letter this is kind of Bert orange
color called realgar it's right here
called raw sienna and burnt orange to
begin drawing my crease for something
the shaded realgar which is that burnt
orange color I showed you guys and I
have to kind of actually look straight
up at the sea and because my lips are a
little cluttered I could have to go a
little bump on my creases so you could
actually see it you see what I'm doing
there so hard look at this identical to
the other eye it's like oh my god
before I open with the pan we get the
shade realgar mixed with burnt orange
realgar hope that's the right name blend
on top of that
acting machine love-letter because this
is looking pretty pretty already and I'm
going to go over where I drew the crease
line
see and clean off the same mac brush
I've been using because it's the main
brush I'm using and I'm gonna get that
eliminate primer again just a little bit
like very little you go see it and I'm
just gonna define that crease a little
more just make sure it looks clean and
none of that color transfer onto my lid
now for the lid I'm using this pigment
con afterglow by makeup geek and then to
put the shimmer I'm using my little
sugar by K which I always use it's great
but it's it's great for keeping shimmers
and glitters from transferring on to
your crease area it's the best thing
ever buy it it's a lifesaver I'm glad to
look down for this part because I can't
look up cuz I don't want to transfer it
onto the crease area but to apply the
liquid sugar you want to use a very
small like detail brush because you do
not want to actually get it into the
crease area because that would be a
shambles you don't want that you have to
hurry up and put the shimmer on before
it dries or in shambles
put it back over the creek area where I
looked up to fix that I don't I don't
know if you can see where I messed about
it but just fixing it and I took the
she'd love letter and real girl mixed
together and I blend it out on top we're
looking fancy now a lot of you guys are
all saved you've glued her right now
you're laying you don't use litter no
you guys I say that but you guys tell me
hey do glitter so I'm using these two
clear aligners by NYX I would do the
next door the other day um yeah Nix Nix
Nix I was kind of like against Nix for a
minute after their uh NYX face awards
based on the lack of diversity of the
contestants
but listen wooden track there stick
foundation and she braved like crazy
about it and I'm you know what like and
one Alyssa great about submit Conti that
seriously and she wouldn't shut up about
it so I went to go try it out and it's
amazing
I'll use it in one of my next videos but
when I was there I'm not gonna just be
here and just by one thing so I bought
these liners too and I really liked them
the only thing is this and honestly odd
NYX liners do this they burn they really
do when they're um wet they will burn
and I like years ago I bought this like
blue NYX liner and it burned my lips
like crazy em to put it on only when it
was wet though when it was dry it was
okay but I couldn't figure out like was
Bernie I thought it was me so I'd kind
of like used it once no twice I try to
give another can and I just like kind of
like stopped using it it's when I bought
these those okay we'll see what happens
and it did the same thing they burn but
it's not like an unbearable burn it's
just a burn where it's like what's in
these things
do I just using this
so now it's time to show you guys how to
make your own liner out of eyeshadow
it's like the easiest thing ever I've
done it three times before first choose
an eyeshadow and you're gonna mix it on
using this color pop top color pop top
and I'm using this shade love-letter so
I'm picking that up with the brush and
just put it in here your any dirt lines
by Inglot it works the best and you're
really gonna pick up some of that liner
I'm gonna pick up on this shadow and
you're gonna put like a drop of this in
there Boop just a drop you don't want
too much you don't need too much you
literally just need a drop and you mix
that with the shadow shadow shadow I'm
gonna mix that and you get your delay
nerd now I'm gonna put on the liner so I
can't talk holy I can alright so put it
on liner where you have glitter or
shimmer right in there rubbing it you
just want to press it in
now before I totally butcher this look
and mess it up I am going to wipe this
brush off go do it faster why the line
are still wet and you just didn't go
flick it out just a little bit just so
you can have like a faded out wing
because if you keep doing frog on you
put it out let's say you get a messed up
wing and you guys don't want that great
I know I didn't so I learned that when I
wiped off the prod off the brush and
then I flicked it out it looked more
radiant and you look pretty made more
sense perfect in the lane you wanted me
to see this thing what's up on my lashes
but we're almost done with the way I
look now I'm just gonna take the shave
your realtor and love letter and put
that on my lower lash line
like a load too much love letter
okay now I'm gonna put my lashes
off-camera and we're gonna finish the
rest of the face okay so now that I'm
dumping my lash Simon face entire face
lashes I did used where I pinky rose
cosmetics and this style Delilah they
don't have them on line but if you're
local like Sacramento local you can
totally go get them at their store the
only $5 super inexpensive and super nice
so my face I'm using my soft focus
powder I Black Radiance like my favorite
powder ever
I bought this like three times so far
Laura Mercier powder has been on my eyes
for at least 40 minutes so I hold up
hope it's on shambles just no way the
powder what I do whenever I leave powder
on for too long and it's like stuck I
just get my foundation powder but it's
the Black Radiance powder and just go
over it so be aware that white tone and
now once I set my face with setting
spray it's gonna help get rid of Wolves
gonna help that powder sink sink into my
skin so it doesn't it's not like sitting
on the surface so no worries
four and move on to highlighting contour
and blush I'm gonna do my brows I came
really quick so I can look normal and
I'll be right back
so now that I look like a normal person
now it's time for blush highlight a
contour and just finish off the face for
blush abuses this Sigma blush caught
chiki chiki just have pretty much a very
neutral soft pink I don't want to do
like a too bold blush because my eyes
are already bold as it is and it's like
a bold button word too dramatic
so put a very light flash of that on for
kanto I'm using this benefit hoola
ronson powder
contour my jawline get rid of my double
chin all right do what I can do and I'm
gonna use artist Couture and the shades
and seed it put a little my nose hmm I
have it in a sample jar I got a sample a
big so let's try it out because um my
sister bought them a minute ago and I
know that when I find which one I wore I
so didn't stick to my skin will but I
couldn't mix I wasn't using setting
spray back then but um so yeah before I
bottom I just try it out and a little
sample size to see if it sticks my skin
lil enough before I drop my coins but
it's beautiful I just know I'm
it's very powdery very powdery I'm gonna
use a setting spray actually to get this
to stick so I put my my liner on sorry I
skip through a part I use the artist
Couture diamond glow powder in the shade
conceited I kind of a hard time I'm used
to press highlighters I will say that
it's more difficult using that
highlighter and I guess loose
highlighters in general because it's
harder to make it stick to the skin I
guess based on the consistency of it I
didn't learn when that when I you just
kind of brush it definitely made it
easier to apply and then I had to wet it
just a little bit to make it stick to my
skin look I'm not having enough someone
add another highlighter I'm gonna get my
glow Kip and since Beverly Hills the
sweets glow kit one of the newer ones
I'm gonna take the shape butterscotch
which is like this pre oh god the way
it's a pretty golden color yeah just
like that wasn't stick to my skin enough
unfortunately
okay so before either my lips on my
bottom SK I'm gonna put my saving spray
on and I'm using the NYX to be finished
setting free let this dry and I'll be
right back this is my lips hey move this
a lot but I like it okay so for lips
what am I using I don't know yet let's
see how this looks when I get a brown
liner by NYX it's a shape room that's
pretty specific I hate when people
actually use the word Pacific for
specific I'm talking some people oh yeah
specifically I'm just like not talking
about the ocean girl that's the ocean
the Pacific Ocean pacifically
oh my god no I I mess up my words too
though
I came in front I can't clown anybody I
once thought the capital China with
Japan and I my mom won't let me live
that down every time things have issued
those on my face like oh you're the one
who thought the Cowboys your hand I'm
like you know what I was 15
let me live okay so I'm like I live to
the best of my abilities while I was
talking quite difficult I'm gonna take
quirk by dose of colors like this will
look pretty with this look so we're
gonna find out right now somebody was
right this looks kind of cool
I kind of like this I kind of like it um
plug is a little too Brown so I'm gonna
get this Anastacio color caught crush
it's like a pink color and mix that in
to kind of tone on that Brown this that
worked okay yeah I like that much more
who this nothing to fluff my hair and
put on something cute just for the video
I'm not gonna leave the house and I'll
be back for my slo-mo outros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
