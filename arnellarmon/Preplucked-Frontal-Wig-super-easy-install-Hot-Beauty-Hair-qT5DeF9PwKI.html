gonna do this video really fast like if
I want this year I want my videos to be
quite short cuz I don't want to like
make movies or some compost video and I
want to be really short my voice sounds
weird because I'm getting over a cold so
I care about you guys cup still filming
Eli son weird maybe wait let's start it
so I have breathe yes I do
um my on was able to braid my hair Wow I
son um yeah my hairs grow long enough
for braids was weird I would had it
shaved like in September but it's
growing so I had her braided that way I
could put oils in my hair instead of
like brushing it back so I just felt
like I was thinning my hair out and I
didn't wanna do anymore
new year new me so I'm gonna show you
guys the oil I use in my hair I have a
new concoction I was using another one
but the way I hide in my jar dough is
too messy and it kept spilling so I had
to find a bottle from the beach pie
store for like 99 cents wow I'm so weird
and I bought this a hundred peers sweet
almond oil work that's good for you um I
got castor oil severino's castor oil is
really good too and then I got vitamin E
oil and then I mixed all three and I
pull em in this bottle in annex chord
pretty much through each braid and I
massage it back and I miss off to my
next part I look a little bald but
that's because my natural hair is
growing out and my natural hair is like
a light blonde brown so yeah don't mind
that but I want you guys this wig I made
it is right here let's grab that thing
okay
I made this wig now and I'm wearing it
the vault the last uh hunk I've been
sick maybe the last five days
yeah and it's probably honestly truly
it's probably the easiest wig I've ever
had and it's not because of me
cuz I mean I mean I'm great now but it's
because it came we plucked or free it
came ready for me okay so all I had to
do was make it and don't worry my tutor
on can I make away with the lace
frontals it's coming up next week
because then
waiting for it so yeah I was put it on
Oh stocking cap I'm in shambles oh wait
I have it right here so we're gonna bust
a cap on okay we need one of those and
you see I haven't been wearing the super
light one cause it's like this too light
for my scalp all the other ones I have
they're like ripping on me no I'm gonna
put my other one what up all right guy -
our cattle are at it got takeaway by in
a bit I just started taking my sugar
bear hair vitamins and they're like wait
dad take I took tuber they're not just
once
girls will teach you a day but they're
so good it tastes like candy to me more
more more and so I'm gonna be tracking
that for sure because is so easy to take
this the first time I'm actually taking
vitamins I'm actually doing it and
that's because they're like candy to me
and I love candy
so I'm mercy of his works anyways
stocking cap put that on all right put
the wig on
I made the wig and all I did was a lathe
wig and I put little clips on the back
just to like grip the back from our
security but you don't necessarily need
them I'm gonna put it on one all right
and then I'm going and this wig like
it's looking so simple
secure the clips in the back
okay all right
got the wig on Coolio
and so it's brush it
now this hair itself is really nice and
very easy to manage it's super soft um
super soft I still see grays in it so I
know I'm gonna die I just haven't
figured out what do I wanna do yet I
bought bauxite for it I'll show you see
I bought this tie for this intense
burgundy die I'm not sure if I'm gonna
use it yet but I mean I'm not I might
I'll let you guys know and so this
itself bar looks good now I need edges I
didn't think this through because I just
got a hair braid today and so I was
wearing this hair with my natural edges
out so I'm gonna have to create baby
hair switch you guys know I do not like
doing I do not like Korean baby hairs
because it's just not easy like it's not
fun but I guess wanted to do it but this
wig the lace frontal came with this part
it's like a c-shaped part but I like it
I think it looks really cute I think it
gives like like alia vibes you know how
she used to wear her hair and so that's
why I like the most about it and I think
it looks right so yeah now I don't know
I mean I go on wear like this but some
people invite walk edges so I guess will
make them okay alright let's let's make
some quick edges okay this is Tony plana
I want my video to be this long but
guess I gotta do what I gotta do
so let's see
all right how are we going to mix
majesty
so to make my edges I'm just going to
get by the comb and part a little
section like very very little now this
should be hard because the closure is
like or the front tool is I customized
so it shouldn't be hard to make them
look natural but we go find out and I
don't really need edges for this part
because I've been wearing the hair in my
face guys like that's the purpose of the
whole bang thing so I'm just going to
make edges for this part but I've been
having I've been wearing this tucked in
my ear so I'm just gonna make him to
where it can look like I have hair there
and I don't look bald
so let's tuck that so you don't really
need edges on this side because I mean
this is covering it all right so
first my friend Portia is high she's
texting she's I love her you had you
guys have ever made a friend on social
media and you guys became best friends
like that's me and Porsche like it's
funny we have friends for I'm gonna how
long like at least at least three years
I don't know how long we've never met a
person get out were like best fancy so
she made out of it oh how I really don't
remember how but we've been friends for
like so long
we're me trying to sing it though that's
our goal so before mcdead is I'm going
to tweeze them first with tweezers oh my
god this videos gonna be long I'm so
sorry that was my plan it won't happen
again okay I'm sorry
and so please just thin out the area a
little bit cuz that's what you're
supposed to do okay and then take back a
little bit as haircut it's a lot more
than I want it out in a course this is
bright easier I'm a Styrofoam head but
the way my desk set up I would have been
strange I just put my staff with heads
let me stood on my head then I'm going
to get these eyebrows streamer and I'm
going to try to thin it out using this
to just like by brushing it on it
thinning it out to this health in milk
was it faster to then I'm gonna go
diagonal with it do it I don't know you
know what to get too short though you
want to be like realistic and uh let's
see let's see these work oh my god I'm
scared
all right and I'm going to use just
regular general I mean he's right there
job to lay them I want to use s control
because s patrol make it stiff and if I
want to go back and fix them the edge
control make it too stiff for me to take
it out and I just yeah it's you some gel
you just want to like make edges that
work for you oh my god I hate doing this
I really do not like doing this I just
don't look bald right there you know so
you have to make like something now I
missed a piece of hair
and using our
first pull it up with it okay we're
getting somewhere
that's almost k looks better than it did
when I first started right 0:01 waste
more time but that looks much more matte
natural right everyone so cuz I think it
does
alrighty I like that now okay yeah I
mean I'll go out the house like this
alright so to make it just a little more
natural um what's really good I can get
a little concealer and a little ankle
brush it's very little very very very
little and then dab it apart a little
and rub it out feels so weird having
braid underneath this I'm really not
used to it but you I don't like blend it
out to finger
wow that looks good hi new yeah that
looks really really good
okay all right and that's pretty much it
that's really simple I know it's really
like twelve minutes and I'm really kind
of mad about facts I want to be shorter
but uh I did what I had to do I think
see it's not even glued down now of
course you want if you want more
security you know if you plan on
fighting and doing and crazy you could
like got to be gel it or whatever the
heck you could do what I need to do but
for a simple everyday we're you know we
just want to put something on you know
got the boat edges you know put a little
concealer something very simple easy
this wig is perfect um I mean about this
hair I really honestly look at it I
didn't want to take it off to even do
this video I didn't want to get off to
have my operate my hair cuz I already
made it look perfect
I think this frontal is amazing I think
the hair is amazing I mean the hair
itself is nice I mean I review so much
hair you get in you're like okay it's
good it works bad this hair is nice um
like I said when I die I'll determine
