this look
welcome to October you guys like where
has the year you would like with like I
mean everybody's image anything I'll be
look 22 and four months and I feel like
I just turned 21 I don't know even know
what to think about this situation so
yeah I just from this look now I thought
about doing the traditional orange eyes
black lips or black eyes orange lips you
know the Halloweeny type stuff I also
notice that like it's kind of purple
it's kind of popping during Halloween
time if you think about Halloween color
you think black orange purple and green
well that's what I think so I did this
look right here there's still a little
orange in there but um I just want be
something different I feel very
Halloweeny very October first II um so
yeah cuz we just also get the up dry
skin because my skin it's a very long
story but it was breaking out and it was
like very rash she was very very dry and
it was like all over the place so I need
specific things to make my skin feel
great now does it feel dry or annoying
at all Sophie or dry skin this is
benefit you as well um before I go I
want you guys to meet someone very
special in my life if you follow me on
snapchat you've already met him
but I mean it's only right that you
should use him to you guys too serious
but oh my god like okay cuz I'm I went
to lay these past couple days and at the
airport I don't even know like how I
even seen him but I seen him and I was
like in like his size is so cute I like
just pet him cuz he's just so little and
then you just hold him in like one
little hand I don't know man I used to
collect stuffed animals so this is a
good thing for me but I've seen him was
like a $10 it looks like I'm gonna like
you're not even a baller but I bought
him and my one star selfie of us right
here you know we even look like each
other like this is meant to be and he
just so cute he always looks happy I
mean his facial expression technically
can't change but I mean I like to think
of it as he's a happy person for fish
were stuffed animal man you ace you guys
names he did
cute I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial
oh my god you match the back job means
all right guys why am i such a loser Oh
God look at that's my cue someone just
started mowing grass like they even do
that out here
hope you guys are this video if you do
give me a thumbs up why do this
enjoy the video I'll see you guys in the
next one
so to start off take of this Jo a daily
treatment oil I've been using this I
mean ever since I got it we're just
gonna listen moved out she left it here
and it is amazing I learned that when I
placed this on my skin before my
moisturizer on it gives my face a very
like nice base for my makeup and it also
hydrates the heck out of it but the
thing with oils is that I get to find
one that's good for daytime use because
usually I like to use oils just at night
because oil can be very heavy on your
skin but this one it's I mean it's daily
mean II use it during the day so it's
not that heavy on the skin which is why
I like it so after apply it to my skin
I'm going to use this benefit total
moisture moisturizer as you can see it's
almost gone because it's one of my
favorites I mainly use it when it's very
cold or when it's windy because it keeps
my skin protected because it's pretty
thick so it gives my skin like a thick
layer of moisture
next I'm taking my hard candy hydrating
Primus now I'm gonna use it to pry my
skin when it says hydrated it truly is
hydrating I was using this as a setting
spray and I was like why the heck am I
so dewy and hydrated until I read the
Bible and I was like okay it's a primer
that explains it
so foundation using a NSS pebble he'll
stick foundation the shade cool goals in
caramel
now caramels my actual shade but cool
golden is a little more tan and so I
learned that one use that I like around
the perimeter of my skin my skin my face
and then I put the caramel in the middle
of my face I just feel like that looks
much better and it kind of keeps my
color you know it makes me look a little
more tan like my true self so I just be
mixed in the two and then I'm gonna
blend it out with a damp Beauty Blender
to conceal I used my Kat Von D lock-it
concealer and I'm gonna place underneath
my eyes duh my forehead down the little
bridge of my nose and on my chin and
then I'm gonna place tiny little lines
underneath you I plan to contour so to
contour using two sticks undies she's
I'm using cocoa and espresso espresso is
what I've been using and someone on the
left it's the more it's a lot easier
right now it's more cool tone and cocoa
is more um I guess it's a more warm tone
but actually want that because the blush
I'm going to use like a really warm
orange and I feel like the two would
just go well together so that's why I
chose to use this shade instead of
espresso now I'm just going to blend all
of that with my Beauty Blender
to set the place that concealed I'm
using this airspun powder now it's not
just air swim powder actually put a
little banana powder in that because
eres fun it's a little too like white
for me
banana powder is a little too yellow so
I learned that when I mix this two
together they like work perfectly see
I'm just gonna set the place that
concealed and after that I'm going to my
brows and one eye off-camera and then
I'll be back to the other eye so this
light came up with I really liked it I
didn't want to do too Halloweeny but
just a little Halloweeny so I felt like
this Halloweeny enough now I'm taking
the morphe 35n palette and I'm gonna get
this soft orange shade right here right
here what I have a lisp and I'm gonna
place that all over my lid then I take
this orange blush by Mac called
devil-like super bright I'm going to
place that where I place the lighter
orange just to kind of like deepen the
orange shade
so now I'm gonna take this dark purple
shade I almost forgot which one I use
but I use the darker purple shave the
two and I'm going to place that pretty
much all over my lid I'm not gonna go
too up though cuz I kind of still want
you guys to see the orange a little bit
but um yeah I'm gonna pretty much place
out all over my lid
now I'm taking this liquid eyeliner by
la girl it's like a felt tip pin and I'm
going through a wing now wings really
scare me which is why I rarely do them
but this wing guess came up perfect like
both wings looked the same and when I
noticed that I got super height because
yeah I'm not a wing person every time I
tried to a wing and look it always ruins
it so I just stay away from them but
this time it actually worked out and I
mean hey I was rolling with it
so for my lower lashline I am taking
this weight about my lashes on oh yeah I
put lashes on you guys um there by huda
beauty the name will be below but um I
totally was not gonna feel myself doing
that cuz I'm no professional BAE anyways
I just took that same orange blush and
put it under my lash line that I got
this black liner put in my waterline and
I was good to go
also what I scare on but I didn't put my
mascara on on camera cause like this
latter kind of irritated my eyes so yeah
my eyes are a little watery so I was
kind of scared to do it on camera so to
set my face I'm using my soft focus
about my black gradients like always so
yeah I'm just gonna do that and I'll be
right back
so to contour I'm taking hoola by
benefit and I'm just going to uh yeah do
what you do I'm gonna contour cuz that's
what I'm doing there blush means the
same blush I use on my eyes and this is
dill by Mac now I'm sure you guys how to
use the right way you can kinda dab it
just a little bit then blow on it that
sounds gross and then I applied to my
cheeks only cause like this blush is
really really pigmented and you could
easily put on too much by accident so
yeah do like that we need to push to
highlight taking the old snake glow cap
and a sense of the hills um I know I got
so excited some of the mirrors like a
this me babyrage I'm taking this amber
gold and I believe it's called white
goals I mix those two heights together
and I'm using that to highlight my face
I'm also gonna highlight my brow bone
now that it come out too great I learned
this highlight is more of a face
highlight and not an underground balloon
highlight because it's pretty glittery
and so it kind of like yeah I became a
Miss on my eye shadow let's just say
that
so to line my list taking plumb by Mac
the lip liner honestly kind of got
messed up if you guys tell to begin the
video you are makeup expert that's gonna
have chapstick on while out of my lips
so it just wasn't the neatest but I mean
can't go back now
so for lipstick I'm using Lime Crime
fetish stuff to be honest I do not like
this formula I feel like a little skill
when you first put it on but after it's
on for like an hour - it starts to kind
of crumble in the middle so I mean if
you know of a company that makes
lipstick this color that has a better
formula let me know because I'm looking
but I use it for now because it's what I
had I really want to wear this color
oh I decide to be extra good this
pigment from Mac sample it's reflex
bronze I decide to put on my lips now I
didn't really like it but then I liked
it but I didn't really like it but then
I was like I'm not doing it over so I
just went with it I mean looks okay I
mean we gotta be different sometimes
okay just bear with me
I found on with lips I really need to do
something my hair but my hair is dirty
cuz I got edge control in it and I was
like I don't really feel like doing this
the answer was no so I just kind of
pinned it back with bobby pins and
create like a cute look slicked back
style now I'm gonna set my face using
the Scandinavian setting spray and
that's pretty much it for the look so
this is the final look I really like I
came out and I hope you guys did too if
