inspired by this palette that was 60 by
deck of scarlet who is sponsoring this
video this palette includes two lip
shades a blush a highlight and three
eyeshadow so this palette is part of a
monthly subscription where every single
two months you are gifted a new palette
that pretty much comes with every single
day you need in order to create a full
face each palette is in collaboration
with a youtuber a blogger I know one of
my favorite youtuber is Sasha loves
collaborating with them and made the
perfect palette for a smoky eye if you
wanna check it out just google it pops
right up
I know give you an idea the kind of
pouch they sent out this palette also
includes a lip pencil which I'm showing
you guys right now it's like a purpley
crazy brown color interesting but it
pretty much comes with every single
thing you need so now let's start on the
eye look
so to prime my lid I'm going to take the
lip pencil I know it's kind of weird but
I want to challenge myself to use every
single like product a part of this
palette and I knew I was going to use on
my lips so I decided to use as a primer
it's not like your ideal primer however
it made my lids sticky enough so that
way the shadows and the blushes could
stick to my actual lid so it working
alright so the first I'm going to use
actually the blush this cotton swab the
HD name makes us ain't Bobby but it's
Bob D am using all of my lid as a base
and then I'm going to go into the shade
making wall just like a slightly darker
purple and I'm just going to use that
Cod dark in the look
next I'm going to go into the
highlighter shade this called gilded I'm
using to highlight my brow bone I don't
know why but lately I've been addicted
higher my brow bone like if you see some
that used to never do but actually it's
pretty good so just going to do that now
on my lid I'm gonna take the shake off
Sophia which is surprisingly
super pigmented I'm sure you guys right
here it's a beautiful like shimmery deep
purple shade it kind of acts like
backdrop like perfectly and I'm just
going to rub that all over my lid use my
finger I find that use your finger to
apply shimmery shapes works best because
it comes out more pigmented so that's
what I'm going to do and then we take my
brush I'm just go back over everything
you're just like you know blimp things
out and make sure it's looking all
perfect so once I'm finished with the
top of my eye I'm premising to the same
zest being on the bottom part of my
lower lash line so I did my other half
camera and I'm gonna take this to make a
big purple eyeliner I'm going to add
that to my waterline to intensify the
look a bit more this part isn't really
needed however depending on how hard
you're looking it makes a difference now
for lips I'm going to first I like to
kiss the back of my hand to remove any
like chapstick I don't want to just wipe
my lips crack like a little harsh and
then I'm going to add this liner this is
the NYX lip liner in the shade Brown I
always uses
so for lists I'm gonna go back to the
palette and we used both shades the
brown one of clubs brownies in a cup a
stiffening perfectly and then the purple
shaded co-op plump and so I'm gonna use
both those the ground color is going to
be like the main color and I'm at purple
in like the middle which kind of create
a plum meal if color just come in two
eyes little more so for my scarab you
just with my Mac cause Bolton bad lash
like my favorite mascara at the moment
because it literally makes my eyelashes
look so long and so full so just going
to apply that now I want to intensify
the highlight so I'm just going to take
the same highlight Guild's it and then
instead apply dress to my face I'm a
straight from setting spray to make it
more pigmented and then I'm just going
to apply it to the same place that all
right put highlight I just wanted to be
a little brighter so once I'm done doing
that I'm and just set my face really
fast and that pretty much completes the
look alright so like always when you
guys enjoyed this please be sure to give
us a thumbs up please subscribe I'm
going to be doing more coastal look soon
stay tuned for that and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
