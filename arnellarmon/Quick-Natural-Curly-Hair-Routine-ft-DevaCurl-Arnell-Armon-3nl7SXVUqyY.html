haven't filmed in a while well that's
not the case I did posted a couple days
ago and took it down because I just
tuned right about it but finally posting
after what it seems like has been
forever i text you a quick video on how
I spell my natural hair only because I
mean I've gotten requests on how I you
know stop my net your hair when I wear
my natural hair and I just like doing it
so this is what it looks like my natural
hair it's weird okay I'll explain these
things to you guys um okay how do I
explain it I haven't been cutting my
hair since like I don't even know how
long and thing is my hair grow and I'm
okay I'll let it be natural I'm gonna
keep healthy then I'm like all my diet I
want to like straighten in a hole which
times and my hair so the texture is
actually very very thin you get your
packet on the video but it's very very
thin it can't take a lot of heat so then
the for me flatter it so many times
they'll get damaged and then I want to
wear it curly but then a cambric curly
has damaged I'm okay would cut it off
again so I cut it off again that it
grows back I'm okay I'm gonna just leave
it healthy now am i okay I went straight
again which it probably happened cuz
it's getting to that lids orchestrating
again so um yeah I just I've had like a
very weird cycled my hair I try to keep
healthy that I'm like oh look so cute
went straight in um so yeah that's my
story that's why it's all so short
because I go to those cycles over and
over and over again multiple times
throughout the year now this time it's
like I'm so tempted straighten it but I
think I'm just gonna buy a wig that like
is this lint or maybe make a wig that
this length so I'm able to cut it and
straighten it how I would Tecna straight
my normal hair oh my natural hair I
really wanted to grow out I really
really want to girl I wanted me to wear
it curly so I mean I guess we'll see I'm
going to try stick to it I haven't put
heat on it and maybe close to two months
now so I'm doing okay and I actually
chopped a whole bunch of it off I'll
know if you guys remember my hair is a
little longer it was actually longer
than this because um if you watch one of
my wig videos I actually braided I'll
insert a clip right here a while insert
the clip of the video so you can see how
long it was I chopped it all off all of
it off
I talked pretty much all my dead ends
off cost tired of holding on to it
because of the Lyne and so this is like
how long it is right now it's not long
at all and honestly it's all over the
place if you guys remember I did have
this side shave but it grew back since
then that was like a couple months ago
so this side is a little shorter than
this side so that's why I gel them down
just so you can't really tell
so yeah my hair is going to knocker
stage but anyways enough talking it's
what explain you guys like my whole hair
story and if I find a really good
vitamin that helps my hair grow I'm
gonna start taking them soon I'll make a
video on that too so you guys can know
and yeah hope you guys enjoy this video
if you do please give a thumbs up if you
want more natural hair videos let me
know although I'm not really sure what
else I can do Oh with my hair so yeah I
don't know maybe you can like suggest
stuff I don't know but I want you guys
watch this video and I'll see you in my
next one so this is my hair freshly
washed conditioned I use my diva curl
one condition conditioner and the diva
curl no poo to wash condition my hair
I'm fresh or right here but really it
was really showing up in the camera and
so to style my actual hair I'm going to
use a diva curl super cream coconut curl
styler and the ultra define gel now do
my hair texture is very annoying because
it's just I just don't like down with it
which is why I always wear wigs I just
try to avoid it because it's so hard for
me to style it because when I put just a
curl gel in it it's too heavy for my
hair texture when I put a cream my hair
is a look and very dry so it's very hard
for me to find products actually work
for me and so in diva curl first sent me
like hair product which is like I wanted
to this like maybe April um they left a
little note in the box may set to mix
these two together and cells I got it's
jammed never done that before but ever
site did it actually worked for my hair
texture and so if you have like hair
texture like mine and is just annoying
finding curl products now even just with
their products but any come products
alone just try mixing a gel in a cream
together and see how it works for you
because I definitely work for me and by
the way this video is not sponsored by
them they don't know I'm doing this I
just really like the products I'm very
grateful that they send me them because
if they are not cheap but they work
really good so yeah on the next thing
I'm going to take this Pantene detangler
and just spray a little bit of that over
my head
and that's because when my hair does dry
it will get a little tangled like once
it dries out so to avoid that I just
some pillow detangler and I mixed in
with the curl cream now I'm going to
take this eco style gel and this
specifically for curly hair and so
that's why I love it because it's very
thin it's not thick at all and I really
can't put thick products in my hair and
you're wondering why I put so much curl
stuff in my hair it's because it works
for me by the time it dries down it's
perfect I just know if I don't put a lot
like my hair just is get so dry I don't
know why I really don't know why but if
you have tips let me know because my
hair just gets so dry it's actually
disgusting out dry gets it yeah so yeah
I'm using my fingers to part because I'm
going to slick the sides down now I do
this I said to begin the videos because
both sides are not the same Lynn and I
can't just like this look it gives me
like a mohawk type of style and I used
to always do this when I used to wear my
natural hair only so I just slicked down
the sides and I think it looks really
cute and I think it's at a cool lift to
do this if it feels any longer I
probably wouldn't do it because they
probably look kind of weird but the lint
that dye I think it looks pretty cute so
I'm just gonna watch you and watch you
guys I'm gonna let you guys watch me
style my hair and it's really not much
to it it's pretty simple
you
you
you
so if you want your hair to look a
little bigger you can take a pic and
then you just pick the hair up and that
gives a hair more body
there's works a little better once the
hairs are you dry but I didn't have time
for to dry and I'm yeah so you just need
a pic and then just gonna pick the hair
up and just like make it look just more
poofy in full it's pretty simple and by
the way I let my hair air dry and it may
look like you can see all the product in
it but once it dries it just goes away
it doesn't look y at all but if you're
in a rush you can just get like a paper
towel and just Pat on top to get rid of
any like extra residue by stopping your
air dry so yeah this is pretty much the
finished look I'm sorry I didn't like
show you guys how it looks when it's dry
but it's really not much of a difference
it just looks less wet I guess you can
say the app you like this video please

you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
