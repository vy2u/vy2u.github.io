little video on how to style this fool
Jade it's not full lace
it's a lace front wig from RPG hair now
just a little review and it's going to
ensure you Kamiya don't have too much to
say now okay I've been sent here from
RPG here before and I never did our
youth for them because I did not like
the hair at all not I wouldn't say the
hair well it was a little bit bit of
hair and the actual tracks themselves
I'm not like how their bundles are
constructed they are triple wefted which
makes whatever you do it it makes it
very very bulky so I was not a fan of
that and the hair they sit me it kind of
reminds me of pack hair where it was
kind of thin it'll string at the bottom
it was just not flattering whatsoever
and I was like I'm not putting on my
channel so I never did a video and so
they reach back out to me they pretty
much live here and they'll you know
what's going on and just like I'm not I
don't like their hair that okay do you
watch my new hair it's like well I don't
have much confidence in your bundles but
mess you guys off the lace wigs or you
know wigs whatever so I'll try one of
those so they sent this now I will start
by saying this this is way better than
their bundles so I won't come in their
bundles I'll probably never recommend
their bundles let's see me in new
bundles and they're completely different
cuz I did tell them once I got the
bundles I don't like these I think you
guys should get different vendor because
these they don't work but as far as the
wigs go I like this wig for the most
part however I could tell that the hair
is not completely version or human as
you can say I could tell that by the
smell I get when I Flatiron it I don't
know if that makes sense but I've been
working right here a long time and I can
kind of tell those kind of things so now
I don't know if they're claiming that
the hair is that but mostly sites they
do that it's able to hunterson virgin
hair human hair blah blah I can tell
that this is not not saying that's not
nice I'm just this is just what I've
come to a conclusion that's not 100%
human introversion here I could just
tell it's pretty easy to those kind of
things by the smell by how it asks me
flattering it I don't know it's weird
so the wicked self is constructed pretty
nicely it came like pre parted however I
did have to pluck a little bit to make
it part more natural a lot of most
companies of semi wigs they're their
parts always kind of suck but it's a
good middle you know tweeze it too much
they don't know how big you want your
part so you have option
like if you want your part to stay very
thin like how it comes you to keep it
that way
however thing looks more natural when
you pluck a little bit make it a little
more wide because I don't think anyone's
parts are that thin but yeah the way
that soft structure pretty nicely is
very easy to work with I really don't
have a mini backing stamp at the wig I
thought the density and the bang air is
little a little thick but I think it
works I mean if you know how to work
with it I feel like the hair itself is
nice it's good for people who want to
just throw something on and can't wear
it every single day they'll work
everything daffodil eventually kind of
like you know wear out and I don't think
you'll look that pretty you know once
you go outside and a hint deals with the
humidity and stuff like that um that's
just my personal opinion but overall I
think the wig is nice I think I made it
look as nice as I possibly can make a
look I think that the reason why this
would work works for me is because since
the hair is kind of thin itself it kind
of matches my real hair texture when
it's straightened so I feel like that's
why looks kind of natural I know when I
just went upstairs I mom said that the
hair looked like mine you know my
brother can even tell that was wick so I
think that's why it looks kind of
natural because when I straighten my
hair it's kind of you know it's this is
this thin it's not you know super full
body order you want safe but that's my
review on this my honest review and yeah
this is a really quick video just me
streaming the hair and kind of cut the
bangs a little bit I don't really show
how I lay down the wig because I'm not
an expert that I did use this got to be
ultra glue gel in order to make this lay
flat that's was my going anywhere but I
haven't perfected that method of laying
it down it's still a little messy when I
do it it still gets a little flaky so
that's why they including the video
because I don't want to teach you guys
how to do the wrong thing but this one
used to make it lay down I'm getting it
you know I'm getting better at it but
I'm not I don't feel confident showing
you guys I do it because I don't want
you guys messing up your waist but yep
that's pretty much it that's my little
review I'll talk a little bit more
during the video quick video if you guys
do like to give a thumbs up and if
you're not subscribed subscribe and I'll
see you guys when it's video so this is
the Wiggins natural state now I do think
that it looks much better in the natural
state it came in however whenever two
reviews I try switch up the hair to see
if it's capable of being straightened
and altered and you guys know I don't
like just keeping the hair as it is I
try to switch it up
so I decided to straighten the hair or
this straightener is from PYT hair it is
a titanium Flattr
I prefer titanium over ceramics I feel
like ceramic kind of burns your hair a
little bit too much it makes your hair
smell burnt however this one I've had
this Flatiron probably about a year now
and it's never made my hair smelled
burnt which is what I go for when I
straighten my hair this flat iron also
strains hair very well however I was in
a restaurant straining this wig because
I just wanted to do it really fast and
get over with so you'll see at the end
of some part to still a little bit wavy
but just know that this flat iron is the
bomb see I'm not really going to talk
much during this process I'm just going
to speed it up really fast I want this
video to be pretty short and I really
don't have much else say about the hair
like honestly I like the hair and the
wig itself is nice I could see myself
wearing it multiple times and after look
at the site I realize that they're not
clean with this is a hundred version
here at the Colin Indian remy and you
guys know Indira me sold at the be so I
store it maybe that explains the bundles
that I got from them because those
weren't version either but yeah I'm
going to speed this part up and I'll cut
back in when I'm cutting my bangs
you
we will try
No
cooling hired but we do
that's yes
so if you want something to hold on
first so I'm going to kind of cut bangs
well not necessarily I just felt like I
wanted it to flow a little bit on my
face so I took these scissors these
terrible scissors from Conair never bind
them they're trash I miss monsters I
still I'm going to find them you guys
see these scissor just suck hey does
anyone give me since for Christmas like
I'm gonna peel box like soon so if you
want to see me since as you can
but anyways I'm trying to cut just a
little bit off just so it looks like
bangs but they're not too baggy
then we get the flat arm and curl that
back and I'm going to create body in
like more definition in the front as you
can see right here but um honestly I
really like how to look so I end up
tucking the bank length my ear which is
you got to see that in one second
so in this part is that kind of create I
don't want to call them baby hairs they
weren't even really like baby like but I
created like shorter piece in the front
just one kind of like put some extra
land kind of like gel it back saying
just felt like it would make it look
better
what you did you got to see in one
second I'm just gonna like take a
toothbrush kind gel it back it just made
it look like less bald I guess you could
say I don't put too much effort into
this cuz I'm I haven't you know
perfected making baby hairs on wigs it's
really not my thing but I'm gonna work
on it because I know you guys want to
see that I just see it I just I kept it
real simple and this one I tucked the
hair behind my ears and I thought it
looked much better that way
this pretty much the finished look I
tough I mean not tucked I pulled out a
little strand of hair from the ops side
the bank stuff like it looked me to look
more natural now over I really do like
this wig like the more I think about it
I really do like it it feels really
comfortable I head it doesn't hurt it's
not giving me a headache or anything I
just want to wait to see the weights up
again if it wakes up again it's
definitely one I would totally recommend
if you guys like this video please give
