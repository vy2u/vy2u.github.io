thinking wow I know your hair looks
great it looks flawless so I'm here to
tell you that I was in shambles this
whole entire video okay I'm to tell you
that right now
it's gonna be pretty long that's because
I did not cut out all the mistakes I
made and all my shambles so if you want
to see how I got the hair to look like
this or style please watch the whole
thing um cuz I'm telling you Midway
you'll be like wow she's in shambles
alright so let's start it okay so this
is hair from ilaria here I have a video
on how I dyed this color to color me it
kept pretty cool I mean I like it it's a
little patchy but hey so this thing here
I just washed it so it's a little dry at
the ends that did happen when I first at
the hair so I was really concerned with
that and I didn't plan on cutting it
today but I mean I'm doing it so those
dry ends really didn't matter I don't to
show you guys that show you guys what
happens when you bleach and dye the hair
so I flattering the whole entire head
now cut that part out and good thing I
did because that part was very long and
this video would have been even longer
and so I was trying to decide how I want
to style the hair you know I I have
issues okay I could never keep my hair
pretty simple so I knew I didn't want to
keep it like this that's all I knew
while you in this video by the way this
frontal was already in shambles like
before I even got a chance is in
shambles that shamil's the last video I
don't know how I made it look good the
last video I did this hair because the
frontal eye freakin tinted it red and
another purpose of course what I want to
do that and like the baby hairs I over
plucked it it would just totally in
shambles you guys and don't even judge
me you know like I'm having expert and I
never claimed to be so you're gonna see
me this whole time I'm gonna be messing
with my baby hairs comes like wow these
look like trash but you know it all came
together so that's all that matters I
hope I can give you guys hope
all right so I'm figuring on my life I
like how the bangs are already falling
it's up chef a ground hmm
what I want to do with these I'm really
I'm really disturbed here shambles all
right
by the way um the lighting I finally
know what I've been doing wrong well
it's not on purpose I usually film in
manual what I'll flatter myself but
sometimes when I turn the camera on
actually like move the little spinny
thing on the camera and I spin it to
like ah Auto thing where it just the
light does something so that's why I've
been messing up my lighting I'm so sorry
for that but I'm out of dishes came here
anyways so anyways I said all that and
I'm still thinking about what I want to
do I'm really in shambles I'm just like
okay like huh I didn't know I did not
know I mean you guys know cuz you seem
in true
so I find things to me now I knew I
wanted things that were flowing like
frontwards and I know I want to like be
cut at an angle so as you can see I'm
pretty much starting from the back and
I'm cutting it towards the front part of
my face and make it longer in the front
now I'm not an expert hair cutter and
I'm honestly only good at cutting my
left side I'm using the right hand as my
dominant hand but when it comes to
cutting my left side I'm trashed and you
don't see that I'm so trashed when it
comes to cutting the left on my hair
like I'm cut my freakin right side all
all day long cuz it's easy for me but
when it comes to cutting my left side
it's really really really hard for me
right I pretty much piston right side I
tried to like zoom out the camera so you
guys to actually see what I was doing
and so now I'm doing the left side now
in this part I cut most of it on camera
however I realized that it was look it
was just I was too much in shambles so I
take the wig off put on Styrofoam head
now I did try to film that process
however these styrofoam headstand wasn't
tall enough to where my camera could
show the hair if that makes sense like
doing my filming setup it's it's
different like my lights and my cameras
in front of me in order to be able to
see me cutting the wig I would have had
to move my camera in my lights behind me
if I make sense so you can see
everything clearly
so that just TOI wasn't working out but
I mean I really didn't do much but just
make it even in the back so yeah I cut
most of it on camera though I mean it
wasn't too bad but I just I don't like
cutting my left side because I just
don't know how to angle it and I just I
hate doing this part
all right so a lot about this hair but I
talked about my first video and my
review hasn't changed much I mean you
guys see after I bleached yes the
ins did get dry and I showed them to
begin the video but Anza the only
problem I've had with this hair I
haven't experienced much shedding since
I dyed it and also I like the texture
it's it's a different section the other
hair I've had because mostly I have it's
always silky and it's kind of like the
processed type of silky whereas this
hair when you touch it it has a very
natural feel to it like it's a little
coarse but it's not too coarse it's like
it's a really nice texture I can't
really explain it cuz I mean you guys
techne cannot feel it through the screen
I just feel like it feels much more
natural than other hair I've received
and it feels a lot less processed and I
think that's probably why when I bleach
the hair in the first video it processed
so fast because it's not super processed
already so that's one thing I will say
that real like about this hair is that
the texture the texture is what I like
the most it feels really natural also
the luster the luster to the luster it's
like in the video dica it doesn't even
look shiny at all honestly and I kind of
like that because inside control the
shine by just adding oil you know what I
mean it's kind of hard when you get here
that's almost too shiny cuz and I just I
feel like it looks more plasticky in my
opinion so I guess less or too now I'm
not saying that like hair that is more
processors bad I mean it still feels
soft I just um if you want more if you
want hair that's not as process and
that's a traditional bundle type feel I
would recommend this hair because I just
it's you could tell that it's not super
processed like most hair is
it's kind of hair and I'm doing my thing
and I'm cutting my hand I'd even peep
that actually pierced his skin and so
after this video like this scissors you
can see like two little scissor marks it
really did hurt and this goes to show
that wow I'm really not professional
so yeah I'm doing the hair and this one
I realize that like the back it is not
going I want to go so I have had to put
on a styrofoam like I said I may start
from head like I said I tried to get
that process but the angle of the camera
the lighting was not working out so I
mean I really didn't do much I just made
it even but then it's like I knows when
to took the wig off put it back on the
hairline part was messed up and I hated
it and by the way yes I put on a sweater
because it's cold it's cold as heck and
I couldn't you know have the heater on
put on film in the video so I just put
on a sweater so yeah I'm just bumping
the ends of the hair just to make it
look more flawless I guess you could say
and make it less choppy looking
you
oh I almost curl this wig which I
probably would have more time but after
I did the first like curl or every want
to call it I was like ill know I'm not
really feeling this but I'm happy I did
do that cuz I learned this hair does
hold curls very well because now
compared to another hair company um when
I had the Eunice Malaysian straight hair
I had walked up the whole thing like
five minutes after that I went back and
straightening and it literally went back
to straight like like immediately which
wasn't a problem to me I mean that's
super convenient but it's a reflection
that wasn't holding the curls well now
this hair when I curled this hair when I
want to make it straight again I had to
go over it a few times and give it a
break then go back to it because it was
really holding that curl and so that's
nothing about this hair that it really
holds curls well even when I had coltd
in my last video and I took the wig off
the curls are still in the in the hair
until I washed it you know what I mean
so it definitely can hold the curl which
is a very good thing see I told you guys
I kept going back and forth my baby
hairs because I just knew something was
so off about that part and I figure it
out towards in and you guys see how I
fix that but even put concealer on it
will just something was off and I hate
it I just literally cannot figure out
what was wrong I just it was very very
frustrating
you
during this process all also having a
problem a stupid stocking cap kept
slipping back and showing like the
perimeter of my hair which is making it
look darker underneath the lace so kind
of a move it push you back I would just
like having every issue you can
literally think of
you
you
all right salt I'm calm with the front
part of Herricks I feel like I over
pluck that area so I try to add these
brow powders to that just to make it
look less light it didn't necessarily do
to wanted to do but like I said I was
gonna cut out any part where I messed up
so that's why I included this I just
felt like I looked a little bald right
there
oh the whole hairline of this wig was
making me so angry I'm like oh my god it
just something was totally off so I
decided to create more baby hairs on the
side I was just like oh I was so
frustrated you guys like iMac I'm
actually shocked I'm even posting this
because I almost didn't finish I was
like you don't f it like I did not even
want to continue it was just so
frustrating I just felt like Eric's my
perfected one part another part was just
like not perfect to me it just I don't I
don't know but don't worry it'll all
come together soon it's even after I
tried to fix it you guys did that line
it's like a dark line right in front
that was getting on my nerves I took the
wig off and I got my foundation powder
and I'm dusted pretty much all in the
front and that's when it finally looked
better I just I didn't know what was
wrong with it cuz I mean I didn't have
anything dark underneath it but after I
did this powder trick that's when it
looked much better so I just did my wig
cap then I put the wig back on alright
and then it looked it look much better
well at least in my opinion look better
than that just dark line so what that
dark line was making it look way more
wig like
another thing idea that I thought made
this look much better was instead of
having the baby on my forehead I just
brushed him back into the bangs I just
felt like it just looked better this way
like I was tired of trying to create
baby hairs on this way cuz the frontal
it just shambles okay so I just brush
the baby hairs back and I just I made
them less dramatic so the focus wasn't
on them because they didn't look that
good
you
fine thought I was done I was like wow
this looks really good it looks way
better than Holland earlier but then I
was editing this video and I seen some
that did not like so I'm like let me sit
my ass back down and fix it it will this
little space right here it looked very
ball to me and I could just post this
video a little bit okay you know it is
what it is I was like no like I just it
was working my nerves so I'd have this
red and brown shadow now I mainly use a
brown I choose the red to kind of like
at a little bit that tint to it about
too much I mainly use the brown and sky
blue eye shadow brush and I filled in
that gap now I didn't feel it too much I
don't want the part to look super
defined because and then it looks fake
but I just got rid of that bald look and
then I'll okay like this is a my work
with and then I reef lat on my bangs to
get rid of that curl that was there
earlier looks like I said it holds curls
like crazy and I was done alright so
this is a very long video um I literally
I finished - I thought I finished and I
was editing uh something's off you guys
like it's literally a hard process doing
this whole wig thing and the only reason
why I mean I'm sorry for the long video
I just try not to cut out any mistakes
in DMSO fomka watch doesn't know that
hey like I'll be struggling - and I'm in
shambles all the time but the more I
work at it I tweaked it I do little
stuff
I somehow - making it work now I mean
honestly this frontal was harder than a
lot of the friends I work with because I
kind of like messed up when I first dyed
this hair because I finsihed it red on
accident but um I mean I may look pretty
decent I mean I like it I would go out
the house like this so yeah I've tried a
long video I want to show you guys
everything I go through watch I figure
out how I do my hair think about how
it's down there I gotta make sure it
looks as natural so I could possibly
make it look but um
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you in my next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
