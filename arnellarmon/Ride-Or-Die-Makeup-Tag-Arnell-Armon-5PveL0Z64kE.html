whole face using my brighter die holy go
products I know Jeff and Hill created
this video idea so that's the
inspiration for that um now I already
have my brows done and I didn't court
myself do my brows however when I was
done I realized that that whole like
section itself was like 12 minutes long
and that is very very long if I include
that in the video it'll make because for
like 30 minutes which I don't think
people when I see me doing make it for
30 minutes however um either in my next
video the one after that I will do it
updated browser teens who doesn't wanna
see me do my brows I don't mind doing
that I've been using on new products I
will show you guys what I used I just
use benefits gimme brow benefits crowd
OH
burnout hand space benefits Ready Set
brow and benefits brow Zing's
that's what been using for my brows
mason it a lot it's not a lot I just
very particular but I will do updated
about routine I just I I was thinking of
you guys when I didn't include you do my
brows in this video because it took a
very very very long time so unless you
get started I'm I'm using my allure
Mercier radiance bronze foundation
primer now you guys know if you've been
watching me you know I love this primer
so much I first tried it like a little
sample silence as a fora and I've never
been a prime person I actually used to
tell people you don't need primer um I
honestly felt like primer was a thing
that make it companies made just to get
more money no some people can't get
really used without using primer like I
don't repair all the time and I it's
totally fine for me but being like more
skin issues like if you have really oily
skin or you know your skin is more
textured primer is good for you but um I
used to think that you know you don't
need primer until I drink this primer
and I was like oh look it's amazing it
gives your skin a really nice glow it's
super lightweight I just it's my
favorite so I went on and bought it
isn't like 35 dollars at Saks so it's my
baby I love her you next yeah I how like
it kind of added glitter my face already
it's
does foundation I'm using NARS sheer
glow now I love this Monday's you guys
love it because I'll show you I'll tell
you it broke my heart when I ran on my
left my other one I was like wow I
didn't think this was gonna happen I did
not see it coming I was using every
single day so what could I expect but
now this foundation is great because
it's really great coverage see how it
covers my star right there which I look
for that foundations cuz I hate this car
really good coverage but it's SuperDuper
lightweight and it doesn't feel heavy at
all and I find this foundation matches
my skin tone the most and all the
foundations I have it's like a perfect
amount of yellow but not too yellow
where are my other foundations like some
I think they'll be a little too yellow a
little too red or orange II like I make
it work but this one is just it's easier
and I just I love it I love it a lot
it's really amazing
see I matched me really well I think is
my perfect shade it's interesting though
because I have the dinars all day
weightless luminous foundation in the
same shade I used the shape Tahoe and
this looks stark Ravin me it even looks
kind of like darker in the bottle you
guys see that they're apparently like
the same sheet but it looks dark for me
I don't know what that's about and I I
love this one too
however it changes it's not one you use
every single day I learned it's weird by
Bart twice
I always determine if I love the product
final amount of times I bought it
because maybe the cheap person I am the
way I see it is if I could buy a product
twice admit look I really have feelings
for it I really do I didn't sleep took
three in the morning so I'm really tired
so forget Celia I'm using my bare skin
concealer actually own two of these on
the shapes medium golden and tan tan or
darkness shade of course I'll show you
guys it's more so like kind of like it's
very similar to my skin tone whereas
medium golden like brands it up so a lot
of times and I want to go for such a
look that's like more bold I'll use the
meeting golden by itself but I want to
look like a pretty kind of like natural
concealer look where it's not cheap
right I just mix the two together
motorcycles that's what I'm doing I'm
just mixing the two together as I was
saying for the motorcycles distracting
me I love it concealer because not only
is a very lightweight has great coverage
so much on my foundation but it's great
for the summertime wintertime pretty
much all the time
I'd like there's some concealers that
are great for the summer and there's
some consumers are great for the winter
like in the summer you want to use a
concealer that's like light wave of
course you still want to cover you still
want like you know have a bomb concealer
but it's hard to find concealers I like
what is for me my spin changes like in
the summer the winter time and so like
in the winter time I have to wear like a
more creamier concealer it just how can
I explain this it's good for both summer
or winter time because it has the
perfect coverage and it's very lively
and the sometime it doesn't feel too
heavy in the winter time it you know it
does this job like how hard is it to
explain that I don't know why it's like
so hard for me
my brain I did get enough sleep but
that's all I guess concealer I really
like it a lot
Matt's at the place I conceal I'm using
my Laura Mercier translucent powder you
guys know I love this powder it's likely
the best powder I've ever used at first
before I bought this powder
I'll using my banana pattern on banana
pass pretty cool but it's something
about this Laura Mercier powder that
just it it sets my under eyes better it
looks less cakey act like banana powder
sometimes I go look a little cakey I
mean once you pass things around it
looks okay but I just feel like the
Laura Mercier powder gives you just a
more natural finish and that's what I
like about it
I just I wish only went to the theme
Expo because my sister she went there
she said they had the powder I think
it's a - for like 45 or something crazy
what about so many so so so so many
these powers are really awesome now what
I like to do is I like to do one layer
first and that's what's that and then if
I'm doing an eye shadow I do another
layer and that's layer that I'm gonna be
focus on brushing off like when any eye
shadow like falls out that's my
technique which is what I've been doing
I like it alright so for eyeshadow I'm
gonna do one eye look off-camera and
then I'll be back to the other one it's
gonna be a pretty simple eye shadow look
because I don't want anything to freeze
me but I don't see I'll be right back
okay so did this eyes camera this look I
did if you haven't already guessed cuz I
mean you should have guessed
you know me you know my favorite palette
I use the annexes really hills in Modern
Renaissance palette my baby
it's literally like my favorite palette
I've ever owned um he's like the best
palette are you seeing at the morphe 35o
is my favorite palette now I like that
palette when it comes to doing like
clients makeup but other whose makeup
but this palette like for myself it's
literally perfect like I don't wanna do
it on right now in these shadows but I'm
just gonna cherish it while I can
so let's do this it's a very simple look
it's really pretty
to surprise eyelids i'm using my
lemonade primer by benefit of a limited
benefit it is my favorite shadow primer
it really is you guys know I use it all
time my videos I try other primers like
like the Mac soft ochre paint I can't
talk today I try the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm gonna deliberate it
like I did for like
much well it's not better than this
primer that's what I'll see this time we
just awesome I thought that's a perfect
consistency it just just for me um I
think the always wanted the soft ochre
paint hub network for me because a lot
of times I do have eczema on my lids
which you guys cannot see so I need a
good primer and I also need to be a
little thick so I'm gonna cover that
layer of like rough skin and so that's
what this one does the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot because since the consistency
of it it's a little too like thin so it
doesn't really like cover that layer
rusty and I have over my lids explain
that really great we'll all right she
said that I'm going to use too much of
my brush celebrity powder just gonna set
that I'm using all morphe brushes on my
eyes were the way if you guys want me to
get a morphic okay like me now looks
like I totally get a coat I just haven't
got one cuz I don't know if you guys
will actually use it but if you want one
tell me because I totally thought the
paper can do all that for you guys I
just I really don't know because
everyone has those coats and I do say
yeah I don't know I'm still me dude hi
okay the first shop I'm going to take
I'm gonna make the shade golden golden
ochre and raw Sienna I'm gonna put all
my lids go to ochres like a soft yellow
color and Rossi Anna's like her color
it's like a shady that's like my skin
tone I mix me I just have more control I
really like mixing shadows then we take
the shade raw Sienna by itself and go
back over that the leaves why I did that
because I'm in the past I'm using raw
Sienna by itself and I feel like
sometimes I'll be a little too dark as a
base so I noticed that when I mix it
with the gold ochre it kind of tones it
down a little bit I just have more
control over that like over eye shadow
look to make sure it's not too dark and
to make sure it's like really well
blended okay the shade Bert orange I'm
going to go back over wipe the raw
sienna I'm just building up that color
that makes this a real girl with Bert
orange
you know I'm going to place out all of
my lid picks a ruger by itself I'm gonna
place that more towards the crease area
just to deepen that of it might have a
shade Venetian red and makes it a real
girl and focus on more towards the
corner crease area I'm just building up
the color and slamming it darker
now I'm take the shirt antique bronze a
mix it with the Venetian red and put it
all over my lid I'm not going to do a
light weight color today I'm gonna do
like a darker color I'm gonna take the
shade lugar mix with Venetian red I'm
gonna place that on my lower lash line
alright so for mascara using the tardies
mascara by Tarte this is my favorite
lately umm I like it because he reminds
me of my old famous care which is
latched on beneath my bare minerals
they're very very similar the brush is
like the different sheet but they're the
same material the third both like laughs
stick and I knows they have the same
effect on my lashes if they made them
look longer and more full it's like
literally perfect I seriously love this
mascara like it makes my lash look so
long he main thing I've falsies but I
don't I love this mascara
we come along getting my lashes look
along it looks oh dude we put a little
more on this side oh my god Nega see you
I love this
alright by the way Ellie put mascara on
my top lashes first cuz I don't want to
put it on before I brush this powder off
cuz if I do the powers gonna get on the
lashes and eyelashes flap my lashes will
look ashy I don't want that so I'm gonna
put the bottom mascara on after I set my
face and i dis about our way so my face
you guys should know this I'm using my
spot focus powder a black radiance
seat saw was gone it's not my third time
to having this powder I just keep buying
it's awesome the fact there's only six
dollars I'm telling you man I moved to
put you guys on and you're not letting
me like those powders we really like my
I don't even know I don't know what
inspired me to buy it
I think I don't know I haven't been used
for over a year now but I'm so I bought
it I literally keep buying it over and
over and they rig as a price a little
bit since I bought it like I remember it
was only five dollars and now it's
closer to six dollars but so worth did
still worth it nos he's cheap and all
these other powder so I would leak it
complain I just hate seeing prices go up
okay that looks that's what that's what
happens when you first put the powder on
you do a thin layer first and then you
go back over with a second layer dust
away I learned that at first one is when
I was using this powder as well as
banana powder output a very thick layer
on and they would not brush it away I
don't have to do a whole bunch of
brushing and it was still a little cakey
and powdery underneath my eyes but every
time I started doing that thing where I
just do two layers I do one thin later
set and then another layer to get rid of
any fallout it's made my life much
easier like I totally recommend doing
that if you have any problems with your
powder kickin underneath your eyes do it
we lie to you
cool alright mascara my bottom lash is a
kindof on camera though because like I
can't I'll mess up so be right back
I really cannot talk my focus or knocks
I can't see anything I'm gonna be so mad
I thought this whole video and I wasn't
focused little time I I probably cry
probably anyways to contour I'm using
that the holy grail of mine well I mean
duh these are awfully real products but
I really love this and it's the soft
focus powder by Black Radiance but it's
a darker shade cm2 I use golden almond
to set in this milk chocolate finish I
used to contour and I like this shade
because pretty warm like it kind of
bronze my face a little bit but it's
like how I see it it's it's good oh god
I keep having brain farts and I like it
because it's pigmeat enough to where I
don't have to do cream contour
underneath I just put it on as a contour
slash bronzer
see that it's beautiful no beautiful I
remember that there's a point in time
where they ran out of this and it wasn't
there and I was so upset I was like how
could I do this to be half the better
came back
listen knew when I li just bought it
because the last one I bought and ran
out of it and the only four that I broke
it on to the all over the place come to
my forehead a little bit my jawline take
off some pounds
cool now for blush muses 1 by sigma i
dislike at her blush i notice that no
matter what a makeup look it looks good
with every single look and i noticed
that i always reached for it and it's
this blush it's hot quarter rosa and
yeah like i always reach for his powder
because it's like a it's a perfect shade
between pink and peach in my opinion
look I don't really like pink blushes um
and but I love peach flushes but I
really like blushes I like reflect both
pink and Clete that oh my god pink a
peach at the same time pink peach peak
in Pete speaking feet I like when they
reflect both shade so this blush does
that so highlight I'm using my favorite
highlight ever now there's a lot of
great highlights out there but I wish I
got this one it's like my go-to
I think it pops more than any other
highlight I own I just think it's like
the best highlighter like completely
like whenever I use another highlighter
and like uh it's not only popping I go
to this one and that's laura geller
gilded honey I actually have two of them
have a big one the baby one now um I
noticed this highlighter pops more when
you wet it however once you wet it you
two keep wetting it to make it work so
sometimes I'll use this one this why are
you wet that's why the tops like that
but this one I haven't wet just yet so
I'm just saying use like the dry one by
itself I'll show you it still pops and
just if you want like a crazy highlight
wet it and it's it's nuts like it's
insane like I just created a mirror on
my nose everyone I bought this I got at
Ulta it was a very last one and I am no
I am look at the price
I just looks like we chose that date Oh
old times warmer go the honey if you
want it kinda wanting to get it but it's
always sold out and so I go to Ulta I
grab it I don't look at the price I go
to the register she's like oh this is a
total when I was like how much $28
and I was like you guys know I don't
like spending money i was looking like
but i did it i was like you know I came
down here this is my plan
I'm not leaving now so I just bought it
but that sucks Lord gala reached out to
me shortly after that just send me
products and I was like wow I couldn't
just wait it but I mean it's okay
the reason why I highlight my lip on my
lid born lips don't have a bone oh my
god you guys I want to send it through
the morning I'm sorry my mind has been
like is this arnelle I'm really did see
though so don't might be the reason why
I have my Cupid's bow is because one
makes the lipstick we're cool but two
and this is a total tip if you are like
having issues lining your lips when you
do this it makes her like little Cupid's
bolt
stand out it's more prominent so you
know exactly where to line I can't
explain how much this like has helped me
line my lips I know I used to 101
classes whenever I'll teach someone this
they'll be like oh that's how you do it
and it's like yeah because when you
highlight it it brings it up front and
so you can actually really see it and
you know exactly where to line your lips
so do it
it looks weird sound like a I kinda like
a milk mustache but it's worth it all
right now lips
one's actually go get for my purse see
that's how it's a Holy Grail I don't get
on my desk I was in my purse I'll be
right back
okay this is my favorite lipstick ever
this brand makes my favorite liquid
lipstick formula okay they're amazing
honestly you donated me liner and uses
lipstick and mady's dose of colors cork
it's a fish I tried to suppose I went to
IMATS and I got the shade I think like
stone I don't know if you guys follow uh
do fat but I'd met the two girls are in
that counter super sweet super sweet and
they are like oh you know check those
clothes here kiss his lips tickle a DS
game lips because I've been totally
sweet um so I tried it and I was like I
put it on I was like wow like the
formula is amazing this literally and it
smells good it doesn't you have nothing
on your lips nothing at all like they
literally have the best liquid lipstick
formula in my opinion this is my opinion
but my opinion is pretty true I think I
don't know but if you haven't tried
those colors you'd really do like you
really try it and you won't regret it if
you regret it you could totally yell at
me but I'm pretty sure you won't because
you're like your lipstick sir I'm
amazing like I was like what the heck
good music every single day and every
single look I would look up Newton that
color is like I think it's amazing like
I think you don't need Meyer for this
it's like right what is life it's like
my favorite color um let me get off this
colors nuts
I'm a gloss on that's my favorite gloss
ever and I cannot do a video on products
I love the most without including this
gloss this company makes the best
glasses ever I'm gonna song every
company's nuts today it's okay but I'm
telling you best class ever I'll tell it
a story when I first tried this gloss I
was like 16 15 16 ish and it was $20 for
a gloss and that's a lot for like a 16
year old
me sixteen year old I was like twenty
dollars and back then this brand used to
make their Colossus in a tube so I go to
Sephora and I'll get a sample and I
would sample after sample I ever to know
just before I got a sample of this gloss
I don't know how they didn't catch up to
this and then I was 18 when I did
college for one semester when I got my
financial check like twenty dollars not
to me I'm bridge and I went invite the
lip gloss a ton away at last a month
because I used it so much and I was so
pissed I was like I I waited all this
time I spent $20 for it to last it was
less than a month I was like okay now I
see them I get this gloss I have to use
it for special I was literally just like
applying it playing me like every single
day all day and he ran out on me and I'm
sick anyways you guys probably never
what it is is buxom its buxom gloss this
is sheet sugar
I actually have two of these where's my
other one this one's running out though
this one's like pretty much empty this
is my new baby
I love you I will buy this gloss over
and over again if you have a smart lips
this gloss plumps your lips it gives you
it looks like really nice tingly feeling
I know you guys I pray like clear now
why do you need that you have like three
big lips but it's late like I'm just so
amazing the thing that pisses me off the
most is I worked for bareMinerals and
they're under the same umbrella and I
couldn't guy hold on to these gloss for
50% off and I'd aim to commander that
like I bought like two of them but I
should have look I knew I was in bare
minerals I know with my state when I
knew that I should have just saved up
and bought a whole bunch of glosses so
at least I'd benefit from working there
but I was more at the time
the best class ever oh man I love it
I'm totally here for this look now one
more thing on the grill same spring
because I gotta set my face the Saints
pray that I've learned is my favorite
one that I have bought probably like
five times now yeah look about five
times it's a smaller bottle and doesn't
last that long it lasts long but if you
use like me doesn't and that is the
Knicks do you finish setting spray it's
only eight dollars um best one out I
like it because it really doesn't make
you look dewy but it doesn't make you
look oily or too shiny it's like the
perfect amount of glow and it really
does set your makeup in place it just I
like everything about it I like the
price I yeah I've tried both to do it in
the matte um I didn't really see if it's
with a matte but maybe because I usual a
pattern so I already looked kind of
matted so I can't speak to if it works I
agree or not but I know the doing one
work sweet good because it gives me a
really nice glow without being too shiny
I'm scared I feel
back when I was like cheap and broke oh
I'm so cheap back when I was broke I
used to make my own savings free
I knew saved a lot of money that way
yeah I was like I'm not spending money
on spring I'm just making my own it's
really easy it's really easy to make
your plans break maybe I'll do a video
on that more love this look from my
teeth so I'll let this dry I'm gonna
like fix my hair a little bit cuz the
curls are probably gone and I'll be back
for my slo-moes why just do that why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
