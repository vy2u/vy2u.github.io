using my limited benefit primaries on
what I have camera because I kind of
improvise during this look I originally
used my Jack and Hill palette which has
the perfect colors for this look but it
also has it so improvising so first time
I take this like warm brown shade from
this makeup addiction Cosmetics palette
you don't have to use a specific shade
use like any warm brown shade you could
fine but you definitely don't want to
start with just using the teal because I
did that what I first this look in those
bad now I'm applying this tumescent my
rich 24 hour cream color and he has a
base because mine use this shadow which
is sharkbait by makeup geek it wasn't
technically enough on its own and so I
just use the domestic matters cream base
at the face and it like uluru does not
move so it's gonna keep this eyeshadow
on as long as possible and I put that on
top and then I go back with like that
brown shadow I use kind of blend it out
to make it look seamless now I'm taking
the same make a big skies mag palette
and I'm using this like shimmery teal
shadow and I'm placement on top of my
lid this is an important step in and
make it wipe and just wipe off any
residue because I messed up okay I feel
this look yesterday and I'm lucid ed has
told me do it over because I didn't do
this when I first did it and so when I
come back concealer on it makes the teal
and may look green angel is pretty bad
so just take your time and clamp to fall
out now to pry my skin I'm using my
sponge looks P Stila million emails
pretty much some bodies go with like the
rest let me have okay by the way my hair
is blowing cuz I have the fan on it's
very hot out here please forgive me yeah
I was not gonna film this about my
friend now foundation I'm taking one of
my favorite friend Asia at the moment
it's my color fact it's a full coverage
foundation it's very creamy and thick
and it's literally perfect but I kind of
want to buy a new one because I know I'm
gonna hit pan on this one like I did my
other one but it's a great foundation if
you want
people coverage but it doesn't feel too
heavy on the skin and it won't break you
out because like their products are like
hyper allergenic or whatever that word
is anyways um for good sale I'm taking
two concealers I'm taking tart shape
tape and Mac Studio well just call it
having some so long I forgot the name
it'll be down below though but it's NC
20 and I use that to kind of brighten up
the tart shape tape but I didn't want to
use it alone so I learned it's kind of
it's weird on my scan where I use it
alone I don't like it alone that's a
place I can sit I'm using my Maybelline
setting powder I didn't use a lot lately
only because I don't want to always use
my Lorimer powder on my chanel because
those are expensive so this will work
just as good and it's super cheap so if
I need to replace it it's going to be
very easy for me to do now I'm going to
complete the bottom half of my eyes I'm
literally gonna do the same they gotta
at the top where I start off with like a
transition shade and then I'm going to
add the teal that the blue eats not blue
more to you and you know I pretty much
did the same thing that I did on top
part so the sign - hi space muse my
black gradient soft focus powder there's
my favorite powder so distant my face
using that so the bronze like face kind
of contour muses Tarte bronze are always
used and every sort of name but it's
called hotel heiress and I think is
really nice because it have just like
the perfect might of warrants but it's
not to oranjee or too warm so it's
perfect now for blush I'm using this
blush by Mac plum foolery it's like a
pinkish reddish blush and have some type
of shimmer in it so that's why I chose
that or highlight I'm using an Anasazi
Beverly Hills highlight and this is so
Hollywood mine's broken in half which is
why I didn't show it and it's not
working like it used to but I used a
anyways alright sandal on my list I'm
using this like lip liner by Black
Radiance freaking a but it's like the
only rare one they have
so it should be defined I am going to
line my lips using that for lipstick I'm
using slip stick by joy cosmetics it's
called brick it's like a perfect red
color I've had it for a while and it's
my first time ever using it and I really
like it a lot now my face I mean
essentially my oMG glow cosmetics and
it's a shade incredible and since medium
so I'm assuming it's mid for medium skin
tones I don't know I feel like I look
good on anybody but I don't know so
that's why I'm using mascara is my
favorite mascara at the moment by Mac um
I don't know to me but check down below
because it's literally bomb I'm nine
more lash today
I never lashes but this mascara it's
like it makes my lashes full and that's
where I don't feel like making without
lashes so I'll gently recommend its
mascara and now I'm just going back in
and just kind of like perfecting any
blending and you know doing what I do
now I'm going back into the makeup big
cosmic Palin taking that like shimmery
teal and put it in the inner corner of
my eyes I look back of a picture and I
feel like I saw a little shimmer so I
decided to no at that and I thought it
brought the look together a little more
and so it's happy I decide to do that
then after I did that I was done I'm
glad they recreate this look over
because yes Shane out a pair today it
sucked
I did a really bad job but that's why
