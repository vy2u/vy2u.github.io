you're new welcome today's video is
kindly sponsored by tipsy and I'll be
using this month's glam bag in order to
create this really nice fresh spring
summery inspired look so here's this
month's bag I'll be taking these two
recipe sheet masks get two of them one
is the acai berry calming mask and the
other is the pomegranate firming mask I
chose the pomegranate one because I
wanted my skin to be firm and smooth
this mask is infused with red flower
extract to help soothe and lift the skin
and so I just took out a pack it was
quite cold which that's a good thing
because if you know anything you know
that cold at cold water it helps to
tighten up the pores and so I placed it
on my entire face obviously it's a sheet
mask for your entire face and I just
press into my skin and I let this sit on
my skin for 20 minutes and I just you
know cleaned up and did these are on the
house while I let it sit and then I'm
going to take it off and prep for my
makeup so as I said I let that off for
20 minutes then I took it off and there
will be leftover pock on your skin so
instead of wiping that off you want to
rub it into your skin to make sure you
get all the benefits of the mask has and
after I run into my skin I am going to
take my h2o Beauty moisturizer I forget
the name of this I don't know how
because I use it just like my third jar
but it's a cream like a gel it's a very
hydrating moisturizer and I just rub
into my skin on top of the mask and then
we'll be ready for makeup
so to prime my skin I'm taking my 50
beauty pro filter primer you guys know
this like my favorite primer at the
moment so I'm just gonna rub that into
my skin and then for a foundation I am
taking my NARS sheer glow you guys know
the drill I use foundation like every
other video if not every single video
and I'm gonna blend it out using my
fancy beauty makeup sponge
to conceal I'm taking one of my favorite
conceals at the moment this is the Urban
Decay all nighter concealer and I just
applied that underneath my eye on my
forehead and my chin as well and blend
that out with my morphe blending sponge
I use in like every single video
so to set the play second seal I'm going
to take my Chanel powder this powder is
one of my favorites and I've had it for
over a year so I definitely think it was
worth the $54 but I'm just gonna do a
thin layer first and then place a
thicker layer on top because I am going
to do one eye off-camera and then come
back to the other eye so I did one I
have camera and I'm gonna do this I
really fast
I'm gonna take my Urban Decay concealer
to prime my lid I'm gonna take this SL
miss glam in 15 eyes shadow brush and
this Apes a exclusive it's really pretty
it's like flap a fluffy at the same time
so it's very versatile you can use it to
pack on pigment onto your lid as well as
blend eyeshadows in to the crease area
it's like a blender brush and a flat
head brush in one and some take this
morphe blush palette actually do my eyes
I'm gonna start with a light shade first
I'm gonna blend that all over my lid and
I'm just going to build the color until
is my desired shade and I'm going to
grab other shades palette as well in
order to pretty much do what I did on
the other eye now I did notice that I
did both eyes differently if you're
doing this at home I think it's easier
to do both eyes at the same time while
you're doing YouTube obviously when you
do one eye of camera it's better cuz I'm
gonna see my idea what you're doing
especially if you're not like the best
eye shadow and so what I looking more
pink than the other but it's weird
because in person they look the same but
on camera one I looked a little
different let me know if you guys see
that but anyways I can't into do anyways
I liked it this brush is made out of
high quality synthetic bristles so it
does pick up shadows and pigments really
really well so I'll sable to really like
get the most pigman this blush palette I
don't know what inspired me to even use
this blush palette I think I just got in
the mail and so I was like you know what
- what do I start look with that and I
used two more if you blush pouts by the
way I use this one as well because I had
a slightly darker pink which I mean I
use for my other eye and so I used both
of the newer more she blushed palettes
for this look and then I cut out my lit
area comes at crease cut my lid area
what's in the Sailor in a small little
brush and then I'm going to take this
light shade first and
to set that concealer and then I'm going
to take this persona cosmetics
highlighter I believe the shade is
called Laguna and I'm gonna put that on
top of this in order to make it look
more shiny and just complete the look so
after I'm done with the top part of my
eyes I'm gonna go to the bottom I'm
gonna take this like peachy shade from
the first blush palette and use this
same brush in order to just dust em with
my lashline and then I'm going to fix my
lid because I didn't think that this
color
well the way I did it was payment enough
so I took this Mac Studio Fix concealer
Studio finish I I never know what it's
called and then I just placed the
highlight directly on top of that
instead of putting the other shade on
top just so the highlight pops even more
because the other eye I noticed was
brighter so to fill my brow I'm taking
this your cosmetics arch arrival brow
definer and this is a shade taupe Tom
this brow pencil is very similar to the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer in
regards to how its shaped it's like
triangular and it has like a pointy tip
so the pointy tip I'm able to get like
hair like strokes towards the front but
then when I owe this horizontally and
like fill my brows upwards
I'm able to fill in a lot of my brows at
once this brow pencil is sweat and
humidity resistant is also waterproof
and it lasted 12 hours it is talc free
paraben free gluten free and cruelty
free it was very easy to use and so
after I filled in my brows I just clean
up a concealer and blend that out and I
was pretty much done I mean I wanted to
be perfect so I went back in and you
know add a few more strokes but I was
pretty much done after it only took like
five minutes to this brow
so for mascara I'm taking this milk
makeup push mascara it is infused with
cannabis oil and it's really great I
suppose I lost it which kind of bums me
out but I'll buy another one anyways I
am just going to put a very thick layer
Vance my lashes I don't plan on wearing
falsies and then I'm gonna take this
Urban Decay foundation powder I don't
know my shade I got this at Marshall's
for a cheap price I wanted is like $13
and I'm going to buff that into my skin
and dust away that powder you through my
eyes use this Real Techniques powder
brush and I'm gonna go in with a smaller
Sigma brush to really get that powder
off of my skin and then I'm gonna go
back to my eyes and just perfect it if
you might say or just you know I was
trying to fix excite notice that it was
looking a little off they were looking a
little different so here I am just
trying to fix that and make them look
identical
so to bronze my skin up I am taking my
hotel heiress bronzer right Tarte and
I'm going to take my same foundation
brush I was still disturbed with my eye
look oh it was confusing I feel like it
was the lights because I promise you it
looked perfectly fine in person anyways
um please don't drag me
I'm gonna take my bronzer and this
bronze my skin up really nicely and then
I'm going to take my Sigma core DeRosa
blush it's all my favorite blushes I've
had this for over oh I've had it for
three years now summer I use it for the
first year Coachella's I've had this for
three years now and it's still lasting
me ask places a lot on my cheeks as well
as over my nose to give me a very flush
like finish now for lips I am gonna take
mac chestnut lip liner first and I am
going to go pretty light on this because
I'm gonna fill my lips in with another
lip liner in a second
so the last proc I'll be using for my
ipsy glambag
is this huda beauty lip contour and lip
liner and this shade trophy wife and i
actually really like this a lot because
it lasted forever um it was like mad but
not mad like did my Matt I don't know
what you would call that but it wasn't
going nowhere my lips but it wasn't like
to the point where it dry my lips out
either pencil does claim to be long
lasting and waterproof and it's also
transfer proof and I could test that
because I mean like I just said earlier
I had no issues with this at all and so
you guys know me had to do a gloss on
top of that I took this Lancome like a
loss lip treatment type joint um I just
put on top and then to highlight I took
the same highlight used earlier my lid
so I persona cosmetics i used this BH
Cosmetics highlighter brush and I just
you know place that on my cheekbones and
a little my nose the typical places
where I highlight and that you set my
face I'm gonna use the Morpheus any
missed and I just you know Jeron myself
and that and applied a little more
highlight on top of that to make sure
that it pops then I applied my lower
lash mascara once I say and spray dried
and after that I was done with this look
and so I did my hair and put a shirt off
camera and then you know it was time for
some slo-mo action so once again thank
