just get familiar with it before I get
into my modeling so this is my homepage
all my favorite brands I picked out when
I first created my app or my profile are
right here so I have Cole Haan Nike and
Mac everyone sells clothes makeup hair
accessories shoes pretty much anything
you can think of that's like sellable
it's gonna be on posh market it's so
easy to do is you get to see you know a
little bit everything and then when you
go to the shop you could type in
whatever you want to look for I was
looking for green shoes I'm gonna type
in my key and this little pops up just
different Nike items all over the world
imma type in hair and you can see
there's like hair accessories hair ties
even extensions I see someone using bras
poshest photos like this Raj um so yeah
a little bit of everything and then you
go to your you know your comments this
shows who's following news interests in
your closet there's people who would
share your listings for you that way
your listings can get discovered more or
faster so you can sell your item faster
and so um yeah it's a pretty cool app I
used to sell my stuff on this app that
calls nineteen years old so I knew how
to use it perfectly fine it was super
easy for me here is my closet has my
picture my 85 followers um you get
follow to automatically when you join
based on your interest and so here is
like what am i listening shows a size
the shoe the color the category how much
I paid for them and how much I'm selling
them for and um yeah it's cool so you
have you know your likes I haven't liked
anything just set you have your actual
profile that's me
so you know you're like you know buy it
from then you have your sizes so I'm
size six and dresses pants all good
stuff so when I search for items easier
to find my size then I have my sales
which are not existing as a now but they
look
my balance pretty much this app isn't
the most easy app you could if I could
use that 19 years old you can use it now
because I mean I wasn't the smart in
nineteen year I wasn't as smart in
nineteen years old so yeah they Nick
fall new people you follow whoever you
want based on their closet based on what
you like in them yeah that's pretty much
it and I'm going to show you guys how
easy it is to sell an item so in order
to sell an item you just hang up on your
wall make sure it's like a white
backdrop so it's clean and nice or maybe
you just post a picture of you wearing
it and then you can pick a filter based
on the mood of the clothing so I picked
I think it picked this bright filter
yeah and then you add the details the
title you want something nice just like
something like probably better than this
alright maybe not this is a burnt orange
long-sleeve shirt so yeah you want to
add that and then you don't actually put
words from cuz you actually be given
that option later on and so you describe
the shirt I'm like it's a long sleeve or
insured like I don't know how else to
describe it besides it being it long it
kind of reminds me I got prints a little
kini with how loose it is anyways then
you pick the category of course this is
a top so I'm going to select tops then
I'm going to choose it as it like to
think as a blouse because it's like
sleep blousy to me then Quan you only
have one of them and then the size this
is a small so I'm going to put small
that's I'm selling it cuz I don't fit
anymore it's a size 4 but it's small ok
and so then I type in hmmm that way when
people surf hmm my listing comes up
because it's from hmm then you select
the color that way when you people type
in orange shirts I pop up and I put in
the original price which is a thief like
$20 um I put 2 potato accident and I'm
gonna sell it for 10 so I'll get $7 once
it's sold of course posh marquees
they're cut and then you post it then
you look at your closet it is there it
is the easiest thing ever so let's get
into my um my fake modelling now
okay so the first time I'm selling is
this a nice little long-sleeve orange
shirt I wanna clock a blouse it's very
loose-fitting I've only a reward like
once actually I worried once it's
actually worn a Rihanna inspired look if
you've been following my channel so I
first started its I wore it like one my
like first videos and so um yeah I got
some black shorts on don't mind my
cellulite okay it's normal I have it
you know I'm trippin you know I'm
chillin I like my body so next day I'm
selling is this little shirt it is like
blue and white stripe I don't know why
am i confused as if I'm not looking at
right now I've actually never wore this
shirt I bought if everyone I didn't try
it on when I bought it and so when I
find try it on I didn't it didn't fit
the way I thought it would fit so that's
why I'm selling it next I'm selling this
dress on this dress it's for someone
probably who has a flatter stomach than
me it gets longer however I keep it
shriveled up to hide my Fupa
which is why pointing to you right now
so um yeah it makes your butt look nice
it's pretty like body con ish I like it
I just I I'm kind of self-conscious in
sometimes because you know I think it
shows a lot so eating for me
next thing I'm selling is this nice cute
little pink dress as well as these shoes
I wore this outfit to this Maybelline
party up for Sheila's mascara launch and
so and I showed she's old too and so um
yeah I know I'm never gonna wear this
again I bought these pink shoes just to
wear them once I know I'm never gonna
wear them again so yet both these were
only worn once and they're really cute
this outfits so cute it almost makes you
want it like again I almost don't want
to sell it but it's in the video so it's
gonna be sold
this dress is kind of short too but I
mean it's cute it's not like too short
and so next I'm selling are these pans
I've got a little thicker you know
gained some weight so these pants are
kind of small on me like they may look
good but it took some time to even put
these on and they're so cute though I
have another pair that's all green but
my butt was so big it kind of ripped the
butt part they're from Lord boutique
they fit your body so nicely they're so
comfortable
I wish and keep them if I could I would
but like I said they're too small for me
there
small and I'm more so like medium so I
don't need these I don't need to be
looking crazy and I need to breathe so
selling those next thing I'm selling are
these green shoes as well as this green
sweater these shoes are all similar
boutique and this lettuce from American
Apparel and um it's a very good quality
sweater the only one is selling is
because it doesn't fit me the way I want
it to I've only worn once and I only
wear these shoes wants to to an event
and I just don't wear them like that so
sell them next I have this jumps to you
that I've had for years I only wore one
time on Thanksgiving it's so cute
obviously wear it at this video maybe
want to keep it but it's just been in my
closet for years I just I had maybe it's
like three years old and I just I
haven't worn again I wore one time for
Thanksgiving and I kind of cancelled
after that and I'm it cancelled but like
I don't like repeating stuff like this I
find this like a one time kind of thing
what is for me so I'm selling it it's
only worn once it's super cute makes
your hips look nice makes your body look
nice so um yeah hope you guys enjoyed
