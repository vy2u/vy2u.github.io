D hydrating primer and my la Mer
assyrians froms primer I said Lee makes
Leslie together
not sure what inspired me to do this but
I really liked the combination because I
mean lerma see everyone knows that
that's like my clear primer and kavadi
does hi Jody primaries become my
favorite Souls like hmm that makes my
two favorites together let's see what
happens and it was magic it was magical
my foundation taking my Kat Von D lucky
foundation and mix it with these cover
FX custom enhancer drops it's like
pretty much like this shimmery stuff you
mix into stuff and it makes it glow I
forgot which one I'm using though but
it'll be down below I just I literally
cannot remember cuz I filmed this video
like probably three days ago but I mix
those two together and like I deal with
my primer I just rub it on my hands a
little bit and then I applied to my face
and so now that that's on my face I'm
just gonna blend it out with a damp
Beauty Blender
you can see on taking Mike a model up
concealer in the shade warm and I'm just
going to play sign with my eyes on my
forehead
I'll leave on my nose and also on my
chin
antek on time taking this convex click
stick and this is sheet in 100 I'm going
to contour my cheekbones I'm an attempt
to contour and highlight my collarbones
you guys let me know have you seen a
difference like when I was doing this
videos like okay like I don't even over
see saw a difference I just I don't know
I've never done it before so I decided
to do it by mean if you don't want to
learn how to do it you don't have to
watch this part I just do something
different
so now just going to blend out my
concealer in my contour my face and I'm
going to move on to my collarbones
Oh as I was playing this out I really
did it kind of wrong I think that if you
want to do this it's smart to put the
contour shade first then blend that out
and then put the concealer like
highlighter sheet afterwards because if
you do them both together to try to
blend them out I feel like they just
kind of blend together and they look
kind of muddy so I'm that's what I
realized I kind of went wrong and I
almost gave up I was like you know what
this is a fail it looks horrible but I
mean I went back I'd try to rehire light
them um you guys see that in one second
cuz I was like you know I can't just
like start something and not finish so
that's when I go back I'm like I really
want to work so I decided to put more
highly on it so look less muddy and I
think it made like a cool little
difference I mean I like do much more
I'm gonna set the play second sealed
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
and then I'm going to do one off-camera
like always is like a routine and then
I'll be right back
I didn't want to have Cameron that's my
cam what I really really really loved it
it almost looked like perfect to me you
know I'm not like the best eye shadow
person well I'm getting better like uh
I'm just all over the place
I could see myself getting better like
the more I do my videos and then I like
watch I look like old ones I could toast
to myself getting better so that was
pretty exciting to see video ways I'm
priming my lid because my benefit primer
like always lemonade and then I'm going
to sad top of that with my translucent
powder by Laura Mercier and then I'm
gonna go into shadow so the first shot
me to use this one soft brown shadow
I've been using it like all the time
it's tan line so I'm making me it's like
my favorite shadow at the MoMA because
it kind of just like goes with
everything and I'm just gonna like flesh
that all over my lid kind of and I'm
gonna go with this other make the shadow
I forgot the name but it'll be down
below it's like just slightly darker
than the first one I use sorry I'm Moses
to music when I film like there's never
time I mean not listing music but yeah
be taken eye shadow just kind of deepen
that color a little bit and then I'm
going to get a little brush of some
concealer and I'm going to carve out my
crease
after you you know use the concealer to
carve out your crease you're just gonna
stay on top of that what's the light
clothes translucent powder so it doesn't
move and it stays flawless now I'm
taking this darker brown shade I thought
if you use these three shadows like
every video I'm just going to kinda like
deep in the upper part of the crease
just a little bit not too much just very
little
I'm taking my Mac mixing media and I'm
gonna go into my Mario pala of anastacio
and I'm gonna take this one shimmery
like champagne shade right here and
that's I'm going to use for my lid so I
just like place that makes a medium on
my lid and I mix it with the shadow and
I just keep packing it on until I get
the right amount of shimmer I'm looking
for
I was time for my wing I'm taking this
liner by la girls like a felt-tip black
liner I would recommend this if you are
that aren't that great at doing wings or
maybe just a beginner because it's like
the perfect I don't know like I had this
one my tart but it's almost too liquidy
to where it's like you could very easily
make a mistake but this one's good but
it's not like too good if that makes
sense I don't know I just think it's
good for beginners and LA girls really
inexpensive so highly recommended and
I'm gonna pop my lashes these are just
Jade by who - beauty so I put those on
and I'm taking this glow kit - as
Beverly Hills I'm gonna mix these two
shimmers right here and then I'm going
to put that on my brush I'm a spray with
setting spray I'm gonna place that in my
inner eye corner because that was the
things called my inner tear duct I think
that's what it's called tear does that
thing and this just helps my eyes look
whiter
you know so I'm done with damaged panel
and mascara my lower lash lash line my
bottom lashes and that is it for the
mascara part so now I'm gonna set my
face using my soft focus powder black
gradients are you guys getting tired of
this powder like I should probably try a
new one cuz like this is all I use I
don't know if she's my favorite like I
have other setting powders and I'll I
try to use it in my try to give him a
chance it's just I like this one the
most so I just keep using it
though I tried something new and I tried
to use this soft focus powder it's not
the milk chocolate it's like the one in
between my foundation shade and milk
chocolate so it's like in the middle and
it kind of add a little warmth to my
face but it didn't really bronzed me
enough so I end up taking my milk
chocolate and I end up going over that
just kind of deepen it because I wasn't
that impressed
once I'm in bronze bronzey my skin I'm
taking this back blush got a little
lusty I'm you you won't find this in
stores cuz it was a limited-edition one
but I mean if you just take like a just
simple red rosy blush you'll be fine I'm
just brushing that upwards on my
cheekbones and into my bronzer just so
it's all seamless now I zoomed out so I
can show you guys have a highlight of my
chest the background um it didn't change
it just got brighter because like I
don't know has to do my camera when it's
like more zoomed out it looks brighter
so don't worry about that but yeah I'm
just taking the glow kit again I'm just
highlighting my collarbones I'm gonna
highlight my shoulders and I'm just
gonna highlight all over
so what's up in highlighting my
collarbones and my shoulders I'm just
gonna go I'm ahead of my face I'm just
going to you know do what I do like
always my cheekbone my news same old
same old
so set my face music Scandinavia setting
spray and I'm just going to set my face
because that's what you do but set in
spray
well if you ever want your Holi to pop
more after you setting spray you can go
back over and put a little more
highlight on because then the high is
going to stick more to your skin it's
gonna pop way more it might not picked
up too much on camera but trust me you
could see it in person so now for my
lips I'm taking this black radiance lip
liner this is like the color brown I
don't think it has a name I'm a lot of
stuff does that they don't have names
they just have numbers but I think they
only have two lip liners they have this
brown one just like Burgundy one so
shouldn't be that hard to find and I'm
just gonna line my lips and then I'm
gonna put my lipstick on in like one
second for my lips I'm taking this
liquid lipstick my mother's cosmetics
called breast and roll you guys this
lipstick is perfect the formula is
perfect the color is perfect everything
about it is literally beautiful it's
like a carom rise with my cork by dose
of color it's just a little darker and a
little more warm but this lip color is
awesome like I love it
you it's my armpits I know I'm pizza
girls have a mole on my armpit anyways
I'm kind of unique but now I gotta
figure out my hair and don't worry you
guys I'm gonna do a video about this
hair it's like they're my favorite like
the color everything it's like so
low-maintenance and I'm not starting all

threw on a necklace and some earrings it
was a bit much but I liked it all went
