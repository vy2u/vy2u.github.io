lot of you guys asked me to film this
look that I had in a previous video mind
and actually filled with that same day
so yeah edit it pretty fast and here it
is so if you want to see how I got this
look which think is pretty flawless and
very pretty just keep on watching
alright so I did what I can to make this
fast I'm going to take my lemonade
primer by benefit and I'm going to prime
my eyelid using that and then I'm going
to take one of my makeup addiction
cosmetics pallets I forgot the name of
this but it'll be down below I'm going
to take this like it's like a flesh tone
shade I'm used as a base and I'm put it
all over my eyelid I'm take another
makeup addiction cosmetic palette and
I'm going to use this like first Brown
orange shade and then I'm going to start
building up a little color on my lid
area the top part of this eye look is
pretty neutral
it's where the liner that's where like
you get the pop and you'll see that
later on the video I really like looks
like these where it's kind of natural
but then you get a pop of color and so
now I'm going to mix this color with the
other darker brown color I'm going to
focus that on my outer crease just to
deepen it I mean basic eyeshadow look
the basics now I'm gonna take my Mac
mixing medium which is good for her to
list because it makes store - uh the
chef of the shimmer does it transfer
onto you like the crease area I was
watching some YouTube video that's my
face like that I'm just going to take
this pretty much basic shimmer color I'm
gonna place it all over my lid this
meals going pretty fast but I mean I
hope that's okay I just gotta get
straight to the point you know what I'm
saying
so now I'm going to take Kim karma by
Stila like a liquid eyeshadow and I'm
just going to use that to make my
shimmer pop you won't even see it in the
camera
does pick up but it makes a different
person it makes it more just make the
glitter look thicker and I just really
love these look I bought for them at
Sephora and obtained like $120 but it
was worth it and I really like them
they're awesome alright nice mascara on
and for my lashes on and I always use
mascara it's tart tardies it's like one
of my favorites and then for my lashes
these are called Bingle Bingle
it's fine to bounce them oh I just
wanted through one of them away that's
what those were oh my god anyways oh my
god I'm so mad you guys I just realized
I actually threw one eyelash the way
comes staring at one right now and
earlier I found it but I didn't know
what other pair was so I'll bouquet
absolutely the way I just realized it
speed lashes but you know it's okay you
live and you learn
I'm really sad actually Wow okay okay
anyways go put my lashes on
now I'm gonna take one of my favorite
prom it's all time
this is radiance bronze by Laura Mercier
and it's on the name just gives me a
nice little glow it's very gold and I
just love this primer so so much around
eh I'm taking this covergirl foundation
mixed with this la girl foundation I
don't even know what inspired me to mix
these I've showed a covergirl one it's
like my perfect shade but it's a little
pale and the la cara one it's like all
of my perfect shade that's more yellowy
so I just figured that makes the two
together will make it pretty cool shade
and it's a it looks pretty cool and I
don't know I just I just I didn't want
to evil foundation okay so I mix those
two together and then I blended that out
with my Tarte sponge
she concealed I'm taking my Kevyn Aucoin
sensual skin enhancer which is my
favorite and I'm just going to like
please find a place where you could
still and then blend it out
naima take my Chanel setting powder and
such place I conceals I use a lot of
fancy process a because this stamps
actually Saint Patrick's Day and that
plans that night even those plants out
ruin Oh doesn't want thing about it oh
my god but oh just watch this video
finish me sack makes me realize how mad
is that I was that day I wasn't prepared
for it I don't even know my day was
going to be in shambles but at least I
make was nice and at least you guys
liked it and he's not going to film it
so you guys could see it so I guess
that's okay so yeah I'm just you know
putting powder on my face and what am I
gonna do this
oh time to contour I'm going to take my
Kula bronzer my benefit which is like my
favorite bronzer ever favourite in the
contour and just in the contour I did
something differently this day I didn't
I usually set my face before I contour
by dint set like it was powered before
contouring so the powder gets to stick
to my face not even sure was inspired me
to do that I just I did it and I thought
it was pretty cool
now for my eyeliner so I used two liners
don't know the names then one by makeup
geek and it's like this light teal and I
used one from oh joy cosmetics it was a
good dark green I wanted to make like a
different kind of dream so I mix these
two together to get the kind of green
out going for I really do not like using
liner on my waterline because it always
bothers my eyes as you can see but it
looks really pretty so I guess it was
worth it but yeah I mix those two lines
together to get the color I was looking
for and don't write names to be down
below and everything so don't even trip
off that now I need some green shadow
and you're gonna see me test down my eye
first I wasn't sure how it's gonna look
but after I liked it I end up getting
this one green shadow I believe as eye
makeup geek the name will be down below
but I just got this green shimmery
shadow and I placed it underneath where
I put the liner
not to send my entire face I'm using my
Mac Studio Fix powder in the shade in
c-45 oh just just recording this
voiceover and just watching this video
makes me want to do makeup like do you
ever watch tutorials that make you want
to go and beat your face like oh this is
not coffee for me to say that my own
tutorial because I keep struggling to
feel this way too but if I go have
makeup on right now watching it hello
makes you want to go put it on because
it just looks so pretty and flawless
like I don't know my skin is breaking
out right now though so my life is in
shambles but I still want to put makeup
on because I just so fun just watch
everything come together and I don't
know it's like art on your face now for
blush I'm taking this matte blush mache
devil which is like this bright orange
color but I used a very very little I
just like dab the brush in a little bit
and then I just place on my cheekbones
or my cheeks you can see it too much but
um that was the point that's what I was
going for now for lips I decided just do
a clear gloss we're not clear like a
shimmery gloss why I didn't put a lip
liner no lipstick no nothing I just I
just felt like this would go good with
it so I put shitload of gloss on my lips
do my lips and I realized I almost
forgot to put highlighter on because I
was to my list last and then I'm doing
them off like I'm missing something and
I was like okay it's the highlight so I
took my coal girl glow can't buy this
Beverly Hills and I hire my face I
cannot believe almost forgot like I mean
the looks do a pretty but you cannot
like not wear highlight it's just weird
to set my face I actually used to
setting sprays they're both my Milani
ones like a regular setting spray and
one is naked dewy and you don't have a
lot of makeup on like a lot of eyeshadow
head and powder heavy concealer I like
using a lot of setting spray just to
make sure that once the makeup really
set on this to my skin it looks as
natural as possible then after dry I
decide I want to lift a little more
shiny so I took this girl acting like
lip topper you probably can't see too
much in camera but it made a difference
of person just made my lips look a
little more shiny so I put that on top
of the gloves soon and everything look
so perfect self however guys enjoyed
