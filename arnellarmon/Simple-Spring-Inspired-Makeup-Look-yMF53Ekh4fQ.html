take NYX jumbo pencil in milk and I'm
going to use as my base because I'll be
using pretty light colors today so to
make them pop as much as possible I'm
going to use a white base
so I blimp that out but then I'm going
to go back and use that pencil again and
put it directly onto my lid just to make
the Sham right place on my lid stick a
little more and I'm going to take this
like lay like it's like a silver pink
color for my Nubian pal Abed you this
place I'm going to place that all over
my lid
so after I get done packing that onto my
lid I'm going to take this yellow shade
for my pallet and I'm going to work that
into my crease
so after I take that yellow shade I'm
going to get this like lighter brown
shade right here and I'm gonna put that
in the corners of my crease just to
deepen the color just a little bit but
not too much
so that's pretty much it for my actual
eyes now to highlight underneath my brow
bone I'm getting I believe this is high
brow by benefit I'll put the name of the
discussion box below and that's just to
kind of like super defined my brow bone
I've had this forever and I'm just now
starting to use it and I actually really
really love it like it's yeah it's the
bomb
so I blend that out and then I'm going
to take a highlight in place underneath
my brow bone to highlight any use is so
Hollywood by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
by the way if you guys think me like
moving and stuff it's because listed
reek while I was filming this it was
very hard not to dance and sing to drink
so I'm sorry for that
now it's time for my face now I sped
this part up because you guys have seen
me do this a lot honestly I didn't
really do too many things differently
I'm using the same primer I've been
using it every single in my videos my
favorite one and then for my foundation
I'm using Mac face and body mixed with
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD the reason why
did this cause breaking out and so
whenever I breaking out I mix my face
and body into my foundation because the
kind of like waters it down so it's not
too heavy onto my skin so it makes my
breakouts less obvious I know you guys
can see my breakouts in the camera but
yeah I had a little bit of eczema around
like my chin area it was a little bit of
bumpy but I mean I'm happy he didn't
show up on big screen and for concealer
I'm just using this NARS one I know I
haven't used my NARS concealer in one of
my videos that's because like I mean
this concealers cool but it's definitely
not as great as I as I was told it was
and it doesn't crease or whatever I just
I don't know I thought it was gonna be
magical based on what everyone says but
hey it's a cool concealer I use it you
know when I'm bored and I realized I
haven't used in forever
yeah so pre-much is doing the same stuff
so yeah sorry split it really fast but
let's see I want to play a game let's
play
would you rather would you rather eat
pizza for the rest of your life or
cheeseburgers for the rest of your life
come below which one you guys whether
you for the rest your life I'll tell you
guys mine in the comments when after you
guys are done I want to know what you
guys say first
I think the only thing different I use
is blush and papaya by Laura Geller I
actually have been so obsessed with this
blush lately like I've been going hand
with blush and it's really tripping me
out guys because literally like I think
that a year ago I hated blush blush was
not a part of my makeup routine
highlight wasn't even part of my makeup
routine I really just didn't like makeup
I didn't like the whole full face thing
but now I can't go without highlight or
blush but anyways I sped up too fast but
I here I'm just finishing the bottom
half of my eyes with the yellow and
brown shade I used earlier I kept it
very simple then I just popped on these
cheap beauty supply store lashes and
this is what they look like now for the
lips I'm using my all-time favorite
gloss it's by buxom where I love all
books and classes now guys it may look
really sticky but that's because these
are really sticky but they're amazing
they're like $20 these are the mini ones
I got like I'm a two pass for 18 but
yeah they're awesome and to set and
finish my face I'm using my Urban Decay
stain spray which is the bomb I just
started using it and this is the
finished look I love this look at super
simple super easy super springy for my
natural folks and you guys like this too
please give it a thumbs up and make sure
to subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next video
which would be a skincare routine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
