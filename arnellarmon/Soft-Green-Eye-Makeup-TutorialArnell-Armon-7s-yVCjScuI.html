effects anti-aging primer this is the
first time I use this stuff and I
actually really love the texture of it
it didn't feel too how do I put this
silicon e it felt really smooth really
really smooth start to prime my skin I
get my cover fixed natural finish
foundation cost my custom cover drops so
I just mix those two together the cover
drops a little more coverage even though
I don't necessarily need it I like it so
I just added and then I use my bare
minerals precision face brush to blend
that in
next I'm gonna take my bear skin
concealer by bare minerals and I chose
this concealer because close to my skin
tone it's very lightweight so when I use
my contour kit by color FX it won't be
too heavy enemy of my eyes
after concealing then take my cover next
contour kit is the first time I'm using
this thing - but I will say that after I
used it I kind of became obsessed I use
it every single day now I'm just gonna
take that light shade I'm gonna want to
place it under my eyes on my nose on my
chin around my nose on my lips in my
forehead now I will say what this
contour kit the darkest shade what's
kind of my color I mean it was a little
darker than me and it gave me a really
really natural contour which I actually
love but if you're looking to get a
really intense contour this kit probably
won't happen especially if you're darker
than me yeah it's not going to happen so
after I place all of the contour creams
and the desired places I go back over
with my be the blender and I just play
that all out
laughter I find and blend it all out I
just want my Ben Nye banana powder I
just set the place that put the lighter
contour shades at now time for eyes I
use my benefit cosmetics Air Patrol
primer to prime my eyelids and then we
take and make a big shadow in the shade
chickadee and use it as a base and then
they take the shade Barcelona Beach also
I make a week and put it on top of
chickadee and then I'm gonna take just a
Barack Obama cookie you can put it more
on my crease area honestly when I do my
eye shadow I never know where I'm going
I kind of just go I'm gonna come for
cool stuff so yeah I just layer a lot of
things before I figure out what I'm
actually doing so then I'm gonna take a
martini awesome I make it big and this
 is Gator color Everest I was
really excited to use eyeshadow because
I obsessed with greens I just love doing
and that hit the shade cocoa bear just
add some Browns in there and I'm using a
lot of blending brushes I prefer those
or any kind of brushes only because
honestly I'm not an expert at eyes
shadow so blending brushes makes it
easier so then I take the shade jester
now I forgot to put mixing medium on my
lid before I applied this and I told her
to graduate because my eyes are hooded
and so the shimmery shadow is always end
up getting all over my crease if I do a
mixing medium so charts are hooded make
sure you put a mixing medium or some
type of you know gel base so that that
shadow doesn't go anywhere so then find
out my lash line I'm just getting this
shade Morocco and I'm gonna add cocoa
bear and also the shade martini
you know just to bring the eyes look all
together so that's pretty much it for
eyeshadow after I'm done with that I'm
into skiing a Real Techniques contour
brush it was like my favorite brush ever
by them and I'm just going to dust off
all that banana powder
from my face because I actually hate
letting powder sit on my face it makes
me feel so dry and very annoying and I
completely hate it just on my face i'm
using my eliminating setting powder by
cover of X and the shade medium now I
have this powder in the shade light and
I actually love medium so much marks on
sunlight made me look a little ghostly
so I loved that I got this shade and I
tried to like not use too much but
clearly I put a little too much in the
brush because it kept you know getting
everywhere as you can see I took all of
my contour i'm using Bahama Mama by the
balm I chose to use a more cool toned
bronzer because my blush is gonna be
very orange and warm so I didn't want to
use you know a warm shade to contour
because I didn't want it to be too warm
if that makes any sense at all so if I
forget to mention the brush I'm using
like I always do I decided to put the
brush names in this actual video if you
guys have been paying attention in the
bottom right screen I've been listening
everything I've been using to make it
easier for you guys to know because I
was gonna ask so I just put him in the
corner of the screen if you guys seen
that and so here I'm just putting on the
blush devil by Mac which is a very warm
and orange blush like I said so to
highlight I decide to use my Anastasia
Beverly Hills cloak it in that glow and
first I take the shade golden bronze
which is like the most natural highlight
in the kit and then I decide to go over
with dripping and gold you guys will see
that soon and then later on I decided to
go over that with the shade sunburst
because I wanted to look very very
highlighted but don't worry I'll list
all these names in the description box I
just wanna let you guys know ahead of
time
so after highlighting I go pop on my
lashes off-camera and I used the vaguest
name lashes for the first time nasty
kind of like them dirt a bit dramatic
but I like them and on lips I'm using
grunge by color pop
you'll see I don't like fill in my lips
completely because I'm going to take
this buxom gloss caught sugar and put on
top I love gloss my books and they're
the best glasses in my opinion all the
anasazi ones are but these are second
and then decide my makeup I'm using my
NYX Dewey's setting spray which is like
my favorite setting spray in the whole
entire world and that's pretty much it
so thanks for watching guys and I'm so
sorry that I haven't made my get to know
me video yet um if you follow me on snap
you know that's a it's too long but I
decided to make two parts so stay tuned
for part one because that's going to my
next video I promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
