you're new welcome if it's your first
time seeing me I'm are now allowed to
see this to be a bunch Channel I'm just
so awkward to come say my name I'm gonna
try to start because I understand that
there's new people that come to my
channel so you may not know but there's
something new you today's video I'm
really excited cause it came out really
nice um I don't pull out the spark the
backdrop I haven't used one of those in
over a year so you know this is a big
deal
I did a prom look I didn't pull on my
Instagram and I actually guys want to
see a prompt tutorial and everyone voted
yes and so I didn't for you guys I
really just came out I'll totally wear
this lip to prom in fact my senior prom
I think the look I have on right now is
very similar to the makeup I had for
senior prom obviously the eyes weren't
that smoked out like the dramatic week
okay well as I thought it's almost
identical I don't listen to my major
senior prom and Alyssa's the reason why
I actually got into makeup because I
should I make for senior prom that
smells like I kind of liked this like I
kind of like how this is going and then
she's my make for graduation and after
that I was pretty much sold and so a
great look for you guys obviously you
don't have to do the bold red lip I
think well rail looks really nice
however you want to do a lip that
matched your dress color the most I just
feel like if you can kind of play around
with a little bit everything you could
do would glue drys you to a black dress
a white dress
maybe another green dress you can pretty
much put a bow around with anything and
as far as I look goes I feel like it's
pretty universal it's obviously like a
very simple eye look but it's dramatic
enough to like look nice in photos and
so on yeah my time guys ears off I do my
hair as well this video ends like two
little Styles not super extravagant but
you know I just have to throw a little
bit in there but unless I watched the
video if you enjoyed it find it helpful
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
to subscribe and um that's not to say
he'll because for your prom I hope this
video comes in time if you do do this
makeup look be sure to post pictures on
Instagram attack me because I wish for
love to them and um yeah let's get to
the video alright so I did one eye in
both brows off-camera
by the way the brows to I use actors
drug stores like this NYX upon me is my
first time using it which is why I
didn't film that process I know Hausman
turned out and so first I'm going to
prime eyelid using my Studio Fix or
studio finish concealer by Mac and I'm
going to put a whole bunch concealer on
my lids
I noticed that like her summers the
shadows don't blend on my lid and I
don't know one list of always been a
little weird I used to get eczema on
them so I don't know what that's about
whatever I said using darker shadows it
starts to tripping out on me many ways
blend out the concealer now for taste
powder i'm using the morphe x Jaclyn
hill palette and i'm going to pretty
much put a little triangle over the
shades I'm using my palette so I haven't
the older version of this palette the
one that's like the paperback not the
plastic so it's so dirty I was like I'm
not gonna show this on camera so I'm
yeah I just look at where the little
triangle is and that's the shade I am
using so yeah I'm pretty much doing a
standard type eyeshadow look I'm
starting from the lighter shades and
just working way up and just getting
darker and darker as I go I'm using
multiple brushes and they'll be listed
down below this look than me
well I keep switching them but I'm
pretty much using like a big fluffy
morphe brush to really blend in buff
then a smaller fluffy brush they're kind
of like pack on the color then two
smaller angled brush from Sigma to
really pack in the color towards the
corner um so yeah I'm often in between
brushes and once I include the shadow
well for now I'm gonna ask the sealer to
my lid and I'm gonna put a lighter shade
on my lid I'm going to use the Make Up
For Ever star lip palette which I'm
gonna insert right now and I'm gonna use
these two shades one of the shades
the white sheet actually has like an
iridescent pink tone to it and the other
one is just a classic champagne type of
shimmer be sure to pick up that wallet
camera though because it looked a really
pretty person so now I'm gonna apply
some liner I'm gonna use this next line
that I actually just bought oh I was
stiffening that sniffing this uh huda
beauty paddocks I swear to you guys like
I'm gonna say the word well I'm
getting to Mon tights but this palette
smell it comes straight loud I'm not
joking it opened I was like wait what I
kept sniffing next I was like tripping
out like I promise you like and I'm
really so very now
it smells like like you know I don't
work the W word anyways I did that liner
and then I added this black shadow on
top and this is why I like my shadow I
started being weird and I don't know
what that was about
I was kind of annoyed I'm like coming
close to see you see ya see how the
shadows already picking up on my lid I
don't know it's like annoying this is
why I'm gonna do eyeshadow like this
because it's I always have some
different problems but you know I didn't
cut this part out because you know you
might mess up you might mess up while
doing your prom makeup you might get
some doing everyday makeup just you just
gotta keep going cuz you know I just add
a more shadow on top you know just kept
on blending and then my top of the
lashes on you can tell there's messed up
so if you ever read in your eyeshadow
and it's acting dumb like mine was today
just keep going it's cool just long as
you make it look good overall then it's
okay but it's like a little messed up
it's not the end of the world and you'll
probably still be compliments
so after I finished this annoyed I look
it looks good though I want to put my
lashes on off camera I'm using these
boar lashes pop those on so you can tell
that I messed up so I pry my skin I'm
using spit T Beauty Pro filter primary
this one my favorite primer it's sticky
the makeup whatever foundation I put on
top of it always lasts like all day I
love this primer and some foundation
mixing - I'm using the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation and I'm
going to use the NARS and natural
radiant foundation I love these two
foundations mixed together it's not like
a little yellow at first but once like
you're not blown everything out it sells
my skin is like the perfect shade I just
personally like these two natural
radiant obviously makes a little more
radiant and the all-day weightless lunes
has really good coverage and I feel like
it's very long-lasting especially like
for like a special event so I had to
make those two together so ticket seal
I'm using my favorite concealer
action-movie the Urban Decay all nighter
concealer I never know what I like so
much about this concealer when I first
bought it I was like oh it's cool you
know I bought it old to just try it out
and I thought was okay like I thought it
was good but I wasn't shook but look the
more I used the more appreciated I can't
explain it just a coverage how it blends
out it's just it's one of my favorites
like I have to buy more I love it so
much I found it ah I finally found a
concealer that could replace my
heart-shaped tape since you know I can't
use it anymore I guess although it's
like why can't you shave tape I still
use the Tarte Browns over anyways that's
obsessed point bled this is Taylor and
then we're gonna continue this tutorial
after I blew the concealer for the gods
I'm going to set it with my Laura
Mercier translucent powder translucent
as I said translucent powder and I'm
gonna do a thin layer first and I don't
actually don't think I even put more on
because I almost put shadow underneath
my eyes however I really like how this
eyeshadow made my eyes shape look and I
just didn't think it was necessary to
add a darker shade underneath so if
you're gonna add shine underneath your
eyes obviously you go putting it over a
powder on to prevent fallout but if
you're not then don't waste your powder
you know it's still a thin layer make
sure that conceal as I'm moving anywhere
and you're good to go
so summertime face I'm use this urban
decay powder foundation I got this at
Nordstrom Rack and actually really liked
it a lot
I used it whenever I want to look a
little more tan because it's slightly
darker more skin tone so after I said
I'm going to add a little more powder
I'm trying to my nose just snatch you a
little bit more I try to contour my nose
used to conceal my powder and look so I
can to avoid having to put the bronzer
right now some nice looks a little muddy
I'm gonna Vinci put some bronze on my
nose anyways I just if I could snatch me
without it that's awesome so now he uses
more if you had a contour palette that I
just got a male it's new so I had to use
it and I'm just going to bronze in the
contour with that I'm really snatching
my cheekbones because if you call it a
prom or a special occasion you want to
look really smashed in photos
you know you want to take off like 5
pounds you want to agree so go ham with
the bronzer it's totally cool like you
know don't be scared now I'm gonna use
my benefit hoola bronzer and this is
time contour a little more in detail cuz
it's like a cooler shade so really like
you know chisels me out and Wilcock to
my nose a little bit not too much though
because you don't look crazy but you do
watch your nose to look a little more
defined so we're gonna have to contour
that I'm at a lighter shade on the tip
and bridge of my nose to further that
definition and it's just so simple I
really see huge difference but I it was
cool you know it did the job for me
so watch I'm using Mac peach twist blush
and I would handle the blush too you
know because when you have prom or a
special occasion I noticed that it kind
of it's okay to go a little little
heavier on the makeup because there's a
lot of flash photos it's much flash like
wash you out so go ham you know at that
color go ham so I just bought this
freakin highlighter and it broke I don't
know how I was really upset
those last time I had an office so I
wasn't gonna go exchange it I just put
it back the police and I did what I did
so this is Laura Geller Gilda honey one
of the best house ever it's like my
third time buying it it's just I flick
after a while kind of like fakes out
it's not as pigmented so you have to buy
a new one it kind of sucks but I'm gonna
still do it so I'm kind of going hand
with a highlight I won't look to him so
I can tone it down a little bit with my
foundation brush and then we're good to
go
so Tim s-scared I read this part TARDIS
mascara
I know it's hard yeah you know I'm gonna
cancel them
like I'm not gonna use a foundation cuz
I'll see that shade range was a mess
however I don't believe you're writing
off and tire prints because of one thing
you know like granting what they do is
stupid
this is a bomb a scare and I'm gonna
keep it real so I'm use it you'd have to
buy it though like I'm totally not
saying like oh my god go buy it I
personally like it though
so anyways now I'm gonna add some
highlight from the same starlet palette
I used earlier to my inner flappy folds
and then I regret putting a highlight
under my brows because I feel like a
little messy and it blew out well enough
so let me do the stat make sure you
blend it out because I in the
beginning this video if you deal with
the best and so now for you I'm gonna
use matte chestnut liner you guys know
the drill
I used to like every single video but
it's cool it's a favorite lip liner and
I'm loyal so I'm gonna use it and I'm
gonna blend that out a little bit before
I put my lipstick on because I want some
blended the sofa lipstick if I could
hurry been bleeding these lips out I'm
nice dose of colors myrrh Merlot I'm
assuming that's how you say it this
color is so beautiful so I chose dose of
colors and the main lips I have because
dose of colors let's keep it real they
have the best liquid lipstick formula
change my mind you know anyways and the
best liquid lipstick formula it lasts
forever it's so comfortable it doesn't
transfer it's just the best I like for
like prawn or special occasions their
lipsticks are the best for that and they
have a really great shade range you can
literally get any color dark brown berry
nude doe sikozu has it all and this is
totally not sponsored I wish a sponsor
me but I must still buy their stuff
anyways I almost like to have it
I'll shoot her with the lipsticks so
yeah I'm gonna put my lip bow it looks
so pretty this let my fav'rite I look
like this need to look it so to set this
beautiful face I'm using Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray because I
obviously want this to last all night
and wants a little tacky I'm gonna add a
little more highlight because I mean
this is a special event so you want a
very what a very poppy highlight not too
crazy though not to figure out my hair
situation first my spray with the skin
or blow-dry spray with some of my
favorite thing to use for my hair I just
love it it smells good makes my hair
extra soft it's like I don't my favorite
and I'm gonna use got to be ultra glue
styling gel to leave my edges tonight
because this is gonna make my edges last
all night long not to say my edge
control won't but you know if I'm sweaty
and stuff I feel like got to be a glue
works at this so we're gonna use that so
yeah I don't know what to do my hair I
want to updo and it's a trip because
earlier the updo I put it in looked
really cute when I filmed this video the
first time I ended messing up but this
time around it like wasn't working for
me by the way like this shirt kept
writing up but it's totally supposed to
show my shoulders so I'm pull it down
for a reason so first I clicked it back
like okay that's cool I guess I'm gonna
redo the clip focus I wanted to and then
add these cute little bobby pins and I
bought from Ulta because they're super
festive and it comes afford so I write
two on each side because I thought that
that looks really nice sorry I did burn
a little bit anyways um I've got this
little Katie but I was like eh it's okay
sucked up the clip out and I actually
like this look this gave me total like
three survives for sure um all I needed
was on my leather jacket
oh I just get excited but anyways I want
to do something else so then I play a
little bun and I thought this was very
like wedding sheep you know what I mean
like the bun obviously you don't have to
do a bun but I actually like buns and I
like how my hair looks tied back so I
thought this was an option as well I
thought it looked really cute you know
we do one more though because I don't
settle
no I'm joking I was just bored and my
hair felt nice so I like playing in it
but I'm gonna doing more and just the
next I'm gonna do it was totally like it
gave me total like nineties about Apes
you guys are gonna see like one second I
pull out two little strands and I'm
giving you like Bianca Lawson see the
last dance vibes low key and so I'm I'm
gonna curl those little strands though
so maybe now do what I wanna do
and this style is kind of cute too I
feel like I've been cute if I put more
thought into it but I didn't it I didn't
want to so I put those pieces back and I
did a little cute bun so um this is
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
hope I gave inspiration makeup wise and
maybe even hair wise if you enjoyed this
