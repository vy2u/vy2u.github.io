new welcome Jason is going to be this
full face season on drug store products
the only thing that's time drugstores my
gloves and that's because I don't have a
drugstore cloths I'm just super loving
at the moment and so I just use what my
dose of colors I had to spot and I was
kind of anxious to use it but everything
else is all a drugstore it can be found
in Ulta the drugstore section it's
obviously more affordable so the main
focus of this look will be my lashes
this video was kind of sponsored by kiss
lashes they send me a whole set of a new
blog latch and I chose to stop Pompadour
for this look pompadours a greater
whiskey lash and they kind of flare out
twisting in giving like a really nice
kind of like cat eye effect and I felt
like they come into my eye shape that
moves because my eye she was pretty
small so it's very hard when it comes to
picking our lashes because sometimes
they're not dramatic enough songs are
too dramatic to where they make my eyes
completely disappear so this left eye
was perfect for this look so if you want
to see how I pack this look continue
watch this video and if you enjoy it at
the end give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe and all the products I use we
list down below and I'll see you guys
later alright so the primary skin i'm
going to take my nyx honey do me up i
find it's hard for awhile actually
really like it a lot i like the fact
that it's very easy to blend it in it's
super like kind of like sticky but i
want to dries down it gets even more
sticky and i feel like that helps any
foundation on top of it stick really
well to the skin and so i'm just gonna
apply it on my skin and just rub it out
as if i'm rubbing on a moisturizer
for foundation I'm taking this l'oreal
infallible this is like the pro glow one
just the first time I was trying
Fondation when I was filming this video
and it wasn't necessary my favorite I
liked it however I'm more like a full
coverage type of person and so I did
notice that to do like more than one
layer in order to get the coverage that
I wanted this is super duper sheer this
foundation is good for someone who has
drier skin or someone who doesn't want
super thick foundation who kind of like
already has clear skin they just want
like even on their complexion this is
perfect for you but I like that big
stuff that like it's kind of cakey I
don't know why I just I like it anyways
gonna use it anyways and I'm using this
one Sigma sponge to blend it out then to
conceal on take this makeup revolution
concealer this is awesome my first time
using this concealer I actually like it
a lot
I should have got a different shade
however in Ulta they didn't have many
shades choose from so I just chosen what
I thought will look the best and I mean
this one's kind of the job and I just
applied the concealer underneath my eyes
on my forehead a little bit on my nose
and on my chin
another cream contour take another
makeup revolution concealer this is just
one that's obviously a darker shade and
I just placed it above my cheekbones and
I just blend that out with the same
sponge I used to point on my concealer
so to set the place I concealed I'm
taking this makeup revolution powder
this wasn't necessarily my favorite but
I think it's cuz I put too much on cuz I
start off with one layer by knew I was
doing eyeshadow so I put another layer
on top and I put a lot and so definitely
you don't need too much of this stuff I
will say that but I mean I can't really
go back and take it back so I did one
half camera and this is what I came up
with I actually read like this I looked
a lot so I'm going to show you guys how
I got it so first i concealed using or
priming my lid you can same concealer I
used earlier and I just blend that out
with a brush and my finger and then for
shadow imma take this makeup revolution
palette and I'm gonna take sorrows kind
of trip to see myself in the reflection
I'm I take this shade right here as a
base it's just like a light cream color
I'm gonna place that all over my lid and
then after that I'm going to take these
two shades right here just like peachy
shade in this pink shade and I'm just
gonna start building up the color
towards my outer crease and working
inwards so after I blend that out I'm
gonna take these two shades right here
and it's like reddish shade in this
orange shade and I'm just like start off
with a like lighter color and then
slowly working my way to the darker
colors and I'm just you know blending
and blending and adding more color to it
it's as dark as I need to be so now I'm
taking these three shades I just shown
and like I said just grabbing dark
colors and just trying to make this look
smoky and just oh this palette it was
okay obviously idea I like with it but I
did one I wish was more pigmented but
then again it was very cheap it's a
drugstore so you can't expect too much
now I'm taking these two shimmer shades
my finger because I like shimmers apply
better when you use your fingers and
then I'm gonna take this dark green
shade right here
I'm gonna put on my outer crease because
I wanted it to be darker than it was so
I'm gonna apply with my finger first and
then blends out with the brush so after
doing my eyes I'm going to apply some
mascara first before I put on my lashes
on I'm gonna play a very thin coat and
then I take my kiss blowout lashes in
the style pompadour and you're just
slowly pull the last down like this so
you don't damage the band these lashes
are super duper flattering on my eye
shape I'm gonna trim a little bit off
though so they just fit my eyes a little
bit more and after I trim those I'm
gonna take this kiss strip lash adhesive
which actually found super easy to use
because it comes like a brush applicator
so it's super easy to apply to the lash
band and you're gonna apply a very thin
coat this glue does dry clear when you
first put it on it's kind of iridescent
and a little bit white with like a blue
tones really pretty but um when it dries
it's super clear and so I'm going to
blow on that just a little bit and while
I'm doing that I'm going to like bend
the lash these lashes are super flexible
and so I'm just like rolling them in my
hand so they fit my eye easier and to
apply them I'm gonna start at the end of
my eyelash and kind of like work my way
inwards as I'm doing right here applying
lash is pretty difficult however I
thought because it's lash band is super
like flexible and pretty thin it's
actually very easy to work with even if
you accidentally like apply to the wrong
place it's super easy to just fix as
long as you have some tweezers I
definitely recommend those it definitely
helps me apply my lashes so I could not
apply lashes with my bare hands
another thing I'll say about these
lashes are them because they're so thin
and lightweight and like Fairlight
they're SuperDuper comfortable if you
fall in my channel for a while I've
talked about lashes a lot and one thing
I always say is that lashes they're
typically uncomfortable my eyes cuz they
feel too heavy that's why in most my
makeup looks I won't wear lashes but I
will say that these were super
comfortable and didn't annoy my eyes at
all like once I got them on my eye
because I'm not an expert
they were SuperDuper comfortable like I
wasn't rushing to rip them off like I
simply deal with all my lashes so after
I'm done finesse these last with
tweezers it doesn't take this long by
the way I just like to make sure they're
perfect because one of my pet peeves is
seeing lashes fall off I'm going to use
my fingers to press his lashes into my
actual lashes even more to make them
look even more natural you guys see how
the other eyelash looks so perfect and
flawless almost looks like mine that's
why I'm doing this one and so once we're
done with that I'm pretty much oh one
eye done without a look I have to add
eyeshadow to the bottom part of my eyes
and so I'm gonna take these two shadows
and just you know brush a little bit
underneath and that completes I look now
I'm going to go into the rest of my face
so first things first I'm gonna dust off
this powder I let this powder sit on my
eyes for way too long so it's almost
kind of hard and getting rid of it
that's a really really really like
really dust that powder I'd use two
different brushes cuz it was kind of
driving me nuts so before I move on to
setting my face I'm going to do my brow
really quick which actually was super
either do I just took this pencil by BH
Cosmetics and then I took another pencil
by kiss which actually really loved
their brow pencils a lot I got an abuse
by store by my house and I just you know
fill my brows we quick clean it up a
little concealer and I was done this
brow actually took like less than five
minutes to do which is a shocker but
they came out really nice
so to send my face I'm really gonna
focus on the bottom half of my face I
don't know if you peeped earlier but I
did put the brush over my face and
that's because I had so much power into
my eyes I kind of kind of distributed it
amongst my entire face so I need to set
my face too much so that part was pretty
fast so her blush famous song in BH
Cosmetics it was actually way too light
it was way too it was too penguin I
didn't think it was show up this much on
my skin so I put a little bit on and I
it was on to the next so to send my face
I'm using this morphe setting spray
setting mist and I'm gonna let that dry
and then I'm gonna pond some highlight
which is by and make a revolution as
highlighter it's super duper nice I was
should you get to see in one second it's
very powdery though but it was
SuperDuper pigmented and I applied that
using this fan brush I bought IOLTA as
well so I blend out that highlight now
I'm applying a little bit to my flappy
folds what I always do and then after
that I'm going to apply some mascara to
my bottom lashes
I like this mascara lock my bottom
lashes because like the the little wand
the applicator is really really good for
bottom lashes so I definitely recommend
it for that and then I'm going to do my
lips I'm gonna start off by lining my
lips with his brown lip liner by NYX
then I'm gonna ply this gloss by
different colors it wasn't my favorite
though it was way too pale I ain't no is
gonna be so pale I tried to make it work
I had donut lips I was not a fan
I probably too much on and so I decided
to put some dose of colors cork on top I
love cork however because I put gloss on
cork just was not working it didn't
really do much
I mean it helped a little bit but it
wasn't I wasn't expecting that so I put
this buxom Leslie gloss on top and that
kind of gave me more of the color I was
going for I want to go for a very nude
muted look and after take that back
complete her look and so I'm changing my
shirt really quick and this into the
