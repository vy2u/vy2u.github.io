my friend brie who's willing to hair
care told me to deeply dish my hair
before strain it cuz I'll minimize the
damage so that's what I did
don't mind that those towel lint in my
hair anyways now I'm gonna take my
Tresemme heat protectant I got this from
Walmart I've been using this for as long
as I can remember I'm not sure if it's
like the best one however I like how it
works so I just constantly buy it
because it's like I'm used to it down
top-down for my blow-dry spray from
Kendra and this is $22 at Ulta but they
have it on mine on Walmart for like
eighteen dollars I managed on
discovering that but if you wanna say
four dollars just got four more you have
to order online and like wait for it to
ship to you but still cool anyways now
I'm gonna blow dry my hair using my
Amica blow-dryer I don't have a blow dry
with a comb so I just take my blow dryer
and I'd like to write the heat on the
part I'm trying to dry and I just get a
brush my brush it this is a professional
do it from what I've noticed so I mean
it's cool by the way the front part of
my hair is lighter than the back as you
can see it's all blonde I always looked
bald and the front part of my head but
it's not that it's not that I'm bald
this is it's blonde and because I am a
light skinned it's like the blonde kind
of like fades into my skin and makes
look bald when really my hair just gets
really blonde in the front I don't know
why it just it's always been that way so
I'm just gonna blow dry my hair so I can
flat iron it I'm sorry that the Lynde is
going in and out of focus it's uh I was
moving a lot and I have like I autofocus
Lin so that's just what it does but I
mean this part is about to be done
anyways and then I realized at this
moment that I forgot to take my sugar
bear gummies which is why my hair is so
long right now so I take my two little
gummies i hate when i forget these are
really addicting you guys and I always
recommend them this is not sponsored
I literally just love them so much so I
mean deathly check them out I'll talk
more about them in the video I mean if
you guys want some longer hair you'll
buy them if you don't you doing the
but I'm just brushing my hair right now
and I'm gonna part it into section to
kind of like prep it to straighten it
when I straighten my hair because it's
shorter it's a little harder to flatter
in it um it goes a little wild
if that
makes sense so I have to section them
it's like I usually like three parts I
section like one half off and I just
like leave that side alone then I have a
section in the front part and then I
just like to work on the back part first
and so um we're gonna start yeah I'm
just gonna stop talking because I don't
want this to be like a super long video
and it's gonna be all sped up but I'm
pretty much gonna flatten my hair you
know not that special
I just know that if I didn't record it
people would be mad and when I posted my
hair on Instagram because this video was
recorded a while ago I got a lot of like
people messaged me asking that I record
this process and yes I did so here it is
just gonna speed this part up and I'll
check back game with you guys at the end
of this video
you
all right so I'm gonna straighten my
hair um you know what I like this style
you know maybe a little button at least
I'm able to put it in a ponytail I think
that's so great easy to me that's
literally that's you guys that's
literally nuts I don't talk about it
like I wanna make something I just I was
never able to grow hair because
my hair the long someone say I let my
hair grow the longest I let my hair grow
it reached back here somewhere
it was like kind of like the top of my
bag it was never held along by an
athletic girl before
but I've always just always cut it and
dine it
I just straighten it I just like never
was able to leave it alone because I
don't know I just I like touching my
hair a lot and so the fact that let's
see hold on fix my bangs wow this is so
freaking key
you know what I almost want to add a
piece to my hair but you know what this
is all me fill me like I kind of want to
add like a piece and cut button bigger
but at the same time it's like my hair
is short you know no part Milo's been
such a good boy but now I was saying the
last time my hair being healthy it was
when I first got with not damn it was
when I was dating one of my exes and I
remember I was wearing extensions this
one 18 I was wearing extensions like
okay I want you see my real hair and so
I showed my real hair nose so curly and
bouncy and then shortly after that I
just I was doing glue ends I would just
I was really messing up my hair back
then whatever I was really messing up my
hair back then and I remember I had an
episode where I cut it all off I always
have was episode so my pattern is I'll
be letting her out and then it'll be
kind of getting somewhere well I'm gonna
cut out let me lift my chair a little ah
um anyways it would be growing out and
then I'll be like okay I like it then
now we're on a diet and started doing
random to it and then it was a ill
- damage now then I'll just cut it off
and I'll start over and so this last my
comment hair um I want to say I cut it
all off cuz I it was like it was a cool
length or whatever but when I want to
wear it curly out into a picture I
actually was looking at
tonight not had extremely air and I was
like that looks so bad it I was I was so
tired of pulling onto lint I was like
you know it's hair it grows whatever and
so I just chopped it all off and I it's
funny I filmed that video by these
narrow posted because it was just was a
plan by kind of went ham I chopped it
and then I am going to my hairstylist if
you're in the area I recommend Jessica
kill me I'll link her instrument down
below
she likes specialized and she does hair
like for the people who have dance for
warriors so she's legit as luck but um I
went to her and got my hair to pre cut
my hair she yes coming here recently so
you know it was a little longer but I
had her cut it you know cuz I didn't
want any dead ends I was like you know
I'm tired of her on to lived whatever
and so oh sorry sorry
looking for my hoops I didn't get
dressed okay okay anyways um so annoying
so I pretty much just hold onto the lint
whatever and then when I started really
getting to wit it realized okay like I
like wigs you know like I thought to
make them look natural enough I was like
you know what like I'm not gonna touch
my hair and then I forgot which month I
trying to work with sugar bear I think
I'm I'm on my sixth month with them it's
been like six months I'm yeah I've been
during these six or seven bottles so I'm
a taking it for six months now that's
crazy that times look go and buy that
fast um but we're also taking sugar bear
like you know like I just don't want to
mess my hair anymore I'm not gonna die
and like my natural hair color is weird
cuz I have like some blonde in the front
and I just I let it be honestly it'd be
better if my hair was darker because I
like to put in two pieces I make my hair
look long know what it is but I mean I
just much rather just let my hair to
grow out and just have its natural hair
coloring just you know do what I do look
you're struggling but you're there but
yeah I haven't treated my hair in almost
a year
I couldn't wait until next month but you
ever know you have in those moods where
you're like I want to do this and then
like me be me I just do it and so I'm
gonna phone my friend Briggs and I'm not
sharing my hair and I was like okay imma
straighten my hair and she goes way to
the next month and I'm just like no and
I'm happy I did it cuz it looks really
Keith but honestly after this I probably
won't straighten my hair
for another six months to a year I'm
very curious to see if my hair would
still be all curly like it was my hair
is very like thin so it's think it
stands very easily but after this I
don't plaster in my hair but at least
another six months to a year because I
mean honestly the year before by so fast
I didn't realize it was a year until I
looked at the pitch about damn it's
another year so but heat on my hair and
you guys see how much it's grown if you
can found on my channel you guys know
I'll insert another picture and I'll put
the month I forget the month but it's
crazy that my hair is literally just
like that's short and now it's like this
I feel like putting a little button so
I'm that's on yours ears off because
there this video I just want to like do
like a live check and just I know you
probably mad like you know straighten my
hair without filming it you know cousin
going you guys are part of this journey
with me but I will totally recommend
getting sugar their hair or at least a
gummy Irvine if you want to grow your
hair out get one that tastes good
because if it doesn't is good it's not
gonna be fun to take and you'll forget
it I grew up taking like different hair
vitamins and I would never be consistent
with them because they're either in the
pill form and I don't like pill form I
don't like pills at all they all stuck
in my throat and or the gummies just
they weren't good sugar bear tastes like
candy so that's why I really recommend
them because it's like it's just so easy
to take you to realize that you're
taking vitamins and then it's like your
hair grows out of nowhere you're just
like okay so I'll try recommend it
honestly it's up to you I think that
well now that I have taken sugar there
and you know I've seen the results if
for whatever reason they no longer work
with me out of hell in cash out on them
I would literally just buy like a
six-month supply I would not mind
spending that money not I know that it
works because I think in a day it's like
it's your hair if you want to be long
you gotta like spend the money and do
what you have to do to get to grow and I
like sugar bear and I'm gonna start
doing one deep conditioning mask I think
if I did more of those my hair work or
even faster a lot of times I kind of let
just leave it alone but I do think I
need to do more like deep conditioning
mask and treatment so when I come up
with something like our work that works
and like you know makes my hair feel
nice
I'll definitely recording fill it for
you guys but until then I'm gonna go a
little bit over some hoops tonight
I'm done
do you guys like my little bun say yes I
want me to hear you but just say he has
a comment yes I mean it's very small but
she's she's doing something okay all
right it's okay it's I'm probably
changing when I walked over this video
but she has gone now for us through this
video give a thumbs up and subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
