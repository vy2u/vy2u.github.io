video I just posted before this what's
up so I'm just going to you why'd I just
say what's up I never use it word but
I'm just going to part my hair in the
middle and put some Jo in now although
like I'm going to post on cap on so this
part won't necessarily matter I just
want her whenever I'm doing the middle
part I mean I just part a middle part of
my real hair just in case the stocking
cap moves back and you can see my hair
from underneath the lace I just want to
make sure that you're seeing scalp so
pretty simple I'm really not good at
straight part and I'm learning this this
is not in the center of my head at all
like it was in shambles I was like you
know what like oh I guess I did try to
fix it but it didn't really do much so I
had to put this down cap on and I mean I
just went on about my day
it's time put on the wig you guys just
seen me make that a cool thing about
wigs or lace closures is that you don't
have disown elastic band because you're
not cutting off like pretty much none
the dome cap the dome cap still gives
the wig some sense of security so you
know save some time on that but yeah
about this hair quickly review it's
amazing like I absolutely love it it's
literally a breeze I'm not I'm not
experiencing any shedding and tangling
it's it's I mean is straight hair so
it's bound to be more easier than you
know other hair I just I absolutely love
it and I want to die to jet-black like a
super duper jet black so it's even more
sleek but I mean I'll do it when I'm not
lazy which is probably like next week or
so I'll show you guys when I do it trust
me you guys will now here I am I'm just
trying to like you know do something my
baby hairs I actually got edge control
in the actual hair not just on that part
but like another part too which is very
annoying but all you have to do just get
some water and just wipe with the towel
and then you're all good and I mean I
don't even keep my baby hairs like this
I feel like they looked a little too
like artificial but I'm just playing
around with this you know when I do my
wigs I kind of just I just play around
with them until I feel like they look
decent now I don't want any bad comments
because I want to I wore a wig like this
similar to and wait I wore similar wig
like this when I did the video with
Alyssa and a lot of you were flaming me
because I guess I don't do my wigs how a
lot of prefer them and that's where they
make their foreheads disappear that's
just not my thing
like people were really reading me for
filth even on lipstick alley that that
Devil site oh yeah
her wig was just driving me crazy just
look you know what it's not nice you
know cuz I I feel like it looks nice and
if I'm willing to go outside with it
clearly it's nice to me I just don't
understand people feel the need to make
that negative comment sometimes because
I mean you can literally be perfectly
fine without making that comment like
literally but people choose to and I
just don't like it I really don't get I
wish people would think twice before I
leave comments like that because it's
like I spent so much time on my hair and
even if I am getting paid paid or not
I'm still gonna put in the same amount
of effort and so it's like I spend this
time that edit the videos and I make
them look all nice just to say oh my god
no your hair looks like and it's
just like ouch that hurt me but yeah so
of my motions I'm just firing the hair
trying to make it look more flat and
more sleek
you
so now I'm gonna take this chi keratin
leave a conditioner one because I like
how it feels and two because it smells
really good and it'll help the hair lay
flatter cuz it's looking kind of poofy
and that's another oh god hiccup or burp
or both but that's another like negative
about lace closures is that with lace
frontals it lays flat all the way in
front of your hair but lace front tool
because it's only one little section the
pieces around it look a little fat
sometimes I don't like so I'm going to
spray this on my hair I'm still messing
with those baby hairs to try them out I
really hate baby hairs I'm take this
scarf and I feel back this my mom's
scarf and I cut it to make a head scarf
so not to buy our new one but it's okay
cuz at Walmart I'm just gonna wrap my
hair and then I'm gonna go do my makeup
and get Purdy and then I'll be back for
the unviewable that's the word right and
view
Oh oh my god we're back already and so
did my makeup I'm a whole new person
yeah and took the scarf off and I'm I'm
feeling pretty good about this the part
no it's not straight okay but it looks
pretty decent enough to me and so I just
rolled with it
well--that's lied in a role that I try
to make it straight but I was like you
know what footage it it's not gonna
happen if you guys notice my energy is
totally different budding and happy
because I'm like the Cable Guy has
finally gone so I could finally hear
myself talk and it's finally quiet yes
so I'm going to take this like little
funding that foundation palette and you
want to see much of a difference but in
person the part look a little too pale
in my opinion and so I just want to like
also make a little bit so I match my
skin tone a little better
you
see I'm gonna keep playing around my
hair until I realized hey looks fine I
was just having so much fun because a
hair is just so nice and if you're
really peeping my facial expression so
here I am try fix my partying I gave up
but yeah I do people my face expressions
I'm like totally feeling myself at this
point I'm like wow this is amazing
like the hair is so nice ooh when I'm
jet-black it's maybe so flame I have
nothing bad to say about his hair like
at all I can't think of anything I
couldn't think of something I tried to
you the only time I had I mentioned this
in previous videos that when I was doing
the wig on the last bundle I did notice
that some of the tracks went up only a
little piece of the track it started to
mess up a little bit but I mean all
throw up his hair is like literally a
tin like I really love this hair now
totally recommend it like it's really
great straight hair and yeah so this
premise the finished look I honestly
don't even know what I'm doing or why
it's taking me so long to even like get
done with this video
so once again to do you kind of notice
like a little flap in the front our lace
closure was like not completely flat on
my head I just took a little lash glue
and I use that to make it lay flat on my
head and that is pretty much it you try
to get lash glue you don't care about
you don't want to use actual lash glue
that you use on your eyes on your hair
oh it was a flaw bothering me that guy
but usually I put the glue on and then
you just lay a comb flat on it and that
makes it lay flat you guys see I
disturbed by him by this fly I'm like go
away dude what are you doing here like
when I was like tiny small flies he was
totally messing up my vibe you see how
I'm like back to slaying again I like
flip this fly oh wait the camera still
on so yeah this is a finished look I can
finally say that and you know just I'm
about to be in my slo-mo action so give
that about 5 seconds and we're about to
be doing slo-moes and if you guys
enjoyed this video please create thumbs
up like I always say I preferably like
my when my videos get leads like a
thousand thumbs up because that sounds I
mean that not sounds it looks pretty
legit so if we could do that I'll be
awesome and um yeah we're almost 100k
you guys I'm not to get drunk off my ass
I didn't say that I don't drink or doing
that bad stuff um but I'll see you guys
on the next video which would be
tomorrow and have a really cool comic
plan so stay tuned for that and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
