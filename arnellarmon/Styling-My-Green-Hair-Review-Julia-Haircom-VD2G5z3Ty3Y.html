you are new welcome so I just got done
just filming a quick video on how I
style this hair I want to be able to
review on edge and just my thoughts kind
of know you guys are gonna ask about it
and yes I did film a video of how I dyed
it I'm not sure which will be a first
step I want to put this one up but then
I work with everyone at first it depends
on how fast I can edit them but this
hair from Ali Julia hair they sent to me
four bundles and a frontal and I use
three and a half those bundle I glue the
tracks very closely is my cat anyways I
glue the tracks very closely to one
another so that way the hair would be as
full as possible and I usually like glue
my tracks onto my wig I kind of like say
some little part you know but I glued
them like super close each other just
clan want it to be let's just fool all
the way through and I really kind of
came out I can't already have idea what
I think about the hair only cuz I went
through a lot of processing during round
dyeing it so I could tell you guys how
the hair will take bleach in color clear
the hair takes color really well I have
a blue knot which I have to color this
twice so it's a get-well but it depends
what color you use not all colors work
in this hair I guess that's the way I
bleached it but I will say the bleach
did make the hair a little stringy and I
pull from my brush from a shame I got
during the process and on this in our
lot um this is not a lot all compared to
how much how much hair you to come out
when you bleach it come out how much
hair comes out when you reach it but I
will say that when I was blow-drying
this way to style it I was kind of
losing confidence and I was living a
truly mad cuz I did not say all this
money and time dedicate his color for
the winter trip out on me but when I was
looking a hair at the ends specifically
they were it took them a little longer
to dry and you know when you bleach hair
so much that they're like rubber band II
like it gets so thin and damaged that
it's a rubber texture back of the hair
was I don't know how the head the hair
is normal now the ends are a little
drier then you know up here and that's
because the ends were processed more
than this part and you don't see them
like
here and so I will say that you want to
like keep this hair as long as possible
still bleach is like I bleached them my
only wish is I want to create a braid
sex honestly if the hair was just all
this color throughout it would be
perfectly fine but I would've left
anyways so yeah I did damn to ends more
than I would have liked to damage them
and in order to keep this with healthy
if I have to I'll practice in socks I
really like this color and I really like
how the front two looks I believe smell
from the front to the front is a very
strong front I'm starting to like really
learn more about here you guys know the
more I deal with hair the more I
understand it and not all centrioles are
weak when it comes to bleaching um some
are but some aren't and this one is it
because I left the bleach on this
frontal at least like 30 minutes was a
long time in my opinion and I bleach it
twice yeah I bleached it left off for
maybe 20 minutes while dyeing the hair
and I bleached it again because I want
the noxee be even lighter and then I
would go downstairs make some cereal
I've watched long hair pop I completely
forgot about it and so I production back
upstairs well like my frontal
German and so far like it's perfectly
fine like no shedding on that date and
usually when the frontal course of a
sauna you know you're bleaching it too
much it's going to outta macula
you'll immediately pick up on the fact
that your frontal shading more than it
should so I haven't received not
received I haven't like noticed ur had
any shedding from the frontal which I'm
really happy about my 5 mm of my
downfall but other massive hair has
really nice like flow to it you know
straight ahead a lot of body but I want
to curly you know because every hair
color is bolt like this it looks good
curls like no matter what color is it
looks good throw and so I'm yeah the
hair it's I could tell I could tell that
up here I'll having a problem I'm going
to have to carry brushing me to make
sure the intro the tangles I could tell
by the drugs' the ends that I will have
to brushes hair you know not all the
time but throughout the day to make sure
it doesn't get tangled I think I might
be tell that you know even I run my
hands through it it's perfectly flying
to others to ends and I feel like a
little friction but that's my fault
I wouldn't put on the hair company we
haven't met um I love this hair I love
this color I am so happy I'm getting
better at dyeing hair I'm so happy I'm
kind of getting back and drew
convenience for you guys but a lot of
here diets I'll have a lot more colors
to go and then I have all my colors
together I'm going to a really cool
color for wigglers blue so if you don't
think I got the style which is also
super simple but maybe you just want to
watch can you enjoy watching me anyways
keep on watching and give a thumbs up
and please subscribe and I'll see you my
next video which would probably be me
diamonds hair and maybe another one to
pin down when I post it
have you guys ever tried to do a
voiceover with hiccups if your youtuber
come down below yeah it's terrible but
anyways now I'm going to brush my hair
first my hair this hair it is not belong
to me just on my head I'm going to brush
it out you know just that's what you do
before you start here right and then I'm
going to start section it into pieces
that way it's easier when I style it and
yeah we're just going to get this ball
rolling this going to be a very short
video I wouldn't call it a tutorial I
just find the very satisfying watching
videos where you're curling or doing
something to like bold colored hair so I
like to do those kind of videos because
I mean I like watching them I hope you
guys like watching it too is just I
don't know something about is very
satisfying I don't know because not
every day you see someone green hair you
know I'm saying
so I first would use these clips later
on they were cancelled because I
realized how hard it is to freaking clip
every single curl you use like it's so
freakin hard maybe I got the wrong clips
I don't know I tried to clip this one
and it it just it didn't look like how
it looks from the Instagram tutorials
okay so I got kind of got discouraged
and I do like one after that like you
know what no it's not going to work but
um yeah so I'm just taking a flat iron
and I'm just like rolling it down the
hair can't really explain this motion
you kind of have to like follow what I'm
doing I don't know what you'd call it
but I'm going to curl all the pieces in
the same direction that way when I brush
out earlier all the waves are flowing
together you know kind of like I can't
explain it it's supposed to make you
seasick but I just want all the ways to
be flowing together so I'm doing it all
the same direction and so I'm going to
show myself do the whole thing a maximun
to cut out and it come back with most of
it already done because
literally repetitive I'm doing the same
thing and honestly the main part I care
about is the front that just brings
everything together and that's the part
you can look at the most because I'm
facing front words so I'm just going to
curl the rest of the hair and then we're
going to get into styling it alright so
and I'm going to spray it just a little
bit this sprays Litella crazy I'm gonna
spray just a little bit of my gossip
ease freeze spray and I'm going to get
my serum just to kind of like run
through that way when I brush it it's
not getting frizzy and then I just brush
through it and you guys see how the
waves are kind of all go in the same
direction that's exact what I was going
for I really love this look you guys
like this is the one that goes who looks
for since high school it's just so easy
to do especially we can get the hang of
the motion of which you know oh wait
pause I got this expensive that that
control it it control urge control it's
late you guys forgive me
this is Hicks edge control I first heard
a bit by Lakia star and this back when I
was making you money how like $60 for
edge control are you nuts
even now I like 16 - are you nuts but I
bought it and it works pretty good like
and you get a pretty big thing it is
still crazy to save 16 dollars
residential and depend on where you go
this should run you at $20 so I mean I
bought it though
anyways I don't know what I was talking
about this point I like my hair that's
all that matters
and then yeah pretty simple to do oh yes
I'm saying when you get the hang of
flattering your hair this way it's like
you could do it in like 10 minutes
depending how long the hair is and it
looks like you put a lot of effort into
your hair when really you really did it
um this does not take a lot of effort at
all and so this is in tutorial I'm going
to a makeup look to go with the tear
color because I kind of have to you and
if you have any like eyeshadow
recommendations that should go with this
I'm thinking purple let me know but this
in the video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and if you did be sure to give a thumbs
up if you didn't let me know what you do
definitely next time and I will see you
guys in next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
