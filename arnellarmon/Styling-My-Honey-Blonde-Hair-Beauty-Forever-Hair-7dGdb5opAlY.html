getting their hardware dealer today but
it has been a long day and I'm just not
trying to slap doing this this is so
cute right look just style so me and
this color so me like it so cute oh okay
close down so I just post a video on how
I got my hair to color but now I was
like hmm I want to like really test the
hair to see like how is there after I
bleached the heck out of it like twice
and I honestly but I love it here so
much but I ever really move over it like
I would I would buy it and you know you
guys know I get to Tanzania free but I
would buy it
it's from beauty forever you watch the
video before this one why should you get
dye in it and you guys know that there
are coming Express I'm actually ordered
ombre bundles I just dived in myself
this is kind of all gray kind of anyway
they're all my bundles I got myself I
got this beautiful color and it is if I
smell beautiful he said it's like the
end it's just so cute like I love it
style and I had it straight I thought
was really cute straight but you know
like I want just to test the quality of
the hair even more and the hair it curls
so nicely honestly when you watch the
videos tool we have a sinker lena that i
always put like 5 cents each I totally
was it whenever and it came up so nice
and so pretty and I love my necklace and
I find this I find wigs that like I'm
actually going to wear multiple times
and I know that like I don't post all
time Instagram so you guys don't see all
the way there where but I do like really
rare some of it was a review like
they're just one I'm going to talk about
it because I mean I want to expect
company but I'll make a video on the
ways that I constantly go back to
because there's always go back to it
this is when I put it back to you
because I'm in the corner late super
easily articles like I don't think I
didn't blow it down is laying mad glass
the hair itself is nice but I seriously
no shedding no tangling like I'm nothing
I'm super shocked I bleach the heck I
did you guys watch the videos anyways
but did watch some videos I love the
hair but I have nothing best date on it
I can't be of any best to say about it
I'm Tom state I literally can I think
something bad about it I can't do
anything back to say like I literally
can't in
I kind of feel bad like um let's see I'm
trying to pull out hair like okay I got
more few strands I'm gonna die though
like I can't be many mixtape I can't so
with that being said I'm gonna let you
guys watch me Carla's here real quick
and watching you go from a pin to 11 or
like this little I don't know what you
guys told me I have a lot injury now and
I haven't even drinking a Red Bull
so that's crazy but I wanted to go to
the video and when I did give me a
thumbs up and subscribe let me know what
I want to speak and I thought don't know
what to do anymore like people do not
his hair and don't know him anymore if
he doesn't tell me so yeah I'll see you
my next video alright so this is the
hair straight you guys are seen in my
last video I think my hair looks really
nice treat but like I said in the other
video I don't try something different I
honestly like it curled better than I
like it straight so I'm just going to
section my hair off just like put this
little section in the ponytail and then
you know just dude I do dump that curly
this will be a very simple video because
I'm willing to show myself curl one side
because I mean I've done a want curl
tutorial before I just don't want to be
repetitive but I'm yeah it can be very
very simple I just I just want to do
this so I'm gonna take one most section
and I'm gonna take my wand curls from
Bellamy um I don't even know the size
this barrel I just know like using
skinny barrels I don't know why but I'm
literally like maybe one for this for me
like five seconds super short I wanted
messy waves and okay wait when rain let
it go that's like five six second this
one look like it looks really cute and
increasing it this will be even a
perfect long curl it looks so much
better but I thought it looked so cute
like I was just yeah I'm really weird
because this kind of stuff I don't know
no and I think everyone was really cute
and like doll like I don't know maybe
it's a color but I really liked it a lot
so I decided to go with it and I just
like want curls and want curls and I
kind of like did some pieces longer than
other than this appeases shorter than
others I wasn't going for a perfect look
but I do know that based on the five
family has a wall code for like maybe
like a few seconds and it came out
nice if I did want to go for the perfect
look it'd be very achievable and we very
easy cuz hair want curled super easily
almost too easily so I love this hair I
really do I think it's awesome yeah this
video will be pretty sped up because I
mean I'm doing the same thing and I
always say this I do not like me
repetitive so I'm going to speed up
pretty fast I just hope you guys enjoy
it I just thought it'd be enjoyable
video because something about this hair
color and the curls something about it
is just very satisfying to the eyes for
some reason I don't know like it's like
it so I'm just gonna speed it up and
I'll check back in with you guys
towards in the video I'll just let you
guys watch it enjoy and if you have any
question about this hair leave them down
below all the links will be in a
description box I have nothing bad to
say about like affinity in the video I'm
wearing right now I've experienced no
issues at all I'm wearing a black shirt
so I'm going to see if I see any
shedding on my shirt in the day cuz you
know usually when you have a blonde hair
you could see all that on black shirt so
I'll check in with a comment like later
later on tonight to see how much shame I
got but so far so good
um and this hair has behaved amazingly
when it comes to still taking the blue
that you like it's actually a shocker so
like a family I just watch me do this
and I'll check back in at the end of the
video
so I think this fine you guys see how
cute it looks and love love love the
fact that it gets light and if I'm happy
I put the lighter bundle at the bottom
if you watched my previous video you
know exactly I'm talking about CSUN of
mistakes aren't always bad bad yeah if I
take a few selfies you know you know how
it goes I was really really really
filling this honestly this is probably
my favorite hair color yet I want to do
more hair dyeing videos I can't explain
why I haven't been doing them lately
it's a long story but if you have any
color suggested leave them down below
because I'm a lot of hair to die and I
I'm in the mood to dye hair like after
this I'm really in the mood to dye your
hair so here's what one side looks like
straight and one side looks like curly
now I finished the other side I don't
know why I'm dancing oh yeah I'll just
to music that makes sense but just the
finished look ever so cute you guys like
I'm so extra okay so anyways I hope you
doesn't do this video if you did please
