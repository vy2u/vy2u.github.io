this one's by tarte it's America just
see brighter ID treatment
I need that because my eyes are very
various incidents I filmed this look
like three times
I was actually filming us at 12 that
night because I really want to get up
for you guys so yeah my eyes they needed
some treatments to prime my face I'm
using another tarp product this is a
clean slate
timeless smoothing primer and using as a
base for foundation I'm using NYX
mineral stick foundation the shade
caramel and so after I played on my face
I'm just gonna use a brush to buff that
out
so I won't be using concealer today and
stem using Shia beam by benefit it's a
liquid highlighter with the pink
undertone and I want to use this one
because I want to give my eyes and my
over a highlight like a rosy feel to it
so yeah this is what I'm using I used to
be for my videos but now I'm gonna blend
that with a Beauty Blender at first it's
gonna look very bright and it won't look
that flattering but I'm gonna use banana
powder to set my makeup today and
because I'm using banana powder which
has a yellow tint to it it'll pretty
much balance out this pink tint and make
it it will still have that bright effect
but it won't look so crazy in cast get
ready
so now I'm taking this tart cheek stain
I never use cheek stains but I'm plan on
wearing a lot of blush today so I just
want to use it as a base it's very
interesting I thought this is better for
people who don't want to wear foundation
and they just want a nice flush because
when you apply this over your foundation
it's kind of hard to get to stick but it
worked out I just used as a base so now
I'm just going to set the place that I
highlighted with that liquid highlighter
with banana powder
so after I'm done studying those place
that I highlight it I'm gonna do one eye
off-camera and I will be right back
right now so this what I did um I don't
really know where the inspiration came
from I kinda just I tried to match my
backdrop so that's where this ilyich
infer reminds me of a sunset hence the
name sunset eyes anyways I'm priming my
lid with my lemonade primer by benefit
so after I finished rubbing the primary
and I'm gonna get this Laura Mercier
translucent powder and then just set on
top of that watch me come through with
these edits though look at that you guys
I'm really like I've been doing so much
research to try to make my videos better
and I taught myself I do this I'm like
overexcited so I'm using asked us to
Beverly Hills modern renaissance palette
and this shadow I'm using is highlighted
in green as you can see the first shed I
used was called golden ochre now I'm
using raw sienna and burnt orange just
painted to the screen I highlighted the
shower I use it in green cuz green is my
favorite color and I just love green I
really hope you guys like these edits
cuz I stayed up till 3:00 in the morning
forgiveness stuff out and I just
couldn't sleep you know like I don't
know I'm just like obsessed with
upgrading my content like I don't know
it just it's so fun and it's so
rewarding you know it's like I'm finally
investing into myself and improving my
 and it's just like dang like I just
never had the back anyways let's focus
on my eyes here I'm taking the shade red
ochre and love-letter and I'm using as
blending brush from morphe and I'm just
placing on my crease eyelid area I'm
just deepening the shades before I at
the darkest shade
it's not it much easier watching nitros
then you have the pallet right in front
of you in the shadow of the highlighted
like I feel like I don't have to talk
but I will say that the reason why I
chose to highlight it at each time is
because I love mixing shadows it's just
my thing it makes things easier for me I
feel like if you're beginner eye shadow
please make shadows it'll make your life
so much easier it you know it helps you
avoid mistakes it's like my favorite
thing to do I almost never use one
shadow at a time unless it's like very
very light if I'm using anything
slightly darker I'm always mixing the
shadows
so before I apply Shrimant to my lid I'm
going to quickly highlight my brow bone
I'm choosing Mac oh darling highlighter
but for my lid I first go take this
shade with bahi cosmetics called Solange
and to apply that I'm using my liquid
sugar by eye candy like I always do and
after I put that on my lid I'm gonna add
this shade called melanin also my body
cosmetics just add a more golden tint to
it
now to apply liner I'm using this tar
Dias liner by Tarte you guys know I
never wear liner it's not my mom it's
not my strongpoint I just I don't really
like liner like that I just feel like
yeah I don't like liner but I decided to
wear it today cuz I was like you know
what mine's a little try it and it came
out pretty cool I felt like I still have
practice today when it comes to liner
and making it look flattering on my eyes
I always feel like the liner I do
off-camera comes out much better than
why I do on camera and it's because I'm
not able to like have a mirror super
close to my eye you know they try to
perfect it but it is what it is
I got myself a wing that's all I needed
so I'm gonna pry my last today I'm using
tarts opening act upon my lash cuz my
lashes have been all over the place I
made the mistake of using this horrible
lash glue and my last was just tripping
out while let that primer dry a little
bit I'm gonna take the shade real car
and love-letter I'm just gonna put on my
lower lash line from SK I'm using gifted
by Tarte now I thought that I look
coulda came out better actually looked
better during the day but I filmed this
three times and so by the time I'm
filming this my eyelid space was burning
to be honest and I just feel like the
shadows weren't sticking to it like it
typically does so it doesn't look
perfect that's why but you get the over
idea of it I hope you guys understand I
just try to do this for you guys but
here I am just setting my face my black
gradient soft poke poke is soft focus
powder like I always use
so for blush I'm using pretty coral by
Bobbi Brown this is like one of the
first wool this is the first high-end
blush I ever bought and I really like it
but I use it rarely because I mean it
wasn't cheap it's Bobby Brown and I'm
going really really heavy on this blush
I don't know why I just wanted a lot of
blush on even put out my nose
I felt like really cute because I gave
like a little red nose which I liked so
to highlight I'm using Laura Keller's
peach glow I chose this shade because it
kind of matched my blush and it kind of
matched the overall feel my makeup look
I didn't need intense highlight because
my blush was already looking crazy so I
just wanted really a soft peach glow
so for lips first time I applied dose of
colors cork which is this beautiful
brown shade those are colors they make
my favorite liquid lipsticks best
formerly I've ever tried if you haven't
bought one I definitely recommend that
you do they have the hands-down the best
formula I promise you guys how to make
this orange e I'm taking this the lip
glass by Mac Cod laundry list um I don't
know if it's let me assure or not it's
some really cute orange gloss and I just
put that on top to kind of give this
look of orange tone I'm going to set my
face using my NYX dewy finish setting
spray and after that that is the
finished look now time for slo-mo is my
favorite part I really hope you guys
