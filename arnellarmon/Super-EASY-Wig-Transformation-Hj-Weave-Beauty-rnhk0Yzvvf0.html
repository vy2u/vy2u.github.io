you're new welcome so Jays finish will
be a really quick one quicker than I
thought it would be because I didn't
think this would be so easy just like to
work with my max happy it is because I
think that that makes it better for you
guys who aren't used to wearing wigs
like I don't know I just feel like
videos I just like make wigs and super
simple I just better so quick intro this
wig is from H Jamie Beauty they save me
this wig and believe was 18 inches
I didn't even cut it I'm shocked I was
going to cut the ends but after curling
it looks much better straight I did
notice I guess only karna mentioned up
front is that I feel like the hair kind
of got thin twist ends which I notice
it's like they have this a lot of wigs I
get sent however the hair curl um I
think it looks pretty good you can't
tell the ends are like you know slender
the rest of hair and so in this video
just literally to show you guys what I
do to I guess put the wig on I'm so
shocked I this was just so simple like
I'm kind of actually kind of freaked out
by it because I wants to do much more I
literally just bleached the knots on
this wig I cut the excess lace off I not
customized this hair my at all I mean I
plucked a little bit apart to the part
was just more defined but I think
customers in front at all in fact if I
lift this up you can still see you know
some of the lace now um you can put a
black eye shadow around the rim of this
I guess you could say in case like the
wind blows it's like oh my god but I
mean my hair you stays in place and I
don't want to put too much or do too
much as wicks I plan on giving away test
subscriber in mind so that's why I'm not
really like doing too much with it but I
mean I'm going to go outside I'm gonna
film a lookbook today so you guys will
see me wear this wig and lookbook and
this looks pretty good I mean other than
I had my like my real edges out so I
mean if I were to put a black shadow
right here and this will be even better
like I said I'm not trying to touch this
with too much time giving away but I
mean I think this looks pretty great if
you'd wear this wig it's video a thumbs
up imma let you guys watch it like I
said it's super quick video super
straight to the point so if you enjoyed
if you find it helpful thumbs up
subscribe all that good stuff and I'll
see
so the wood comes in this box and then
you open the boxes so they come in a
plastic bag and the week hasn't that
around it when you get it however I
might already took out the back and
everything to like touch it I just put
it back you know for the purpose of this
video but it does come with a net around
it and so the wig comes straight and as
you can see like the ends get a little
thin when it's straight that's why I
care all day I like it better much I
like it much better when it's curly
and so I'm yeah here's the hairline has
own little baby hairs so that's why
didn't customize it because I just
figured you know I would just like work
with a wig how it is it has three count
for combs two on the side one in the
front and one in the back and then it
has an adjustable strap at the back of
the wig which I did tighten I didn't
show them the video by did tighten it
and so first things first you're gonna
bleach the knots you bleach and knots
because the hair is tied to the lace and
it has black knots and no one has black
knots in their scalp so you want to
bleach it to make it look more scalp
like so I'm using my ion powder liner my
developer you need a bowls and full and
a whisk and you're also getting a butter
knife which I didn't show and so I'm
gonna make my mixture you want the
mixture to be like kind of thick however
you wanted to be easy to smooth like
easy to spread sometimes I make it too
thick to where it's all clumpy which is
cool but I like easy more than anything
and so um you just want it to be at a
spread but not too runny to where it's
gonna seep through the lace because then
you'll have like bleached roots and
that's not what you want
so before I plan the bleach I'm gonna
cut this comb in the middle because I
don't know why they have a comb right in
the middle of the wig I don't know not a
fan of that I'm not gonna use it and so
I need to cut it so I can have more
parting space so you don't cut it when
you part in the middle you'll see that
you'll see the comb trust me I've done
this before
so if you don't want to see the comb you
have to cut it off you cut the other
ones off too if you want slay flatter I
just I didn't feel like anything was
necessary to do that and so after I cut
the comb off I'm going to spread the
bleach with my butter knife you guys see
how it's thick but it's so smooth yeah
that's all I'm gonna do I've done this a
minute
before so it should be easy to fall
along
so I put a bleach then I put the fall to
process it and I let it sit for 40
minutes and this one looks like I could
have used to again something like a lot
of times when I like bleach like least I
bleach it twice I feel like it looks
perfect that way are you kind of
paranoid after like 40 minutes I don't
wanna leave it off for too long but you
can always bleach it twice if you want I
could tone the knots but it wasn't
necessary for what the look I was going
for so now I'm gonna saw an elastic band
and you just got thread your needle I'm
using bra X and ran out of my black
thread so there's that and then you want
to get your elastic band and I don't
show us I'm measuring it because my
camera angle but you later just measured
ear-to-ear you stretch it out to where
it's like tight and then you cut it my
mind's um it measures like the length of
my leg the bottom part my leg like my
shin area that's how long it stretches
out too so here's the next day that's a
lighting change cuz I took a break and
you know I went to get food then I just
didn't finish the video that day so here
I'm the next day cut off the rest of the
lace before you saw an elastic band you
want to cop the lace so you sew it in
the right place
I mean you cancel elastic band with the
lace there I just I didn't need that and
I don't know I still think that's area
so you want to sew it from ear to ear so
you are trying to wick of course and see
where the wig flap just lay on the ears
and it of course it lays right here and
you try so it down and so I saw one side
and once that's done I'm gonna sew the
other side I'm not gonna show that on
camera though because I mean it just
feel like it's kind of repetitive I just
want you guys see me sew one side you do
not have to do this neatly you do want
to make sure that the thread is laying
flat on the lace you don't want it to be
thick cuz you'll be to feel it I've made
a mistake before but it doesn't look
super neat because the inside of the wig
so no one's gonna see it
dry finish that I want a wig if you
would like an Elan curl tutorial which I
already have one but this is a little
different let me know and I'll do a
video on that because this one I have is
so nice it's like dude so nice I don't
want cry my real hair but I'm trying to
be on anymore and so now I am just going
to pin this down to my Styrofoam head
and I'm just going to tweeze the part
already made so I made the part and
because I loose the knots the part looks
pretty good
however when you put the wig on the part
does really show up that much and so I'm
just going to pluck a little bit into
the part just so it looks more defined
and that's literally all I'm going to do
now time to put on the wig so I've
already gelled my hair back now I'm
putting on my wig cap I usually like lay
my baby hairs back to buy new I wanted
my baby hairs to be out so I just kept
those out and so first of upon the wig
you know see what it looked like it
looked kind of crazy because the curls
are too fresh so I have gained a brush
and brushing through the curls cuz I
just felt like they look crazy I don't
know so I'm gonna brush them through and
the wig it was only bad however I the
part looks really nice but it's a little
too light so I'm gonna end up grabbing
my foundation powder in order to make
the lace match my scalp more and so I'm
using this studio I think it's due to
finish some samac powder and I put the
powder on and it looked much better but
now I need to glue this down so I'm
taking my god speed glue someone in the
yellow tube actually got on the hair
which kind of really messed this whole
process for me because once you get this
into the hair it's like it's a wrap and
so I had to like do the like mold design
off-camera because I mean I didn't have
a mirror which is why I kind of messed
up but all I did was you know to put the
guts of people who spread it out and I
just like place the wig down I don't
think of it a bit low on like what I do
but I use got smooth glue cause it's
really easy and Here I am just you know
trying to like finesse the front to look
super natural as possible I'm Lilly just
like you know just moving different
hairs around just seeing what frames my
face
the most and you know Korean like little
swoops little baby hairs just you know
doing what I do and I after I did this I
am pretty much done like that super
simple right super easy so if you
enjoyed this video if you liked it if
you thought it was helpful please give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and um yeah
I can't believe anything so soon like I
was like so simple oh I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
