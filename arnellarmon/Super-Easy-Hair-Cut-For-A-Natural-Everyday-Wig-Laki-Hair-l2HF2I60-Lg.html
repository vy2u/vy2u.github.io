a quick video of me cutting in solid and
tears honestly kind of morons but it's
pretty simple I just have to believe me
for a while like almost two months now
and I have a plan for it but those times
cancelled so I had to be able to do with
it I decided to kind of go for in style
back to where kind of every single day I
want more ways that's kind of strong I
go and I pledge it's going to be it
because kind of like the natural hair is
pretty simple pretty like you know
pretty natural
so this hair some locking hair I hope
there I am in the right here lacking
lucky Lipi that's how every sort I don't
know about this but I'm going to sum
them they just mean her moving straight
bundle and honestly like I looked up
email to come and remind me of what I've
spent and now kind of makes sense now
the hair texture makes sense is
something that they do you ever see that
I'm saying that hair like you feel silky
but it feels more on the satisfied and
now in excellence that peruses because
I'm in resilient hair if I were to
recommend any kind of hair texture or
origin I recommend the villain because
you still sick it just Africans the best
of all the hair types I try Indian
Malaysian prove it but on I drug
Brazilian with the best anyways I don't
know but um resume event so the whole
time I'll just build up a point verify I
but not as cuddles great when it was a
zoo month I got that I was really doing
it and I will say that the orchids hair
if you are 20 inch by a 22 inch if you
want a 22 inch by 24 inch because you're
going to end up having to cut them off
the end because the hair goes from being
really nice and lush and then it is a
little thinner on the end so if you want
to fill a limb you have to pretty much
buy a length longer and use it for that
anyway so I mean I don't know if it's
normal or not I mean I used to have on a
story hair limp I want to end with I
knew I would be cutting a little bit off
the ends anyway so I violins longer than
the one I want it that way once I cut it
I still got the list that I wanted what
oh right but yeah the only thing is a
bit of hair is that the in trouble
stringy there live kind of legs hours
it'll end like that
to be honest I think the hairstyles we
took in life when I first messes with
our jet engine black and all come out
right at home the hair dye use just
basic red ones I like three dollars a
box to 86 and things I don't know like
three four hours bucks and for that they
are black and I did notice that when I
did thoroughly rinse the hair dye and
make the hair stiff so I have to go back
in a second time shampoo it to get it to
be more flowing and when you don't rinse
on my hair and I we don't press up any
hair dye
you may think you're in sit out black
hair tactics forever drinks out I hated
but I haven't anyone hide at my bundles
black balls with Debbie will and will
actually do it well yeah when I first
got been here and I cited I let the I
rinsed it dial I didn't rinsed out
enough because I was back the wig was so
 stiff oh well no I held her hair
at first but then I was back I stopped
being a lazy and I washed the wig again
I really thoroughly rinsed out all the
black dye and now I mean it's perfectly
fine so if you do Dyna hair in here you
have to rinse out there early or else it
may make you think niggas negative
things about the hair and really about
the hair is the problem in here because
I almost like I was a good I like cuz
when were you two seem like a pair of
the nation' but it wasn't my hair it was
a diet I do rinse it out thoroughly but
you know I didn't you have to see the
hair is a nice luster I have a frontal
and honey little McClendon they send
three bundles stick only is a two and a
half I know how to use all the bundles
on because the hair
it wasn't like sure like this but it
wasn't a long the bundle is a pretty big
um I made this wake months ago so I have
footage of what the hair came without
insert a little screen grabs from the
site and I also like insert the price
and everything so what you're going to
know what you guys repaint but on lunch
I just watched a video I'm not going to
be a very interesting one my energy is
kind of low I don't know why kind of
weird but a millage is what you they
want to see how I just cut into moves on
salads and just keep watching all the
details for this hair be down below I
made this with myself I noticed I don't
fit in my videos a lot of all the hair I
think
all the time I get sent and make it to
which I'll attach my real hair I'm going
to keep it healthy so all the hair I get
said I turn to wigs it's a wig it sent
to me and it comes in the wig I would
close out let you guys know that but if
it's not it's made by me so I don't want
you guys to think that you guys can go
to the side and buy regard it when it's
actual bundling you'll have to make it
was yourself
I noticed I did some question about that
the time ago but I can't find the words
outside is because we'll come and make
the wigs by myself and I'm sorry for not
explaining that clear of each video but
I just did but let you guys watch the
video I hear the BART train coming but I
messed up my intro like always so I'm
just as well the videos into it drugs
them bribe and I'll see you in my wig
with my Creator now that's because I
want to tell myself recording it because
I've been wearing my wig looks shorter
Meili I don't know why I just I think
cutting them and I become them off
camera hasn't shown you guys have been
doing this voice what show you guys
because you on camera now I'm crying I'm
gonna stand up there as you see let the
ends of them I'm kind of because the
hair it looks really nice up here but
then when you get down here it gets thin
and stringy um similar pack hair and so
I'm not really liking this and I like
the wig I didn't I mean I spent time on
the wig so much I think it looks good
but I have to cut it because the
industry key and that's not worked for
me whatsoever like the only way to make
this look good
without having to cut it curly man I
don't want to be curls so I'm just going
to cut it now when I cut my wig it's
like Bob and stuff I don't just go for
it um and I think this is gonna be very
easy because my hair is on a thinner
side usually one hair thicker it's
harder to kind of cut cut it and make it
look good because you don't stick but
usually one hair gonna verify it's
easier to cut you can just like cut it
like very simple you can see this so I
mean this is also to be so easy because
the hair is very thin but if you've ever
tried cut into thick hair problems is
really easy
Wow local community if you've ever tried
cutting this big hair you know what are
comes back even so if you guys see you I
mean we put my chair up
oh joy be taller no this is totally good
um remember my camera I'm going to
actually scoop that the reason why I
can't like put my camera I like far away
because I got this new backdrop but
where's I'm online and I don't know
message message measurements Jesus I
don't measure miss so I didn't want to
get so I got then it was cool but small
like if I I have to stay in the spraying
rope you Lucy my wet wall so yeah it's
pretty easy I kind of like figure out
what kind of length I want and then I
just go from there I kind of like take
the back piece birth and cut that first
didn't have my guideline that I cut it
for us and then I just make sure it's
even and it just works for me it was a
pair of sticker it be a little more hard
and more complex because not um this is
actually way easy I'm s to kind of like
set I was alright how they would like
adjust the backdrop to where you get to
see more so uh I came when I cut here
following me hopefully this works I'm
shaking that other side I'll do like
it's very simple the front is a little
longer at least on button teaches I want
to cut in using you know like the hair
raised they use for guide I can't find
mine anywhere so I have to be bigger
than I finally about the new scissors
lead or cater of contact con air and
they are this have supposed to cut their
fortune Gaga Walmart I'm going to play
pretty good I just I honestly I feel
like with wait weights and leave it
social forgiving and there's my bro hair
if I want to cut it off but I mean this
looks pretty good
I can't one cut the front just a little
bit ah I'm obviously we're doing come on
cut the front
just tap it just go a look live style
I hate all the hair to saw it on me
alright so yeah I meant this I think it
looks nice couple more pieces just go
this perfect I think was Bob they're
very forgiving because like the thing of
this even if I were to cut them evenly
which I try to avoid but I do I don't
only get upset because I just bump it
and you can't even tell young cute and
I've got other side honestly like this
hair is very very thin and there's been
enough to thin hair and there's
negatives it really depends on your
preference the only thing I like when I
gets in hair like that little short the
only thing I like when I gets in here is
to make sure even the organizer like is
that it reminds me more of my natural
hair so it feels more real because my
natural hair spin but it's like I feel
like for wigs I don't think been here
but you have to really know how to
finesse to make it look good and it look
interesting because the bundles they
felt really gently felt safe after
looking - look I've destroyed the hair
feels more thin like it's really nice
and still gives all there's more -
thinner side
now that I'm here I kind of wanna add
more dimension so I'm going to cut
Beauty to shorter you should give them
more bodies the hair is more spin using
hair spin you get less body so right now
I'm kind of grabbing red pieces and I'm
cutting like this way look at an angle I
think sometime key part to stick it up
so I'm have to get a scarf and like lay
down I just wanted to like a very cute
my goal right now is just trying to get
very cute super ball like a bob wig I
could pretty much let it look like my
desk on here straighten and I want to do
to throw it on and go so that is my goal
I just wanna make this wig look like you
know that length of hair where it's like
Paige that's not like words like it's
long enough to like look long but not so
long Tori's opposite is a with a wig or
weep that was a limp I'm going for the
bomb and it's but not like new growth
now I'm going to take slide to make both
times even like I'll take hand from this
side and bring it over here just seems
it's blowing with it and it's not like I
feel a few pieces that aren't really
going with the flow I can pull down I
just cut those pieces easy pretty simple
feel free even right he'll do right now
part is bothering me I'm gonna
straighten that part for this wig um I
originally was going to make it for a
little she want to have bob wig but
please crap on the video and just yes I
decided just a bit on myself and I kind
of customize the front a little bit why
I did a lot of tweezing up there to make
it look more natural so um like I think
that's why it looks pretty good up front
I just make some baby hair right now but
it looks some and looks nervous
stiff about it I feel like baby guards
are optional I'd like some people don't
look right baby here and some people's
like they need baby hair for the wig to
look natural they need a 10 like I just
come out a little crazy on the baby
hairs
I'll just put enough to where it's not
so obvious like a line with a lace lace
so it's not so obvious badly it's a wig
my goal come up Saturdays my like on
eyebrows micro bleeding I don't have at
this video prime mention in the
beginning but I rather like that I got
some isolated and there is update three
for healing so that may look shiny my
booth illustrating Simon on him but the
other day when I went to be done
I had a weight on and if I look from the
monthly favorites and I was I don't have
a waist was up fun and so I just want to
fix it that I messed it up and so I need
to put another wig on I was in Russia
with you my eyebrows up and that's why I
realized I don't have a lot ways better
so on the wig is going on was the wig
that I used the L'Oreal red hair dye on
oh that's one of my favorite throwing
wigs right I'm wearing that one but like
no II I didn't wear that one I almost
wore that one not really yes and I
wonder what I want I'm ganna days mixed
up I warned I want early date no no I'm
given a percent I wore down yesterday I
end up wearing some other one effort
always wanted I'll leave in the little
yellow sees all you guys see in the
video but that's my realize I don't have
a lot of link that I just throw on and
go and I want more weight like that
because it's more convenient so it's
like to knowledge I do my legs I'm going
to try to pull referendum they just try
to make them just as nice as possible
that way whenever I just want to slow
the loss I could easily do that so I'm
yeah if I'm trying to just you know take
my time on this I need to put scars on
the hair has a lot of flyaways right now
so I've come frustrating mess occur from
what I do is I like this cut I like I
said it's cousin it's super easy
I really do have to do much less with a
pair of angels been so sick of it in
short trust me um so I mean I like this
color this is perfect to me that the
purview listed a little pea-sized of six
that's it but I've been cut I think it's
very cute natural little threads on my
brows them I'm going to do I just spray
that get my brush brush that down slowly
freaking smooth this one piece is
sticking up because I had this end with
a little fun so it I can get used to
being that fun I like a big format
though I want to somehow to do that
gonna have my natural hair I always I
always have being of some sort and I'll
explain how that happened but I just
seen where I take my flat iron and the
front and dishes using your a lot of
dimensions and what my favorite thing to
do I pull it up and you get to see loops
I don't have that some kind of cute
no I'm gonna take my mind the exercises
on our clock and yeah that's right here
so we're looking at petal how to clean
down I just have it ellagic man the
excess Becker looks cute to the side you
know what I'm going to stick to what I
was doing
um I should think about gravel sex right
here and on your flat iron and I will
just like scoop it that way just let it
drop and that kind of giving it a super
fat and they give another bottle to your
house
looks like that and then he comes like
the whole head of course and it's too
curly to keep playing with it it'll be
Chicago be tamed down you know but I
think that it is just asked like more
dimensional look
if you want your code addressed of like
the hair I'm not going to do that
because I kinda like how this one down
look look what I look like this kind of
like that gives me a very positive budge
so there's that flowers are really
killing me though so I'm not really
going oh alright well that's the video I
really still like know why like I'm so
tired but I'm not so then I am I knew at
