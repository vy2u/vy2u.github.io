love my hair it's so cute oh
now lip gloss my teeth that's not cute
no good thing I caught that alright okay
I'm fixed okay anyways yeah you guys
know have a new hairstyle now I've been
wearing it like whatever what I've been
doing to it oh I've been curling it with
a flat iron you know played all that
heat and damage on my hair but today I
was like you know no like you don't feel
like doing your hair won't you try jail
for once in your life and this white
came up with everything looks really
cute and so I guess I'm excited because
like I thought that if I have my natural
hair out I typically do not like wearing
your wet because it doesn't get curly
anymore I thought that I'll have to
continue to put heat damage on it but
now I figure out new style so that's my
story
anyway step on deodorant took on the
shower it's really hot okay yeah I did
anyways just got done from this look
using let me get you out baby the new
NSS Beverly Hills master palette by Mary
oh no it's Mario I just like saying
words differently um just create this
really cute look I honestly have
probably done this look before not gonna
lie I don't know I'd be doing the same
looks I don't even know if you guys have
any other video suggestions as you do
let me know I already have some plant
umm I planted Shane guitar straighten my
hair I'm just trying myself a break so
I've been using a lot of heat on it so
I'll probably be up with the next week
or so Silas knows I really like this
style but anyways that is all I have to
say I hope you guys in this video to
prime my skin I'm using Porefessional by
benefit this primer helps minimize your
that I came to help smitten by your
pores and my pores have been a little
bigger than they usually are and I'm
focused that around my nose ear because
her most of my pores are not from - I'm
taking my NSSC Beverly Hills stick
foundation I grabbed the wrong shade
occurs I'm using one for my foundation
and one to contour the foundation on the
shade caramel caramel however you say
this like absolutely my perfect shade
and this is my fav foundation at the
moment I'm just really scared to run out
so after I apply that using the stick
I'm going to take a damp Beauty Blender
and I'm just going to blend that out
this Beauty Blender it's not super damp
but it's also not dry I really don't
like my beauty but that my Beauty
Blender super damp
I just don't know just it's my
preference okay there's no rules to
makeup or how you use a certain tool so
yeah I use my Beauty Blender like time
to dry kind a damn um I don't know I
just feel like it blends my foundation
the best so after I blend that out I'm
taking my concealer I'm using these two
cap on D concealers I forgot the name of
this shade but I'm using the shade
whiteout to mix into that to bring the
concealer one of our users always mixed
them so I feel like the concealer by
itself um the shade is old to oranjee so
I feel like the white kind of tones that
down and so yeah I just mix those two
together and I get another Beauty
Blender and I blend that out
so to contour make another stick
foundation this is shade espresso and
I'm just going to contour my cheekbones
and my jaw line to kind of make my face
look slimmer by the way I want to start
working out the hidden Accio that's the
gym for those who don't know Spanish I
don't know that's like scene in Spanish
I meant Spanish clashes like oh my god
four years old anyway let me start
working out because they need I have a
bet with someone that supposed to get
ads by November it's like $1,000 bed and
I haven't really been taken seriously
but I'm feeling that you know he's
probably gonna be like where's my money
to sell my conceal'd I'm taking this
airspun powder but I actually mix a
little banana powder into that because I
feel like the airspun powder is a little
too white and I feel like the manna
patterns a little too yellow so I was
like hmm you're an artist mix the two
shades it's like the perfect shade so
yeah I mix those two and a really
affordable to airspun say I like Walmart
for like eight dollars it's not like
baby powder go but it does the job so I
did one eye
off-camera and now I'm gonna do the
other one I'm using my same primer like
always the lemonade prime by benefit and
I'm going to set that with my
translucent powder this could be like
the most simple eye look ever this is
perfect for people who want to like a
cute little fall look but you're either
lazy or you're not that experienced with
makeup now I'm taking the master palette
by Mario this palette comes out next
Thursday this will looks like okay this
is horrible but don't worry I'm going to
insert more pictures and I'm going to
take the shape Isabelle as a transition
shade it's kind of like a just like a
warm brown shade it looks different in
the pan then it does on my eyes um it's
a trip but I like it so that's the shade
I'm taking
then we go with the shade Violeta which
is like a warm brown shade I mix a
little bit is the bell Japan tone it
down so it wasn't too dark and I'm gonna
focus that in the crease area and use
the same morphe fluffy brush now I'm
gonna take the shade Lula and it's like
a I can't even explain it I just I don't
know what it's like but I place it all
over my lid it's like a matte greyish
shade and then I take the shade Violeta
with Isabel and I mix those two and I
place it on my lashline and that's
pretty much thin that I look so so my
face oh my god you guys pregnant tired
this powder but that's all I like using
it's a soft focus powder Black Radiance
I'm the shade golden almond and I'm
using this brush by urban studio I
forgot how much I liked this brush I
will switch my brushes so I forget which
one I liked the most for this one it
blended um the cotton to my skin really
really nicely like yeah I don't know I
kept being powder my eyes though which I
was not happy with so to get underneath
my eyes I take this makeup dish cosmetic
brush I just like you know dust and buff
that away
not to define my contour taking my hoola
bronzer by benefit and I'm just going to
place that where I already had my cream
contour for blush you're taking this
Bobbi Brown blush called pretty coral
it's like a pinky coral color I didn't
really want much blush on I try to keep
this look as simple and easy as possible
so yeah I just placed a little blush
with the same brush used for my bronzer
on and that was that now for highlight
I'm uses Anastasia Beverly Hills
highlighter in the shade so Hollywood it
was sold upper Wow I don't know if they
plan to bring these things back but
that's what I'm using
you
now before I do my lips and my scare I'm
taking this L'Oreal infallible science
spray I'm going to set my face with that
and I'm gonna let it dry and then I'm
going to do my lips I think I do my lips
mascara first they didn't ever scare
first I think I don't remember let's see
let's see what happens
oh there our mascara first I'm using the
mascara always uses a tart tart yes
mascara it's like my favorite one even
though it's starting to dry out because
I think it's almost empty enough to buy
a new one I'll probably buy my bare
minerals one the last domination it's
only 18 dollars and it's pretty similar
to this one
now time for lips I'm taking this brown
lipliner the name will be down in the
description box below I'm going to line
my lips with that and then well let's
line the lips first then we'll talk
about what we're doing after this now
before my lipstick on I decided to
define my Cupid's bow and I choose the
same hoola bronzer I use in my face and
I just put that and we're like the dint
like right on my Cupid's bow is and that
just kind of helps to find that a little
bit now I'm kicking this and Stassi
Beverly Hills fall gloss and the shade
raisin and I'm going to place it all of
my lips
now I thought this glass was cool but I
wanted to be a little darker so I got
this gloss from the same gloss set and
this is a shade maple which is like a
like a shimmery brown shade and I mix
that on top and that's how I got my
final lip color
I thought that look was cool but I
thought was missing something so I took
this color pop eyeliner in the shade
call me which is like a pretty brown
color and I just placed on my waterline
just to kind of like I don't know spice
up the eye look a little bit and after I
did that that was pretty much the final
look
so you guys know i dekopon turtleneck or
some cute shirt which I mean the neck
part was kind of messed up I didn't know
until I edit this video but you know
what it's okay you guys focus on my face
anyway so maybe focus on my hair cuz I
gotta new style mm pretty ways I'll be
