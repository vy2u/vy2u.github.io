channel if you're new welcome so I did
it so fast like I'm so glad that I when
I first on YouTube I cannot say that
 like I'd be like oh I haven't do my
intro over so many times I was so like
awkward uncomfortable finality to it
alright so new wig I know this price the
same wig I had in my previous video but
two different curl patterns I do showed
up into the video to compare the
different
- totally difficult having the two
totally different deals let's say I'm
kind of obsessed with this hair right L
doesn't mean right here
I'll say the random if I am and if they
sent me four bundles in a frontal accent
one sec I'm grouchy bundle I actually
have two bundles left over on this style
only took one frontal into bundle just
gonna shop because this hair is 22
inches long this is the 3
oh no I'll show you guys I did whatever
you're gonna see it anyways but it's 28
inches long and a lot of hair comes in
the bundles like when I was done I'll go
down I'll use two bundles so I mean is
to to achieve the style and the bundles
the track they're very close to each
other so if not guys get to the last
bases i laced it very closer to other
it's Bauman's you know what two bundles
so hey I got two extras but most I don't
know what I do with these I almost want
to dye these and get close to my natural
hair color make clippings out of this
quite destroyed scenes would be really
really nice clippings but um yeah they
send me four bubbles in a frontal 22
inches and I need a way I got them now
the video the purpose of the videos to
see if these curls can take bleach
without losing its curl pattern which I
mean just kind of see that well clearly
it did I'm not sure you guys please
watch this video I don't want I'm giving
everything away in intro but I kind of
have to you but I'm I show myself
bleaching the hair and I try to die in
and honestly the dying part was kind of
shambles guys kind of literally just
experimenting with random colors but I
got this cool color right here it's not
showing right now so what the hair of a
prophet but this is what the hair looks
like when it's dry so I end up getting
like a dark peel off weird green color
so if you like the color - keep watching
I use a lot of random stuff
but it looks pretty cool in my opinion
but yeah this hair
honestly it was such a breeze working
with it um I haven't I can like run my
fingers through it and let's see them
experience I get them in keep doing it
for a second I get this like maybe three
strands but it's not Sheni at all back
find that kind of weird could use it all
curly hair would be shedding but
even when I bleached the tips the hair
did not dry out and get weird usually
when I bleach hair annual Ritson that's
what makes the most shedding but just
wanting to do that all so I like
literally have nothing sexy about this
hair and whatsoever like I literally
can't do everything that um it's super
super super bouncy and super flexible I
just really really like it I'll be
messing back to say at all like and I'm
be cooler honestly I mean I'm never
going to say so unless you have watched
the video where I'll shine back in emit
in you know and talk a little more but I
like this here I would totally totally
recommend it um now all about this I
don't know if I'll recommend everything
or hair textures I haven't tried it but
hopefully um I could work with them
again to try Morgan here because after
experiencing this curling hair I really
imaged it and try and move your hair my
voice sounds really weird because it's
like we're in the morning I've been up
since this morning I haven't slept I
can't sleep I don't know why I'm going
to tell scream so I can't sleep and I'm
not going to sleep but I hope it under
this video I've been talking and you
should working with thumbs up if you
liked it please subscribe if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys later
alright so I'm still recording holding
the camera because I looking at a piece
to my tripod but for some reason I kind
of like I like to style a video I don't
know like I feel like I'm behind the
scenes and I don't know I like it
anyways um I'm going to be dying this
hair from is C hair I hope I'm
pronouncing it right I got there sent to
me I mean I've been loving curly hair
lately and I want to bleach the hair to
see if these curls will still be intact
or bleaching it because I'm assured that
the curls you got to see that it's very
very very very very cruelly and I just
want s to see if some the Costain tech
so I'm going to open a box of God I do
this one hand is like crazy okay one sec
okay we
do it oh god you're doing it happening
okay you know what I'll do this buh-bam
all right so they send me two boxes by
re-opened on one of them this box it
comes what they seem a little techniques
sponge is cute now I will say that I am
Not sure that the order from the hair
you would get a sponge
I'm that's a disclosure because when I
did another review for another hair
company and they sent me a gift a lot
more comedy in saying that when they
order some company they didn't get gifts
so I just wanna let you guys know that
I'm you may not get the gift I don't
want to like you know me yes me females
so I really really really like the
packaging of this hair because being
that I get sent a lot of hair I get to
see how everyone packages their hair
some company just ended just straight in
the bag they don't have any labels no
nothing not to figure out okay who is
just from like I get things out of hair
you have to label your hair for me to
know what's from but three and whenever
I'm working with a company typically
like what I like Aliexpress brands or
just like a cheaper brand whatever they
have their own labels and everything
hooked up it automatically turns me on
because I realized they're more
established and they've been doing this
long the other companies some of the
companies they really do not have any
labels or anything I just feel like when
the company has all this hooked up I
just feel like it looks good okay so
let's go over the label so it's kinky
curly this is 22 inches this is 22
inches hair color 1b it shows the
production date which is April 11
thousand 17 everything that's cool
I'm gonna open the back comes in a
little dip lock bag oh I use my mouse or
actually I'm a girl but it's very open
you know this month all right so let's
skinny focus here's the hair I'm going
to I'm actually use my phone to put on
flash you can see the actual definition
of curl because not pick up on camera
but it comes with a tag with their
company name and you see how I haven't
sleeve a little plastic thing come on
gimme focus now I think this is really
for some images stands out to me because
not all hair companies take the time to
really label
stuff and it comes with a little thing
the outsides are labeled so this
company's really like cool okay so I
mean my phone and put the flash on so
you guys can see the actual curl
definition you guys see that I like to
review like that oh my god I don't know
why I really like the style review but
it has very very very very tight curls
I'm gonna good other bundle that I had
around my fingers to see I see even more
you guys see how tight the curls are
extremely tight and so I'm curious to
see if they are still there after I
bleached them and I honestly just want
to wear this hair I already know I have
other curly hair but this one's kind of
shorter and it's more tighter and I just
I want variety here's the front totally
also into frontal so they sent four
bundles and a frontal gonna shine a
light on that again just let see the
definition of the curls it's super duper
duper curly I say differential here
already has baby air on it so I'm just
going to have to bleach the knobs and
hopefully I'll have to customize it too
much but right now it is currently 2:35
in the morning actually and I'm just not
tired and so I'm going to be up just
dying this hair I honestly I want to put
a lot of effort into this wig because I
have a bit feeling about it and I have a
good feeling that the curls and I stay
there after the bleach so I thought I'm
going to like it so I'm gonna go bleach
it I'm not going to court that process
well okay I guess I'll record myself
doing one bundle it's not a big deal it
just I'm gonna put bleaching I'm not
going to do anything special so I'm
gonna go set the bleach up and I'll be
right back okay so I have my bleach
mixture right here and I'm going to just
bleach the tips because I want to
Umbreon fast so hard some without a
tripod so I'm just going to focus this
on the tips this will be so hard
but what yeah I'm doing I can't do
pulling the camera it's so hard but I'm
just putting the bleach towards the tips
I don't wanna be sold things because I
want to on the effect so I'm just going
to let the hammer down and I'm just
going to slaughter the change is very
simple this is something anyone could do
you just miss mix the bleach in the
powder and you just put it on the tips
and then I'm going to rinse it out and
see if it holds the coast alright so I'm
back and I think so lighting my Rose
I've changed ISO on my camera but I'm
pretty much the cold state impact now
I'm noticing that I'm sure my
flashlights anyways I guess you really
see the Kerr texture on the frontal is
different actual bundles but the hair is
so soft you guys like and shockingly
enough when I was renting out the bleach
I didn't really get any shedding like at
all and the ends are still very nice and
I'll dry sauna breast but I'm bored with
this color so the other day I went and I
bought some hair dye and I happened to
buy this like aquamarine color and so I
don't know I want to Coachella tomorrow
and I think it'd look cool if I you know
put blue so I mix aquamarine in the
cinema color I'm not sure why I mixed it
with the cinnamon color I just I don't
know like I just thought that it may do
something cool I'm not sure and you know
what because I have all this dye
honestly I just have too much hair I
just get so bored that I just left
mixing stuff to see what I come up with
so I'm going to mix this fuchsia color
inside too just to see if it does
anything cool and you know if it does
then you guys how colored I need to make
with the $3 just mixed so I mean I know
the majority of it will be that um blue
color but hey it may come out a really
cool blue purple I don't know I just I
want to play so that's I'm going to do
so let's mix it now of course because
the bundles
they're technically yellow in the
haircolor world you know they're not
toned that
is not going to show up exactly that
color um the yellowness of the bundles
may alter that color
but let's go try anyway so I'm going to
go I'm going to draw the bundles a
little bit so the color can pinch with
the hair a little bit better and then
I'll show you guys putting in the color
cuz I should be easy
um yeah should be easy so I'll be
alright so I put some gloves on already
have a hair dyed mixed like I said I
mixed twice damn noise right now is 3:00
in the morning
I mixed aquamarine cinnamon and Fiesta
fuchsia so very very weird mix but I got
this like almost like an indigo color so
we go and see how this comes out it
should be easy I'm only gonna show
myself doing one bundle so I'm able to
like do both on both hands base it a
color I got a house on this may be
really pretty neat we might just do
something here oh oh okay so yeah this
is pretty okay Omar on I didn't know
that was gonna happen so I'm gonna go
I'm going to just put the dye and the
rest of the bundle so I can make this a
quick process then I'm going to make a
quick wig and then I'm going to show you
guys how it looks like alright so I went
and made the wig a little ki hai ki
obsessed you guys so cute okay so once I
style this y'all define the curls are
this is beautiful to me well they're
simple springy and other side is not and
once I have prompted those sides not so
as you see okay you want how to sort on
but in the bottom grow hair boobs
whatever quick so this bike I get
smaller well I'm completely bored I'm so
we're becoming scratched up wherever you
guys increases work it anyway um this
side a little longer when it has pumpkin
it goes all the way down to my belly and
then side does not okay if you guys see
what the color is you guys did a color
more the dry side when the hair is wet
you can't really see the color I put
into it but nevertheless um I have to
say okay I mean I'm going to put profit
in while I'm talking so this video is
make it loan I'm using my ultra defining
gel
Beauty girls I have to say that I can't
I don't want to say just yet because I
haven't wore this wig for long enough
but I I want to say god I know how I am
this is probably my favorite curling was
that I have only because the hair
texture really was nice and I'm going to
show you guys why I'm a compared to
another wig I'm another curly wig that I
have just so you guys can see the
difference and see the different curl
patterns because when coming in to reach
out to me I've been specifically asking
for curly hair expecting like curly hair
and rigid for spring/summer time I know
it's pretty popular so I miss you guys
one sec one second before I sell this
scientists regard the curly wig ahead my
other videos just singing to the
difference in the curl pattern
I don't know degree really noisy but
this is curly and this is kinky curly so
these clothes are way more defined and
also these curls do something that these
codes not because a beautiful I love
this wave quick I had on earlier when I
want to dinner and I literally just
threw it on and I didn't do anything to
it I was on this way but I like these
clothes a little more because when I
twist the color on my finger like this
it does that like it's very easy to find
the curls whereas with that wig I
actually try to do it with that and it
didn't do that and I've been wanting to
find some curly hair that does this
Krabs really like how to look that's
like that make you look strong tore
natural I just I really like her look I
follow this one girl Instagram I do not
prefer me my notes naturally something
I'm hoping chat or tea or chain she
makes a really good curly hair tutorial
in her hair the beautiful she was really
really nice beautiful natural hair okay
so like her but she does he's like
senior coil but I didn't want to do it
but of course my hair is no long enough
so I can lay out handy to find curly
hair that does that and then only did it
not elope I'm doing these right so I'm
to get Sookie bouncy these curls are
this hair super-duper-duper lightweight
I love it so much
like it's really really nice but I just
really like it so um yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
I'm sorry I wasn't able to dye the hair
like a usually diet my tripod like oh I
don't even want to piece of that it's a
piece like my trap a bit I have to type
off of one for filming like this and
make a videos and one for doing hair
videos to get different angle but um I
won't for different angle a piece is
missing so I can't just my camera so I
can't do my hair videos if I use it
won't do them so I have to hold the
camera it's kind of difficult I kind of
like it that style I don't know if do
