a pretty review but I'm going to the
students if Linda evident in unit 4 so
it should be interesting now let's go
stick to it because I thought this
review I want you to prolong anyway so
this is to it so this hair revenue loss
is from I'm standing up from a move
because I love energy I don't know why I
need to do but this hair is from her
given hair now it comes in box on its
second anniversary on it so it's tricky
because I love this box and strictly for
anniversary or if this is how you get
all the hair I really don't know but it
comes really nice I like when companies
have like Primos nice packaging is ill
with turns me on
ernõ comical use companies in your hair
little classic gothic your big tangle
your hair so I like the box and then you
open it if I kind of keep because it
really shows the history when they
started to the 15 and a little timeline
I think it's really cute they like
comments with arms that the back move
off to shows your Facebook Instagram
YouTube in your sweat chat
now inside the box you get your hair and
I'm wearing the hair so that's what's to
know the book you also get this little
pamphlet edge it shows you the girls
wearing the hair Michele like pretty
much steps on how to wash the hair how
to fill your West little pictures and
then it shows you the piece art school
let me do that it brings to the app
installation I'm tells you daily
maintenance wash the extensions they use
Washington once over two weeks I never
did every right where it says about
coloring
how are you shedding it also shows you
it also tells you to co wash the hair
cuz I am looking down you guys I'm we're
breeding the cortisone with the side
it's just a co-wash before installation
which anybody
I don't know co-wash knees what is neat
but it's pretty descent for the curly
hair is this blue key
they tell you that so it pretty much
it's recommended hair products is that
these are personal repetitions from our
experience with the hair you may find
that other products for pedigree so for
curly hair and I'll just go over curly
hair I'm not a reasonable tire list but
I have curly hair
it says they recommend the Shea Moisture
raw shea butter deep to the neck then
Mindy for one brush or d9 brush drip
break check I guess for the two
silhouettes key curly knot today a new
conditioner both bi8 natural hair care
curl enhancing custard for that daily
maintenance it pretty much shows you
like the cross to you before you install
it while you have installed and when
you're washing it so sister wash did use
the Shea Moisture raw shea butter
moisture retention shampoo so I don't
know either side cute that they tell you
the processing that works best for the
hair type now I have a little card that
pretty much shows me exactly what I have
are going to have my memory of the card
just showed you some more structures the
texture I have opposite curly now on
their site they go by you guys know when
they have like the 3c4 see those oh my
gosh blind bit of my hello bed
sorry I let this fly came in he just
loves his work anyways understand
Freeman shows you to give type of hair
textures like 3b 3c which wasn't period
and the other is bean seeds I really I
don't know what those mean and also the
pictures I don't know what my a
pedestrian's I'm assuming I'm probably
be a greasy because my hair's kind of
like curling like this I'm not sure I'm
going to guys tell me but this hair is
freebie through see now I got a lace
closure now this is on a frontal which I
wish I went out front - like I said that
frontal some case I wanted to look 10 to
15 days to process and so I peasants in
the enclosure and a half three bundles
this hair did come 22 inches long and
the closure was 20 inches however I cut
it as these often uh tranches and I wish
I could show you guys what the 20 inch
looks like however I used all the hair
like and it was in the left piece I used
elbows right now at full traction backs
as the front in order to make this work
because I told about hair
so if there is I'm along with 20 nations
are long with 18 usually the idea for
bundles to be used in a close you and if
using a frontal three bundles will work
but because the coal you come cover much
space you have to you have to get more
bundles this is how it works alright so
before I feel I'm ending to my review
and I want you guys to tell me how you
guys like this because I want to make
very more forward and more helpful
so I do this let me know if you guys
like it before let me give you some that
could appear on this hair now I just
leave this with today so of course I
don't have a super elaborate you know
review however this hair is beautiful in
the video so Melissa I claim that was
this other company have a favorite curly
hair I kind of worked it the line now
I'm having this hair all the pearl
powder is different maybe I'll finish my
favorite like tight curl hair I don't
know but it's not that this hair looks
so natural just so nice is fluffy its
soft and move I know that that seems
like just normal but some crow hair a
good stiff and so I love this hair I
have nothing but babe on it now did
comment matching hair texture texture
color and I did diet and I have the
boxes sorry I have to box I have free
with the colors I use right here I edit
fill me because I erase him from the
Dinah tear blonde I just read the Diaz
walk tutorial so I thought that would
make no sense to do another one and so
when I dyed my hair I didn't send my
camera to film or anything and so when I
change the color I was prepared that's
why I didn't feel it but it's really
simple all I did when the X aggressive
weeks when I used to show you guys
because I use a different bleach than I
usually use so first I push the hair
with this odd bleach and developer so I
first remember using this and I think
they work so good obviously using like
quick grow bw2
but I'm tired of using them because I
just let they're cheap and I don't think
senator that's the best and so on
Streisand is more professional see Mike
I just read both and I definitely did
because when I was his hair is lifted so
bad almost too fast for me
like literally I want they three five
minutes it was already lit to a blonde I
know I know from back when I kept them
longer across it again I kind of got
this heavy platinum with it so although
I forgot
price of these there on valleys there
little more since in the VW 2 however
it's better quality so you get a better
result but it was definitely worth the
price drops off long runs into my next
bike hair dime tutorial some is like key
buying these down I like them so we're
ideally I pretty much leave the hair
that across this foil but it lives for
three five minutes rinsed it out and
then I put these Wellard dyes on top now
the main column using is the wellas
caramel or caramel whatever you prefer
it's 7w and so i put design there you
have to mix like a ten dollar developer
and I put this dye and enter the main
color you see and then I added some of
this off by five W R and I don't want my
vinyl pick up on it I know when I filmed
earlier in my lid room you can take a
lot if I'm not sure how my studio like
to pick up on it but you can see it in
the real life but the main colors that
you grow are used to be like this color
is the caramel color perhaps with the
main color are used and so I used to box
of that I used to lots of each so for
box in total at each box I want to look
for 99 $5.99 so what six times more like
$24 on hair dyes but I realize this
color isolated like a perfect kind of
natural color this wig I can really take
off right now and put it on and it looks
so natural like it's going to be a very
easy
nice throw on wig oh god wait leaves a
little bit it's a musical really nice
thrown wig if it's a perfect natural
color that that will literally go with
anything so I like the hanger have no
complaints on it so far so let me do
what I said I was going to do so I never
talk about price in my videos and I
thought about it I'm just like why do I
do that and here's why well wax with a
particular reason I just never think to
actually look only because a lot of
times I work with the use from
Aliexpress and I have already have ideas
how much L Express coughing to shop
there a lot before I started you know
doing this in a job and the other
company I should never thought to let me
look at the prices that's out okay you
know I start doing this on my reviews
work for maybe like a Colette you guys
know is it worth the price and so why
would you is
I'm the Gorgas site I'm going to ask
without boring and Sam deck thing that I
have in my hair right now and I'm going
to see the price and unless you guys
know about biggest fourth best price so
this beauty all right let's see
all right so I'm excited and I I look at
xx closure which is what they did me
there xx clothes cost $129 now in my
purse append that's pretty pricey for a
closure usually you expect Munsell to be
that price up closer you get less hair
so I hunt rant about foreclosure that's
pretty pricey my opinion I do know that
their hair is better quality than most
company that I worked with personally
like um I've had a lot of curly hair
before and usually when you bleach or
that color hair it it is not say this
pattern and this actually has no product
in it whatsoever so the hair is coming
my soft and fluffy was absolutely no
product I didn't put any profit because
I want to see how it work after I
bleached and everything so this is no
product so there curly hair is a better
quality hair than other companies so
maybe that's why the charge of Hunter
not all for a closure I don't make the
prices I'm just telling you guys that's
what you're charging so for our 22 inch
bundle it's correct
it is saying that for a 22 inch bundle
is $169 which is a lot for 22 inch
bundles for one singular bundle that's
$170 and so if I want my three bundles
which that works but I know for a fact
after maintenance wig if I want 22
inches ebony of these four bundles I'd
definitely ran out of my bundles you
know with the hair I have to make it
work
if I want three bundle that's five
hundred seven dollars but really
listening speaking of the it's going to
knit any four bundles so that's going to
be six hundred sixty nine dollars so we
have six hundred sixty nine dollars i
hoping to the restaurant plus $129 669
plus 129 so we are at seven hundred
ninety eight dollars to get exactly what
I have my head do I think it's worth
that price that's the real question
alright let's be real here okay I think
that's funny money so look a lot okay
and that's my eye on my hair I had an
extra bundle because real existed you're
good anymore three bundles
trust me on this right now because
they're western Seema Weston and you
can't split the
check and make the hair sprint so I try
to split the traffic there and spray to
get more out of three bundles it's justa
less you can't flick a trap and so you
have to buy four bundles if you want 22
inches now let's say you want this lint
which I'm assuming is about 14 to 12
inches let's see the cost of that so
maybe you like this list that I have so
let's say like 14 inches a 14 inch
bundle is $119 so say I think we're
fortunate bundle you maybe need two
bundles but the pieces playspace
get three it has two bundles emphasis on
the titles they gave me two bundles but
you need more if you want performance so
they get three 14-inch bundles that will
cost us let's see 357 select 357 let's
not forget the closure as 357 plus 129
that's for $86 so roughly five hundred
dollars alright so that's another price
so eight hundred dollars for three 22
inch bundles plus a 20 inch closure and
that's not including shipping do I think
it's worth that come okay compare now
how to try it every curly hair in this
Under the Sun so this is one of the best
curly hair like bundle whether we hear
about curly hair me that I've tried
since reviewing hair and I've been doing
this for like I'm 22 in those four years
from where we for longer and so in my
opinion I think the hair is great
quality I think that if you want to
invest in have hair is gonna last you a
long time I would say yes it worked
however to be fair only reward for a day
so I don't know how long it's gonna last
I would like to say that dentist working
a job because I would like to assume
this hair gonna last
based on acting right now there's no
doubt in mine that's gonna last a long
time but I cannot say with certainty
that it's going to last you what a year
six months to a year I can't say that i
can assume if I can't say it
I do say and you go on to paint at $800
it doesn't last long because my fault
that you use your money you don't need
and so as far as being worth $100 it's
really if you have a funds to do so if
you have the funds to buy it I would say
go for it I like I like the hair and you
guys I don't know just tell you guys how
nice the hair looks you I can see it if
you only looks my storytelling we don't
hurt myself and it looks great but I
think it looks nothing it feel guys you
guys can see that as a video you can see
the quality of the hair so these if you
have them I do so invest and get good
quality hair that's on you when I on use
on me but you don't trust me I tell you
tell your wallet now do I think that to
tape on and off for 14-inch bundles to
get a similar buzzes do I think that for
bit yes I think it still works
definitely the I would I would pay for
it I don't know about paid $800 like I
haven't borrowed cheap and I believe
alike so anyway like that and I'm very
picky in the hair going to have to last
me year for me to spend no much money
but that's just me but from finally
drawers if I want to get a similar look
to this I don't totally I want anything
twice I will purchase this hair I would
have to persist hair I actually when I
really want to fight I would love to see
if they have full lace wigs because I
would I want the first one because I
like to pair texture a lot I think this
will look great with the full list wig I
wish they have sparkles on their side
because I would love to purchase a hair
print with this hair texture but shorter
with a frontal it looks beautiful
and so do I think that it's worth $500
yes but in Hong Kong is a lot as an
investment and that's sometimes you
really have to you know what are the
reviews because end of the day everyone
gets different hair with these hair
coming someone trying to do same
bloggers better hair but sometimes they
just sit in my hair they spin and you
may not get the best hair I work with
companies for like three years at a time
and some of the hair was great my little
bad and I mean I would work with it for
a year so it's like they can't always
control how the hair is max what gets to
your hands cuz I believe - one coming I
work and I won't get their name I
respected its brand by working in for
like two years so I think I was great
minds just wasn't able to save that
company so it really depends so if you
want an aversive spent $1 a 22-inch
bundles
go for however
there's always a risk when orders from
any company there's always risk okay
what you say there's always it was you
you just never know I would participate
five minutes in cause that's a lot and I
mean that's the decision is your
religion to think about if you want long
hair I think that if you got short like
this Posse will look great up into
looking a little more natural I look to
a preferred super long hair so if you
want that there's kind of been a little
more but I worked like this and I think
it's totally worth $500 that's my
personal opinion I would totally buy it
better to me so with that being said I'm
going to do an update review because
this hair is not cheap and I apologize
for my previous videos where I didn't go
over the price and everything I feel
like that this one that should have been
doing cuz I'll get more health warrants
more informative let you know what you
get into a week from now on to do
another review and I'll even make a
whole separate video are aware that's
living the video we'll talk about in the
video or I'll leave a comment down below
I'll find a way to update you guys on
the terriblest you guys know if I still
believe is worth the price at this
current moment I do think for the price
I think it's hella nice and I was really
hoping here cuz you no problem either
this assume it won't but I'm so my money
on art the fact that it won't but in a
week is if they does any problems you
guys will know that and if it doesn't
even problem you guys one of that so I
mean I'll stay holed up only because
this isn't Aliexpress hair this is like
expensive good quality hair it's more of
an investment an express you can buy a
three curly bundles and a frontally
between like $200 or it would mean a
little more but this is an investment
it's a lot of money so I personally
would suggest this way let me give up
the review to see how it acts and then
you know if I give it a go then I was
twenty recommended Terrance's de Rivoli
nice and I really really loved it a lot
so that's my review I really hope it was
informative I'm trying to come just more
helpful with these because I understand
the people restrain their hard-earned
money and so they need to know what's
the best thing to buy and what not to
buy so if you found this informative and
you find it helpful give it a thumbs up
and please subscribe your station from a
