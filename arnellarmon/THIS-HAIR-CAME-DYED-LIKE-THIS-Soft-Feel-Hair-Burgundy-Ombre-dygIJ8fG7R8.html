phone silent so I'll get frickin
distracted all right hey guys look back
so I'm doing my mood room because I want
to do in front of my balcony I've had
natural eyes because you asked our hair
color I have I guess it's because it was
television my video so in this lab you
can see an actual color so let's just
talk about it um I just it's like I'm
used to doing videos or doing more
repair but this hair training guide like
this so I was going to do like I'm gonna
talk and let you guys know where I speak
um and I deal with color to match the
hair because I'm like I don't want to do
it for me nude little anyways this hair
some soft feel hair I know HD means that
I'm pretty sure that means that their
hair so soft
I'm assuming they fix me four bundles
and a culture out insertable video and
this is the bundle to see it not die
security touches you gotta bundle cane
now I never have to hair those guys
before I've been sitting like on red
level of where they come on grade but
never like an actual color the other
part of the pair least in this picture
will look like is sometimes you guys
know that her hair never looks like wool
a lot of times the hair will would
levels in a picture so I was kind of
like nervous I was like you know I just
send me that because the cameras closes
I never dive at the most companies when
they have a third hair color bundle we
don't have an enclosure cut color
I don't know why like I guess an Auburn
bundles I also did it closer by myself
because they don't have like ombre
closure or frontal I'm not sure like the
power and so when I got in the mail
which is like three to four days ago um
I was like oh she could look really
really nice and so I made the wig and I
will say there's one thing I don't like
and I'll explain that the color itself
is replete I see that it's beautiful and
they said let me do red hair dye
tutorial but it's like this red so news
we might as well just so pissed
it's like
perfectly done for you you save time and
save money cuz buying hair dye is
exquisite I spend so much when I'm near
die and I kind of addiction the bogus a
leader anyways I kind of stopped some
stupid trains going by obviously like I
can't eat already
if you in this it's quite over here but
it's not quite enough with the train is
literally killing time
anyways that is hair so I really have no
complaint
um I didn't have to do much the closure
all I have to do is switch the knobs and
that's just my personal preference I
have a video that already edited stuff I
was looking to post it before at this
video but I explained why it's just
honestly my solution ups because I have
butchered this one closure I have from
this hair coming out of your life and I
like to fluff it instead of finishing it
and I want to bleach it Nell Falls now
to be on her fix that and so just least
enough but it takes its annoyed doing it
because it's like a rule it's not his
technique I mean you could easily mess
with the closure because I sometimes of
you do the bluish makes you look thin or
runny it gets through unless mixture
like roots blonde is annoying but I'm
being better eyes so once I suspect my
technique I make a video for you guys
I'm always going to recommend she sleeps
and knocks it looks much better than his
 alone I'm telling you I promise
you looks much better and still off to
do we just bleach my mouth and then I
like total foundation powders on the
part to make it match my forehead and I
did like a little baby here and that
pretty much I have to do in order to
style this wig the hair did come in a
body or texture but I didn't want to be
boring and I couldn't live like that I'm
like I have to go into it and so I have
some layers in the front but I didn't
build that I'm using like Abbas's and I
didn't want your knee by the Angels
usual and so I cut um why am I doing
this I cut in the front and I just did
one big curls and you slide my boss and
I'm backing up this now is the only
negative thing is that the offer is
almost too perfect and it's not only for
you know what I mean
okay so armor a colleagues
bliss seamlessly and when you
my hair you're never told to just put
the dye I'm gonna guys you never
school just straight across you want to
bring it up a Travel section of the hair
just so much seen with you know I mean
now of course I'm gonna I'm assuming
that they don't have professional hair
dryers but for the company expecting to
like not many people are professional
dying hair I know I'm not I just like
learn over time but the old italic say
is that I feel less with their bundles
but ombre or the color has been brought
up a little bit more because I still
hate the context or the color straight
across it looks good a picture when you
put the weight together you can see
where it's kinda wet and you could see
exactly where the color stops that's the
one thing that I would say I don't like
some of these lenses that it looks great
before you touch them before you put all
together who want to do you can see with
messed up and that's why I do a lot of
big curls
how does I cover that of this way to get
around that but I mean I'm free if you
want to go back in and kind of like I
wouldn't recommend any more red going to
take more time for going to bleach it in
a diet what you can do is feel like a
light black hair guide and cover some of
the pieces or just do little streaks
that way it looks more polluted than
this looks right now if all of that best
bother me by the Terry Harris on the
soffit elevate the colors beautiful by
envision that ombre it could be a little
bit better but I don't think I mean I
almost we change our faces when we don't
change that I'll show you guys the back
of the hater look dude it's not a pretty
inspiring house in a little bit it's
very cool all way down to the bottom
like fat so it's really nice very low E
yeah
brunette hair I just ordered I could say
is that whatever took on ombre when it's
not necessary number is just hair by I
just wish that risotto especially
birthday he can't and they're doing like
multiple bundles of time so can you
really accept Britain's like go through
each individual bundle really like guy
chain that no it's nothing happened
so yeah we're gonna scare um whatever
ignored you I don't have much as thing I
feel really bad
can I say more but then it's like it
makes me happy cuz it makes my job
easier if I don't have seen anything bad
they're very nice very into the work
with not all just left shots a brand I
like dealing with people who have a good
customer services spoke up skills
um it's like it's a reflection of the
brand most of time I've noticed that
when a company was the person who liked
emailing that the fourth is really nice
professional that's right into my
reputation versus somewhere I work with
they come in like Doberman spawns and
they have issues of their customers so I
been texting actually almost a square
things called and so we've been like
correspond through that and they're very
nice very professional very easygoing
they shouldn't be here very very fast as
far as electricals
I feel like the lunch is nice but same
time did you tell the lobster more with
the hair is darker you can see the shine
on it more feminine and you can see more
the luster of the dark private hair but
Natalie I mean you can speed in the rid
of at the same time ever you can see the
lustrous shine warm with hair darker
bitch is my personal opinion on who
might notice but yeah the hair doesn't
field in Lebanon I guess another
business is getting hair that's our
guide for you using a new condition do
if they do to make a boat of course
there has been joyous bundle so the
heretics programming at all what would
it bother me to embrace so what you can
do to you know avoid is looking like so
like alright but die I'm just going to
flip it over con decide to look a little
messy but it will distracting the fact
that it's not super seamless you guys
see what it did like I'm trying to
distract them that back but um yeah that
my reviews they're looking for living
room let me know I actually like it in
your business any chair it's really fun
and like the lighting to show the color
more so you guys gonna better be able to
look like but you guys want me to review
um you know more bundles or hair that
comes pre-dive like I mean bright bold
colors whether it's human hair
Medicare neck I know and I'll do that
and a enjoyed this video please give a
thumbs up and subscribe all the hair
details will be down below like always
um I kind of want to do a video with his
hair again try to turn it purple or blue
just as I feel life I want
the pair has more versatility like a
fourth and grander than this color but
people have to change their hair and red
is a very hard color to get out and so I
select with this hair because are you
the red family I feel it'd be very easy
to turn it purple or blue or another
fold color best well then let me know in
their duty ways but if you would want to
video on it let me know and I'll do it
I didn't know that you know red nice did
you have to shut up you want to give
change the hair once you buy it so limit
if I want mine are recorded but I'm done
talking areas often some of you guys go

mean I work companies and they need a
lot of times being that pressure being
stressed now like words video where the

to like put you know I'm going to give
