just don't have idea what I'm doing I'm
gonna add more however I'm just I'm I'm
gonna do the basics of my eyes first and
then do my face and go back to the eyes
and so I'm zoomed in so you see
everything I got a few comments saying
that it's better if I'm like up close so
let's do that so first I'm going to take
this Urban Decay concealer and I'm use
that to prime my lids it puts on the
back of my hand and then I'm going to
take this BH Cosmetics 139 brush it's
kind of a flat fluffy brush and I'm
gonna use that to blend concealer all
over my eye basically not just my lid
like up into my brow I learned I want to
do that I just get a better base so I'm
just gonna blend that all over like this
all right so for eyeshadow I'm taking at
the Hugh Tibet Hooda Beauty rose gold
palette it's actually pretty just on the
male's I decide to use it so I'm gonna
take this color first and so typically
speaking and so I'm you should start
with a lighter shade first but if you
remember if you will if you've watched
my promised tutorial it's kind of hard
for colors to the blend and stick on my
lid and so I noticed that it kept
happening and I was doing the same thing
so I decided to try something different
and so now actually start off with a
darker color first and then I kind of
like blend and diffuse that kind of make
it look smoked out cuz that just works
for me and so if you have a issue with
your shadows blending on your lid try
dark color first I'm gonna do a
wholesome your video on this to kind of
teach you guys we're talking about but
that is what I'm gonna do in this video
and I'm going to take my morphe in b23
brush stuck with my favorite brush to
blend with I'm gonna take that and just
first want to press it on and it looks
crazy at first but then when you like
really blend in the buff it out it looks
good and I'm kind of like buffing like
in windshield wiper motions and I kind
of like go like a little circular - so
you should I really blend that all of my
eye
so now I'm gonna take this shade Oh
mm to the cheek hot cocoa which is like
a darker brown color and I'm gonna take
this Laura Mercier brush this is the
finishing ponytail brush it's pretty
much like a tapered blending brush or
buffing brush I'm gonna place that on my
outer crease area just kind of deepen
that I'm gonna mix it with a little bit
of hint of too so it doesn't come off in
too dark so I'm more control over the
color and I'm gonna go back over that
with my morphe 23 brush just to make
sure it's all blended out all right so
now I take this Bare Minerals bear skin
concealer I just use concealer a versus
like my ridiculous it's more lightweight
so it's less like how do I put it I want
my lid I don't want too much glue on my
lid because that's how start to crease
I'm like kind of crumble so I'm gonna
use this and I'm gonna take this morphe
r43 brush it focus here it goes like a
little small flat head brush and it fits
perfectly into my lid and I'm just going
to take that and kind of carve out my
whole entire lid and I'm taking this
more feet in 3:30 brush and take the
shade henna
and come and make sure that the outside
is blended before I put the shimmer on
top and kind of set that concealer now
I'm going to take these shades pink
diamond which is like a creamy
consistency and I'm going to put that
all over our place a concealer and then
to set it in place I'm taking the shade
of moon dust
I'm going back to that lunar sea brush
and I'm going to like play some shadow
at the end just to make it flow better
essentially and deepen that color a
little bit now I'm gonna put my lashes
on there very natural but very like
lightweight but I feel like they do just
enough and so I'm gonna put some mascara
on first and use my Mac golden bat lash
and I'm going to just put a light coat
of mascara on the first four lashes of
Tina's lashed by kiss these are the kiss
blowout lashing the style bouffant to
goof off today I'm so fancy right and I
kept the piece that I cut from the first
lash to measure it and I just place that
on top of this lash it's kind of hard to
show up in don't worry I'll like to show
this when I do like that a dedicated
last tutorial but I just placed that
same piece on top of where it lands with
other lash and I cut it at the exact
mark then I cut them Ashley's nail
clippers cuz it snips it very easily
just go and it snips it right off for
last food I'm taking this one buckle or
lashes I love this latch though I feel I
can last all day long for graduations or
special events I would pick a strong
lash glue I know a lot of use duo and
dill it's okay but obviously there's
better lashes out there which is why the
other wife she was caught last year last
glues which is why they cost more I
click on the lashes on the lashes do
kind of wet only because it gives me
more time to move them around and you
know put them in please if they're new
lashes if they're laughs safari ward
don't have to do that I could let it be
tacky and I know exactly where I'm going
to place them
but for new lashes that I'm not sure how
they're gonna fit my eyes afraid my eyes
I like to place my eyes water still a
little wet that way I can kind of really
make them warm to my eyes I want them so
these flare up a little bit so I like to
kind of like hold them down so that way
they're not too flared up so they just
come from my eye shape a little more and
then once they're completely dry I'm
going to take my fingers and press them
together but I'm not gonna just yet I
don't want to move them or like mess
them up someone let them dry and work on
the rest of my face
okay so don't add the eyebrows camera I
almost forgot about it I like zoomed out
let's okay anyway eyebrows done um I
didn't think it was necessary doing this
video because that's not what the videos
about but I did use a new Kat Von D 24
hour super brow I like how it works see
because want me to review this product
on my channel I don't mind doing it I
personally like it it's really creamy
very easy to use my brows are my
favorite but if I want to pick some I'll
just do it when I'm gonna do the makeup
too so for a primer first we take my
Finn T Beauty primer which if you watch
my videos you probably could have
guessed that uh
I'm a garden light and brighter than the
one I'm used to so I'm having a hard
time figuring out how to like control
that light and make my videos bright you
could probably see it it's a ring light
so you can see the little circles yeah
I'm trying to figure that out but I'm
gonna rub this pretty much like on my
cheeks and forehead right and a little
bit on my nose and then I'm actually
take this NARS pour in shine control
primer and I am going to get a little
bit of that and I'm gonna rub that in my
kind of my t-zone area but meaning like
a lower tea I only need it right here
because I don't get oily so I'm gonna
like mainly focus on my nose and using
that because like for a graduation think
about it why me like I've only graduated
high school I didn't graduate college
I'll explain that into this video but um
there's a lot of lights I know it is
wolf or mine memory it was a lot flash
you're gonna be sweating you know
depends on where you're at I mean I just
left the graduation up in Arizona so man
I would've hated my makeup out there but
basically you want to make sure that you
don't get oily which is a big
possibility so I'm gonna use it time and
really focus it on the area that I
typically oily in and really massage
into that area to really control that
oil and to minimize the pores i have so
i do have poison on my nose although you
guys can't let you see them and i mean i
do a good job pasting them in pictures
and okay they're small but they're there
so foundation priority know this cuz i
really can't do a video without using
NARS I mean use my NARS sheer glow
foundation in the shade Tahoe and I'm
going to just pork
Oh what kind of poured a lot whatever
I'm gonna take this black beauty one
there and I'm just going to blend that
all over my skin like I usually do
so after I get the majority working my
sponge I've actually do something
different lately I'm gonna take this
flat kabuki brush by Sigma it's the f80
and I'm just gonna blend the foundation
over again with a brush I notice that
that busts into my skin just a little
more makes it look more natural I mean
it already looks natural but I feel like
ever started doing this if I make a last
one it really gets in there and it just
gives a really nice flawless finish so
I'm just gonna buff that I don't know if
you saw the difference but it looks
really good alright so now to conceal
this is your graduation you spend hours
in school you're tired you have eye bags
you want to very heavy duty concealers
so I'm gonna use this Kevyn Aucoin
central skin enhancer it's super thick
now you don't have to use this I just
want to give an option because you know
you're probably tired you know when you
conceal it wakes you up and see you in a
really nice concealer other options I
can recommend I would recommend
heart-shaped tape tarts uncancelled for
me if you guys haven't known cuz
ethanoate have good products so that's a
really good concealer and then the Urban
Decay I'm Northcott it's the all nighter
concealer this is a really great
concealer so I'm gonna grab some this
concealer with a sigma blending e 25
brush and I'm just gonna Pat a very
little amount you this is honestly like
it lasts so long and I'm going to
actually mix concealers just for shade
reasons because this is pretty light and
this is s x06
and I do have s x08 which is a shade
darker
however the undertones are different so
when I try to do this I thought I'll get
different results but it doesn't really
flatter my under eyes
I'm going to put some of this urban cake
up so on top just to balance out the
color so it's not too bright why do want
the thickness and the coverage of the
chemical on concealer so and I typically
um highlight my chin area but I've been
noticing I might do that based on how I
blinged it out I always end up blending
it out a little bit too underneath here
and it leaves a white cast on my chin so
I'm cancelling that for my routine never
take this morphe blending brush and I'm
just gonna blend the concealer and I'm
gonna take my time on it because you are
very like thick and creamy concealers
and I want to be really blended out so
it doesn't increase who I live for
bright under eye I don't know why oh
that rhymed but I love it
I'll show you guys a way to kind of tone
it down so it's not too bright although
you have to factor in if you want a
bright under eye it's cool to go very
bright with concealer because once you
set it with powder it's gonna tone it
down
regardless so if you want to keep it
this bright don't do what I'm gonna do
after this but you don't want it that
bright then keep watching concealing is
literally my favorite step of makeup
because it just makes you look so alive
and just so alive and just so bright in
just a week so if after you can see look
it's a little too bright which I
personally liked how this looks when you
have options you take the same sponge
used to blend your foundation out and
just pack that on top of where you
conceal and it won't completely tone it
down but ill attorney down enough to
where it looks more natural so if you're
going for like a more natural look I'd
recommend this however I thought for
graduation it's cool to come go all out
and just glam yourself just look really
great if photos
I managed to do this as already started
that just comes down you know but you're
actually like me don't do that so - so I
can see I'm gonna take my Chanel powder
I love this powder because no matter how
long you let us down there face it does
not leave a white cast you look at
things dusty um and you want to make
sure you use a powder that does not
leave a white cast or flashback because
why would you want to have flashback and
graduation also to avoid flashback I'm
gonna use this sponge that I've been
using to seminars either recently it's
another morphe sponge but a little more
flexible and it has more movement to it
that way when I place powder it's not
putting too much on it's doing just
enough to set it and because it's so
flexible I'm able to kind of like act
after you put the powder don't do I just
did when it still would you just can't
move your concealer around but after I
put the powder on I'm able to kind of
like really move it and make sure it's
really well blended and I'm gonna put a
thin layer because like I said you don't
want flashback and I'm looking more
patty put on the more cakey your look is
the more you increase the chances of
becoming flashback Mary so I'm just
gonna put a very thin layer on and then
I'm going to kind of like move it back
and forth to make sure that that area is
set and to make sure that the powder is
really blue and well into my skin so
it's not sitting at the top of my face
and this sponge isn't I want to call it
damp it's almost like it was damp it's
kind of drying down I don't know what
you would call that but it's not damn um
perfect under eyes okay we're getting
somewhere I'm getting excited I like how
that's coming out okay so we're under I
this is optional so everyone's
graduation school colors are different I
apply you could keep it natural and keep
you know do the same like warm color on
the bottom or you can try to match your
robe so say like you have purple school
colors you can put a purple shadow Neath
because since the top eye is pretty
simple you can really play around with
it you could use Blue Goose Green you
even go black you could pretty much with
this
I look you pretty much match you with
any color that you want so I'm obviously
not in college so I don't have colors
however my high school clothes were
purple so I'm gonna do a purple like
lime time to look underneath so I'm
gonna do this I really quick and I'm
gonna come back into this I I would do
purple because one that those are my
high school colors and two they caught
my eye color so purple it is okay so
this is actually very easy to do I got
freaking I shot on my eyes so don't mind
the fact that I'm like having a panic
attack right now but it's gonna go away
in order to place the coloring with your
eye you're not gonna like put powder all
underneath your eye because check the
speaking you're not gonna do too much
addition I mean you fall out however you
you do want to like place some
protection so I'm gonna get a little
powder and I'm gonna just kind of draw a
line with the sponge just right directly
into my eye don't do all this area
because like I said you don't want put
too much powder make that area cuz
that's usually get flashback so just put
a little like a border of powder right
up your eye just to make sure that
you're safe and now so for the pound we
use I'm taking this by the balls
hashtag palette I'm use these two shades
throwbackthursday DBT and light and I'm
just gonna mix those two them I take
this BH Cosmetics just part of the
Ashley Tisdale collection number six you
talking like a flat with fluffy brush
and I'm going to just literally just
dust that I make mine very simple in the
dark you want the color the more you
apply obviously and you can't like pack
it on
and then that's the way the padam take
this morphe m55 for brush and that's i
look this came really pretty i really
how this is going but let me wrap it up
to those videos in too long
alright so to my face i'm using my own
micro smooth powder by sephora I've
never set it that way my Sephora my
cursor even powder I'm gonna use this
morphe e42 brush and I'm gonna press
them into my skin first to really set
that my base came out for all is when
I'm gonna kind of start to buff it just
to make sure it's not going anywhere
Oh what I'm gonna come pick in my time
but this is coming out really nice I
think I'm just becoming better eye
makeup because I've learned to be more
patient and just I don't know like I
guess because I'm learning more I'm
going to teach more and because I'm
teaching I like in my previous tutorials
yeah I've got a few things but I kinda
sink with things really fast I'm working
on like really thoroughly explained
things I guess when you're like in the
middle of explain things you kind of
move slower and when you move slower it
comes out nice here so yeah blue she
super blue I know isn't it all I'm gonna
say that I like slough she's like I
don't know but it's Mac this is shade
devil it's orange shade I'm using the
shakes it looks very Universal it's
really great on everyone it's cool
because you have a lot of control with
it like you could put very very little
and have like a light wash of like teen
orange going on or you can go ham so I'm
gonna go ham and I'm going to use my
foundation brush as well because with
these kind of blush
lucious lucious when they're very
pigmented I'd like using a bigger
fluffier brush click you almost have
more control versus if I using a smaller
like dense brush I feel like it kind of
like puts too much on at once and that's
how you look clownish so I mean use like
a very fluffy brush and I'm gonna like
focus that on my cheek obviously and
bring it up and I'm just gonna Pat it
you guys see it not yet
all right many more but you're just like
patting and making sure that like it's
stay in a controlled area you guys see
like when I dip it into the brush I'm
only dipping it on the corner of the
brush I'm not padding the whole thing in
there because I'm gonna have control
over how much blush I put on so I'm only
dipping the edge of this brush so I'll
give you more control even though the
brush is pretty big it gives more
control in that way after I applied the
brush after I applied the blush with
this in I place the whole brush on my
face so the rest and blend it out but
it's not product so it's not adding and
it's blending I hope I'm making sense
this is so cute
I don't care all right so to contour
your looks nationals obviously I'm
taking benefit hoola bronzer here darker
than me I recommend Tarte hotel areas or
more if you just came up some really
great bronzers and they have really
great shade range as well as make a peak
they have really good problems as well
I'm going to take us who live in in the
bronzer they'll collect my go to and my
take this Laura Mercier angled cheek
contour brush and I'm just going to
contour with that
I'm snatched and I'm also a contour my
double chin as well because if you have
one of those guys like minimize their
leaves can't get rid of it unless you go
in the gym we're not time for that cuz
we're graduating today so if you have a
slightly big forehead like me you could
take some bronzer and put it on that as
well my baby hairs bleed wow I can't
wait to take photo I'll contour my nose
is a bit I'm gonna take this morphe e20
brush put somebody on the brush then
blow it off if you're doing makeup my
client though don't blow your brushes
like I just did that screws and I mean
you could be watching this and warrants
do like you know graduation makeup other
people so never blow on your brushes
just tap it on your hand like that but
obviously doing makeup so it's cool if I
do it it's almost done
we'd have to highlight and do our lips
I'm not got the lower lash mascara I'm
only because graduations sometimes
people cry and you know you just want
your mascara ready you could do a
waterproof mascara however I personally
don't like clean waterproof mascara on
my lower lashes because when it comes
time to wash it off it's very annoying I
just personally don't like doing it so
I'm not gonna do it in this video
so for highlight I am going to take this
Cosette brush this is the 165 as well
since 5 it's my favorite brush to
highlight with now I'm going to take
this NARS kosher disel a cheek palette
and I'm gonna take these two shades
right here I'm gonna take all three cuz
you know why not do it I'm going to
highlight the top of my cheek obviously
that's oh that's really pretty
the reason why I'm decide to mix all
three is because the first shade is your
classic highlight shade champagne type
and the middle shade is like a peach
and the third sheet has like a purple
mists going on and that pretty much is
my entire look so I feel like it'll
complement my blush and go really well
along with that so that's why I'm mixing
all three like always I'm going to get
my foundation brush and Cod dust that
highlight just to have really use it in
with the blush I'm gonna take this one
champagne shade and I'm gonna like hide
it tip in my nose like that and hi my
little bridge also take a little bit of
that and dust it underneath my lash not
my lash gosh my brow I'm not gonna go to
ham though I'm not a fan of super
highlighted brows just personal
preference and I kinda glow a little
more cuz we're graduating so I'm gonna
take this Mac whispers kill highlight
that is about to fall out the one that
keeps happening to me
so I'm going to take everything a little
bit I'm not gonna put over the entire
patch of highlight I did I don't want to
get rid of the peach eNOS of purple
tones for another highlight I'm just
gonna take it at the very top part of my
cheek just so it really pops like so
before I do my list I'm actually gonna
line my waterline I actually just got
these new pins I make it forever in the
mail and I want to use them and so I'm
just gonna take this shade
well it's purple but it's called
versatile violet I'm just going to run
that upper lash line just to intensify
the lower lash line because I'm not
wearing mascara so here's a little tip
if you're emotional which is two little
pigs I'm 82 illumise watering if you are
emotional and you're like fried to
graduation
I recommend the Laura Mercier powder
transition translucent powder
I recommend it because I have used that
back when I used to freelance I used to
use that for weddings and obviously
brides cry and
on three different occasions when I use
that on my bride and they cried before
we even left the room for the wedding
I'm like don't touch it just let it dry
just like I just don't touch it and when
it dries it doesn't leave a tear stain
now I don't know if this third
particular skin type it's just from
observation but east I used to learn my
say powder and weddings and they cried
if they don't touch it if you don't
bother it if you don't try to Pat it
just leave it alone it dries it
literally dries up and it's gone like
it's almost like you didn't cry at all
and so I'm gonna recommend that only
because I've seen it work now if you had
different experience be sure to comment
it down below
I just I used to do weddings and it
seems to be the best when it comes to
when you're emotional so if you think
you gonna cry when you graduate the
Chanel powders really great however I
can actually say for not perfect but for
my experience at the Laura Mercier
powder works really good for tears so
I'd recommend that instead just to put
that out there before I continue cuz I
don't want to forget her lips I'm gonna
go with the gloss so now the reason I'm
choosing a gloss is because when it
comes to liquid lipsticks I feel like
they're higher maintenance and glosses
our glasses are very easy to touch up
specially for photos you can have like a
little gloss and keep it in like your
graduation like you'll a little pocket
and it's just easier touch-up when it
comes to touching up you don't want to
like have the touch of your liquid
lipstick because when you keep piling
that on even Chester crumble and it
makes your lips feel super dry at least
for my personal experience so I feel
like for occasions like this I would
definitely wear it gloss because it's
just easier it's easier even in my
previous tutorial where I do like the
prom special occasion look I wish I
would did two lip options because while
that lip was beautiful it's good to have
a gloss as well because they're just
easy to deal with I don't know and I
mean it's just person what I would do
because I remember when I graduated high
school I used a red matte lip and it was
so annoying
even as on my pictures you can see kind
of separating right here that's another
thing when you wear like liquid
lipsticks if they're like more on the
bolder side sometimes if you're not in
the mirror every five seconds it'll mess
up and you won't even know it and then
you'll take pictures and then afterwards
you see them and like
look a mess if you don't want to face
tuned you're screwed
so I say I'd like to say I may use a
gloss so let's get rid of all the stuff
having my lips already so first time
I'll line my lips with Mac cork lip
liner if you're darker than me I'd
recommend chestnut I don't wanna use
chestnut because I feel like for my skin
tone when it comes to mixing kawasan
liner I use chest all the time but we're
like an occasion where I may have to
touch up a lot it's easier to use a
liner that slender lighter or that match
your skin tone a little bit more because
then when you toast the gloss it just I
can't explain it get it to be in
situation I know what I'm talking about
but it just makes it much easier you
don't touch the liner and gloss you just
kitty to put the gloss on top I mean use
a darker liner and when you touch up the
gloss you have to touch the liner as
well it's complicated so I'd recommend
using one that is like close to your
skin tone
just slightly darker you want to add
more definition to your lips so for
gloves I'm taking on my urban decay and
this is called mess so we're stuck a
really nice pink and I'm going to that
our first ever win this a lot lately
this looks good I like those gloss who
looks good even when I don't have like I
shadowed lashes it's weird looks bold
but it looks good without makeup - I
love glosses like that and then on top
of that to give them more pop and take
his hand and rege loss this is called
size shake Henry yeah this is cut side
chick it's like an orange e shimmery
gloss I'm gonna put it on top

other each word but I'm trying to be PG
alright so last thing got such your face

inking right now and I'm going to spray
whole bunch you pry it on my top while
you're doing this but you don't wanna
like get in your mouth spray that now
notice how some of this shimmer from my
lid did transfer on to my crease half I
don't mind that because it's not I don't
how to put it but the color the shimmer
makes to where it still looks okay if
you have hooded lids though I would
recommend using a mixing medium it's by
Mac I personally just can't find my buy
definite want to use that but if you
have hooded lids and you don't want the
shimmer transferring up here like if if
you don't mind it it's really cool but
if you do mind that kind of stuff
Mac mixing medium I'll put in the
description box now completely dead all
that but I still like this look so it's
cool to me okay I got this for the video

continue watch this video but if you're

all right a quick story time I decide to
put this on the end of the video because
I know a lot of you guys are pride here
just to see me do my makeup and get look
inspiration however I do get asked a lot
why I jump into college so I decided
because I'm doing a video that's based
on graduating and I thought it would get
appropriate just talk about a little bit
it's not gonna be super long cuz the
story starts pretty simple I shall talk
about it if you want to know and so I
went to college for one semester uh
years ago I feel really old this is like
five years ago cuz obviously was out of
it after I graduated high school
obviously I was 18
yeah and I stopped going to college on
my 19th birthday exciter I went to I got
my financial aid check I got those
checks um I love the financial aid part
of college do I regret getting that yes
cuz my little money but that's besides
the point came to get back now I just
there for my mistakes but um yeah I
remember I went to Sephora bought a
Becca foundation that was the first high
in foundation ever bought and I bought
the foundation specifically for my
birthday and I remember doing makeup I
remember exactly what I wore weren't
this a pink sweater this really nice
jacket went to school when I was last
and when it comes over it so the reason
why I stopped going is because it's
really simple
I don't like homework I just don't like
school in general and also it's Alyssa
stop going if something looks sappy but
it's true so we look the same college I
really supposed to go
Sonoma State if you're from California
prior of that and I got accepted
everything and I want when I watch the
orientation the lack of diversity was
just too much like no like I can't I
think I'm like I'm not gonna go here so
I applied to East Bay very very last
minute and I'm sick I've accepted and so
Alyssa's aren't going there and so I'm
going with her and it kind of became a
thing or like we wake up in the morning
time get ready the same time catch the
bus to catch a BART to school like we
were just like always together and
became like I got comfortable with just
being with her there and like you know
whenever we have free period we play
freaking volleyball and the little rec
center we play like Dance Dance
Revolution where those things are called
with boards all together and so she
stopped going for most personal reasons
maybe a month before I stopped going but
when she stopped going
I felt very lonely and I was like this
is weird like not only do I already
don't like this because obviously
speaking I don't know the teachers are
now but the teachers I had they were
really teaching me much one teacher I
can understand so I wasn't learning much
another teacher was teaching literacy
but she was illiterate herself so that
didn't make much sense to me not to my
drive I'm stating facts it's all you're
not feeling it and they were Alyssa
stopped going while I lost my best
friend I was like I don't like this so I
stuck it out for one more month and it
was like scary not to walk to the bus
stop myself now gonna be about 6:00 in
the morning while I'm still a little
dark and I was just over it oh no I
don't have anyone to play with me
anymore
this looks like childish but I was over
it so that's what I'm going because I
missed Alyssa what I was studying I
wasn't really even passionate in it I
got a job at Target so I was kind of
like focus on you work him there and I
just was like not feeling it at all and
I'm also going through a lot who's
making me depressed this is like the
first time that ever went to like a
doctor break depressants I remember I
got anxiety medication that was Jack me
up and so I was going through a lot and
basically college was just like
this is not working out for me so that's
what's not going for every who I was
asked I mean I kind of talked about this
before but never went to detail about it
but it's pretty simple I just I was
monkey stuff emotionally I'm in solicit
causes you're being there and I wasn't
passionate about what I was studying and
I just growing up my mom she always made
sure we graduated high school she want
us to of course be in college but she
was never one of those kind of parents I
was like if you don't do this I'm gonna
shun you and hate you she's like you
know what if you're passionate about
this if you feel like if you could be
successful while doing this then go for
it is she just supported us well you
know we try to figure it out so I
appreciate that my old sister she
graduate from UC Santa Barbara and I was
a very proud moment for all of us I mean
you know mom and this you have one
person that graduated college that's
cool enough for us and I will listen I
we were like eight by now on YouTube so
that's why I stopped go to college do I
Drive in college yes if you're studying
something you're passionate in of course
obviously that's pretty dope like it'll
be a really good time constantly if you
are in college because your parents
trying to force you to be in college ask
someone they're gonna pay off your loans
because if you're like for stuff to me
in college and your night and passion
about what you're studying and like so
many people go to college and they get
out it's like the job and of Guinean has
nothing to do with it with a study then
a lot of boost and cause to impress
other people don't do that unless those
people gonna pay your debt and I'm just
gonna be straight up honest now I think
college is great obviously speaking but
just do it for you do it because you
want to be there not because you have to
be there you know what I'm saying
because like I said unless these people
around you're gonna pay your debt that's
gonna be on you and that just causes
stress like my student loan does still
have to pay those and that affects your
credit but before I get into too much
deep talk you guys want to begin more
about that and my thoughts on that I
will do one but now you know I start
going to college like I said earlier
congratulations to everyone who's
graduating now I think it's a really
really amazing thing to be able to start
college and finish because some people
start and don't finish I think it's so
dope if you actually finish I love that
I love seeing that graduation so it
makes me happy because I know it's a
very great experience just feeling so if
you were a subscriber mind your
graduating and I'm proud of you you're
awesome for actually finishing and
getting that done and good luck to
what you're gonna do next so yeah I'm
gonna talking I let you guys you know go
down thanks for staying if you want this
whole entire thing and I'm I'll see you
guys later boy
I don't wanna do all I know is I love
you guys come out to making my apartment
