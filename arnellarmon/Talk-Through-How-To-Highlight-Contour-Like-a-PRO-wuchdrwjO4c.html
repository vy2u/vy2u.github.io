back to my channel if you're new welcome
I know a lot of you're new because you
guys need to subscribe to me due to the
video I mean ELISA post together
surprise now let's actually of those
comments like oh my god I've got two
lists actually I've here so there's that
but safety video I thought I'd do my
makeup just because but then I thought
um I want to like really well I think
you know every one of eat my face and
since I wore my contour and highlight it
might make me look super snatch and I
thought maybe I could to do a video on
how to like really contour and highlight
you know cuz I mean either once I do it
and I like doing it and for many ways
still philosophy about that
but before I do that I'm going to show
you this how to do my face I was
thinking about doing my foundation I
think off camera but that I knew people
wanna know where I you so I'm just gonna
do that really fast and then we'll get
into contouring and highlight and all
that good stuff to look super snap so
look at me before take this in because
I'm lil their new person in like 15
minutes
so to prime use this milk a makeup
cooling water stick I think this is a
primer however I've been using as one
because it was really good and then for
foundation I use my NARS natural radiant
longer foundation I'm in the shade Tahoe
so I'm going to do that really fast
because part up and then we'll get to
highlighting contouring o-p-s this will
scratch my head I'm in this thing where
I scratched myself in my sleep sometimes
so that's good that's prime I scratch
myself I don't know why price dress
all right so we have our hyphenation on
so when I have a contour I like using
creams I know anyone's different I use
both creams and powder powder for
contouring and I will do cream the my
highlight is based on the concealer I
use so it's in for everyone you can
automatically want to highlight or you
conceal first and then use a lot of
concealer on top to highlight and so I'm
gonna do first is conceal cuz it's like
thousand benefit people more and so in
concealment to use my bare minerals bare
skin concealer in the shade tan kinda
almost out of this so that's cool
telling you look a little bit and if
you're going to conceal before highlight
this look a concealer could super
lightweight so it won't be all like
heavy and cakey Kate classic kinky cakey
it's a bit of concealer I'm gonna use
this really bomb workpiece bunch more of
these sponges are so bomb I just bought
this one I'm used to using this one I
want to try this one though because it
looks so super like precise and why not
and it's so bomb I will say that the
individual is too soft
I mean it's blending but I wish she
would like kind of stay still if it
makes sense you guys see how it's moving
this one doesn't move though it kind
just like gets right in there and does
the job I like them both though they're
both really good and they're really
inexpensive as well
okay so my skills when did not time to
highlight I love fighting Tori
alright so not gonna lie right fit
concealer and concealer I used to
highlight was a heart-shaped tape and it
breaks my heart that we can no longer
 Watari on the wrapper but it's like
if you don't use your stuff anymore look
at where you drag to put honestly
speaking like that was my fear concealer
not my new one but I have these cavity
ones which used to my favor before you
ever know we have a favorite they trust
my new and that's a new favorite that's
how this happened so I do like the Kat
Von D ones these to lock it concealers
um if you don't like heavy stuff I
wouldn't recommend these because they
could they can't be kind of heavy are
you gonna focus up depend on how you
blend them but I'm gonna show you how to
finesse it okay so I have this white one
because it's why I want to highlight the
heck out of you but you have to mix it
with another one so I have this one d31
warm and I'm gonna put that one first
well I miss these concealers actually
haven't used in a while and I highlight
underneath my eyes I'm gonna make this
super simple as well cuz i watch the
meals like this before and they make it
seem more complicated than it actually
is and i know a lot of people wolf um
wasn't expressed to me a lot you are
scared to cream contour and it's so easy
I'm gonna make it really simple like
it's not that deep so I hadn't been on
my forehead I don't look too up because
my 4x are kind of big if you highlight
you know too far up you guys see how it
then the lights naturally hit in the
middle of my forehead when I'm gluing
this out it will blend up to where that
lights hitting but you don't wanna go to
him because like unless unless your
forehead small then it's cool but my for
its kind of big so I don't want to do
that and I'm also gonna contour my
forehead to to make it smaller and then
I highlight my chin it's basically I'm
gonna have to tell my life it's hitting
the places I just put the lighter
concealer it's handing to my eyes my
chin and my forehead my nose but I do
something different my nose I don't pink
highlight on my nose out I'll be there
and so on top of that I'm going to put
the white eye concealer
and I'm just gonna make on blend that in
there and if I crazy now but once you
played it out like it's really cool
blend not and then so got that done and
also I'll take out something if you want
for under eye because I went through a
phase where I like to went under I was
super duper bright I think Kim
Kardashian inspired that I just wanted
like a student bright highlight if you
want that and you have to lower your
light because it looks line right now
who wants to say with powder it's like
it kind of tones it down so if you want
to be extra bright you have to kind of
like go extra light with the concealer
because once you like set with powder
it's gonna tone down regardless so I'm
just gonna blend that out and I'll show
you guys why I do to make it like Blin
flawlessly and seamlessly into my
foundation oh one second oh I love a
brand marybelle it just I don't know
something is so satisfying about
blending out concealer it's my favorite
part of makeup
they blend out the concealer I don't
know why it just makes look so alive
it's like that's so satisfying doing it
so bring it outwards
cool going out the channel bit and went
out the forehead and just calling go
kind of clock or you know a little TV
feel like that
Mike stop effective terrible okay so
it's not Cleveland it out so the sponge
I've used to little my foundation while
I like to do like go around the edges of
the highlight and blend that in because
it's like it still has a little bit
foundation not too much but it makes
that area like cuz I've seen this before
i seduce myself where i'll blend on my
highlight and it'll be a sharp line so i
wouldn't blend around it so you which
one do as you try to blend around it are
you the fence I didn't say anything
Google sorry as a little okay and then I
like to bring it in on my nose this is
part of me contouring my nose you guys
see how I'm bring it in but not too in
you know I mean into the other into a
sponge and just blend the rest out it's
all about blending the air we're gonna
do the very it's gonna be intense with
nacho at the same time you know you want
to be wearable that's a good
all right last time to contour so I
don't use it too thin to contour if
you've been subscribed my channel for a
while you've seen both these products
before at some point time so I like
using the Anastasio bevel stick
foundation I am happy ending in cocoa
they go to the same thing for me it's
like a darker shade like so or if you do
not want you to stick I like those
things I suppose it's easier to do if
you don't you the stick I use is Ruby
kisses 3d face creator and they come in
like different shades this is level 12
and I've been using suck for you
it's awesome however I feel like this is
just easier because you can kind of draw
it on versus if you use a brush it's
just it's another option if you don't
wanna spend too much money because these
are like five dollars $4.99 and you 225
but I'd freeze these cuz it easy to do
so I just now okay so it comes
contouring you want to use a cooler
shadow which I am gonna do later I'm a
cooler tone powder
I said shadow powder because that's how
you make your cheeks about chiseled this
is going to like contour but more so
bronze because more warm when you
contour you learning to cook cooler tone
shade but trust me it's all the time
together so I can either contour down
here contour up here it depends on my
mood and depends on how high on my
cheekbones to look but I usually kind of
just like feel where my bones at and I
just go down from there and I kind of
like you know you can kind of feel your
cheekbone is that's my contour i could
contour down here by blood that makes it
look older if it makes sense i think the
lawyer contour it makes your cheeks with
a super chisel but like a new contr
higher up it makes your cheekbones up
higher and that makes you look younger
so that's what i do and when i can't on
my forehead i just do like the edges
like this now you can't contour your
jawline if you have a little chin like
me but I'm gonna do that with powder and
I'll show you this I do that in a second
so now you blend it out I'm use the same
sponge I used to blend out my foundation
so that's pretty good you guys see how
it's warm that's cool
don't worry about it so I guess I'm
going to add a cooler shade the reason
why I like using a cream product that's
more warmer is because I feel like when
you can just go in with a cooler tone
contour shade it just looks almost too
intense and
it's not really like for an everyday
type thing but for every day I like
adding warmth to my face and then kind
of contour you make myself with more
chisel I just I don't want look too cool
but I just feel like that does not
flatter me or my skin tone so I'm gonna
have some cool tones in there this is
probably nice I'm gonna kind of bronzer
so next I'm going someplace I concealed
or highlight it I'm gonna use my Mac
Patrick star powder I love this powder I
also like the Laura Mercier translucent
powder
I like Chanel powder I don't like
powders but this is one I've been using
lately exactly kind of highlights me
even more and then brightens underneath
my eyes cuz I have to go pink tone to it
so while I like to do first is I said it
first and I press that first layer of
powder in just like this see how that's
so highlighting bright then I go and
with a second layer a slightly thicker
I'm not too thick I think when people do
that whole baking thing and they use
like a whole bunch of toddler I think
that's a semi and necessary and you
waste powder doing that you don't need
to do that you just kind of gone with
you know a second little layer and then
you let that sit just for a little bit
up to them and then I kind of go on the
middle of my nose like this and then I
do my chin and my scratched-up forehead
all right so now I'm gonna side the rest
of my face so I can like you know
contour blush and all that kind of stuff
and highlight some more so since Alyssa
made me cancel my Studio Fix cuz she
says it brings a lot of texture I have
my micro smooth powder she's always
talking about so I'm going to use that
so my face cuz it's really nice and I'm
gonna go around the places where the
powder is first
powder city little longer and I'm using
a more freaky 58 brush things someone
let's put me on you look like the
Harris's flattered I don't know I hope
this is great one and I'm just going to
set around I like to press my powder to
my skin and then brush you kind of tell
it where you are powder out let me do
that and you could press it in and then
when you brush if you feel like there's
like a drag where it kind of feels like
some tension you know any more powder in
that area it's still wet if you could
rub the brush against your skin and it's
all smooth and it's no like pulling
that's how you know your powders I'm
really set and nice I'm looking oh
what's that word that starts with F
hahaha loser
flawless okay and you see how I let that
powder stick and you see how it kind of
like helped out of my nose but I don't
like contour my nose too crazy if I will
show you guys what I do my nose it's
pretty small and it doesn't really have
a bridge I can't really go to hand my
contour but I do a little stuff then
I'll show you guys
I said my I don't ruin me
now I feel like my eyes look perfectly
highlighted it's like my eye that my
tire looks really bright but it's not
too like BAM if you want it super BAM
you can use like a highlighting contour
palette there's one here because that I
like you use something like this and you
can use like a banana shaped tube right
into a little more I'll show you those
it looks like I don't want to go to ham
on this but I will show you guys I'm
gonna need a little bit this one and you
could just like varieties a little bit
more if you want to you but usually
speaking when you use the Kat Von D
until you don't have to since it's white
it's gonna brand anyways but this is
just an option if you want to go extra
ham I know there's some of you that will
alright so to contour powder so to
really contour I like uses hoola bronzer
by benefit unfortunately um this shade I
don't think I'll work on England darker
than me and iOS's when I use it just in
the morning and I can't think of it
sucks not many brands make really good
bronzer contour shades and Stassi has
good contour shades her contour powders
I like using this hoola bronzer benefit
it's crazy cuz for the launch of in
thing won't work but I started using it
and when I first put it on it doesn't
look like it's working but it gives like
the perfect shadow I can't explain it it
just give it it's like a perfect contour
and i'm using the morphe ether t4 brush
i'm just placed on top of you guys see
how when i first put on it could be too
light
now when i blend it in it just helps
intensify my contour just right but I
put it the same place where I claimed
contoured
those cheekbones
what cheekbones well no it's the
opposite no way um a little bit or my
forehead and you could use this running
jawline as well I wouldn't recommend
using a warm shade around the jawline so
I don't that is only contoured it is
kind of bronze your jawline I think that
was kind of funny style so if you want
you have to use actual contour sheet in
order to contour that jawline and get
rid of those zone that's skin all right
so to concentrate nose I use this as
well and I use my favorite freaking
breast I bought three of these over
weekend I have for now three plus one is
four I mean this is the morphe m5 72
brush it's like a really nice contour
brush and I just use a little powder I
don't put powder on the entire brush I
dip down the side because I'm not using
it I brush and I just rest that along my
nose and I kind of drag it out so it's
not like one harsh line it's blended you
guys see what I'm doing and I just do
like that and then I dip someone other
side of the brush and do the same thing
like a contour and I could drag it out
you never want it's like a harsh line
don't that is looking at all and then I
used the part of a brush that has no
powder on it because I only use a sides
and I blend that out and just like that
I have a nose job and it looks pretty
what nose
- will you just blend that out but the
worst thing you could have is harsh
contour nose lines nose contouring lines
whatever and I do this one thing that's
super cute that I have a like doing and
that's where I take this and I
contradict I do a line right here like
and that makes you guys see what I did
here it makes it I got up a little
button nose I don't know why hecka like
that I don't think many people even
notice I do this but I do notice I might
do it
I get more compliments on my nose we'll
just my makeup the illest face right now
don't worry about to fix it oh and you
want to go over with the big fluffy
brush when you're done and uh put some
powder on that brush as well this will
kind of make everything look flawless
I like a mellow line cuz it makes my
nose look like a little button
and I like that cool I like it
alright so now another thing if you want
a contour to be crazy with the K Hixson
the powder used to highlight and go on
me like this don't you three contoured
now what I could do some people oh I'm
snatched look at that some people I let
this sit I don't I am eating away
because your student Lee the same effect
if you let it sit it's gonna look too
crazy then if you want to look crazy
like I said you can let it sit but I
don't like let it sit doesn't you have
to like two extra buck feet and like you
know go crazy you don't have to do that
I thought you do one to leave it off
Arcola seconds you just brush off and
still get the same effect so there's
that now it's a highlight fun part so
I'm gonna have my cheekbones first I
don't really think those gold that money
like I mean it makes your cheekbones up
higher but it really does absolute
shimmer and the highlight I'm using is
the one of listen used in our video that
we just do got their tendrils accent no
it's called it is the it's Lancome
Lancome dual finish highlighter and
Lewis gold my friend want to say
put me on to this and it's long you are
see you don't have to put a lot I can't
believe I put that much on you don't
need that much
that's cream and smile you do this thing
where I highlight right above this brow
click like it gives it a really nice
glow to my forehead because see come on
it's just like goggles together
and for my nose now people who have
actually noses my nose I just feel like
I wish I had up a bridge ever there's my
nose like stuck out more
they put highlight on down their nose I
like to highlight the tip of my nose
like this all the Sagami about this she
does I put too much on so I'm trying to
control myself like that look at little
beer and I put a little bit up here cuz
I'm gonna have a bridge I can't put it
all the way down but when you do like
that it makes your nose look more
defined if you have a nose similar to
mine and that's what I do this looks so
cute
um alright so are things I could just
kind of goes to like highlight and
contour you bring it all together last
thing is blush believe it or not I say
blush it just I hated I don't know why I
can't tell you I just didn't like it I
said I can make a good Barbie doll
because all the blush I will look at
will be super pink eraser paint blushes
they have a lot of options but I feel
like blush really bring something
together it adds more warmth back into
your face and I feel like blush makes
your cheeks and cheekbones look more
defined just more cute so pick a blush
if the flowery skin tone the most I like
using peachy blush like this not too
pink I haven't had this one blush I love
this at more Orangi but that's what I'm
like you know over the try go ham this
blush by Joey cosmetics and it is called
peach bouquet and uses morphe y3 brush
and I'm just going to cut a smile and I
bring that blush in to wear it contoured
and I've had it any you see how
you can't list my cheek and makes it
look ossified you can add a little blush
or a lot if you want didn't this is
really good
all right so now that you're pretty much
done I don't get my girls on camera
because it means like this is my
eyebrows tutorial I'm gonna set my face
now and I'm gonna use my morphe contains
continuous setting miss my favorite
things forever this is new bottle I'm
just gonna set everything and I noticed
that when you set your face it brings
out the bronzer it makes it pop more
that's like when you like put a later
powder on it is something like I can't
explain it
I notice that I'll do a makeup and set
it like with powder and stuff then right
sided with the sight spray all the
colors like you guys see how I like
seelye the true color of your blush more
it kind of all comes out so there it is
it looks really nice so I'm gonna do my
brows and like mascara lash off camera
and then I'll come back to show you guys
my finished look these are my brows in
my lashes off-camera my one just really
quick though when you takes on my Urban
Decay powder and put it cut in my hair
so I feel like my scalp looks
dramatically lighter then my forehead so
I just wanna you know make that match
but looks better alright the last thing
because I mean I contour this sometimes
too and I want my lips look super
defined
I'm not lit so I'm gonna contour wide to
do is see right here this little groove
I like OOP Adelbert room I like
contouring that you can see it makes it
more defined
yes yet I don't know why the cat looks
and then you don't want to highlight
your Cupid's will but they kiss off any
chapstick may have on I my line my lips
using this morphe toasty lipliner cool
now I'm 22 gloss I'm use my 50 beauty's
spacesuit gloss first up 3 on top of
that metate buxom princess make your
lips look replug I miss meeting no that
is it so that is how I contoured
highlight it's honestly pretty simple I
feel like I still look myself just a
