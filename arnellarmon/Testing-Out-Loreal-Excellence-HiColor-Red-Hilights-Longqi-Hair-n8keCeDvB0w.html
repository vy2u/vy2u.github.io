video I'm going to be testing out this
L'Oreal hair guy for red dark hair only
um honestly you kind of see how it works
but this is even like a true indicator I
work because it actually didn't work a
little bit but then I covered it with
another guide I'll explain that in this
video I wouldn't even call this tutorial
this is more so me testing out here as I
draw on era like many people I messed up
what I dyed my hair I honestly just go
for it and the thing is like people may
think that I am kind of like I don't
want to careless well I kind of do it
over here because I get a lot into me
but I've been doing this with hair even
when I was buying it because I like
trying new stuff and I'm so cave doesn't
work out well if you would have to and
so I mean yeah I cut out this hair dye I
messed up the first time but I mean I
became pretty nice I'm going to insert a
picture of this hair natural lighting so
I close my studio lights are almost a
little too bright it's not getting the
true color you can probably see a little
bit of red tint but it's definitely not
showing like its true color because in
person or I leave them in the sunlight
like a MASH Almighty it looks a little
more red and I just I don't know if this
for me to through pictures so expect my
inserts I've been really on it as far as
my other hair guys twirled I just
recently posted over that last comments
um of people saying we did this well you
thought wrong and I will say this I
appreciate when I have comments saying
hey you did this wrong here's how you
should you next time
you know helpful comments but just
saying like I'm a cop cetology major and
I do a robot I think you did this and
that I don't want to put home because I
okay if I'm doing a bad job or you don't
like I'm doing the hair color then what
you making a YouTube channel so you
could teach you how to the professional
way cuz you're the professional you know
could say so I appreciate the comments
where people tell me hey dude use this
when you should at this but like no one
likes when they get comment from people
just make this bugger stupid it's okay
you're so the pressure to make a channel
alright then I can learn something and
you'll do better next time so I'm here
to say that I'm
I'm not perfect I don't have my
cosmetology license I went to school for
a month and I was like no I cancel the
school's construct and I'm never claimed
to be professional I miss so much like
doing hair who's willing to just take
risk and just try ramps up out rather
you guys suggested its own actually
suggest that I do this video out in
sanur comment um you know I like trying
new things and I mean sometimes I messed
up and the only reason why I include my
mess up my videos because I want you
guys feel comfortable while watching me
um a lot of people are know a lot of
specials that dine here and you'll most
likely mess up when you're dying here at
home so it's I messed up I'm a legend
ability I messed up so you'll get a
skirt where you're doing at home you
know I'm trying to say like no
perspective stuff unless you're like
that guy tank guy he's like the but
I'm not dying that's on Tennessee
alright so um the parkings video I'm
just Harrison long Queen hair I really
don't have much as a about exciting use
their hair before and I'm going to
continue to use your hair I may review
all your textures
I've already reduced rate here I do that
I want to say last year I'll link the
video down below if you'd like to see it
this right here is okay however this
curl here is much better my opinion I
don't know if they've change the quality
of it they're straight here with silky
and soft but it was a more thinner side
so I have to do a lot to make it have a
little body who just look a little too
thin on me for me personally but this
curly hair I you know it's totally I
can't explain it it's just chill you
know I don't I'll have at the best say
about it and I mean this hair is natural
state after death the hair used to I
dyed hair I blow-dry and I hand drive on
myself let it sit out overnight and let
it air dry and I mean this wood looks
like I flipped a look like a very
natural curl like Bessie growing on
myself um I don't like hard it's a cool
ship art I thought I said it occurs did
better with a part but it just what's
property with me I don't know why I did
wrong or at least and not might as wish
for too long maybe that's why the park
Biffle is more natural at least in my
opinion but I mean that's just me I go
outside like this so I mean this is the
same side I think I could do better at
stick close your part but the para
haven't got any tangling no shade you
can see that can literally just run my
fingers through it carefree and I mean
there's no like you don't stop through
like you know no
and that's ability for curly hair
because not all shows you can do this
you save a curly hair when you run your
fingers through it it's like so you know
curling your tangles especially more
than straight hair Luthor hasn't got
that um when I do that and I mean where
I really do it I may get like one or two
strands of hair and when you see that
but that's about it
so that's cooled me I'm debating about
my abundance of brighter red because I'm
pretty sure the girl left that comment
asking me to try this out was expecting
a brighter red so if you don't let me a
diamond hair brighter red SIA turns out
let me know or if you would like to see
straight bright red hair let me know to
come down below so I wanted some really
nice farm bright ass rooby-roo
lipstick ass red hair I just don't want
to curl your straights comfortable level
SP and I'm going to get right into this
video
this isn't tutorial is just kind of
trial and error just me try and out so
don't expect to like learn something
crazy I thought type of the property typ
rum so when I asked you if you guys know
me to our other hair dyes or other
colleges comment down below and I'll do
then settle my screen the money on it
because I mean it makes cool video so if
you like this video please give a thumbs
up and subscribe and I'll see you guys
right next one alright so this is the
Harris natural state it pretty much
looks the same as it does now colored is
just colored and so I got three bottles
in a closure and so these are guys I'm
using - one of them I didn't know I'm
using h8 h Oh magenta H 10 H 11 I pretty
much bought every single one they had to
reach my store I want to try the colors
you know but waste my money anyway so
frigid squeeze a tube in a little fluffy
D thingy and then you add a little bit
developer that's the box told me to do
so don't say I'm doing it wrong like my
last video the box later said to add
load developer and then I mix that
together in a yeah I'm going to keep
mixing it and mixing it until the actual
cream die and the developer is all like
one consistency kinda like pancake
batter then I know and put on some
gloves on my hair I'm into my hair my
hands go get died even though they end
up being died anyways and then I'm going
to apply this at the
now this is the h8 color because I
wanted to do an ombre and that didn't
work out of course but I mean anyways I
want to h8 first you should see if it
would get like a brighter lighter red
the corn to the store the h8 was like a
a Burnie like a red Auburn a color you
know how to have a google hair swatch e
thingies h8 was like a red Auburn so I
thought that was really nice at the end
so that's what I was going for and so
once I apply the dye I just reckon full
just to help the process faster because
I mean being that I'm not bleaching the
hair first I need all the processing I
can get in order to get good color
payoff so yeah I just you know placed a
color in the ends you know did both
sides making sure that all the strands
are saturated with it and then I just
placing it full to help perhaps a little
faster
all right so this is one I messed up
alright so I checked the dye I'm okay
something's off all right
and I discovered well not yet
wait let's wait to get that crap for in
the video I'm just check and see how the
guy is going you know what's going on
with slide I discover it's a little tuba
teeny this thing right here that is in
each box I did not see that what I got
the tube out and so because I mix the
dye I just add that color directly to
the bundles now I'm I think this did
work but it's not how you're supposed to
do it you have to mix this into the
developer and the cream color but yeah
it's very hard to feel or even know this
little tube meeting is in there because
it's so tiny so when you get the box you
dump it I pull the tube out
so I'd even like look to see if there's
anything else in there I definitely
didn't hear it or see it but um yeah
just dump these box guys so everything
that you need falls right out so yeah I
just add that back on to it and then I'm
going to add the shade H tin because I
just figured I messed up the dye so I'm
like let me just add nother one on to it
so I mix that superfast and I mixed it
the right way
it was weird though um okay because when
I add a little accelerator the little
tube thing is at a color accelerator it
turns orange and this is only weird to
me because later on when I add another
red on top of this it turned red so I
don't know what that was about
and this is red dye so I don't know why
I turned orange but hey I just on top of
the color I put on it I kind of brought
it up a little bit and I just I feel
like me doing this is what helped me get
the original color I got after I rinse
it out because I kind of mess with the
first back first batch and I could tell
that I wasn't really dying or processing
the way it should've on although it look
like a head color that was just the
actual dying self it wasn't actually
penetrating the hair follicle and only I
could see that up close so I feel like
this helped and so I let it sit in for
like music an hour and I rinsed it out
and Vista color God now I could have
just left it like this I don't know why
I added red on top I just thought that
okay it did this color it process on me
bleaching it if I add another red on top
it's going to be
even bolder and I was wrong I was wrong
but I mean how can I not assume that
when just like the boldest read they had
which is age 11 it's called intense read
and you got to see when I add a little
accelerant it's read as so I
thought okay the right guy was okay but
I want fiery crazy red so let me add
another red on top of it and all I did
was darken it and I wasn't I wasn't
expecting that
I was kind of annoyed by it actually
because I mean something I should just
kept the other cover before but
nevertheless like I said this is trial
and error I messed up so I'm yeah I mix
that up it's beautiful bright red I'm
kind of mad and in terms of color and I
just on top of that and then I'm yeah I
let that process another hour I was
chilling with Jabari around this time
like I was dying hair they're going
downstairs chill with him so times gone
by pretty fast that's cool you know
because with this because of no bleach
it you want to let a process as long as
possible or as long as you're willing to
wait so you really get your money's
worth but in this case um I kind of did
and I kind of did it because I didn't
get the bold bread that I really really
wanted
I just wrapped that up I let it sit you
know for about an hour I washed it and I
let it dry overnight and this is the
finished product I'm going to redeem
myself I'm gonna do a brighter red but I
like how this came out if you do - be
sure to give it a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
