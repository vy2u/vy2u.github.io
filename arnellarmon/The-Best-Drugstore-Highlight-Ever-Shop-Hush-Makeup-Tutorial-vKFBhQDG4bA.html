using all object store and promo
products I'm asking to have a shock of
increases I was just trying to like use
make fun and different and so there's
like enough width and it looks pretty
cool I cannot stop staring at myself
because of this highlighter you guys
we're asking Tony guys electric to watch
the video to see the highlighter it's
literally the best drugstore hair I've
ever tried little I don't freaking think
about it I suggest Elizabeth hire a
chart will drop short it may be
comparable for another half of our use
but I'm going to be on that like my
letters you know welcome to do some
internet anyway this video is sponsored
by hush which is a website that sells
pretty of nothing but affordable like
drugstore type products they have no
niggas Milani pretty much the drugstore
name you think up and also other brands
that you kind of heard before because
I've never heard about the Ramanujan's
highlight I never heard a lot of the
river very site where I look on your
cycle as well they have some cool and
stuff I will say this when you go on the
side you will be free to spend money I'm
just going to warn using that would be
the only one advisable to sell someone
your Sigma just to like see my video
with you I was moved
I can't no I can't man extra money okay
my budget retire right now but should I
paint I am there's a left arm was stuck
out alcohol for the guys cuz they have a
lot of stuff a lot a lot of stuff just
speak them self um the eyeshadow me
first look I'm never afraid for it cost
a lot but it's so beautiful
passing beautiful actual action column
sounds painful
and we have like is another one used to
I think this one is but to agree eight
them but one of the things that they
have so many things I've never even seen
before it was a really cool style
in stooping to that you see but I'm
going to look unless recipe you watch
this video if you want more videos where
I is either doing a makeup look with
only the one grant or what all the
processes in spice and immigrants let me
know they know they'll make it easier to
the recreate this look see to order all
stuff from at the same place or this
video me so they don't remember this let
me build out before we do them unless
I've watch this if you do enjoy the
video subscribe and I'll see you guys
later alright so first to do my brows
I'm using this she makeup eyebrows
school now I was honestly shocked to
have this pencil work i'ma show you guys
what it look like it's kinda like that
Anastacio broad to find her but I
probably know it'll work I have the by
definer and I would never really a huge
fan of it now I'm now a shop uses pencil
because I usually kind of just stick to
super gimme pencil if I would be hard
but somehow I finessed my brow then it
was good since like three dollars I
thought I was pretty cool now I'm going
to go into my gold mine collection ten
piece make a brush set this is going to
run you about $20 for ten brushes so
what's the math like two dollars per
brush and I'm going to find a brush that
I can conceal my brows with and I end up
taking like this flat head brush because
I realized higher brush that I thought
this would work the best what you did
and I'm yeah I'm going to use my la girl
Pro concealer in order to conceal around
my brows to count like define them and
make it easier to draw them in and then
ya know do what I do
next time I hit this cream eyeliner by L
and this is like the shade brown and
these are three dollars it's funny
because when I picked this out I met the
new it word because this was used for my
brows before I had enough money to buy
my dip brow Anastacio and it works
pretty good what I learned is that it
works best when you let it dry out a
little bit now it works for the video
but I only use it in my brows so if
you're going to use it just for your
entire brow let it dry out just leave
the top off and it'll get the perfect
consistency
I promise the time I skinned I'm using
the NYX honey do me up in Sierra primer
I've always always want to try this so
when I con this side above yes please
send me that I just never bought it
because it's seventeen dollars and I was
like has a lot for just stuff after
using it I see why seventeen dollars a
little goes a long way we don't know
much at all and it just makes your skin
glow I love it so for eyeshadow I'm
going to use the Oakland jupiter-8 color
eyeshadow palette this is $14 and do I
think it's worth it yes you guys you saw
my iPhone's begin the video scary though
but it's extremely pigmented I was so
shocked because you guys ever see those
tiles that look really pretty
then you get them you try them on and
it's not pigmented at all yeah that's
what I thought this is going to be but
it wasn't oh quickly to prime my eyes
I'm shooting the she cosmetics I primer
I believe like two or three dollars and
I'm yeah then I take two brushes from
the breast bed this is the fluffy brush
back it's fine
to be honest on all building works that
I look I was doing they were separated
but yeah I'm gonna take this yellow
shade first and I was really shocked by
how big did it was almost two guys on my
reaction I was like oh shoot
but I'm yet for like the I look would
have came up better and more smoother
and seamless if I had different brushes
but I just really want to stick to the
process ever send to me to see what I
can do but the brushes just were
bids in my opinion the second shade I'm
takin is this Bert orange shaped is
really really really pretty you guys
know I love foreign shadows or just
oranjee brownie like just warm shadows I
really love them and so again cup of
orange like mainly focusing on the outer
crease when I took this like Birdmen BH
:
and I've deepen the outer crease a
little more I pretty much as play stood
where I haven't orange yet then I
decided to take a yellow shade and kind
of put all of my lid because I wasn't
sure with this I love doing it so I
tried to try my lid just because alright
so now for found e that's a d'bari cause
I'm taking this 2 in 1 foundation
concealer by Milani this is $9 I've used
this before when I first usually made my
skin break out for some reason but this
time I did it so I got lucky and I
picked like a foundation buffing brush
from the brush set um this one really
working for me but I don't think it's
brush fix the product I feel like this
brush will work if the problem was more
thick and creamy
however the product is like creamy but
it's not really sick it's a weird
consistency I can't explain it but you
guys will see me switch out to a sponge
because yeah I was pretty much
struggling with that brush like you can
see in the camera but it was leaving
streaks and it wasn't blending it
seamlessly like I want it to so I've got
my sponge like I always do and I just
blend that out you can film use my la
girl HT / concealer on this site it's
three dollars it's good cheap because
other spices similar this one there's
one thing they have to like $5
I don't know when they raised it but um
yeah $3 is cheap to me because I see
discussed a lot of places and they're
like $5 or $4.99 which is being squeezed
$5 for that $3 that's good to me and
it's going to use my sponge to blend
that out
stamina back on my eyeshadow palette and
I think that orange and yellow shade and
Kylie mix them together and place it
underneath my lash line I'm not sure
what'll going with foods I know didn't
know what can I look on to do I knew I
didn't want to keep it just orange and
yellow kind of house pretty basic but I
was kind of like adding as I went along
so it really wasn't sure so set my
makeup I'm going to use la girl Pro face
pressed powder this is seven dollars and
it's my first one also using this I
thought I have uses before no I had it
before but the shade was too dark so I
didn't baqi like I started out like a
missile crazy
so this is my perfect shade so it
totally worked out
so here I am triad more like to my eye
looks like his file is lame so I went
back over and I blended the shadow out I
try to add yellow in my inner tear duct
area like I did my green I mean when my
previous videos looks like nothing
worked out the yellows little too dark I
think it wasn't like neon enough I think
that only works for neon colors and so
then I grab this shimmery shade so much
muscle use it to see if it works and if
it work but then I was like that's so
basic but everyone just does shimmery
shades on their list and so then I grab
the blue girl ooh I know super positive
and it was really good and so um yeah
that's what I did you guys I know this
probably have a video but I know at the
moment so you know I'm kind of excited
it looks pretty good and I really want
to use the blue I didn't know how I was
going to use it and turn down I knew
jamily so to blush and bronze I'm going
to use this rich on 6 blush and 6
bronzer palette now this palette wasn't
my favorite to be honest I wasn't a fan
that okay the bronzers had shimmer in
them I think the bronzers made great
blush which is like use them for because
the other side of hallow is really
bright to me I thought maybe they look
good on the eyes but I'm really not a
fan of like super bright blush anyways
you guys know this and so the bras are
made for good blush but when I used it
as a bronzer because I had shimmer in it
it made him a little ashy and it wasn't
really that dark either so wasn't really
like that great for my skin tone but I
tried to make it work it was okay but it
wasn't my favorite now my favorite part
on highlight I'm using this hi by Jake
at beauty and it is you globe girl base
highlighter and this is why Gigi 1:02
Twilight and this is $9.00 it is
beautiful you guys like I was so shocked
but honestly when I saw on their website
I was like okay I have the students
about this so I picked this one up all
the highlights and
interesting if you love this site and
you click on the highlight section it's
all the way at the bottom and I feel
like I should play at the top because
it's really great I wanted to a video
like battle of the cheap highlights and
just buy everything with cheap
highlights I know up and just test them
out to see which ones are the best but
this little wins already know these
themes it's like amazing you guys it
smoothly opens ooh
alright so semi face I'm using shake
head beauty mat makeup sign spray and
this is six dollars I sprayed like away
from me first because it's new and then
I spray my face with that and then I'm
gonna take a medicine spray um coos now
and this is by city color and to another
Matt's and spray of oil control and this
is four dollars so I want that something
more pools that I look so I just la
girls line art mess eyeliner pen and
these are $7 um I don't know if the risk
of a dollar cyclic after you use like
the first initial time the ink is in
that payment in Le sort of white you
know so while mix with your eyeshadow
color um without sort of annoying so I
kind of put a wing at the end just left
at bat now to line my lips a Penguin's
Atari Deluxe lip liner I've used it
before and they're actually really
really good it just depend on the color
you get any type of glue the color font
Brown but they don't have any more but
there's a two dollar so they're worth
the money definitely and now I'm going
to try to split pause I've never used
before it is called Kali jus my at home
to the right it's a little flower jelly
lip tint that looks clear very pretty
but you put it on it's a color and these
are $10 they're really pretty guys but I
was not like I don't like the color go
pink I don't know it would be this pink
like it said okay on the side it did say
like it's called Barbie doll powder so I
assumed it would be pink but I think it
would be this pigmented so I ended up
making my own lipstick which is what I
do
a lot I need to make a video on that um
but I'd make you my own lip shade
because this pink it wasn't ugly its
tinkle with
my look it just totally didn't so how to
make my own freakin lip color here's we
do first I scrape some of this brown
eyeshadow I knew I want to see brown
base because you look good with the eyes
and I use like this little eyelash thing
to mix it all together
and then I put the orange eyeshadow and
now I'm going to take the same elf line
are used in my brows to line my lips
because the other lip liner I have was a
little too warm and so on seems like
more of a cold Brown tone this only
thick think up like I said I'm trying to
use every single class I tend to be so
someone can improvise and so I line my
lips using that using a little liner
brush from the brush that I have and
then during a lot of pull over your
foundation color in the mixture just
make it more of a nude and then I used a
concealer to make it creamy to mix that
all together and that's how creamy lip
shade so I'm going to put it on my list
in like one second I don't know what's
taking me so long
oh yeah showing the concealer gosh oh
that part and then mix all together then
permanent
so after put on my lips I thought was a
little too cool tone so I got some eye
shadow and a fluffy brush I just Pat it
on top kind of like create the perfect
color for this eye shadow and that was
that
still for mascara business LA Colors
mega dramatic lash and we're pretty good
for being three dollars I just don't
like to coat I maybe like two and a half
but um you know I did that it works
pretty good
no adenomas mascara that's pretty much
the final look I was so fast I wear have
this came out I thought it was really
great in you do too please give a thumbs
up be sure to check out the hush side
I'm telling you guys the site is really
great and now I have
change my outfit and I'm assertive
