welcome so I just took a shower and I'm
going to do my makeup and you ready do
my hair kind of cool hair product I just
bought been out for a while I'm going to
see it right now I'm gonna try to liquid
hair chopped because I'm never shot it
before and I feel like it's awesome to
be honest and natural 85 so you guys
know I'm talking about in her name
I thought users I want to it maybe last
year I never thought to use it your
video on it and so I made this curly wig
and the clothes are so nice I don't want
to bleach die I don't want to touch this
hair and something I'm healing well how
can i spice it up into something
different
without bleaching or dying and I thought
that my thoughts of you I store Sally's
don't okay we won't do that then and
then I guess I'll test how long it stays
in the hair you know if it changes the
texture what it does to in it are those
details but before I even get to my hand
my makeup I want to give something away
I want to start doing giveaways or like
not announce I'm going to giveaway so
there's more people who might don't even
know you interior and I don't like that
so I want to give I just thought if you
sent these but I already hold these and
I think I'll be greedy to keep them and
they really keep packs you so I thought
it'd be key to give them away of course
into your weight I will be buying the
stuff I want you to think that I would
be able young free stuff I plan on
buying more stuff to get away but
nevertheless I want to give this away to
tension I hope I'm saying your name
right

Jordan I just want to give this away
because I want to say I noticed you dye

of the first comments and I love that it
makes me happy like when I close the

no don't call me your address
give me your address I could soon to see
you guys ASAP all right looking through
this video
alright so firstly into my hair now this
hair is from and I prayer hands write
their name all kind of juice me of
answer is here course but it's I don't
know died except dy 777 I don't already
say it I don't even know what it means
but that's much from they sent me this
hair I want to say at least three weeks
ago I'm just now getting to making a wig
out of it and I'm clearing that kind of
stalling it because well I'm mad because
I knew that the hair was nice when I
first got it
I just knew that the curls do believe it
is fluffy soft I mean kind of like get
the hang of hair when you get it a lot I
kind of like cut it myself once it dries
can be really poofy and cute I saw him
and he looks cute a little shorter
you're doing it um but I'll insert a
clip of how the hair come there you
could tell there are very established
brim and okay from the birds I work with
of course they don't establish you know
they all have their own website but any
expressed and all that stuff but I can
also do this in a brand that like it's
souvenir professional establish has
known thing together it's the brain
that's like kind of new or maybe they
just don't put a lot of energy into the
packaging or whatnot because some of the
decent hair is just in my little plastic
bag but they sent their own like they're
they're a little cute little savage
baggie
yeah you to tell the bear more Stalin if
you kinda their packaging and I always
notice that cuz I'm coming built in here
with no label I feel I have a look at
the tracking number in order to
determine whether the hair is coming
from cuz I won't know because they want
to send a label that's why I don't
nothing but a you know in the world
slides and a little cute baggie
they take their bundles or label as you
see in the video so I've got to say that
I have been having great exchanges with
the person I've been you know emailing
the company is super sessional and now
trend their hero and it's really not as
you doesn't see that I don't have to say
that we have to see that the hair is
very you tell you be tell it's not it
isn't the cheap curly hair you know
today it looks with a very natural curl
pattern and by the time video done the
hair should be dry so you guys to be to
see what it looks like when it's right
down so let me stop talking so much and
start working so I kind of cut my hair
to a little bit because um as you see
the top part are drying and you see how
you come fluffy and then it kind of gets
straight a little um because um seems
better the longer it's more weight and
it's kind of weighing down I don't know
how that look so I just want to like
I'll cut too much off I want to cut off
enough to where it's not being weighed
down and it looks more natural when it
dries out so I cut up a home at like two
inches or you know I cut off a little
bit because I just feel like that will
look better in my opinion this is my
preference and I like the look much
better told you now time to use hair
chalk now instructions wear gloves wash
hands and read yeah okay any old room
over here people so I have my gloves and
it's cool because Milo today I'm going
to do that a very like natural no
foundation look only because my skin
cover it and I can't tell but it's not
it's normal texture out and if I don't
want to like a whole bunch of heavy
foundation on anyways and I'm not really

balusters later and boy a dinner so I
don't need to make look like crazy full

pretty sure as a I don't know if you
will give this video maybe like say a
few thousand at least I'm one of the
person your creditors you know they're
great either
so you mean I have to say that we go to
the same you're not going to say

up what they go through and I'm coming
over just hide and make some it's not
normal but honestly it's okay I was like
a lot of people I got my credit card 18

shouldn't have used all right and the
longer limits it is to kind of like get
rid of the red just let my typeface move
my mac studio fix powder I'm just going
to give as a powder a little work I fix
it but it most part I'm just going to
set that I'm doing it really fast
like in a buffing motion I'm trying not
to put too much powder on you know for
everyday looks for like no makeup makeup
