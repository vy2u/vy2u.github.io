welcome IRA now this my channel what's
up I'm trying to give back this intro
stuff okay and I'm excited because I
love this hair i freakin unicorn you
know a great unicorns axe lowest in them
so you guys see the ends but I mean I
have a bias it on but you saw my boobs a
bit you know maybe I'll just cut scoot
back I don't want to show too much look
at this you guys I'm shipped by this guy
never had a haircut of those this
beautiful I can't believe I produce this
but I need you I was super easy to these
bundles became blonde I will say that I
have to say that because I'm is what I'm
looking at tutorials and I'm searching
for like how to get a certain color you
click on it and they'll talk for like
five minutes which I will probably do
but then you get to the part and it's
like sometimes when you're Lewin you're
looking for hands I hair you want to see
how they got it from like black to the
color because you usually have a 1b
bundle so I let you guys know right now
these bundles start off as bond so that
way if you're looking for a video where
you learned how to dye here this color
that stuff someone be this is not a
video however you should totally stay
this has I mean this car is awesome and
it's like I was really recommend my
blonde bundles anyways if you want this
color but let's go back up so I can
finish talking all right so this hairs
from her hair company now this video did
it for me because I usually work without
the Express companies but I'm so happy
that I do because I'm able to tell the
quality difference now Alex price
bundles like they're not bad at all but
you know that when you're getting here
for that Schumer price it's not gonna be
like the best quality you can get this
hair it is quality hair and I could tell
down from the way the track split I've
kept this track to show you guys an
example I don't know how many of you do
with hair like on a daily basis probably
probably not many less your hairstylist
I do para daily base hit like this is my
job and so when I make my wig I like to
split my tracks and that's when you get
a track and you split in half it's
simple you get like a little blade or a
knife late works better and you split it
in half and what that does is like well
one it gives you
more hair I feel like it helps it spread
but in times where I was writing out a
bundle I would just put the track and
make that spread so I do it a lot or it
makes the hair lay much flatter so a lot
of times I'll split the last bundle I'm
gonna have the top to make it lay
flatter and so from doing this I noticed
what had many experiences where I try to
put the track and the bundle wasn't
constructed the best it's nothing like
the Chubin hair the bundle is going to
be constructed the best way and so when
you're splitting the track it's so hard
to not cut the bundle you know the
bundle would usually rip but with these
trials you can split it you guys and it
goes let me get this way let me cut this
actually quite a bit example when you
just put these tracks you guys I'm
showing this because it's it's going to
show the quality of these tracks and the
bundles when you're explaining these
tracks so when you slowly track you just
kind of start from the end and you cut
an opening and that's how you split the
track Mootoo but you guys see how my
blade let me get this how it is conspire
and it's no like there's no ripping you
guys see that I'm gonna keep going that
is a dream and I know that may not seem
like a big deal but for someone who
works with awesome hair companies that
is that is so great because it shows
that their bundles are the West they're
constructed nicely this is quality okay
I'm just I have to emphasis on that
because I'm making this wick I was so
impressed with that I was like I talked
about
so anyways um I got a frontal in three
bundles I picked shorter limbs because I
knew I didn't want super long hair this
color I knew when I take blonde bundles
I knew I was going to like a fun color
because it's easy you could do when you
get for our models you can leave do
whatever color that you want and so I
knew that for me for my liking and I
would
like this hair super long it's just a
bit more traumatic for me I think this
is really due back as it is but um for
me oh look at that
Oh God for me I thought that this length
will be perfect for whatever Clyde chose
to do kind of be dramatic I didn't want
to like I don't want too much attention
you know I'm saying and so I got there
blonde bundles I got your rage and
streets now as far as like this hair my
loop if you do want to do this color any
length pastel color period if you want
to go buy a blonde bundles after this
video buy them from her hair company and
the reason why I say that is this I
would not recommend by blonde blonde
dose of Aliexpress and a lot of people's
when I was like I mean me that's when I
was buying hair I will see a video I'll
see the cost of the bundles I'm okay out
and they'll find that cheaper I don't
express but I don't recommend blue on
Aliexpress bundles and my no reason is
this a lot of times I work for Alan's
most companies I asked them for bond
bundles and I never let me use them and
that's because they know their bond
bundles aren't equality and so they
don't want me throwing those because
they they know they're not gonna be good
and so if if they're not even letting me
promote them and they don't want to sit
them to their review their reviews and
get themselves then it's like I don't
buy them like I wouldn't recommend
buying them because they wouldn't even
let me use it to promote because they
know that they're not the best and so if
you want to buy more bundles to achieve
this kind of color maybe this exact
color maybe like you know you'll do what
I do
or you wonder like a pastel color
totally buying one bundles from this
company because their bundles are
amazing it's the second time I've dealt
they're gone bundles each time no issues
whatsoever they have quality hair and
then I mean that's all there is to it I
have no name thing to say whatsoever you
like not even with you guys if I had
something back say I would say by now
and Stan I'm guessing his hair because
they just so soft
oh my god it just so lunch - bouncy I
don't have to talk you guys to see the
quality you guys can see it and so I'm a
similar but down I told you got
five minutes since 6:00 I'm sorry I hope
you are at least entertain imma let you
guys see how I got this color it was
fairly easy kind of time-consuming if
you want you know it to be like nicely
on braid and whatnot but it's totally
worth it like I said if you get these
bomb I know it's gonna be super easy
anyone can do this and so unless you
guys watch I got this color I'll show
you guys how I curl his hair and bid
like I said it took me forever because
this hair um it's a very thick it's
super thick and so it took me a minute
to curl this hair wasn't super easy
um so I show you guys how I curl this
hair just a little bit and then I'm i
doing slo-moes and that's about it so I
hope you guys are in this video if you
do like always give me a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
alright so first I'm going to show you
guys how the bundles came they're
perfect pretty blonde and you could see
and the bundles are super thick and it
is not stringy
none of that stuff it is thick roots tip
and so I died one bundle ahead of time
just to get idea of how the color would
come out because I hate why all the hair
at once and I end up messing up because
sorry to fix so I did one but a whole
time just to see you know the perfect
mixtures you know how I have to mix
things all that good stuff
and it came out great so I decided to
just go for it and dye the rest
alright so I'm gonna work on my frontal
first i'ma set up okay I got this down
add these clips and if you put the clips
on then kind of stretch it out um it
makes this process so much easier man so
much easier these clips are from Walmart
I got a bag of like 12 of them all
different sizes for seven dollars
they're so convenient and I'm yeah by
the way don't mind the lighting of my
camera is just my lighting was way too
bright so I kind of had to add the
saturation like tone down the exposure
so you guys can actually see stuff but
I'm here I'm staying on my dies it's
already dying the bulb from dying my
first bundle and I don't waste dies so I
just didn't wash them out because it
still had some like leftover diet so
first I'm gonna take this ion color
brilliance purple dye don't worry that
exact details would be down below and I
mixed that in first and these are for
the roots so I did three colors to kind
of create the perfect ombre effect so
these are the roots and so first I
squeezed the purple tube in there and
squeeze that purple in there
and then I'm gonna take this die by a
door and this is a shade
periwinkle three periwinkle god I hate
this work I'm gonna squeeze a lot of the
in there now this die is a pastel color
so I asked a purple so it can be more
pigmented but then I'm gonna add
conditioner to it because I didn't want
to be too dark because I wanted to go
further like a pastel vibe so I add
those two diets and add the conditioner
then I mixed it and then this coming the
perfect color
I knew it got me the perfect color
because I did test rent even before I
died that first bundle I died like one
little section for that bundle just to
make sure and that if the whole bundle
to make sure like it was perfect so I
really like test this out because when
I've got blonde bundles from her hair
coming to me for and I want to like a
soft pink but I didn't mix it with
enough conditioner so the soft pink
turned to a hot pink so like it just
didn't come out right and I filmed it
for you guys too but then this is the
wrong time for Coachella where my
computer got robbed and all the footage
is on there so it just ills shambles
I'm happy I did work with the hair again
because it's really really nice and I
love it so for the second color I'm
taking lavender and I'm gonna squeeze
lavender in there I'm gonna mix with
more conditioner it's like I said I'm
going for like more like a pastel a
color
so for the tips I'm taking soft lavender
by a door and it's more like a pinky
color and so I add that and then I'm
going to I don't think I act diet
conditioned earnest one yes I had a
little conditioner to this one as well
but not much because it was already very
light so it wasn't necessary to add too
much I was also running now so I
couldn't have much anyways but um I act
back and I mix it up and then my eyes
are ready and I'm gonna start applying
the color to the hair alright so I am
alright the one little section just kind
of like it the flow of it I'm gonna show
you guys how I do it I'm gonna like kind
of like keep this part at normal pace I
must feed it up
so I part it and then I brush it into
the hair that already has died on it
because it helps all the strands II
covered and then I'm going to take my
brush dip a little bit into the dye
because you don't want to do too much
because then in the dike a leak and get
on the lace and so I'm just dipping very
little because I'm not trying to mess
the lace which I deny and I'm starting
at the roots and it's so simple you guys
because this hairs re blonde and the
Tonys are done for you it's perfect so
I'm just adding that to the roots
and then I take the second color and I
add it more towards the middle and then
I take the light color out at the end
it's so simple you guys it's it's so
easy especially if you already have the
bundles blonde like this is literally
foolproof and see how anyone can mess
this up
so yeah you take the first color put it
at the roots the second color put it in
the middle and you overlap the color so
the ombre is more perfect like you see
how the parts where I'm putting the pink
how I overlap it in the lavender like
you want them all to mix so it's like a
perfect bomb brain it's really seamless
I'm going to transition to the bundles
now because I kind of showed you guys
happy the frontal so the bundle is the
same case you you know spread your
bundle out then you put the dart the
darkest color at the roots and then you
get the same color for this a color in
the middle and then you get the third
color and you put at the tips um and I
like to use a brush to brush it out just
to make sure that the color is evenly
distributed I hate that word
um throughout the hair so I'm just using
a brush to help me out and I did I think
yeah in this part I put the pink at the
end I focus on the roots first the
Pink's umm because although the ends I
mean the hair it's baked from root to
tip naturally of course the ins like it
I don't want to say thinner but they
what's now over thinner I don't want
that word thin I don't think it sounds
the best but for a lack of a better word
they get thinner so it's easier to pause
the color down there so if you want to
save time just do like the top two
layers first and then add the third
layer like what I'm doing right here cuz
it's easier I can't explain why is just
simply easier so I'm just talking down
we'd like you know let you guys watch me
do this and I'll check back in once I'm
all done
sorry for my shaky camera but once
you're done you just want to massage the
dye into the hair because I mean this
dye isn't cheap and I'm not like going
back into fix mistakes it is very easy
to miss spots to trust me so I'm just
massaging it in and then I'm gonna rinse
it dry it make it into a wig I was do
and then hear how here's gonna look on
the street this looks great I'm kind of
mad and keep it straight and looking
back but I want to curl it just for fun
but this is how it's looking when it's
straight it looks so nice you guys and
believe it or not this is just it
blow-dried I didn't even straighten the
hair comes too lazy after mixing the
lake so this is just the hair blow-dry
it it looks late as hell and so now I'm
gonna comb my hair I'm willing to show
in this part I wanted you to see just
how easily it how nicely this hair
curled and you guys are gonna see it
with this first curl just watch watch
how beautiful it curls it's so bouncy
nice you guys see how it just bounced
right up super nice hair is so nice you
guys like Oh sickens me I want to die
this wig all purple just so it's more
wearable cuz I mean honestly when I went
out today we're in this wig yeah it's
pretty but it almost attracts too much
attention and believe it or not I always
want that so I kind of wanted I like a
dark purple just so it's like it's cool
but it's not like damn she's a uniform
you know what I mean I'll probably do
that cuz I want to reuse his hair like I
wanna wear this hair again this color
just way too bold for me so I'm just
gonna you know show myself flatter it
not flaring it curling it just a little
bit gonna speed this part up when I cut
some parts out because I mean you guys
have seen me do this before and then
we'll be back for my slo-moes
