you're new welcome
I'm arnelle and I just got done making
this win I wanted to do with updated
Hama quick for beginners video because I
have one already but I'd like my
camera's better quality now and I
learned something new that's like makes
the wigs better and I just started doing
it a little differently that I showed in
my previous video and so that's why I
did this one so I want to update it now
take the funding by the way I put it on
me however I made this wig for one of my
subscribers title die maker 1 I was
gonna make her like a 1 you see like my
old hair that's what I Rosie said but I
was like - andreas lungs I have so many
wigs do like I believe this one so this
is her she's on the mannequin head
chillin
she looks really nice I do plan on
customizing her and whatnot but yeah
this video is just pretty much how to
make a look for beginners it's super
easy don't mind if I look a mess right
now focus on Sheila that's her name
it's springtime a wig for beginners I do
not I don't so this a new just to answer
frequently asked questions because I
make all my legs using blue my first one
making wigs I still kinda that was the
only way but when you're like I can't
stand straight when you're getting even
sit so much hair it's like it's
impossible just so all those wigs and so
ever side is covered gluing that's all I
do all my legs I'm anti-glue they all
last people always ask me this glue last
the thing is this the reason I think goo
doesn't and I know why because I had to
do glue ins but our glue tracks to my
scalp to blue my natural hair and those
kind of glue and still lasts because
your scalp like your head and naturally
like sweat and so we can get swept this
track slip but the tracks being moves
like cotton like a mess material so it
holds back to that versus your actor
Scout even when you sweat a won't let's
like the mesh kind of block side doesn't
even wig cap on and so to answer
question I was the axis question about
my wigs
glue does last and this for like
you like one little slip of a track if
you like being super rough but other
than that your last can you wash the wig
with the glue yes you can I would
recommend Congress many washing the ends
and not really getting on to the roots
like that because of other roots the
roots because then like you know you can
loosen up the tracks
however they are I have ones that I wash
all the time that I made with glue and
like maybe like one track maybe like a
little glue for a touch-up but it would
not off it won't the wig won't fall
apart like you may assume so I had
answer that because I got acts at a lot
of my previous video and I comes custume
before not answering it in the video so
yeah little ass this method is super
easy to do I feel like anyway that make
a wig if we do it this way it's so
simple so and it's very easy if you
don't know so like just get a piece of
cotton your legs needle thread just come
just practice and practice so easy I try
to be very informative and get like
different angles to show you guys what
I'm doing so hopefully it helps if it
does give you a thumbs up please
subscribe and I'm I don't again anything
to say Sheila I'm so goofy it's super
late I'm tired which is like a best car
fun but um meet Sheila I'm gonna go at
this video so we get up you know pretty
soon so uh yeah if you get to this video
give a thumbs up and please subscribe
for Sheila there alright so first we're
and work on this front oiler make a good
win you have to work on the front so
first try to get some close-up action my
lens
help me I'm like dude your new camera
with the head anyways um here's a
frontal before you can see the knots and
just no longer has a black knots in your
scalp it's not an actress so we have to
bleach those I'm taking my on color
brilliance bleach you can use any bleach
for this to be honest I might use this
along some blue bougie and then I'm
gonna kneel pour some powder I pour a
lot only cuz I was bleaching another
frontal um during this process like
knock out two birds one stone if you
think about that seeds actually really
mean like why would you want to kill two
birds anyways you're good developer and
you mix that all up I'll ah I have like
six whisk and I lost all of them so I
mix it with my butter knife which is
what I'm gonna use to spread the bleach
on the frontal anyways that I mix that
up I am going to spread the bleach like
butter all
over my frontal and now I'll leave that
on there I left on it for 20 minutes and
then I rinsed it off and then I did this
twice it seems like I do that each time
bleach frontals now like I don't know it
soon what they bleached better when you
do it the second time around so I do
this twice because I mean it'll look
much better trust me just do it twice do
didn't um yeah so yeah keep doing this
and I'll check back in after I rinse it
out so I rinse the front one I used
purple shampoo so that way like it
didn't look so yellow it looks kind of
brassy but trust me like it looked worse
so you wanna rinse the purple shampoo
let the purple shampoo sit for 15
minutes can't tone the frontal and then
um here are the bundles I will be using
this hair is from alia Gray's hair one
of my favorite companies and this oh not
this these are 14 inch bundles so you
need a wick half a dome cap I like the
mesh ones they seem to stretch more than
the other style ones you need your stock
from head and so first we're gonna place
the frontal on to the styrofoam head and
you're gonna nice
t-pins like these super cheap you get
like a pack of like 15 or something
crazy fun $2 so first I pin the front
down and the frontal kind of like has
like this little curve so I pinned it in
the middle of that curve it'll make
sense when you're doing it then I pin
the back and then you're gonna pin down
these sides right here you see how the
little fabric it's thick then it stops I
pin it right here to where I'm pouring
it pointing at right there I pin it
right there it seemed like that it works
the best for me so that's how I do it
and I pin one side and then this front
feels a little big so I kind of had to
like I kind of struggle to just seen
this like I had to like take that off
then stretch it and pin you on the other
side that's all you have to do and I'm
just so it really really tight whenever
the front was little too big eager cut
it or really really finessing so then
you need a needle and some a thread I
showed myself threading it's like I've
got plates on my last video that I
didn't do that so I did it this one so
easy just put an old and then you tie it
and I like to double knot it so I do one
knot first in order to get the perfect
double knot while I tie it again I hold
on to the first knot to make sure that
the second knot falls into the same
place
detailed gods and then I start sewing
now this guy chickie cows trying to make
sure you guys saw everything I was doing
but then it's like it was kind of hard
for me so it's like really you know work
my ankle really finessed this whole
situation because I was like dang dude
like I want are like what am i what am i
doing where do I go
give me like three seconds I don't know
I was prior texted but anyways I figured
out the best way to do was this way I
just wanted you guys to really see what
I was doing so when I first start on the
frontal I sold like three times at the
end to make sure that in is really
really secure two or three times just
make sure you so pretty tight and then I
start sewing it along oh my god Milo
anyways um if your if like the front is
a little too loose just get on a tee pin
and then you kind of like stick it like
you know just to make it like lay flat
that makes it easier so and so you know
grab your t pin stick in that you can
continue to sew but um yeah I sew like
two three times and I just sew the rest
of the frontal it's actually really easy
this is gonna be like pray
I see if like so in a frontal is easier
than glue in the tracks down but that
could just be me it's just different for
everybody but it's it gets easier the
more you do it you know what I mean like
it is just practice makes perfect
I wasn't good at this when I first
started it took a lot of time to like
develop a technique that worked the best
but um just keep practicing don't give
up
or not I'm officially part of the
quality God Squad I had to know these in
close-ups I love this camera so much
it's so cool so um yeah here's some
close-ups for you guys you know just
just see you know like what I'm really
doing and I'm just sewing and see I use
cotton thread which is what I use in my
original video but today I think this is
called nylon it's the opposite of cotton
or whatever and I like nylon more
because it's a thinner type I guess
you'd call this fabric it's a it's a
very type thread and so it looks so
seamless with cotton because it's like
thicker you could see it and you keep it
fill it with this thread you can barely
see it because it's thin now it's more
tricky to use I will omit that it's kind
of taking me time to adjust to and even
then like someone's like the string so I
get tangled and you kind of have to pull
in and really work where then you got to
move slow however I feel like it lays so
much flatter and it makes your wigs look
so much better so I definitely recommend
nylon overcome
oh I saw it the whole frontal down
pretty simple and now I'm going to take
this off the Styrofoam head and here's
what I'm doing differently I'm gonna add
fall onto the Styrofoam head because
back when I used to only like um before
I did this and I'll glue the tracks with
the mesh the glue was seep through the
mesh and so when I pulled off the wig
the styrofoam like particles would get
on to the wig cap and it's like it
doesn't bother me you can't see it it
just doesn't have the cleanest look so
I'm already the cleanest look I put foil
down first because the glue does not
stick to foil so when you take the wig
off the little Styrofoam head none of
the little white pieces will get stuck
to it so that's something I really
taught myself and so um you know here's
the bun I'll be working with I mean I'm
gonna work with all the bundles but I'm
just showing you guys you know what it's
looking like I'm gonna do another
close-up so you guys can see the webs
these les constructor really really
really nicely you guys can see it's neat
all the way through um although it's
like single left it's a little thick but
the tracks were able to be split and
I'll show you guys that later so first
you need to glue and then all you have
to do I start off by like you know of
course doing the track of the bottom and
you measure the track okay and take your
time on this you know I didn't speed up
too much of this video because I want
you guys to see me doing this in real
time so you take the track and then you
cut it and then you put your glue you
want to feel like a even layer not too
much but not too little I'm showing you
guys right here you want to put that
amount and then what you want to do is
take a blow-dryer and you want to like
kind of like make it a little tacky and
the color is going to change slightly
it's going to get a little bit darker
and that's when you know it's cool don't
dry it too much maybe like five seconds
just to where it gets that dark it'll
help it stick to the dome cap better
trust me if you don't do this the tracks
are just gonna slip and although
eventually dry it just makes it take it
makes this process so much longer it
needs to be and then you just place the
track onto the dome cap and then you
just hold onto and just press it down
and make sure it's really
cure you guys think I'm pressing down
for maybe like well like five to ten
seconds like I said I did not speed this
up so you guys can see just how long it
takes per track and then after you kind
of hold it down to where it's not gonna
slip if you let it go you go blow-dry to
cut my hand where I'm placing the heat
so the heat is directly hitting the part
that I wanted on you know what I mean um
so you know it's really drying and then
I press down again just to make sure
it's secure
and then um that's pretty much it I
moved to the next track and I pretty
much do this for the whole entire wig
Acadia track my slip just a little bit
but um as long as you pressing it down
and you blow-dry it it's not gonna fall
out you trying to really take your time
with this don't rush this I've done that
before and the wig didn't last as long
so um yeah just I'm gonna repeat the
same step I'm not gonna speed this part
up because I want you guys get the hang
of it and I'll check back in and like
one sec
damnit
so after I do one bundle I split the
next one because as I get close to the
top I want the tracks to lay flatter it
just makes the wig look much better so
in order to split you just get a blade
and just split it right in the middle if
the track is nicely constructed you can
just drag the blade down which is what I
could do for this um this hair and so
yeah you just some split the track that
way you get more hair and it just lay so
much flatter because it makes the track
like thinner and so what I always do is
I do one bundle first and then the top
two bundles I split the track just
really just makes the wig look much
better and just just just do it okay you
can use a knife for this too by the
exacto knife seems much easier
all right so I glued a few tracks and
then once I get to this part here's what
I do I kind of glue in a u-shape but I
stop right here and the reason I stopped
right here is because if you continue to
you shape all the way above we get to
the top and do the track the last shot
across you'll still be to see a little
bit the track on the corner if that
makes any sense at all
so I glue it this way that way when I
start gluing across all the tracks are
covered I really hope making sense I
wish there was like an easier way I
could explain this but I pretty much
don't glue track all the way like to the
frontal because I just learned by doing
it this way all the tracks are covered
because I used to do it where I just do
the you know you shape all the way
across and but then you can kind of see
tracks depend on how you part the hair
anyway like the wind blows so I just do
this way this is a way like I've learned
to work the best so hopefully I made
sense and then I start gluing the tracks
across you can't do it you shape the
whole time because I mean eventually the
frontal you want the tracks to kind of
like lay have the front toes Lane
so you want to start gluing straight
across once you get like caimen to the
top like work what I'm doing right now
basically
I just keep gluing the tracks and I just
kind of go in the angle in which the
front hole is going because I know I'm
being closed that I kind of like zoom
you guys in each time I went and then
the last final piece you just glue it as
close to the frontal as possible you
press it down you make sure it's really
flat and secure and that is pretty much
how you make the wig I really hope you
guys my god sorry my little is he
sneezed I'm sorry but anyways um I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
wait pause once I'm alive so I rose to
me and said all my videos I'm like oh my
god you guys sorry Milo's doing this
mom's doing that and there is so right I
literally do that anyways um this is the
final track all right after that I'm
going to just get a comb and press it
down and imma show you guys I you know
once I put the hair from the front over
it it's seamless but as I was saying I
hope you guys found this video helpful I
really did try to you know make it
informative and as detailed and you know
nice as possible if you found this video
helpful if you're gonna make wig after
watching this video a wall and watching
this video um give this video a thumbs
up and let me know down below and I hope
you guys enjoyed Sheila she enjoyed you
