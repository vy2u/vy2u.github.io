hey guys so I just got done filming this
lip for you guys Wow
that's all that someone's doing donuts
you know what this is why don't you talk
through because in this city I live in
literally every single time I start to
talk I hear sirens
maybe I hear that shot maybe ate your
doughnuts I could just heard of me to
stop anyways Oh
anyways so just get that famous look for
you guys now didn't come to I shadow
look only because I did it before I
started to look um partially because I
do you know what doing the video so that
would be too long and I'm still kind of
like playing with the palette I got the
where are you palette morphe 35o palette
so I'm still kind of like testy
different looks with in trying to see if
I come up with looks that are unique
because to be honest um a lot of you
guys when I post the julius place the
new iam palette a lot of you guys asked
what was the Duke furthermore if you 35
oh and I'm like how would I know I don't
got I don't have that morphe 35o and I
have it it is a do like they're super
similar so it's a kind of hard to do
looks with it because it's like I've
done some looks with a dubious placed
palettes like weed what can I do now so
I'm just trying to play with it but if
you guys like this I struggled I'll do
it I just feel like I've done it before
I don't know maybe I have to look at my
videos I don't remember if I didn't know
I've done this look before um but if you
guys liked it I'll tell me I don't mind
I'll just maybe I'll throw a video
showing you decide you looks cuz palette
I don't know I mean I kind of want team
that I don't cuz this just sell us so
fast I don't know if you guys would be
to get it or not but it's amazing I will
see that um let's see yeah so I just
made a film it stunk updated foundation
routine in this sense like I add new
foundation I'm absolutely in love with
kind of do different stuff now and I'm
using new favorite products I'm using
the same exact product for like home
over a week now because I'm in love with
him so yeah my parents
my parrot she's on punishment with me
right now because yesterday I was being
nice to her we were having a good time
we were talking she was giving me kisses
and then she attacked me out of nowhere
and she bit the hell on my back my whole
back was sore for at least two hours and
I still have a wound on my back that she
pierced his skin and everything I was
bleeding and I was like how could you I
was like I'm your favorite I was so
upset with her even now every time I
walk by superval and she says hi and I'm
like I'm not talking to you
look at that legit have an ad to with
her she looked at talk to me but anyways
film this look I think it's awesome yeah
that's it I don't want this to be super
nature oh my god sorry long um yeah I'll
see you as a minutes video so first I
take my Laura Mercier radiance bronze
primer this is my favorite primer up to
date now I did buy the full size but it
turns out the lady gave me a tinted
moisturizer it's not the primers I have
to go back and return it I'm really
really mad the fact that I bought it
just shows just how much I love it it's
I don't honestly I just love it gives
you really nice glow and it's super
lightweight and being that I'm super
picky when it comes to primers yeah I'm
pretty much in love so after rubbing
that primer in and then took my NARS
sheer glow foundation now this is my
first time actually trying the
foundation wolf I've had it for a week
so I've been trying for a week but this
lick the first time I brought it I used
to always want to get it back when I
first I wanted make up but they are
always sold out of my shade but man guys
this foundation is absolutely amazing it
may be my favorite foundation I just
love how natural and it's just it makes
my skin look flawless and super smooth
and glowing I'm absolutely love I'm
already planning on buying a new one now
I'm gonna take my pro bono concealer
with the new do the through liquid
bronzer now the liquid bronzer um it's
actually my color so it was not going to
bronze me but I learned that by mixing
with the lighter concealer it helps tone
it down so it doesn't look super intense
and it also kind of things out the
formula of the actual concealer so it
actually helped like it made it easier
to blend so that's what I'm going to use
it for
now I'm going to take everyone's Holy
Grail products laura mercier loose
setting powder i just recently bought
this about a week ago and so i've tried
using it by itself i tried mixing it
with a banana powder i prefer using by
itself even though it's much brighter it
sets really really well you know i don't
think i've noticed is that like with red
banana powder when i cry my makeup kind
of stays intact with this powder when I
try my makeups all ruined so that's the
only thing I noticed but I think that
the powder is great now for bronzer I'm
using hoola by benefit to give me a
little hula being and a brush with my
name on it now I'm not going use a brush
so I think it's too cute and I just
don't want touch it so I'm gonna use a
big brush it's also super new my benefit
and it's super fluffy and flexible and I
super love did I learn up this video
that's probably not best to put the
bronzer on with it if you're trying to
get like a contour it's more - bronzer
entire face but I end up doing that
later you guys forget I mean in a sec
and if you guys didn't notice typically
when apply bronzer on I set my entire
face first and I always cream contour I
did not do that I simply just put the
bronzer while like my face was still wet
with foundation if that makes sense so
yeah I've been doing that a lot lately
excite the product sticks much more to
the face so that's what I've been doing
now - that dust away that were Mercier
powder off I let it sit for like a
minute or two yeah now I'm just gonna
blend that away very very well
ok so now it's bronze on actual face I
mean the smack bombs and powder and at
first I kind of went over the areas eye
contour that but then I kind just like
put the stuff all on my face and this
brush was so perfect for that it's just
so fluffy and soft I just kind of want
to keep rubbing over my face and I
realized hey I'm filming so I should
probably hurry up ok so now I'm going to
take my NARS blush is also named it's
caught Taj Mahal it's a really nice
shimmery orange blushes now anyone that
knows me personally notice I'm obsessed
orange blushes I feel like they're the
best blush as ever so so happy to
finally buy this because it's like my
new fave now to hide I'm taking laura
geller gilded honey and I'm going to
spray with some setting spray just to
make it more pigmented this highlight is
so nice like I literally was so excited
to get it I bought the last one at Ulta
and I was so excited because it gets
sold out freaking everywhere so it's
very hard to get but when I tell you
what you get it you use it every single
day like I'm not lying now for my lips
I'm going to use these liquid lipsticks
from sonica Laura cosmetics I hope
they'll say that right the last time
spelled kind of weird they raised
Allison gives the Caliph dates like a
month ago and I've used them multiple
times so I am well aware of the formula
they sent me I believe six of them but
my two favorites are at the ones I'm
going to use its vintage moth and
caramel oh um the vintage mob is like a
perfect pink and for some reason I get
the feeling that it will look great on
all skin tones because I don't know I
thought the shade is just very I guess
you could say the universal and the
formula is super duper creamy and smooth
and when it dries they claim to the kiss
proof and they actually are cuz I swear
dude it won't go anywhere
oh yeah and I mind my lips
after the fact just so um it blends in a
little easier you know I don't like that
super duper like lip liner line whoa
and it's not all the time and so after I
do that I'm gonna add the shade
caramello which is like a more like
grayish tone no matter I explain it it's
like more greyish and I just add that in
the middle and mix it in with the pink
yeah son one sec I'm gonna show you guys
other cosy sit me they see me like this
hot pink one this super nude one this
red one the blue one the only one I
really liked the most was the red
because I love deep breaths but far as
the blue of remember we're and the hot
pink I do not wear Pink's like at all
and the other nude was a little bit too
nude for my skin tone but i swatched on
my hand just to give you guys an idea of
what that looked like
that's pretty much it I really hope you
guys enjoyed this little video I try to
show you guys a video of me using my new
products don't worry my next video will
be my drugstore tutorial so stay tuned
for that and please like subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
