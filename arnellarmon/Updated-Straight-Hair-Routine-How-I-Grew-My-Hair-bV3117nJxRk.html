welcome cij's videos need to be on me
straighten my hair somebody's gonna get
a lot of comments that people ask me to
updated straighten my hair and to do at
the live chat and just talk about what
I've been doing you know me had my hair
grow because my hair is through a loss
the last time I straighten out my
channel I know in that video I saw some
Street and once an Austrian kid but like
now it sounds a lie but it's kind of
lives I straighten my hair at least like
10 times since then however although
look my hair doesn't look like cool
right now my curls are still super duper
defined and so I'm gonna show you guys
so I've been doing orders extreme my
hair to get super silky straight but
it's also like not gonna damage my hair
either so let's get started so my
favorite thing to use when I blow-dry my
hair is this kenra platinum blow dry
spray looks like this the focused this
are my favorite spray ever I got put
onto this like over two years ago and
ever since then I always buy it I love
it a lot so I just kind of factory my
hair in that and my hair is like freshly
washed and conditioned and I just let it
kind of air dry so it's still most of
it's driving the most part but some part
is still a little bit this soft like he
protected so that's not so much and then
I'm gonna use my Anika blow dryer Mike
Holmes broken but you have a comb that's
not broken I'm on site just use this
side it won't make a difference
and I blow-dry my hair on high heat and
like high will dry whatever and once
thing so in my previous video where I
straighten my hair I didn't have a
bullet red comb so I just like brushed
my hair while blow-drying it I'm a
purple Ajay comb it gets my hair
straighter and I just bring my blow-dry
my hair until like it could no longer be
boys right even figured like if I can
get my hair it's possible with will dry
I can I
after you splatter unless so do that
before you put your your checks in just
brush your hair out a little bit to get
rid of tangles I'm not doing out so I'm
just too lazy but I do feel tangles in
my hair so in order to avoid you know
causing the breakage I guess you could
say my hair doesn't break up I got those
so that's why I'm not gonna do it but
let your hair is more coarser and
thicker I would definitely recommend
tingling it first before you do this but
mine like it gets a little tangled but
like it's not so tangle toward this
can't comb it out that makes it alright
so here fully dried I think that's as
blue drugs I'm gonna get it now to
flatter so I said a spot on I've had it
before
however dislike my favor flag whatever
besides my kimchi one this is a babble
Asst or B needless Alabama's Pro nano
titanium I bought this planet before at
ultimate 140-150 I had it for less than
a month like stepped on it
one morning was in a rush to like really
I stepped on it it was like seven the
morning and I was so mad
get mad I just looked at it I was like I
just kept on moving I can't even get
back I'm like dang I can't do anything
about it so I bought a new one and yeah
I'm gonna plug it up all right
so first things first I still hold
whatever so I like to do my hair in
sections so I'm gonna part Steve hookers
for me please I'm gonna part to the back
part like section and all the doesn't
have to be even it doesn't matter and
then I'm gonna like put this top part on
ponytail I hope I'm in focus okay then I
split two fat sections so the back two
sections and put this side it
like this select where is that something
I'm super impatient and I'll like fire
and big chunks out straighten big chunks
I'm not gonna be bursting and uh yeah
it's much better if you just use like
thinner smaller sections and take your
time because they'll last longer so
that's what we're gonna do so I'm going
to part a little section this small clip
up the rest of my hair
we're gonna strain it okay and I like to
use a comb to help me guide not slowly
down though I wanna make sure I really
get like the root area too
mmm 50 I'm going to go to 2015 a little
bit it's not hot like enough so I'm just
gonna move it up to 20
I think 25 of it perfect yeah absolutely
25 because although it's like
straightening it it's not like drinking
mint so uh but it's cool though
it's cool - stronger lower heat just to
kind of like see how it works just never
saw everybody Heath it's too high to
burn your hair alright so now I'm going
to part out another piece very thin
pieces and with this flag with this
straightener I'm going to be able to
have these at home but it's so thin and
it's so close to the roof you don't have
to do all that oh so sweet
boom okay heaters on
my bad guys I forgot my heater on so my
toes are cold sorry for that sound but I
might adjust to see like when I'm
straining it I'm kind of bumping the
ends kind of ugh that looks better for
my hair hey you said I record another
section I have to cut out some of this
footage because I was talking I forgot
that I put my heater on I always have a
feeder a heater next to my feet come by
toes are always cold and so I mix a lot
of noise all those fur gets turned off
but what I'm doing is under strain in my
hair I'm not going to comb anymore
because I'm learning that with this flat
this straightener it's so thin and it
gets so close figured I don't really
need a comb in order to help strain my
hair
and I'm just doing one pass and then
when I get to the bottom I'm kind of
bumping it only because I forgive me it
just makes my hair look better like how
it looks this is a really nice and
that's just with one pass I know on my
previous video I got a lot of comments
and some complaints people say that I
didn't need to like go over the piece of
hair morning ones I think I learn didn't
have to I just kind of do got a habit
you know I mean me straighten my hair
you kind of like do it like more than
once but just control yourself you do
not have to do more than once if you get
straight the first time I know it's so
tips to go over it second time it just I
don't know why what it is but you don't
have to like this perfectly fine so I'm
not going to do it
I'm so tempted to do it but if you think
about it like you think that let you get
singer straighter for some people it
does but if you're hearing it straight
the first time around like you're
literally just putting on that circuit
on it for no reason so don't do it so
now I'm trying out another section this
was pretty thick I don't feel like
fixing it so I'm gonna use the comb for
this one
the thinner section you don't have to
use a comb for I feel like for the
thicker sections the comb tells
if you see me do this well I do that
first and then I finished the piece of
hair it's because this part of the hair
like the roots it could take more heat
because it's new grill so it has done
like mega damage you don't want to go
over the ends you know lots of times
because your ends are the most damaged
piece of your hair you look it's been
like going through a lot of stuff so if
you want to really get your roots
straight it's okay if you go over your
boots more than once
however just don't do too much to the
ends because I mean I am the action in
trim I need to come on Jessica yeah
definitely and shrimp but yeah you just
don't to go to him on your ends on same
okay so I'm going to stream the other
side our camera some comedy the same
thing and I have a video on this and
then I'll be back to you guys you know
why do grow my hair although I always
forget see it I have to talk about in
this video some straight this side
really fast and I'll be right back I
should be one of those like commercials
where they I don't know if this will be
hair commercials so before I was gonna
do you know I miss like freaking edge to
bro I already do it fit I Salima edges
amuse my kiss and fixer and love this
stuff like it's a last me forever
I hope um let me use my ugly toothbrush
just lay some slight baby ears
well those agree and when we're thinking
I'm gonna use my kiss hair oil I have
two bottles one smaller of course use a
very little dough and you don't need a
bunch at all actually let the style I
never wear my hair to straight down I
always come put it up but I'm going to
try keep it down we need to be really
fast
you guys this feel like a hundred
dollars right there
I love them I like options and I like
these ones I bought had good earrings
for everyone my favorite place to get
hearings I know myself I know me to put
in my hair I'll try to keep it down
because I was becomes well you should
have kept it down
alright so quickly what I've been doing
to keep like grow my hair out because
everyone keeps asking this if I've never
said before so we're gonna say it again
the only thing I've been doing besides
wearing wigs that's like wings to help
mr. pecker style I pick sugar bear hairs
on these now I get it I get that
the Kardashians promote that this and I
get that you know other people who don't
have to take it promote this and
honestly to kind of a custom low because
if you're gonna say these are free you
might as well take them like I
understand that a lot of bloggers they
didn't see where they just gets tougher
free and then promote it and never
actually use it but like why wouldn't
you just take the Cubbies your hair is
new totally grew I've minded it so I
started I've been taking sugar bear hair
for maybe like eight months now I
it's not eight months or nine they've
sent me through four pack it has in the
year though hasn't it a year I bet you
something multiple packages and each
time they send me three bottles and I
think they've sent me like four so
that's twelve bottles this is my tenth
one cuz I have one more I think I've
been do this for nine to ten months
almost a year and that's look I'm gonna
give credit to this because that's what
I notice a lot of growth now I did start
wearing more wigs around that time but
even before I was run away - my hair
wasn't growing as fast as day when I
took those so let and that a lot of
people don't believe me when I say that
it's the gummies because
I feel like so many people promote them
it's hard to believe it and I totally
get that like when I first start seeing
the sugar bear
I think I saw like highly promoted I
believe that I'm like god no
they're probably super weak I do not
think they will work because I just feel
like somebody promote it and don't
actually use them they just get paid
motive but like I actually take them I'm
addicted them it tastes super duper good
and I'm literal proof that they actually
work because other than wearing wigs
that's the only thing that I've been
doing I have not done any fancy hair
mask any like hair treatments ain't
meant that at all yet I plan on doing
that more often I'll film that process
and the only day I've been doing is
taking those gummies and that's how my
hair's grown I just like I guess you
could say from being honest and you kind
of frustrated with something you asked
me about it and I always say it because
it makes me feel like you guys don't
trust me and I think that you should
because like I don't understand I
haven't given us any reason not to trust
me so I see something works for me now I
do get that not everything works for
everybody so if you have tried this and
it doesn't work for you not everything's
gonna work for everyone I'm just telling
you guys what honest things were for me
and I mean you might as well just give
it a try that you really can't hurt to
give it a try you know to me and so i
yeah i'm no longer sponsored by them i
was sponsored by them i would post
instagram posts that were paid for
however whenever you would seem to talk
about my Instagram story whenever I
mention in my videos that is not
sponsored I'm not getting paid to talk
about this at all
like literally I do it because I want to
the only time I'm getting paid to do
something you never see the hashtag ad
if you don't see hashtag ad and you'll
see in the description box like hey in
this video sponsor I shoulda gray hair
then it's I'm not getting paid to do
this I'm really when you're talking
about it because I actually like to
stand by the product so that's how I
begin my hair to grow I plan on doing um
half my hair up that's like my thing oh
I plan on doing more natural hair videos
I am in like cosplaying it because I'd
like my hair's to at awkward length
however Ivany a lot of comments of
people saying that their hair is that
awkward limbs to you so if I did more
videos just short different styles and
more helpful so because my hair straight
I'm most something
a video on how to do quick and easy
styles for awkward length hair after I
film this video and so um yeah I don't
really want to make this video to super
long I think I've said everything to say
if you have any like recommendation
