in for some reason sighs all I can do in
my videos like with no intro so it's
like less talking more tutorial so I'm
going to start off by taking my Jo a
cosmetics daily treatment oil I believe
that's the name you'll be down below I'm
using to hydrate my skin before I prime
it and then to prime I'm going to use
this Kat Von D hydrating primer I like
the close calls I'm pretty sure it's
like a hydrating it's a hydrating primer
okay I'm using a lot of pause that's
going to make sure my skin stays very
hydrated because the weather is very
annoying and it's cold and it's grainy
and I usually drive my skin out which
makes it breakout which I don't want
so foundation I'm taking this hourglass
stick foundation and this is very very
hydrating it's super creamy so I think
it's great for dry skin for the skin I
want to say hell no but I want to curse
it's not a curse word
heck no for what it's good like this is
probably shambles
okay shambles but for dry skin it works
pretty good by the way I want to say I
kind of comment on my last video saying
stop smoking that stuff someone who
knows hiding my voice over I was not
okay I was in New York my life's in
shambles all over the place and a lot
was going on you guys but anyways don't
leave the clinic comments because it was
leaving too anyway so concealer I'm
gonna take this Kevin o'clock concealer
also very very creamy I honestly I'm not
even like a super duper professional so
when I say that process not the best for
a thorough skin type don't like be
scared to try it cuz you never know it
is my personal opinion from doing make
one people but um this concealer I don't
know if it will work the best on oily
skin because it's so stick and creamy I
just I can't imagine doing like well
oily skin and I'm using it like I said
in beginning video I'm trying to like
you surprised my help with dry skin but
yeah I don't know it's really hard it's
really hard uh see I hate saying like
it's less for dry skin or suffered all
these things I don't I don't people get
scared to try certain stuff but I kind
of to warn you based on how the product
feels on my skin so hope it helps
Conn's let me take this mix highlight
and contour do and I will take the
darker side of course when contouring
and contouring my cheekbones my nose my
forehead and my jawline honestly like if
you have like a slight double chin when
you really contour your jawline it may
seem like it's like a little extra icing
that too but when you do it less
facetune for you I promise you because
every time I do this I have to face to
my photos less you know like it just
looks great okay just do it if you have
a double chin which a lot of people do
and it kind of sucks my engine etic no
matter how much weight I lose like I
still have a little token that's okay
now I'm going to take my lower stages
into powder I think use my Chanel powder
a lot I kind of like want to use both to
sort of remembers you know one now it
may look like I've put a lot of powder
on which I technically a.m. and it may
be contradicting the fact that I'm try
not to dry my skin out but the way I put
my powder on I make it to I those cake
up because I put a thin layer first and
that should just set the concealer and
then I put powder on top of that so the
second layer powder isn't really
penetrating my skin is just sitting on
top of that first thin layer if that
makes sense so that way when I brush it
off it's not you never see later it
won't look cakey at all and it won't
look super white and like washed out you
have to totally see it some at you all
the time and it's how I prevent myself
from looking cakey in weird alright so I
did half my face off camera I'm actually
try something different I know I not
only did the eye but I did like the
whole phase where I did the contour
blush and everything that way my videos
can kind of be shorter or go faster let
me know you guys like this I thought it
was pretty cool so to prime eyelid I'm
going to use this lemonade prime by
benefit and I love this primer I always
use it I do not to see it then once I'm
done bling that camera out I'm going to
set that with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder then I take my
favorite pal of all time which the
modern renaissance palette my end just
bravely Hills I want to buy a new one
just like and like keep dad's like a
collector's item
anyways I'm going to get this transition
type shade and scar left is my skin tone
and I'm just going to use that to go
over my entire lid space
I'm going to get this hot pink shade and
I'm going to use that on my outer corner
and my inner corner I'm kind of trying
to create a halo eye I don't really do
these I think the second is the first
time I did one so I'm not an expert but
it's pretty simple I guess you put the
ice shot on one side of your eye another
shout out inside and then keep the
middle blink for a light color finally
guys my birthday's in four days it's so
cool my god I'm old I'm turning 22
that's nuts and I'm gonna get wasted
I'm glad you water if you're if you're
like under 15 I'm going to drink water
but you're over 15 I'm going to do
something that looks like I'm sorry you
guys I get so goofy while you live voice
overs I literally don't know why
anyway serious time I'm taking the same
primer I'm using that's kind of clear
out the space in the middle to create
that halo effect and I'm gonna take this
shimmery color then point at right here
my motto in sauce palette and ease up a
base kind of put like another glitter
shimmery stuff on top because I think
this is enough and I want to see more
glittery of course but take this Stila
like liquid eyeshadow these are so cool
I have like four of them that's a big
deal you guys I feel like a hundred
Sol's on them and anyone knows me
I'm very cheap when it comes to buying
makeup like I'll buy like food and other
stuff so when I got to makeup I really
don't like buying it too often I usually
don't
so anyways these are Kelly worth it and
it's different ways because they do not
transfer so I'm doing now is just taking
that transit shade I took and the hot
pink shade I took and I just put a
little bit under my lash line I don't
wanna do too much so and I'm gonna take
liner and create a wing this liner is by
Tarte I've used to before I would not
recommend it to beginners only because
it's very uh very liquidy
I don't want to be runny but it's super
duper pigmented I feel like this liners
for someone who's used to doing winged
liners I totally would not recommend it
for someone new because it just very
easy to mess up if that makes sense
I must prefer liquid liners that are a
little dry I don't know if it makes
sense but um anyways I put on a scare
now and
then I'm going to put on my lashes now I
didn't want to even show myself doing
this but I never show myself put on last
lettuce I just keep it in here even
though it's kind of a weird angle I just
I don't know I just didn't want to cut
it out and these lashes are buy a new
bounce um and they're in a style Russian
white be less they're great if you do
not like wearing lashes because oh my
god I have to my right now I don't need
a lot like I don't even feel them on my
like eyes I like lashes like that that
you know make them look look better but
not too dramatic and that are also very
comfortable on the eyes and so these
last agree I mean it even follow me for
a while I've talked about the glass
before so nothing new and now I'm just
going back on my eyeshadow just they say
any little mistakes I see because I'm
somewhat of a perfectionist whew that
was a lot oh my god now I'm going to
dust with my powder as you can see it
does more cakey it doesn't like I've
been sitting there for forever it looks
really natural and that's why you put a
thin layer at first and then you put a
layer to catch any eyeshadow fallout I
notice that my entire face I'm using the
Mac Studio Fix I will just call epic
studio fix powder in the shade NC 45 and
then I forgot to finish some of my eyes
I'm going to take the same Stila liquid
shadow and put on my inner little tear
duct area just to brighten my eyes
because I really like how it looks a
little mascara my lower lash line I
actually got a little mascara my nose
but you can't really see it I end up
fixing with q-tip so I didn't die that's
all that matters
right now types blush - or my face a
little bit now I do only blush to be too
dark I thought my eyes are a little
extreme so I took this blush by the balm
it's like a dark pink blush that makes
for this blessed by benefit it's a light
pink blush so I can get a pink that's in
the middle you guys feel smart again
because the dark pink would have been
way too dark or the light one would have
been way too light so you mix the two
together and you get the shade you're
looking for now to contour I'm taking
this Tula bronzer by benefit and yeah
it's going to contour with that eye line
taking Gilda honey by Laura Geller now
for the record this is one of the best
hires of all time now it will not
reflect on my face because I always wet
this hard before I use it and that's how
I get to pop as much as I do but today I
didn't wet it so I can't explain it but
because I've what the highlighter I kind
of changed the how it applies to my face
so it's not as pigmented but this is
like one of the best hires I've ever
owned in my life add to it and I'm
anyone have a big one so don't even pay
just the video just know that this
highlighter is amazing
so to line my lips tickets Itali deluxe
lip liner in the shade brown honestly
like this will fires okay I just I
couldn't find my cork I want to use
court just for the record just so you
guys know
nah I'm taking this liquid lipstick i'm
morphe at first off testing to see if i
want to go through is there before i
showed you on camera and it smells
really really good so I liked it I think
the formal is pretty nice my lips at the
moment you probably can't see it in
camera but I do need to exfoliate them
so I did realize it was peeling in the
middle part but it wasn't the list
lipstick fault it was definitely my lips
because they've been peeling lately
because the weather not if I take this
other Porsche it doesn't caught Oprah I
don't know cosmetics with liquid
lipstick it's like a darker pink and I
want to put that in the corner edges
just to kind of create an ombre effect
and to make my list with more full
so I just feel like I don't look much
better than just the morphe label
lipstick so did my face napster I was
doing my hair now this wig I'm wearing I
actually wore in my previous video of
this look from China lace wig and
because I wire worn it I actually have
quite some opinions on it now this is a
hair it's kind of dry a little bit like
in the front because I have to blow-dry
her when I was like I guess I don't want
to say gluing but shelling down the
front part earlier but I did the hair is
no processing right now and I just
conditioned it now I'm going to
straighten it and I did off camera
because it took forever now let me show
you guys the hair I'm going to show you
guys how much the hair shed after you
know straighten it now this looks a lot
because the hair is all bunched up it's
not as bad as it looks but you guys know
I like to answer my reviews so the
Heritage shed and this is what I got
after strained my hair brushing through
and odd stuff oh I'm going to stand up
straight you guys the ends of the hair
what's a straight in now I didn't like
this only because the ends got very thin
and very brittle but this is why I
straight and most curly hair that I get
because you can really test the quality
of the hair by straining because a lot
of times with companies send you hair
that comes naturally curly of course it
looks great because you're not really
really looking at it but you could
always tell if my hair is good call or
not when you strain it because you can
see how thin the ends are how dry they
are etc if you're going to buy this look
I would definitely recommend keeping it
in natural state because when you do
strain it you're going to have to cut it
at the ends but you have to comp this
much I cut off this much I feel like any
other lint would it looks awkward on me
personally that's like off this much but
you know typically when it comes to
ordering off these sides like you know a
site like this and maybe I'll express
the girls kind of size in general it's
really smart to always order your
bundles longer than what you actually
want them to be like for example if you
want a bundle if you want your hair to
be 22 inches order 28 inches because a
lot of times the hair most hair honestly
it gets sent in and it gets kind of
brittle so you're going to have to cut
off an inch or two anyways so if you
want hair to be like 28 inches get 30
and you know you guys follow along with
me but overall I think the wig itself is
nice I think it's a wig that you kind of
put on and go it's really
low maintenance I think the hair quality
is not the best I've ever experienced on
the way but it's also not the worst so I
will give it that I can identity is
pretty nice a lot of wigs I get will
lace wigs that already come pre-made I
noticed they tend to be very thin and I
have a video coming up well I'll kind of
mention that it's kind of thin which is
why I'm kind of like lacking on the
video so I feel like it looks way too
thin but we'll get there but I'm item
identity of the wig it's nice I think
they give you a decent amount of hair
for this wig this is a 360 lazily front
two legs so it's laced all the way
around my head and then it has what the
tracks in the middle where they sew it
down shouldn't push this wig all the
information should be down below and as
far as hair tutorials go I will be
making another video soon on how to make
a wig using a lace front tool for
beginners and also have a video plan on
how to make a wig I can't even explain
what it's like a new product you guys
see in the video but I had this plan a
Mexican film that after I'm getting done
doing this voiceover I think totally
black on them videos awesome you guys
let me do a get ready with me like
chitchat for one of them prying on my
next video by my videographer Dax I have
a lot of stuff to talk about and explain
to you guys why I've been lacking on my
filming and hopefully guys will
understand when I talk about it anyways
um I'm just laying my baby hairs out I
mean I don't think this is my baby hairs
it's like little short hairs that aren't
on the wig I'm trying to make my baby
hairs because I felt like the part it
didn't look as natural to could possibly
look so I just wanted to just lay a
little hair so it looks like it's
growing out of my scalp
we dealt with the hair honestly you look
at this video I'm nothing I live in a
pair I like the lustre you guys be
honest it has a really natural luster to
it like it's not too shiny but it's not
too dull it looks like it's my hair
actually like the more like this video
the more I realize just how natural the
hair itself looks so that's another
positive about this wig the hair looks
very natural
anyways I fix this part on my part fix
things up yeah part of my part do that
can't see if I can see it so you don't
have to fix it you can kind of see where
my stocking cap is underneath that lease
so I just put a little bit in that area
so you can't see with the Sun cap blades
and that's pretty much it for my hair
and that's pretty much it for the look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and if you want more videos I'm doing
both my hair and makeup let me know and
I'll do more of them and yeah sorry I
just feel so alone but if you liked it
please give it thumbs up and I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
