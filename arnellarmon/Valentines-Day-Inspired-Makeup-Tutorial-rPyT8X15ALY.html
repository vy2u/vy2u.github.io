right in our I do one I have camera cuz
I kind of want to know like what I was
doing and just what I came up with so to
prime my eyelids I'm uses Kat Von D lost
concealer not sure why I chose to use
this I just decided to use it because i
never use concealers primer by the way
don't my my nail loves wrong more senior
i just have a band-aid my nail broke and
I had my time to fix it so after that
I'm going to set that concealer with the
transition powder and then my take this
volleyballs holy grail palette and I'm
going to point the shot I'm going to use
I don't know the name but I'm going to
use this like base color it's kind of my
skintone color and then I'm going to put
that all over my lid so check that this
shade right here it's honestly very
similar to the first one I use it is
slightly darker I'm kind of doing up the
color you know I never just going with a
dark shadow first I just start some
light and then I get darker as I go and
so now I'm going to take this little Mac
palette I don't know what scotch on a
sense to me and I get this purple shade
right here I'm going to place it all
over my lid as a base like for the
purple shadow I'm going to use I'm going
to blend it out with like a flat kind of
fluffy brush at first I didn't know that
this is shadows like I was like okay
what is this but then I read the
packaging and it says shadows I'm just
assuming it's a shadow so that's all you
did for it and I'm gonna take this
morphe shadow and there's just like this
purple shade I do not normally notice
you guys I met at Homer and I'm in New
York so I'm in shambles but I'm going to
use as a top of the purple shale youth
now I'm gonna go back to the Holy Grail
path and get this like burgundy color
and that's to kind of like give them
look more warmth and I wanted to get
more pink tones in there but not too
pink but um I just want it to be more
colorful and then I'm going to take this
slightly nuts lightly it is darker shade
and I'm going to use that to deepen the
outer crease area
you guys I'm in such shambles right now
like also supposed to be there like two
days ago but then I packed super last
minute for New York and like now I'm
just trying to like finish any it so I
can leave the hotel anyways I'm taking
this modus pigment and it's pigment to
super night like I have to show it but
it did not show up on camera and even
now like it does
show up on camera as like it's super
duper tonight like it has like these
it's kinda like it's very smooth it's
like a it's a pigment but I have like
these really pretty glitter reflex but
you could only see them person and not
show up on a camera but it's a really
nice pigments right you can work with
and I just use my mace Lee medium to
apply that so that way it sticks and it
doesn't transfer to my crease but for
lashing kidneys do the lash by the
Newman bar and I'm mascara on first may
god I love these lashes I've used to
probably like my favorite lashes ever
the only thing is I feel like they they
rip apart a little too easily I notice
Exodus insects have happened and each
time like they're just very they're not
for you don't get many uses and you
probably get like maybe like two or
three that's what I've noticed as I've
been wearing them but you have to be
super gentle with them even earlier this
morning I want to wear them today and
they ripped on me and I just like I just
I feel defeated but they're so nice like
as a perfect style in my opinion I just
I don't know like they're great but they
just don't want super long it kind of
sucks but I have to tell you guys that
you know to be honest in case you guys
do buy them anyways onto my face I'm
taking this juhi anti blemish mattifying
primer and I'm gonna use it to find my
skin yeah I get really sue okay I just
yes and you just won now her foundation
I'm going to take my aunt's artistic
foundation I'm going to shave caramel
and amber caramel like caramel caramel
whatever sinking karma like my exact
color and then amber is like slightly
darker I just like using both just I use
the amber one to kind of give me more
color but then it's like I use both so
that way they last longer because about
only using caramel caramel then it would
run out faster if that makes sense
then I've limit out I'm using this Tarte
Beauty Blender sponge honestly you guys
this is the my favorite sludge I like it
way more to beat the dirt like I have to
say it I don't come a ver you might be
to blame out is if this sponge is too
dirty because I mean it was always dirty
because I use it every single day but it
is just so nice and a blintz
out the products so much faster it's
softer it's just oh my god you have to
try I don't know how much it cost like I
want to buy another one they sent me
this one but I want to buy like a second
one just so I could like rotate but um
yeah wait I'm actually Google how much
it cost one second you guys fund is only
$16 all right
so please agree you have to get it
complete about it for $20 and this is 16
so like you say four dollars anyways
because I'm using a cap on to concealer
that's kind of obvious before if you
have a sponge only sixteen dollars I had
a feeling it be around that price I mean
I doubted that they would make it the
same price the Beauty Blender but it
works really really good imagine you
know how its kind of the same design as
the Real Techniques sponge imagine that
puts softer then the Beauty Blender I
wouldn't know just like try it if you
buy anything from this video by this
fund because it works really good and
then even like distant promo will
attempt it is but it's not sponsored I
get to tell me it's faded I'm saying
this I'm up you guy and then this month
it's on my feet here okay so enemies I'm
laying out my concealer concealer of my
favorite part of the whole makeup
process glad to feel like it just makes
me look alive and makes me look like
below to contour I'm you just went wild
contra stick again ever since I did that
sponsor video with them I only use this
but it's really cool I just like I don't
know why I'm kind of concerned because
you know like I just I don't know but I
like it
and yes matchy like I could totally buy
this again like I love ones like hum do
send me stuff and out of the pockets in
yes I find a new favorite
especially when it's cheap because like
when it runs out rather than emailing
them to accent heat you might say
another one I should go by myself
because this is only like four dollars
but yeah you guys see how quickly I
blend that out and look flawless
so to set my eyes I'm going to use my
Chanel powder I really like to sputter a
lot like I don't know if I send my
favorite over my Laura Mercier powder
like I'm still don't you to learn
Mercier because I mean I have a brand
new little jar so I kind of have to use
it
but I really like this powder so just
finer and I just I don't know it's more
smooth and yeah oh okay I'm not just
spend on my eyes I you know better my
contour my chin - I totally forgot about
that now to put some shadow underneath
my lash line I just can take PT shell
but I disappointed - I'm in shambles oh
my god I came it off but I'm just going
to just lightly wash that underneath my
lash line it's kind of irritating my
eyes everything with some eye shadow
under my lash line the shadows gets in
my eyes and it's really annoying
maybe it's the brush I'm using but I
tried different brush then it happens
each time so I'm not sure but I'm just
going to put that and then I'm going to
use the same modus pigman used earlier
and I'm going to put that in my like
tear duct area at first I was putting it
dry because I want to be to be too bold
but then I end up spraying my brush
setting spray and that made it pop even
more
you
so to set my entire face I'm going back
to on my favorite powders of Black
Radiance off milk powder and I'm going
to use that to dust with the powder I
have setting my concealer red bag baking
whatever you want to call it okay and
I'm just going to tie my tie base with
that two sounds on my con so I'm gonna
take another Black Radiance soft focus
powder in the shade milk milk chocolate
and I'm using this because I wanted to
intensify my contour and also give
myself a little warmth because it's a
pretty warm kind of shade then take this
NYX blush it's like that's really bright
pink we don't worry does it show up that
bright or else I would have used it
because I usually hate pink
I'm not a pink person I'm just not look
I like light pink but um yeah anyways
for highlight I'm taking the artist
Couture highlighting this is the shade
conceited I do remember the I know the
last time I used I hated it because it
wouldn't stick to my skin I learned that
I used a fan brush it sticks much better
like I don't know what I was doing wrong
last time the last time when I was using
it it was just too powdery and use
wasn't stick to my skin but this kind of
looks pretty nice
now for lips I'm going to first line my
lips using this cork lip liner
honestly cork Lib layer is my favorite
lip liner of all time
it's just perfect you know it's not too
dark and it's not too warm it's not too
cool i'm taking this nyx gloss now this
is the wrong one okay i have two of
these and i kind of got them confused
the other ones going for it's like a
really nice lavender shade but i
couldn't find it so instead of taking
this one off i just kept it on and then
I put this Mac oyster girl lip gloss on
top to kind of make my own color so
you're going to see me just mix me in
and just trying to like tone down the
purple but keep it a little bit but I
just I made my own color pieces
you
so once I thought I make about to figure
out what I want to do my hair this wig
look crazy
so I'm just playing some long curls and
if I kept it kind of messy looking it
looks kind of green suit up with too
much oil in it but I mean I've liked the
look that's kind of lookout going for
come on messy ways anyways this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed

thumbs up if you subscribe and I'll see
you in my next video when I get back
