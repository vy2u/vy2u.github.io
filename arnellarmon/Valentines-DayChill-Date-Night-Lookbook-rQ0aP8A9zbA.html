body contact dress from forever 21 it's
a really nice blue I love how this blue
looks on my skin tone it's beautiful and
I paired it with these heels I got from
Macy's I think I'd like BG and I'm gonna
put it down below it's a whole bunch of
letters max Morris I'm like that buttons
for Macy's years ago then I paired that
with this little purse that this one
brand sent me and it has my name on it I
believe it was sugar bear that's I mean
this purse and yeah pretty simple outfit
this is like as dress he's gonna get
after this I'm gonna like my real Styles
gonna come through I'm really the most
dressy person I just like doing simple
outfits are cute you know throw on some
hoops a little jewelry and bam next I'll
feel like number two I have on my Vance
little black dress I got from forever 21
this little white tank that I actually
got from the thrift store Buffalo
Exchange in these cool glasses I got the
forever 21 pair with the same purse from
the last look this look is super chill
super cute it's like cutesy but it's
chill at the same time some of my
favorite looks in this video I got some
new vans guys so these ones don't have
character like the ones on my last video
and yeah this dress is super cute like a
baby dog type dress it has pockets you
could have one of the little straps
unhooked if you want to however I want
to mine both hooked and I have on the
same hoops and I'm yeah that's look
number two very simple I love it alright
look number three is this super cute red
babydoll dress it's a zipper all in the
middle pair with my white Adidas that
are still dirty but I don't care cuz I
don't don't care and then I have this
pink shirt with this cute little rose on
it is from is awful this shirt is
actually like this shirt that you ties
in a crop but I'm like keeping the dress
so I can cover it so that's why I have
to dress it up it's like a little
crisscross detail on the back of the
dress it's just super cute whatever
where like again probably not because
it's really bright red and I don't know
I don't like bright colors like that but
because it's Valentine's Day I decide to
you know show some color and a little
Rose details super cute now for outfit
number four this is my favorite outfit
of the video I
these boots these like velvety boots
that I got from Marshalls paired with
this skirt it's like played plaid have
you say it from firm 21 with this little
forever 21 cardigan that I actually
bought the thrift store for $8.00 that's
why I had like a little stream I've had
it for years I've actually never even
worn in pair of this black bodysuit that
got from a pretty one
a lot of stuff is from forever 21 so
it's all pretty affordable which i mean
i maestra do and it's a different to
anyone thrift store or Marshall's so
yeah these boots are cool I would like
to wear them with socks however they're
little too small for me I just feel like
the ankle support is not the best but
other than that I love this outfit a lot
just I don't know it's super cute it's
like I don't know like kind of Goffe
because I'm not kind of school girly but
cut or not kind of clueless vibes I
don't know
we've everyone though
alpha number five I have these shorts
from after me one pair with this shirt
from forever 21 and these shoes are from
bloomingdales these are Kenneth Cole
they're so comfortable I love them and
put my hair in a bun because I thought
this was told like schoolgirl vibes I
don't know I love this outfit to you by
the way I didn't cut out any of my
awkwardness in this video this video was
kind of super last minute so it's not
the best and I didn't cut on my
awkwardness because like I'm awkward 90%
of the time and if I cut it all out
we'd have no video no footage so but
these shorts I like it cuz they have
like a bow tie they're not the most
flattering on the shape whatever but you
can tie the bow tie and leave it like
this or you could tie it back up I
actually like the how it looks like a
bow tie however I just felt like for the
video it looked cuter but honoring like
an average day I wouldn't have it in
this bow tie
and they also have stretchy band so you
can eat a lot and you know not feel
super stuffed because the sides are
stretchy which is awesome so yeah look
number six the last look I just paired
these boots that I got from a vertical
factory with his carding it up in Feb 21
men's section with this row 2 and skirt
and a throw to a body suit now this
skirt the zipper actually goes to the
middle however I hated how that looked
so I put to the side which you can do
and so yeah this outfits like super
chill super simple all these outfits
reflect my personal style I'm not super
girly I'm not gonna like you know wear a
lot of dresses like super girly ones I
don't know I just I like I like chill
like chill cutesy and um yeah that's the
video so if you enjoyed it be sure to
give it a thumbs up please subscribe if
you want more look books like I said my
last video just tell me I'll do some and
I'll see you guys in next video I hope
you guys have a really nice Valentine's
Day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
