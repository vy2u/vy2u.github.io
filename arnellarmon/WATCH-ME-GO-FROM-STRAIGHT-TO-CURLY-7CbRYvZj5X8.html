afternoon welcome I'm right now in
States video since again how I go from
straight to curly I did a video I'm
going Carly to straighter reading and
I'll link that below for some there's
nothing about a lot of views so
hopefully this will induce my views as
well it seems like people that kind of
used on you it's enough people like this
kind of videos on YouTube which is where
I was trying to do it I bring you guys
with me to the shower as I wash finish
in my hair and to pretty much get my
curls to come back to be honest I was
kind of scared that my curls wouldn't it
like come back like this because I did
dye my hair recently and so I have a
guide my hair I straightened it and I
was okay like that's a lot like not only
are you dying in like putting bleach
stuff in it now you're like let me heat
on it and so when I always taking my
shower to bring my curls back I was not
a hundred percent sure about clothes
come back with you okay welcome icons
video so as you guys can see look at me
my curls are back I think that's because
I don't strain as much as I used to
even when to straighten it I don't I put
I used to be a 450s have a person but
now I strain him okay your hair is on
their side it is not using 450 so I put
on a lower temperature
I'm is very careful although if I do 450
it will make my hair even extra straight
it's not worth it I'm trying to think
had my hair grow and be long hearing so
I show you guys hardly mine comes back I
have my hair up right now and a clip and
that's because my hair is still at a
very awkward lint and so I don't like
wearing it down because it's like not
long lets me down I look like Amy and
simple I just have it up or I'll put
like a scarf on sorry for the noise
outside of the way but I'll either have
it
clip or just put a scarf on and I just
like you know do my curly bangs because
my foreheads really big and that's what
I do so our listeners watch this video
if you enjoy it please be sure to give
it a thumbs up those always help my
videos and if you are new here and I
subscribed yet be sure to subscribe down
below and turn on the notification
because you to be trippin and they don't
always tell you guys my posted videos so
let's watch the video now like I said
I'll subscribe all that good stuff and I
will see you later alright guys so we're
gonna stop in the shower go take off my
little headscarf I went to head scarf
like every time I don't feel like doing
my hair and I'm going to wet my hair at
first I had the water way too hot you
want to be kind of warm kind of cold if
it's okay with you because you don't
have put super hot water on your hair
just kind of dries it out and so he Rams
you know wetting my hair at first it
seemed like it's gonna stay straight but
like the more you wet it and then soon
you like the shampoo it seems like when
you shampoo your hair it like washes out
the heat that probably makes no sense at
all but you could smell the like the
flattered smelling your hair so first
I'm gonna take those Hairfinity gentle
clinch AM poo and I like tempo because
it kind of like has like a tingling
sensation not crazy but um you know it
feels just very clean and clarifying and
so I'm gonna take that I use very little
bit I don't keep it in for too long
because I'm not a huge fan of shampoos
to begin with but because I had trade my
hair I want to know shampoo out the heat
as well as my edge control after I
shampoo I'm gonna take my hair affinity
Balance moisture conditioner and I use a
lot of this I always go hammock
conditioner because I like to
conditioned and I like this conditioner
a lot because it's just super soft it's
super like moisturizing it feels really
really great to be honest I've used this
more than I've use a shampoo and I
recently got these so of course like the
power they're still pretty cool but I
have used conditioner in my hair more
than shampoo christlike conditioner I do
use conditioner when one of my bundles
and it's pretty great so here I'm
grabbing a little bit
more accident grab the shampoo here I'm
just got more conditioner because when
you straighten your hair you really want
to make sure that you're adding moisture
back to your hair when you want it curly
again and so you just want to go crazy
with conditioner it's totally cool if
you do so while the conditioner is still
in my hair I'm gonna take my sugar bear
hair brush I usually use my Denman and
brush but it was in my studio and I
doubt if I gained it and I'm just gonna
like brush out the tangles I know
something but I like to brush their hair
while it's wet but I do it and I mean I
have no issues with that so um that's
why I was doing it and I'm gonna brush
the conditioner out and you guys see my
curls they're popping do not mind my
tattoo I got I was 15 years old in a
house so don't mind that it's not cute
but um yeah it's gonna brush up a
conditioner I'm dancing and whatnot and
now I'm a definition I mean it's two of
them one is by a mica and the other
one's by silk elements and the actual
names we down below and I've used a lot
this is almost done I use a lot of this
as well and so I mix two together I go
crazy with the conditioning but for
today and on days when I'm in a rush
I'll like put the detention in then I'll
wash my body you know finish my shower
and then rinse it out so I'll leave it
in for like ten minutes but on nights
where I really want to like give my hair
a lot of moisture I'll put the
conditioner in at night and I'll like
wrap it with like plastic they put my
cotton scarf on top and then I'll sleep
with a conditioner deep conditioner in
my hair
but today you know I just put it in the
shower that I rinsed it out and then
we're gonna go to my studio Here I am
just waiting my hair again my hair dries
out a lot and it has nothing to me
dyeing it it's always been this way
I've actually watch some professional
videos on styling curly hair and it's
recommended that you put your curly hair
products while you're still in the
shower while your hair is soaking wet
but of course kind of do that because
you know I was filming I'm a hair dries
so I have to you know very wet it you
know so it's easy to style and just easy
to brush through I had a few streets
trans but like I said like that was
there before I dyed my hair if you can
pay attention so now I'm gonna take the
Hairfinity revitalizing leave-in
conditioner I'm just gonna spray some of
that in my hair before I start I demand
curly hair products
conditioners are great especially ones
that are meant to repair your hair so
we're gonna start with that I'm gonna
take my diva curl ultra defining gel mix
with my diva curls super cream I love
mix these two together if you have more
like lightweight hair it smart to like
mix a gel and cream together and then I
add my Carol's Daughter form on a
combing cream because this really
defines my curls I love it
and my curls they look kinda clean right
now but that's Clapton brush some of my
Denman brush this brush is awesome a lot
of you guys on my Instagram actually
recommended this to me I'm so happy you
did because when I tell you this really
defines my curls as you can see it's
beautiful and Mail's on being rough for
my hair but I'm not um I'm not
tender-headed
at all and so here I'm Sheena brush the
product through my curls it looks like I
have like beef Top Ramen hair and um now
I'm gonna style it now my hair is a very
awkward length so it's kind of difficult
for me to come up with style so I kind
of go to the same style each time and
that's where I have curly bangs and then
I brush all of it either to the top and
I'll either leave it like this in the
clip or I'll put a scarf on either or
all the hairs brush to the top and I
like it this way because I mean it makes
my hair look more full and it makes look
longer it just it's not a very awkward
length where like it has body but it
doesn't it's not long enough but it's
not short enough to rock in a certain
way so I just wear like this as you can
guys can see my curls are super defined
they're still very healthy and beautiful
and that is how I go from straight to
curly I'm gonna let my hair dried I'm
insert pictures of what it looks like
once it's dry I didn't pick it out
though which I should have I just um I
don't like touching my curls after they
dry cuz they get they can get frizzy
pretty fast so that's in this video if
you enjoyed it please give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
