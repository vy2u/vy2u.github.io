now then I've got that on the air I want
just one more thing in my last video I
dropped a few f-bombs in two N's bombs
okay and now although something this
isn't this isn't on by the way although
this is like mine I don't know my wand
although some people they don't mind
being on lightly okay what are you two
girls forget all the but God so yeah I'm
not gonna curse in warmer videos like
okay the reason why I feel comfortable
dropping my f-bombs I'm just comfortable
on YouTube like and when I started my
channel I promised myself that I
wouldn't change anything about myself
because I noticed a lot of people aren't
they got on you - they do that they
switch up their voice they they switch
our whole freakin person had to tweet
your life they make us seem like they're
perfect
oh my god my life so amazing and I'm a
nice person
yeah they a lot who would do that and
it's kind of like that's that's annoying
it's kind of wack so mastermind you -
don't lie okay you know what
I was like I'm just be myself like I'm
and just be wherever I feel like being
that day like you know my personalized
which is up so much I'm so bipolar
sometimes I'm super goofy sometimes I'm
emo but I'm always myself and when I
started my channels like I'm gonna be
 self
but apparently myself cursed too much
sometime so I'm gonna change that about
myself I don't want to be a potty mouth
anymore okay so for those of you who
were kind of like stabbed on my potty
mouth I'm sorry
I will like not curse that much anymore
I wish I got to cursing at all but it's
like you understand it I said Emily my
voiceovers I don't see it as like a okay
or no make sure
don't move this word make sure you say
that I'm just kinda like having a
voiceover and I'm just gonna do it it
just I just go with the flow of things
I'm just like it's kind of like when you
go into an interview and when you go
into the interview you you try to like
plan really literally how you're gonna
answer these questions when you get to
that interview and you think yeah I
don't know I'm gonna ask this one they
and then they ask it and you're just
like oh lick you you get stuck
because you were so you know prepared
I'm being scripted and saying like some
scripted ass it's kind of like you
get thrown off but when you go into any
of you and you're just like you know I'm
just answer that question exactly what
how I want to answer to exactly how I'm
Philly you it you like you just
do so great you're just being yourself
and being natural and then you get the
job that's what I see things I don't
know if that was a great example but
that's all you see things but okay I'm
not gonna curse that much anymore I'll
try to squeeze it all because I'm not
professional whatever but yeah just have
to address that cuz I kind of got
annoyed you know comes on you damn but
ya got that out the way I've been
talking for seven minutes you guys
probably once in this tutorial and you
guys probably be waiting for my post I'm
gonna give away so I'm not gonna make
you guys waiting longer hopefully those
enjoyed this video and I hope it's
helpful and just let me know the next
video cuz imma see and I will record it
for you thanks for being here for loving
me for being awesome for being alive and
thanks for subscribing even if you
haven't subscribed I just thank to you
so that means you have to do it cuz I
kind of thank you for it already
so okay so first of all start off with
clean hair of course and you want to
brush it out this hair is not just a
beauty dub so it comes naturally
I really like this so you just want to
brush it out and then you kind of blow
dry it just to kind of blow dry it I
don't know anything else other way to
say that yeah you can't just want to
like make it easier for you to curl it
and you guys will see that every time
I'm done blow-drying this section I just
plan a little ponytail just sort just
out of my way I have a lot of spring
shoes he will need scrunchie took me to
walk her your hair now I brush broke on
me but it wasn't because like the hair
in thinks that the brush is cheapest one
of those part to do show brushes the
ones they sing with every freaking
weight so you know those things are
cheap and so before I start walk through
and I just spray my hair a little bit
with the blow dry spray also by PYT
oh yeah that was a peeler - blow dryer
bt-dubs but yeah it's kind of a heat
protectant spray so I just spray down
the hair you know because one like tip I
can give to maintain your weave it's a
tree like is your hair tree likes yours
right act like it's growing out of your
scalp treated with care treated with
love and it'll do it'll be good too you
know
so want feelings pretty easy you kind of
wrap your hair around the wand but later
on this video I'm gonna show you this I
get two different type of curls I'm
gonna show you guys gonna get these
curls which are my favorite they're like
more natural wavy and then I'll show you
guys how to get like those Waterfall
curls
okay so now I'm gonna show you guys how
to get a waterfall curl now when you
wrap your hair around the wand as you
can see you want the hair to lay
completely flat on the wand if that
makes any sense I kind of slope this
part down so you can see it says who I'm
doing and when I in gold the one you'll
see the hair is laying completely flat
against the one by the way this one does
come the Wong rub you know I'm a
risk-taker so I didn't use no glove no
anyways you can let that sit for about
ten seconds and then when you take it
off the wand you'll see you get a nice
little waterfall curl you know it's very
very very defined you'll see watch it
watch it there it goes there it goes
so for the second curl type I'm not sure
what you a college credit ID but just
very its Wandy okay so when I wrap the
hair around the wand as you can see I
kind of twist my hand so I'm twisting
the hair a little bit as I wrap it
around the wand can you guys see that
and you kind of see how it looks thick
on the wand it's not laying flat that it
on purpose I really hope you guys are
following along kind of like make it as
easy as possible
so have to wait about 10 seconds and
take the hair off the wand and you
doesn't see it just gives it a more
natural curl I'm going to drop in a
minute
great no and you see the kind of curly
gift so I'm gonna zoom up just show you
guys the difference between the katrell
bounces right here if you can see the
difference I prefer the one on the lip
so after you curl all of your hair and
whatever way you like it maybe like the
waterfall curls maybe like the ones I
like would you like some more wavy curls
you're just gonna do the front part and
then I'll show you guys how I make the
front part of my hair like with my
closure and everything looks best as I
possibly can make it look
so after curling my hair I'm going to
take my flat iron from PYT and I'm going
to just kind of flatten that part a
little bit and just make it look more
silky and straight as you as you see it
looks much better already right
so ever do that I'm going to take my
serum for PYT now this stuff smells so
good like like as in like it's actually
worth the price they're selling it for
that's how good it smells but just some
stuff I would actually buy on my own
because it just yeah I love love love
like perfume smelling serums I just I
don't know like I want to walk next to
someone and they turn around like oh my
god like your hair is the most so good
like that's what I want do that take my
wand again and I just go over my clothes
apart if you make that thing where you
live bladder and that's pretty much it
you know you you lay your edges and
everything with your head tool and all
that extra stuff but this is pretty much
it for how I do my hair so thank you
guys for watching and make sure to into
my giveaway stay tuned on my Instagram
to get more details on that and I hope
you have a nice date or 90/10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
