background about myself um I'll do then

look I'm so sorry for my talking I talk
a lot I'll get better at that I just so
excited what I feel much one keep
talking talking talking but yeah
now watch the tutorials so to pry my
face will be using the benefit
Porefessional primer and I'm only gonna
focus on the areas where X and Porras
don't mind the fact that my forehead
that was a mistake
thundergirl is my Mac concealer palette
I'm gonna use the shade burnt coral in
order to kind of color correct my scars
because I don't want them to show up
that much it just helps like conceal
them a little better
so after blending that all and I'm gonna
go with the polar concealers I did not
remember the shade I'm gonna cover the
scar myford a little more and the one on
my cheek I'm not gonna bother my eye for
now and then I'm gonna go with my two
foundations my Mac basement body as well
as my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD along
with Sun beam by benefit and I mix all
three of those together and then apply
it to my skin using this artists or
artis I'm a sharp announces this artis
oval-8 brush and now I'll go with using
this brush you don't necessarily need to
I do go over my foundation with a Beauty
Blender but that's just because I enjoy
doing that take two more Pro on
concealers NC 20 MC 50 and I mix those
two to get a more natural shade and I
have space under my eye and I just blend
that out with the Beauty Blender
I'm gonna go with my Ruby kisses 3d face
created in the shade level 13 I'm gonna
use my oval six brush to contour my
forehead on my cheekbones
now you'll see I'm kind of doing this
contour a little bit like sloppily cuz I
don't want it to be super defined and
super carved out I want to look really
bronzed you know it's fun kind of
contouring but at the same time just
bronzing my skin a little more it's
pretty simple and easy to do so I can
blend that out with the Beauty Blender
I'm gonna go on my Sasha Buttercup
setting powder
yeah listen goes here no you know you
could try it just like the last I have
it she literally gave me a drop so I
mean this is like gonna be the first if
I only kind of using it less i buy some
more okay so it on time for my eyes
first time I take this lemonade color
correcting eyelid primer by benefit
which happened to be super duper duper
duper duper amazing and then I'm gonna
get this in a festive Beverly Hills
shadow and orange soda to use as a base
you gotta see I'm like super super
simple with my eye shadow looks let me
get my favorite shade ever
it's called Morocco I using it every
single look I ever do in life and then
after that I'm gonna get the shade fudge
it's like a darker brown color just a
deep in fat color I'm just gonna deepen
it up keep it up I have to blend that
all out I'm gonna go with this shape
called henna and put that all over my
lid it's a really beautiful shimmery
color I learned that that goes on better
when you do it with your finger it shows
a little bit more and that meant take
this benefit push-up liner the they're
real now this is my first time using
this liner and I think I did a pretty
darn good job I was always scared this
liner you like the applicator I was like
oh my god we were supposed to do with
this thing but it's actually super duper
duper easy to use like I actually really
liked it and it's crazy cuz I'm not even
a liner person so yeah I totally gets my
thumbs up
after slaying that line I'm just gonna
take the che Morocco and just sweep it
under my eye and then we're pretty much
done with the iBook now I'm gonna brush
away that Sasha powder and yes guys I
cooked beads whatever the heck it's
called I did it it's totally not my
thing I just yeah it's looking good it
and I just like to set my face to the
mac mineralize skinfinish then I'm gonna
go with this bronzer by benefit called
Dallas and I'm just gonna just brush all
on my cheek then I'm gonna get this
blush cause devil which is like my
favorite blush from Mac and just dust
out of my cheeks as well and then I'm
gonna go in with my Mac limit edition oh
darling highlighter and just highlight
my face now to conquer these lizards I
just got this brown lip liner along with
the shade local issues by wet wild and
some gilded lip gloss by anastasia
beverly hills and that is the finished
look my friends so super duper duper
