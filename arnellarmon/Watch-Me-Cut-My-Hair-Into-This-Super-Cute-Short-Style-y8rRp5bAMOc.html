you're new welcome today it is going to
be on how I cut my hair like this now Oh
mr. P's hold on there anyways James
Widow wasn't even planned well it was
planned but he wasn't playing like this
I region wants to do a video else
couldn't a bomb I said always doing like
Bob styles and my wife speak meals video
she trying expired me to the shortcut
now I'm the curl in my baby it has
dropped so let me like recall that but I
wanted to be different I try to cut like
this before
and it did not look good and I feel like
although this isn't like the best bike
look I got better and I got help from my
friend Cobb who he does collide his hair
I'm like he doesn't like a lot of still
his hair was saying he doesn't want us
to live in here so I was like he'll know
you know what to do and so he helped me
you know make it look better because it
was looking a little off
you can still see like my hair line
right here cuz I do not glue this down I
didn't know I was gonna like it so much
but um no it's a very cute see else
better it's a very few style I think it
looks super light professional super
like I'm going to a meeting or whatever
and I like it so this handsome save me
hair I don't have too much to say about
it on the hair itself is a nice texture
I want to use two bundles if this look
you are you two bundles they go smile
with my show you again anyways I just do
you if anyone has a dog up there
do you ever kind justice overwhelm you
just let them chew on your shoes you're
like whatever that's house a mile off so
I had three bundles and I mean this is
the leftover but I have so this is what
it looks like I do realize that though
it looks it gets thinner and the bundles
individually look fine but when you put
them together you can really see how
thin it gets and you can see that in the
video before I cut the hair the hair
texture itself is soft and nice however
I have to note this because I didn't see
it as a con my pros are cool and of
course is no smell tangling nose shading
on that
straight here to me that's J like that
unless it's really really bad
however the only con our note is what
are you doing we do it anyways the only
thing I always say that I did not like
and you guys know what my hair views are
typically I never really have anything
back say the constructions construction
of the weft is like now okay let's see I
don't like this and see that but they're
constructed so poorly and I mean both
bundles are like that um they're
constructed very poorly oh you see you
guys see that of course I could show
that the best in camera although this is
my new cameraman Lin so it doesn't
better than what my old in for the show
but the construction of the West
we're not my favorite they're very very
thick and bulky and then we just split
it because you have mistakes like these
they kept repeating of course I made it
work you know because what I do however
if this is like a beginner I don't know
like it wouldn't be the most convenient
you know cuz you won't know exactly the
nest them it's only house yeah that's
bad it's interesting though because they
sent me this is sucks I miss any hair
loose any hair before and I did the
video because I might have a character
not I did a blue Bob but the white color
the hair does not work but those bundles
they sing it the first time they won't
like these ones and so that goes to show
that not all the bones like this but
also shows a lot consistency which is
kind of like what I do not so this one's
on you guys um typically I'll eat I'll
be to say oh yeah for sure buy it or
don't but this one's kind of like it's a
hit or miss because like I said it's me
but before those those are fine these
ones however they're constructed not the
nicest you need to get singing the best
ones because they're kind of frustrated
me
you sent more bundles to do this video I
don't know but a full week I had to see
so I'll let you guys watch this video it
was totally inspiring people I love
probably her the video I'm refering to
the low because she's much more helpful
than I like that but this came out if
you do - be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see you
guys later ok so this is the wig of
course I made it you guys see what I
mean how like the ends get really
stringy kind of like pact hair
I wasn't feeling that I wasn't - a bob
but then like I said I watched peak
Mills video I was like I really want to
try that kind of cut I've tried before
and I just maybe I didn't take my time
on it I also cut the hair walls on my
head I feel like if you wanted this kind
of cut its smartest to do it on a
mannequin head you don't do this on your
head it's because you can't really get
the angles and all that kind of stuff
like the back and it you just it's
easier this way
bt-dubs so while I'm doing this I'm like
very angry very mad like who stole her
bike I was very focused
I was super focused cause I didn't do
like you already cut it like you like
you like half to like do this cuz you
know it got to a point real so short I
was like this won't look right unless
you cut it this way so honestly um I
won't say it's a technique to this
although I'm sure there is I don't have
a technique because this is not
something I typically do I would just
kind of cut it and honey and I was kind
of following my heart I was kind of
thinking back to what peak milled in her
video I should have watched it while
doing this probably came out better um
but I was just you know going with the
flow if that makes any sense at all I
wish I could explain what I was doing
but like I said I wouldn't call us a
tutorial although I'm entitled is how to
because like that's what I could think
of well maybe I won't talk that I don't
know but I'm really just kind going ham
with my citizen the reader the razors
and I'm kind of going back and forth
based on how I feel I'm making sure I
cut layers that way when I curl it it
looks layered and it has a lot of body
but I mainly just
really short like oh maybe with time if
I do this again I could like understand
or I can learn how to explain it better
than I'm doing right now but um I just
don't explain the wrong way and have you
guys doing a certain thing and it's like
I don't know if that's right way so
after I cut it super short I just start
to curl it take an idea what was gonna
look like and then I'm gonna put on my
head by the way this video is super sped
up but thank me for that because if it
wasn't this video like literally before
I edit it it was like 49 minutes long
that's how long it took me to do
everything so you know that's why I had
a Final Cut Pro X B stuff up so I curled
most of the hair and I put it on and I
was looking crazy I was like okay like
what I just do but then I was like hey
like I want a part you know like you
want I want I should have parked the
other way though because want to take
photos my left side is my good side and
you just the way I did this and so are
taking photos it was kind of annoying um
but here I'm to make my part and I'm
getting my tweeze and I'm plucking it I
almost got it over pot but I made it
work and so um I'm just finessing at
this point you know just trying to
figure out like the way I want to do it
I'm honestly just following my heart
that's I just have a connection like
knack Nick wherever the heck door it is
for hair so am I did I make up because I
feel like with hairstyles like these you
never know what's gonna look like
without your face done now I made this
woke with a hot glue gun which I regret
because me tugging and pulling on it
kind of like made the tracks and will
loose and it just at one point one of
the tracks slipped out it was a it was a
lot it was pretty stressful but um Harry
um you know just kind of like framing
the hair to fit my face a little more if
you guys see anything white it's because
it's the hot glue yeah should never but
I said I didn't plan for this I thought
this was gonna be like a very quick bob
book which is why I did it with a hot
glue gun so um this was not planned and
by the way I was on the phone my French
Jamar she might more on Instagram
YouTube I was just telling her you know
like but my hair I'll stop take pictures
cinema terror like is it looking good
she looks super seventies
then I called my friend kah and I was
like what am I missing dude this I
realize I need a baby hair it looked
weird and by the way although my baby
hairs I feel like they didn't look bad
after this video which is what you see
in the intro I did then the baby hairs
out which is what caused him to do and I
feel like I look better with thinner
baby hairs I just um
yeah I think the baby hairs out and then
I also put foam at the top like what the
part is which is also on what Khan
recommended because it was looking
pretty top-heavy and just kind of fat
and I couldn't figure out how to tone
that down so you just put foam and um
that's pretty much I got this cut I yeah
what it called sit a tutorial just more
so like you guys watching me do this but
when I get better I promise I'll teach
you guys until then just watch peak
Mills video which be down below the
links is hair be down below and if you
enjoyed this you found entertaining be
sure to give this video a thumbs up
