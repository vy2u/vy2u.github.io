is not a tutorial I repeat it is not a
tutorial because this could be the first
time I'm cutting my hair using clippers
um I just I only use things like not fry
my shears anywhere
sounds like hmm you know I seen people
do this on Instagram so I decided to try
it I just decide to film it um
partially because I thought you guys
might want to see it in person because
you know although I'm not a professional
at this I do not to make the hair like
look as good as possible like whenever I
cut my hair to Bob's or short styles
it's never perfect like later we may
look kind of good but it's never perfect
I'm just like a master at concealing my
mistakes I know I cut bobs when the when
the cut isn't perfect at the end I just
bump it inwards and you came and tell
and I still looks even it's a tree I
don't know how it works but it worked as
so because this is a tutorial I'm gonna
be talking too much about what I'm doing
I'm just gonna let you guys walk but
it's not gonna be like I know what I'm
doing because my first time however its
animal review because I used his hair in
my video on how i customized my lace
frontal my wigs and I said that I would
give you know I'll do another video
talking about the hair and the quality
here myself our review so I'm gonna do
that in this video just throughout the
video you know what I mean so prepare
for that anyways I just cut one side of
my hair that side of my hair or whatever
side I don't have bangs on I typically
do with the fastest because I'm not
really worried about how it looks like
hair but to a certain extent my main
focus is how good my bangs look because
I feel like what someone has bangs and
someone looks at their hair like this
first Macy is the bang area that makes
sense so yeah I just kind of rush this
part
I'm just section off pieces and cutting
as I go I kind of zoom so you can see
how it works now I did learn by doing
this that it's best if you do thin
sections of hair as you see I was doing
pretty thick section so I made a little
harder I feel like you'll be much neater
if I did do thin SEC sections but this
is my first time doing this so I didn't
know about this hair it's from miss glam
hair now I've had this hair for maybe
like a month now actually I know I wore
to a lay when I did my she was makeup
geek so it was like my go-to wig for
that this hair is extremely easy to
manage I've only died at once I dyed
this black color now my hair reflects
blue-black but it's really jet black in
person I do use a blue black hair dye
which is why the light reflects that by
me I don't like mislead you guys it
doesn't look like this in person it's
just a really really really jet black Oh
as far as like the wefts for this hair
goes um the only reason why I decided to
talk about West my reviews now is
because I experienced a really really
really really bad batch of hair from
this one company I don't know with in a
bunch of hair they're whiffs the
construction was absolutely horrible
which is why you guys never see make a
video on it because I mean I'm not a
brand basher but I mean if I get
prompted I'm like I just I literally
won't don't talk about I won't put the
name out won't do any that cuz I just
don't even want to put in the universe I
don't want you guys to even think about
buying a hair so every style had that
experience I really pay close attention
to the weft and just how they're
constructed I feel like the construction
of the wet web is really important
because it determines how long the hair
is going to last so I noticed with these
wefts they're very easy to glue down and
very easy to sew and they're also
they're not there's single web did which
is what I look for I hate double web
Selena just with the tracks when you
split the tracks it loosens the entire
web so it makes it more more what's the
word more likely to shed when you split
the tracks now as far as a hair itself
it had a really nice luster when I first
got it however the luster was altar wine
dyed the hair whenever you got your hair
like a blue-black it just makes it more
shiny and healthy looking so this isn't
the natural luster that died to this but
the hair had like a really nice match
Buster and I'm as far as Shetty
entangling goals it doesn't tangle um
yeah yeah doesn't tangle cuz when I were
in a late honestly barely styled it I
started once I curled it out and started
picture right here and after that I kind
just like those curls stayed in for like
the two days I was out in LA I didn't
have to do it so that was pretty
convenient I do remember the hair
shedding a little bit when I I curled it
when I was in LA yeah I remember because
I remember seeing a little bit of the
hairs on my bathroom floor my hotel so
just shed it's like minimal shedding but
honestly whenever here sheds um ok
headaches I've had sorta bad hair
experiences I had experience with this
one brand I wanted to their name I will
just say that they charge 400 bundle
their bundles aren't even the standard
bundle width or wherever high reset and
so I expect a lot from their hair and it
shouldn't tangled like crazy to the
point where I just couldn't even wear
anymore I like screw this I'm not
working with you guys anymore um ever
say I had that experience whatever I do
have hair
honestly little shedding it's a blessing
because I just never want to experience
them a shine I experience with their
hair I was so disappointed I was so
disappointed you guys it was a company I
want to work with for years but man did
their hair shed so yeah the shanks went
to this hair it was nothing it was
nothing it was just minimal shedding
regular shedding um I'll take it
compared to you know the hair Pat of the
past that shed like crazy but yeah
overall on a scale of 1 to 10 I would
give his hair I'll give a smooth 9 I'm
really picky when it comes to rating
hair tins only cuz yeah I'm just super
picky on that there's only one hair I
think is a tin and I'll talk about that
another video but I'll get it so 9 and
what I wear the taragan yes I would I
plan on getting blonde bundles from them
so that way I could like do a tutorial
on how I like dye my hair maybe like a
gray or silver because I miss that color
so give it a thumbs up if you guys want
to see that or leave it down below if
you guys would like to see a tutorial on
that cuz really easy yeah this is pretty
much the finished style I think came out
really nice I mean it was really easy to
do I told you guys this wasn't tutorial
I just want to show you guys myself
cutting my hair very quick simple video
hope you guys enjoyed it you want more
videos like this why you know get
reviews this way let me know but if you
want a more detailed video on how to cut
a bob I will do that when I find my
sister
