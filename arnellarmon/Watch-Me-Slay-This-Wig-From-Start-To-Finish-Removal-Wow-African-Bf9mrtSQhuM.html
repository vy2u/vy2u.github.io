welcome right now and this video is
gonna be on this wig
you guys I'm so shocked this actually
came out great this video is pretty much
gonna be on me styling this wig from
start to finish it's really not much to
it
I just none of my rumors out right now
you guys so basically I'm one of my
favorite youtubers elitist face I
watched her video on I think its title
like I don't know way closely I'll
insert like that and I'm she did this
thing with this dog to be blue stuff
which I've seen is before I actually
never company to use it I mean she
includes me but she did this thing and
it looks super cool where she like I
essentially glued the cap to her head
with stuff and then like I guess created
her a little hair line and so I did that
and it looks sorry my my tongues reality
hot chips I did that it looks so good
I'm at that like I'm just not doing that
I'm mad that she's just I'm making video
on that but it's cool it's so cool
because this literally looks so natural
and I didn't have to customize the
frontal if I mean I plucked my part of
it but I didn't have to customize the
frontal a doll like this is look even
better with my front to customize look
factor idea to customize add-on and
looks this good already it's nuts to me
like if I get up close it looks like my
hair it's growing out of my scalp
literally so um you know I filmed myself
doing this I'm not an expert if you guys
wanna know like you I guess like an
expert opinion just watch the leaves
video I'll link in the description box
below but used to bail me got hair all
over me
I put lotion on the night that's my idea
to the lotion on that cut your hair but
tippy don't be trying it out and me just
dialing this wig which is surprisingly
super easy this one's from out African I
show you guys if the weight comes like
out of the box
well I can you guys know the Joe of the
wigs are super nice this one is like
exceptionally nice this one's nice what
other ones I've had as far as texture
girls could so silky and soft it's super
silky I'm not sure what Texans is it
should have looked at the frickin info
card before I couldn't intro but
everything will be down below the
details all that stuff and um yeah why
make opt out I'll let you guys watch
this video hope you guys enjoyed if you
do thumbs up subscribe and I'll see you
guys later babe before I go I want to
show you guys this this stuff this is
going nowhere you guys I'm yanking it in
my hair I'm gonna fight right now it's
not going anywhere so this is slept on
like I don't even know where I'll have
an example metaphor but this is so slept
on um I mean I'm sure pulley like me I'm
not gonna do it double wet at first you
know you just got a wedding whatever I'm
gonna put my edges but this stuff I
guess to show you guys cuz I mean look
at that
that's Thank You Lea baby wait till the
train whistle video now
see you guys later fix my hair alright
so this the boss comes in your
traditional wife can box then you have
the wig and I'm gonna show you the
inside of it it has three clips in the
front and I'm gonna cut that middle clip
out because I want a lot of lace space
to work with and with that clip in the
middle if I want to do a middle part you
would see the clip and so just in case
just from her more versatility I'm gonna
get rid of that middle clip I almost
over the side clips to but they weren't
on any lace so I mean they weren't
really in the way so I didn't need to
cut them off and whenever I caught my
clips I saved them because if I've ever
width it's like not laying down I could
always sew these on to another wig so if
you ever cut off your clips save them
they come in handy trust me and you like
save money cuz I mean yeah anyways I'm
tucking the hair inside the wig that way
when I bleached the knots on the frontal
none of the hair gets bleach on it
then I'm going to get my bleach mixture
set up I have my bowl I have my bleach
I'm using this bleach paella only
because it's like a leftover bucket that
I have actually ELISA left us at my
mom's house and she gave it to me so
free bleach Dan to pay for this but I'm
gonna get like two scoops maybe three
this bleach is super powdery it's like
it's like coke it's like dog well I've
never had cokes I wouldn't know but it
looks like coke to me anyways I'm gonna
pour a little bit developer in there
because you want this bleach make sure
to be super thick like me it's like 12
nights so I have a lot of energy but um
yeah you want to pour very little bleach
in there because you don't want to be
runny
I actually bleached this I bleached this
frontal really nice now I look back and
think I did it like I did a pretty good
job on this and so you want to spread
that make sure it's gonna be a little
difficult you may have to add a little
more developer to make it a little more
smooth but I'd rather it be difficult
and kind of hard to spread versus it
being too runny too easy to spread
because then it'll most likely sleep
through sleep is that the word I'm
looking for
see seep through the knots and you don't
want that and so you know least that
thing you know use a butter knife
Chrissy bills taught me and just you
know smooth it on the frontal like
butter I left this on there for like 30
minutes I could have left on there
longer I was just in a rush and I want
to you know make the video because the
hair felt super nice but 30 40 minutes
will do the trick I'm using 40 bad
developers so it processed pretty fast
I'm gonna mess for like five seconds I
dyed my hair so it looks kind of crazy
but put that wig cap on are you gonna
put it over your ears well what am i
doing right here oh yeah I'm gonna use
some of the got to be Jo just slick my
hair back a little bit so I have no
flyaways and my hair is like the real my
roots look darker cuz I dyed my roots
dark with my actual hair but anyways
we're not talking about that
so you want to put the wig cap over your
ears and then you want to put the guts
meat glue around your hairline so that's
what you want to do in this stuff it's
it's so different from the black one for
some reason I never bought this one I
thought it would be similar to the black
one but they're totally different the
black ones like it clear we're running
gel this was like almost like Elmer's
glue it's super cool it's super cool and
so you want to put that around the
hairline and then use a blow dryer on
this the cool setting if it's warm it
won't work to dry that thing you don't
see you so yeah
dry it until it turns clear and then
once it's dry I'm gonna get your
scissors and you want to cut around dude
I'm doing you want to cut around it
watch it for those little ears you know
you don't cut yourself don't blame me if
you do I didn't tell you to do it I'm I
kind of did but don't blame me if you
you know cut yourself just don't do it
don't cut yourself and then I put a
little extra glue around that perimeter
you know to make sure that's really
staying down and then I'm going to put
little first I'm going to cut the lace
around the wig off you know just because
I don't need that and then I'm gonna put
the wig on you know
and this kind of trick use my first time
doing this and it was like kind of hard
not getting it on the sticky part yeah I
didn't let this dry all the way cuz of
course I want to be tacky so the glue
that's like nothing glue the wick could
stick down and why tell you guys that
the wick automatic starts ticking down
it started feeling secure the minute I
like press down so this stuff is really
the real deal and so now I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna pin the wig back I believe
from my memory I feel much like Fela
days ago and I'm gonna just add glue to
the sides where I want more hold and I'm
also gonna make my part where I know I
want the hair to be parted I knew I want
like a side part I'm also going to cut
some of that lace off just to kind of
like form my head shape a little more I
want to come back and customize as wigs
I feel like if I did it would be a
winner I honestly have price of this wig
but here I'm just adding that got to be
glue just to the size kind of want the
side stick up I just think it's so cool
that like I find know how to make my
wigs to wear none of my real hair is out
I also hate my bro hair is out on my
hairline so weird but with this stocking
cap trick it's like you could really
make your own hairline and that's super
cool to me that's super cool so I'm so
happy I you know finally did this and
you can kind of see my natural hair
sticking out of the back that's because
when I cut the wig cap it got rid of the
stretchiness in the back so that's the
only thing out to figure out tying my
real hair up so it doesn't stick out
from underneath my wig I took you later
on though and so I put the glue on then
I wrap my scarf around my head just to
let that dry and I'm doing my makeup
off-camera and you know just to pass the
time then I'm come back with my face
done looking better
I'm gonna take a scarf off and it looks
kind of crazy at first but I'm gonna
star letting you know dude I do
customized it a little bit but I don't
think this look was so easy to work with
a knife like with this method I made it
so easy like this is probably one of my
most pleasant experiences with the wig
as far as like styling it kind of
straight out the box the only thing that
I had to do that was like the most
tricky part which isn't even tricky but
if you're a beginner I'll kind of be a
little tricky is bleach the knots
imagine if this wig came with bleach
knots I wouldn't have to do honestly
much me anything you just put it on put
your wig cap on mold it down you know do
this before you do your makeup do your
makeup by the time you're done the wig
and the glue is always dry and then you
just style it and I mean I'm gonna like
pluck my part a little bit just cuz I
want that part to just be more
noticeable but I honestly didn't have to
do that I just did that because you know
that's what I do and Here I am just kind
of cutting my bangs just a little bit so
I wants a little more biggie I kind of
leave vibes going on right here huh I
mean not a leas face Ilia to sing
earlier but um yeah just gonna continue
to do this video I don't know why I'm
talking so much sorry
I'll let you guys watch the video then
I'll check back in towards the end
this is it it looks so good you guys it
looks so good oh my god from now I won't
what I'm on my wigs to be late I'm gonna
do the got to be glue trick where I make
no one here line cuz this looks too good
and if I put none of my real hair is out
it's so nice so what I'm doing I almost
remove this wig off camera but then I
realize need to be beneficial show you
guys how to remove it on camera cause
filming a lot of bills this day so you
know I have to take this off and you
know get on to my next video so I never
removing it like right after this video
but I want to show you guys how I remove
it just so you know you know you get a
two in one so I'm gonna show you guys
how to remove it in like one second
alright guys so I want to remove this
because I have other videos who work on
you know business whatnot but I decided
to make this video installing and
removing because you know why not
so I'm going to do in order to remove
this stuff this got to be glue which
learn is damn like glue
you get a water bottle you get makeup on
you know can do this neatly so you don't
you know mess it up you just spray
closely to the perimeter and you slowly
start to lift and to get help you get a
comb and you do that and that helps it
lift then you can slide the comb
underneath and to loosen it damn this is
good I'm using the spray the black one
sucks compared to this so I don't like
the black one the black got to be this
one's much better you just wet it a
little bit and then it's like that it's
gonna be white at flaky but I mean this
honestly this practice on I probably
kept this would look for a good week or
two you know my whole life has changed
oh wow music gotta add genuine I'm
alright
hi I know what moves me too it's just
done Oh God
okay just split this is I hurt by the
way it looks kind of gross but it don't
hurt at all and my wig caps actually
come off with it which is interesting
come with it stay on and I just pull it
off and bam
now I'm gonna assume that before you
pull apply it back on you want to like
rinse it and wash it so it looks fresh
but ideally if you're using this to put
your wig on you probably want to keep it
off for at least a week this is like
mold to my head I could take it off this
one doesn't hurt at all my babies are
safe but this looks crazy now but
they're going it I don't want the hot
mess for too long our videos so yeah
thumbs up subscribe well good stuff and
I'll see you guys later
