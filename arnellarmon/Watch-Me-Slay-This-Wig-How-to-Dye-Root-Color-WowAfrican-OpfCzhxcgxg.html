can see where that's my old period so
it's totally growing I'll put it out
there they actually work Oh God how are
you doing alright time to to lick my
hair back with my gel like always is
what I do it ain't nothing changing
let's put that back
this song did you do my hair with you
know what I knew who my edges are
thinning I promise you guys like it's
not because I do my hair naturally stand
and annoying and now my natural hair is
growing back my edges look even more
than because my edges are using a light
brown blonde color you can't see in the
camera though but I'm light but in the
sunlight you can see all of it and it's
like it's annoying but I refuse to down
in here like I'm not then I touch it
anymore I'm gonna let it grow and
hopefully a year from now and you're

do you would be with that and they see
me got brown hair Lee Betts to color my
skills as oh but amazingly if you like
this stuff okay I entertain powder on
anyways and I don't know how it is so oh
there oh woops it alright I don't stain
I'm going to do this in select awk same
time I noticed that I started you like a
dark wig cap and make it lighter than to
get a light weight how to make it darker
because if you ever see me wear it will
be very very light yellow wick have
actually hate those because something
about when I try to make them darker it
gets to oranjee my dancers it gets to
oranjee and like weird looking but when
I get these like the darker ones and I
make them whiter it looks much more
better so I'm going to put that first
and then I'm going to use some re-type
it's wigglin I know that the scalpels
weird they're very light so what I do is
I just put a little bit of my powder on
the inside this as well just go really
Moscow my kidneys are outside the door
planes are crazy so I'm just going to
get this and tint that as well at the
taller lat when it's on the Gulf Coast
parent experiment and suck okay
I don't know movie critic now I guess I
got to put on my bio beauty bloggers
less movie critic its oh my god it makes
me mad that I need I felt sick twice and
it's crazy looks so good in a creepy I
wasn't anyways I'm trying entertain
myself on you this
all right type of wig on we're good
we're good uh this thing on whoo oh my
god you guys I could tell this movie a
beauty when I style it now before it
died away while he's here um I noticed
that the duh what happens I've been
called the hairline it works super
straight rather customers that really
you're not really doing that I'm going
to try a good message to where I don't
have to do that I'll probably do a
middle part I'm going to have some baby
hair so I get some trouble over those
but in the part of the group far back
okay we look for your cell phone harder
than Oh far back because I'm going to
cut off this middle clip because it's
going to call to my nail car to not lay
it flat so I'm going to cook it off I
don't I never use the middle clip
anyways go over and get rid of that
right now
alright now I'm a cop away so we got
because a whisk
fits my head pretty perfectly now I'm
just gaining a decibel shaft and signing
the back just to feel more secure
all right he has a very like weird
hairline but it's really nice link okay
okay let's see these flappy things let
the bat what is that some people
okay ah what is that something weird
hold on
okay okay that that's new that's weird
okay in the wig right now the clip
there's this little thing right here and
after what it is but it's been like
suggestible collect medals I'm not sure
why duck there I've never experienced on
a wig maybe it's to make it curved to
fit your head more that's really new I
was accepting that but I mean I guess
I'll try to work with it because quite a
bit I just I'd never have to know where
to do that but they were like curvy
Ingres I really don't know why I don't
know I'm gonna take those side clips put
that in okay wow that's really weird
that actually kind of like how it feels
in a weird way because it feels they're
secure Oh nuts
alright I'm stylin and finesse it I'm
never gonna talk lose it'll be forever
so I'm sure you guys watch make the
message I applied to the voice-over
about what I'm doing I'm like the
semester method what I'm doing my wigs a
lot of times I have to be my zone
and I'll agree be in my zone mean I
can't talk so I'm going to focus my
attention on this and uh you guys get to
enjoy so keep watching all right so if
you haven't noticed like I'm plucking
and doing as Danny to do but the wig
just was not looking good well he's in
my opinion um so I decided that I was
going to die the roots Brown I did
insert a clip where I'm going into a
clip of me doing that because yeah like
this wig like it was almost good but I
was not messing with the roof no matter
how much I tweeze no matter what I did
so I had to use this Revlon brown box by
like three dollars and I put it in a
bowl IR I did like the back part I did
most of it and I just had to add the
roots Brown so imma let you guys watch
that really fast I'm gonna speed it up
because I mean it's pretty simple I'm
just putting about dying the roots
okay so I'm kind of Ambleside to open
know where I left off in the last video
I filmed I got this little mop you can
and I saw a little tirade on yesterday
and in that video I thought okay I'm in
some video put the lid on could be all
night and then I realized that it would
not go look how I wanted to look and let
my dad the roof and so I was going to do
yesterday house in a row that's what I
was doing I was in a rush but I decided
to just wait and then fill myself dying
the roof today and this is what the wig
looks like after I fixed it um yeah I
don't know how to end this video to make
it make sense
I just hope make sense but yeah this is
a wig I don't know how to make this
video make sense I just want to let put
it all in one because I didn't want to
do that a separate video because then
I'll have to go over the wig and I'd
already cut the lace and everything but
I didn't want to do all that but um now
you got the roof this wig is it's like a
beautiful um it looks much better I hope
you guys read Gris or else like this
videos for nothing
but um if you Maggie scene if you watch
the entire video and put it on this
looks much better huh like oh but oh my
god okay so yeah all I have to do was
die the roots Brown I didn't touch the
actual hair itself I've got through it's
brown I rinsed it out washed it and I
just restrained it and we have ourselves
a winner
so where I convinced Rick yes I do
right cursing anymore but I love it I
realized just like honestly like Diamond
Ruth is very very easy now if this label
like aa weird color you go and dry the
whole thing over again business okay I
want you guys have to go through all
that so it's like maybe don't get it but
because the color itself is already
perfect you ought to do is just kind of
like do the roots to make it match my
skin tone more and maybe he'll all men
together if it all depends on your
preference - applied everything better
on me I look yeah it's so simple I was
going to recommend it I just am in love
this color I feel like it makes me look
more tan because the color so like
affecting my skin so it definitely makes
me look more tan which I like which I
need but I'm yeah I want it to be super
long so I'll into right here hope you
guys enjoyed it um I think this is yeah
it is it okay okay yeah I can't be a big
deal to say but like this video and
please subscribe and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
