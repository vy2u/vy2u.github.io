little pink bag so of course I mean if
you want to put it on you got to get out
the back so room from the bag and this
one looks like I missed you guys with
inside looks like because I think the
wig is constructed so beautifully so
yeah this one looks like I'm also going
to show you guys another wig that I
already have to kind of show you how to
difference between the construction of
different lace wigs for different like
companies um so here's this wig now as
you can see the lace portion for your
part of the front it's very short and I
have like this thick lace strip right by
the part and it's very annoying because
when you have your part you can
definitely see that and I hate that
whereas this wick doesn't have that and
it has more lace like frontal space and
you can work with which I definitely
appreciate so the first thing I do is
bleach the knots on the frontal part not
to be honest like this thing barely had
any knots well they had knots but
they're very very light brown and I mean
for the most part they're already kind
of bleached so honestly this is kind of
why I messed up although I fixed it made
it look better I kind of over process it
I left the bleach on for a little too
long and so if you guys like a video on
how to fix like over-processed
bleach on lace frontals or closures kind
of lumpy mess about that it's very easy
to mess up on let me know and I'll do
that video like ASAP because I mean I'm
gonna fix his wig ASAP so if you want
that video let me know and I'll record
it just like I don't know I don't know
comment below please let me know so yeah
when you're mixed to your bleach you
just wanna make sure it's a thick
consistency you know see I'm talking
about I used like prior cap pack of the
quick boobie black quick blue bleach and
like I just poured a thin layer
developer right on top and then I mixed
it and it was like the perfect texture
this would've been perfect if I didn't
need to already which the knots but I
mean hey little learn so that's what I'm
doing
now I do bleach my front of the lace
closure I use like this I don't know
it's like for painting but I use that
looks I feel like it makes it easier and
I think we use the brush because it has
those bristles sometimes those bristles
come on go through the holes the laser
we do it the wrong way and it's just I
don't know I just feel like this Way's
safer as far as like keeping it from not
getting onto the hair all right so now
that I bleached my frontal part of the
wig I rinse that off and now it's time
to the elastic band so yeah it's easier
if you just watch me do it but I'm
pretty much just taking one piece of the
elastic and I'm kind of like trapped
area where I want to place into how I
place it and so I take one and I put it
on the end of like the lace I hate I
don't know what to call it it's like the
lace friends want a wig with the whole
wing plate it's like what do you even
call that the lace front I put it on
there but it's like the lace fronts it's
like it's only the front this is all
lace but I put it where it's gonna be
close to my ear like I put oh my god
just watch me do it Jesus oh my god it's
like really like my knowledge on all the
terms because I mean I thought I knew
everything but I don't know what to call
this I just I sold on to the lace and I
do like ear by ear and the how I
determined how long I need my lasting
plan is I kind just take one in and then
I like stretch it and I pull it tightly
and then I measure to my other ear and I
loose it a little bit up just so it's
not too tight and then I cut it in and
it's pretty simple
now that we are abend up it's time to
cut the lace off not as simple you just
kind of lace off by the way the elastic
band comes with the mice my first wig
package which is awesome because I've
been getting a last band from Walmart
and now that I experienced this one when
a Walmart sucks it's way too hard it
hurts your head I like never one use it
to get like I don't know where they got
the elastic band but I love it and I
think it's awesome that they included it
in the package
it's an albacore all the leaves is time
to put on my head now I'm gonna put this
stocking cap on this also came with the
package this stocking cap was
interesting so I've never seen one this
color they're easily like oh they're
easy
oh my god they're usually either like a
dark brown or super light but it was a
trip because this was almost the perfect
color was a little too dark but I mean
it made it work so before I can put the
wig on I'm gonna lay my baby hairs with
this Eco style gel for curling weight it
works best for my texture it's honestly
I'm better than a turtle so I just feel
like it lays my edges better and feel
like I just was a little too thick for
my hair so I'm just gonna lay my edges
really fast now before I put the wig on
I'm gonna put this airspun and soft
focus powder on the honestly I wasted my
time doing this because I am NOT doing a
middle part and do like a side part but
if you ever wanna do a middle part and
you want to make it like mattress scalp
as much as possible you can put powder
on the stocking cap that is the powder
you typically use I mix airspun powder
with it just to make it a little lighter
so scalp is lighter but then I mix my
foundation powder into it too kind of
like tone that down you see what I'm
doing but I mean this is just optional
so now I'm gonna put on the wig and
we're gonna go from there
another work on the front part of the
way take this clip it kind of clip the
hair in the front to the back so it's
not in my way and we're going to try to
finish this way to make you look as good
as possible
right so I'm trying something new today
I got this knot Jill
I'll leave the name below and I try to
do that thing okay because everyone can
say it I'll use got to be jail blah blah
blah tell me why I got a Walmart
i buy the jail and it's wrong one no one
said hey get the got to be in the yellow
bottle so I got the blue jail for like
Mohawk so I mean I can't use that I
figured I like maybe to come to jail
that's sticky so this gorilla likes not
jail it's kind of sneaky sneaky it's
sticky but this one wasn't sticking like
I wanted it to okay so I put on like my
little hair line I blow dried it and I
was like for some reason I don't think
this is gonna work but I found subducted
so keep watching I decide to use another
gorilla snot gel and see this one's
stickier see how that one's kind of
sticky and snotty and that one's a
little more runny because they're all
different the colour the tube determines
how like stinky and how strong it is so
I got the yellow one and the yellow one
it was ah see um kind of dried out even
though it's always super snart like that
it was a little it was like snotty ER
okay and so I put that where I place
other gel and it was magical though I
don't like so this gels yellow and it
doesn't really dry clear if you don't
really thin it out so I mean I learned
and next time I'll probably like thin it
out and smooth it out a little more but
I mean it still look good
so once I'm enjoying that I'm going to
blow-dry the actual hair you know Co
still kind of wet after washing the
bleach for my lease my lease so I'm just
blow drying it to dry it so it's easier
to work with is this here so beautiful
guys like it's so nice and honestly like
it got straight just for me blow drying
it like that how silky the texture is
you really want to do too much to it and
that's why I think it's awesome it feels
your first wig
oh that's new bleep I know I'm such a
loser but yeah seriously I think this is
it I honestly based on the wigs I just
experienced and the ones I made I think
this is really it's a really great
beginner wig and so yeah totes mcgoats I
don't know why to set that many ways now
it's time to figure out what kind of
part of my doing so when I was
blow-drying my hair I was like oh I kind
of like it to the side so I decided to a
side part
so of course i zoom inks I'm on my
angles so now it is time to plug my
friends because I mean plucking is the
way to go tweezing whatever you were to
call it it totally makes difference now
peep this the freaking part looks
horrible right now I would tease someone
with the part like mine at the moment
but in this video you guys know you know
you're gonna figure out why I'm the
truth
now that we're done plucky it's time to
you know conceal the part now I'm taking
this like little cinema secrets palette
and I'm gaining this like lighter shade
that matches me perfectly
and I'm just gonna dab that on to the
part now you guys are probably thinking
oh she's done she's finished looks
amazing
no I'm not done cuz I might like really
go ham and you guys about to really
figure out why I'm the truth this is
where things get crazy I'm taking this
felt tip eyeliner and I just realize
that's what I really like I can't use my
eyes anymore and I'm going to go to the
part now I'm gonna make the part a
little less wide by I'm kind of drawing
little hair strokes because if you look
up close it looks like it makes like
that the hairs growing out of the lace
closure just watch just watch it's magic
it makes the part look so much better
and I kind of like mate some little
strokes along the other ones because I
didn't want the part to look too perfect
I mean what's a little nice but too
perfect looks fake so yeah it just yeah
do look doesn't it yeah just it did the
trick okay now I'm making this proud bro
brow palette Vitus hacia just uses black
shadow in here and I'm going to pretty
much put the powder all around my edges
to make sure you know they don't too
thin because you guys know my edges they
be on some other stuff and this just
makes it look more complete and just
more full and yeah just watch them do
this and I'll be right back
is it looking amazing like this we
perfect divided it freaking over bleach
the knots I mean it's okay cuz we got
that we're gonna fix it and we're gonna
like totally make a video on it I'm
gonna see everyone's life but this is
the part where I'm like okay cuz
honestly the the wig was in shambles
like oh my god can I really do this am I
really the truth but I mean this
finished look I think it looks really
great I like it so I hope you guys like
it too hope you guys liked this video
and I'll see you guys in my next video
Simon do another video with this wig you
know show you guys different styles and
how you know you know you know I don't
even know but I'll see you as a next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
