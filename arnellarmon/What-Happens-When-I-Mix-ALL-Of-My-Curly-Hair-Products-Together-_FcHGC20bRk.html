you're new welcome so today's video is
going to be on me mixing all my care of
the hair products together isn't this
thing going around YouTube what people
were just mixing all this stuff together
I'm not sure who inspired it I think I
feel something illogical but then it can
run watched her video i Function that
idea for someone else so I really don't
know how I dragged back the specific
idea from Lacetti she also had does
YouTube her name is Lisette but YouTube
lesedi I'll link her below because I she
I'm super cute and just I love her and
so on my best idea from her because she
has really nice curly hair and she's
psyched makes all her coat across
together and I thought that was really
cool and I didn't kind of wear my hair
like just out natural lately so I just
decided to try it so let's just start it
because I have a bag while my curly hair
proxxon here a lot I lost a lot my car
their products or I think gave him away
something I like to mini but I have
enough to like to where it should be
kind of interesting to see what happens
so let's get started so I have a curve
ball and I have a spoon I really like
spoonfuls of each products just so I
don't like overdo it because I mean
knowing me I'll prep it a lot in here so
I want to do that so the first time I'm
going to use it as Camille grows
Naturals curl love moister net mix rice
milk and macadamia oil that's first one
and I guess like as I'm adding the
products
I'll give like a mini review want you to
them because I mean I've used all of
them of course this product it's okay
it's not necessarily my favorite my hair
it's like I can use this a lot it's what
was currently okay you ever have like
your favorite hair products then you use
on special days and then you have Publix
that like you use when you don't want to
use your favorites I knew that I don't
use my favorites so I mean I don't
dislike it however it doesn't always
react the best of my hair but maybe
it'll be cool when I mixing other stuff
so we're gonna see next thing I have is
this can - coconut curling cream
focus bro we doing oh there goes alright
and I use for a while - I like this
however I dunno I don't know
Lynda's but I do know that Canty
products usually have alcohol in them
which dries out my hair so I mean this
does work good for me sometimes have
right if like it takes away the moisture
a little sometimes depends it also
because I'm like you know how my hair
too next thing I have which I'm almost
out of but we're gonna try to squeeze a
lot out of here it's almost gone so I
really love this stuff it's the Miss
Jessie's pillow soft curls little goose
I don't think I even have enough to like
put in here oh maybe I do I took the top
off I have like a little bit but enough
to where it's gonna count in my mixture
this is gonna be so interesting you guys
and then I have this um I have this
bottle that I got from Sally's so
everything I don't use I'm put in here
so if it happens weren't really good I
could save it cuz I member when we saw
this next thing I have is my curl
enhancing smoothie by Shea Moisture I
love this stuff I do thought the formula
change if I'm tripping or not but if you
still want better my hair than it does
now I don't know it's one of those pox
I'd use my door knees microscope to be
honest all right rose done well
literally okay so next thing just like
my favorite product ever it is the
formula combing creme my Carol's
Daughter I have like so many of these
bottles so let's have to do this I was
going to put a spoonful I don't want to
be fair I just bought you are you done
I'd go through these so luggage next
thing I have is my Miss Jessie's coyly
custard I have two of these this is my
newer bottle so I'll definitely be gonna
get you know some out of this I love
this stuff miss jessie's and general is
really nice I used to always see Miss
Jessie's um back when I work at Target
and like I'm like oh my god $20 $15 it
just seemed like so much for curl
products but I mean I before now so I
might all the time now
know that like some people are always
hesitant to buy it because I got the
price but I person think it's worth it
and they last pretty cool amount of time
- all right so next thing I use for my
um code before it's not good curl
product I've used for microbes before
it's this dark and lovely easy twist
shell in butter I just I need to say my
hair before what I want when I wore my
curly so I'm gonna put it in my
concoction I'm gonna pump a spoonful of
this actually super fun to do okay
I don't have a coma process so nice
being that I've used for my curly hair
before that actually makes my curls pop
is this S Curl Curl waves and natural
hair curl activator I love the smell of
it to moving the happiest is so long I
know the see this is mush and something
like five dollars so I'm gonna pour some
of that we got that in there duh okay
love this stuff love this stuff
alright now I have my diva curl ultra
fine gel I love the stuff as well I have
like a big like bumpy thing so I always
go to them so fast I'm just pumped some
of that I'm so like you see how it's
gonna turn out next
I have my little just actually an old
model right here I love this stuff so
much and it's like so crazy even it even
will get sent to me I still I treat like
I bought it because man is stuff is
pricey but this bottle might actually
broke so I'm just gonna scoop some out
oh I'm sorry Lulu service pricey I
bought some for my sister my older
sister and also girl alright so it's
safe say I love that stuff though it's
so nice especially mix with ultra
defining gel perfect mixture alright so
the next thing is is as I am curling
jelly
I actually just start using this like I
don't really have a
pinion on I've only used it once so I
mean I'm gonna like you know give my
thoughts and they say I don't think it
could actually see that just yet because
I mean only use it once and I use what
other product so I don't know how it
works Cologne all right and then I have
these that I thought a while ago that
I've never used so I'm gonna mind to use
them now in there you know how I can use
my store they have those are those let's
little packet so you could try different
curly hair stuff I might as well add
things in there because I mean why not
it's own is Jesse's quick curls and I'm
just gonna put the whole packet in there
cuz I mean it's not a lot you know I
bought these a while ago and I never
used them so Adam in here I have the
Miss Jessie's curly Naren just creating
these packs like three dollars each the
other ones for fully tax and I love this
Jessie so it's okay Jessie this one's
good this was hella good oh wow and then
I have this curly butter cream also by
Miss Jessie's and I'm gonna ask that in
there as well and that last one smells
really good okay so we have everything
in this bowl now we have to mix it do
you guys an ASMR honestly when I watch
videos I like the sound of it mixing
look I love this stuff I don't know if
you've ever into that but I like a some
more so this really like satisfy to my
ears
maybe it will satisfy yours - I hope so
it's not annoying how the texture this
is really weird
so to make these are climbers put in
this bottle now cuz I mean like why not
I'm going to scoop it in there uh you
know actually no I'm not to make a mess
firstly put in there later cuz I'm not I
keep dropping the bottle I'm not gonna
be alright right now so if I would I
never wet my hair because when I
whatever I you know do my curly hair
routine or promise my hair is always
like fresh in the shower so it's only
right to wet my hair this fall I'm using
is from Sally's I'm I get asked out a
lot it's a mr. it's so much more like
easier using regular spray bottle spray
bottles are annoying I don't like them
at all alright so I have my big man
brush which is really great for curly
hair so the brush i watered in my hair
right here is what enough that's how to
put this in my hair okay good nervous on
the why so the texture is super thick
like hella thick like super thick oh wow
I'm he's a little bit first I want go
ham
oh this was weird it smells really good
it's just like hella go ham that in
there why not oh it feels weird
oh my god this is a film be kind of
pissed I'm gonna still use it though cuz
I mean I'm not wasting my stuff it's
still
all right so relax my hair
I'm sure wish props causing this but I
feel it tingling
I'm almost I'm almost sure it's a curl
butter cream because it smells like it
has some time a tea tree oil in it and I
feel it tingling it has that smell like
if that makes any sense so I feel with
my scalp tingly but I mean my curls look
pretty nice the ones that aren't damaged
so now I must down my hair really quick
and I'm gonna I'm gonna like speak that
part out though because I mean I'm not
gonna cut this out I'm gonna go on with
the air drive I'm not gonna diffuse I
push you don't diffuse on because like I
don't know I don't really gotta do it
and almost drives my hair out so I slip
my hair air-dry and I'm gonna see like
my curls give more definition that way
so just took over the products and they
used to stop my hair look quick I just
have these two clips I don't know how
many use them just yet and I have my eco
style Joe when my hair straight I use s
control and when my hair is curly I use
Jill and just I don't know something
about it comes out better so I'm I'm use
my toothbrush I'm just so mad you guys I
lost my freaking edged toothbrush and I
feel I know where it is I've spent two
lazy look but up don't mind my little
riding toothbrush so I'm stopping here
quick and then uh yeah we check back in
soon
okay so did I hear you guys so now the
spheres are come along but like I'm
gonna like throw it up I'm going to go
out over my errands and I'm living here
air dry and then I'll come back home and
let you guys know um you know what I
think but is so fun
my curls look nice as hell like I mean
not saying they don't look nice a lot
but they they look nice they feel nice
like I said this is like gonna be a
thing because I love how this looks I
might take my hairstyle because this is
looking childish no you don't keep it
like this I put it like this cuz you
know like I wanted some up but I wanted
to keep like as much down pop I wanted
to keep as much as my hair down as
possible that way you know you could go
to the definition why not so yeah boom
Milo sad birds oh this is so freaky
alright guys so let me hair air-dry and
all that good stuff now if I can let you
know no power go okay guys so I'm back
home I'm very tired I was all day
shopping by myself I don't need taking
my jacket so my hair finally dried I
need to pick it out it's like it's dry
but it still feel super moisturize as
you guys can see the only parts a little
wet is like the parts of the clip was
that because me of course no air was
touching that I mean it's clipped up but
it is dry why I'm calling me sorry
she'll call back everyone was calling me
right when I'm filming I do it well
that's about the devil trying to
distract me but um yeah honestly this
mixture I had to put it into oh it feels
so weird it looks so weird it's almost
like I hate saying this word but me
Mini's mail meetings whatever and stuff
I don't eat nasty it's always like that
and so on honestly
I don't even know whether we're warm
who's to say my curls it's so we defined
and cute um I love you guys to see that
but they look pretty nice to me so uh
that's what happens I mix all miquelina
parts together
I'm not see the start used to make sure
every single day like I I don't know why
never thought doing that before I almost
want to take all my cut products and
just mix a whole big jar it mix every
single water like make more of this
mixture but I'm gonna put that in the
bottle first and then just use that and
then you know I'll probably even add
more and more curly parts to it but it's
like it's perfect because it's like I
can't explain it usually I use my curly
of products I'll use a lot since I use
the form of combing creme by Carol's
Daughter with my Miss Jessie's and that
is usually cool but by the end of the
day although it's XO this petition it
still I want to say like that I said
that finishing it's kind of frizzy and
I'll insert a feature right here over
here the insert will be there so you
guys know clown me so like it'll stop
definition but it looks like frizzy in
that moisturize but some of that on my
process together like it's the curls are
super defined and it looks like super
moisturized and not try it out well the
picture I inserted it should explain
like what I mean by the difference
because usually I find it in the day my
hair looks like that or like it looks
super dry and crazy but you know my hair
looks super teen neck oh my god I hate
that happens um my hair super team and
it's super cute and um yeah that's that
was a mix on that curl products the
other so if you enjoyed this video
