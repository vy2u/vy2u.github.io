to come oh what's in my bag video today
because one I got a cute new purse and
two because I don't want just have like
my channel all about tutorials I wanna
do other videos in between so let's get
started I don't have that much memory
card space so I can't talk as much as
I'd like to you so here's my bag this is
the baby uh wite-out wallet mmm alright
here goes my bag these are the strings
to tie it so no one looks inside and
then I have a little strap because I'm
too lazy carry like this like it over my
shoulder convenient it these come off by
the way I don't wanna take them off copy
Julie's taken no they come up pretty
easily
it comes with the strap like this and
then you care like this but I mean who
wants to do that that's so much work you
know hold in your hand
I'm so lazy okay but this bag some teddy
Blake um what can I say about this bag
oh I stained the inside huh okay okay
okay I can't put my energy on Terry now
I'll I'll be mad about it later
umm oh my god I'm so sorry I really just
got this like a week ago and already
stained inside this so I can't have nice
purses because I used to do this thing
where when I had a bag maybe I'll be
eating some Cheetos or something like
that and like if I didn't have a neck
and I'm just like wipe the inside of my
purse with it but you can't do that a
person like these this bag it's pretty
much it was made in Italy so that's
fancy right there I like this bag
because it's super simple
I'm a very simple person um I don't like
flashy stuff you guys have never seen me
wear anything flashy that's for a reason
um it's good its backstory to it
lobster my dad likes that kind of stuff
he's always trying to make us wear that
kind of stuff or so no dad take us to
forever 21
anyways I like this bag because super
plates every simple and not plain it's
super basic but still stylish and cute
it goes to everything great goes with
everything
umm great yeah great girls would forget
everything and it's really petite you
know like it fits a lot of stuff as you
we'll see you soon but it's super Tita
it's not big and annoying so I pay more
to that later but let's talk about
what's in this thing what do I would I
have a Jolly Rancher wrapper that
shouldn't be in there Oh a charley
furniture how hey I'll eat that later
okay my uber driver gave me some Jolly
Ranchers last night all right so first
things first a brush you need a what's
all right you need a brush okay and you
what you'll notice you need in your bag
well that's why I have I wear extensions
a lot and my theory is this and finally
wear fake hair it has to look real so I
have the tools that I need to make sure
it looks real throughout the day I have
my brush I have a toothbrush and my
little it's true a little baby I meet
these things um now it's weird let's
melodrama a person needs to fall out
because I'm bears like a wife she have a
toothbrush in her bag um but my hair
always looks late so no one could talk
about me when it comes to that you need
a brush you need a brush um
this brush is a blessing I used to have
a smaller brush but I don't know what
happened to I think through the way I
got bleach or something like that I
throw it away but I keep these on my
bags at all times all times these are
first three things
Oh most of my heart only thing I have
you need a lotion um what if you get a
sheet what if your friends are ashy what
if like I don't know you meet a guy and
you're like me and you care about how
hands look and his hands having the ashy
and you want to casually try to get him
a lotion on them so you can look at
better hands I don't know okay but you
need lotion and this one is a sugar plum
dream buy that the body works it's the
holiday kind um I actually don't even
like Santa lotion but you know when Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works snap at a Bed Bath and
whatever the heck yeah best body works
whenever they'll have those little cells
the annual cells would you like vile and
get 50% off and you going to spend a lot
of money on stuff that you don't even
abusing that's me so I bought like 12 of
these I'm trying use and so if you need
some lotion let me know because I have a
whole bunch but yeah I wanna mess my
hair okay
such a loser this is what you talk the
video so I get to Goofy and weird and
talk a lot alright what's next
duh you need a mirror okay so you can
check on yourself to make sure that you
look good because you never know like
when you're gonna see like your future
husband so you have to have a mirror
take a look at yourself so you can check
yourself out now I'm weird though like I
don't like looking in mirrors in public
I don't know why I cause typically on
people like any type of the Lord vain
they usually have a woman that's looking
in the mirror you know comics like
you're into yourself I'm really weird
and because I'm growing up I kind of
dealt people assuming that I'm already
into myself and stuck up because of my
looks I try to avoid doing any actions
that would make people think I'm into
myself so whenever I look at the mirror
I kind of I do it on the low or like I
go somewhere else where no one's around
I do it I'm weird I don't know I just I
don't know I don't know but you need a
mirror to make sure like you know you're
looking okay preferably a mirror there's
certain years you should get those
mirrors that suck that's just like okay
like what's the point of this mirror
there's mirrors that are perfect in the
middle they're not super awesome but
they don't suck like make you look
flawless and those mirrors that show you
too much of yourself I don't like those
mirrors um yeah there's mirrors I like
are so clear you just like out of a want
to see this part of myself so I like to
get a mirror that's like in-between so
it's like if if I'm looking jacked up I
don't necessarily want to know because I
don't freak out so that's just me okay
next thing I have I gotta grab all these
things and if you guys follow me on
snapchat you know that this is like real
life like this isn't just for the video
this is real light stuff I post about
all the time because I realize I have a
problem I have all these lip colors and
my purse I can't hold them all up
most all they were pretty much nude
because you always have new lipstick
I like to carry at least three or four
liquid lipsticks with me just in case I
watch if I want to like change my lip
color or something and I like to keep
the nude colors or very neutral colors
that go with everything so it's like
it's not like you know you know some eye
shadow looks they don't go every single
lip color these
ones do so I have colour-pop teeny-tiny
Lolita to buy Kat Von D and Dragic you
buy Jesse star and dose of color stone
so I'm wearing right now you need these
white eat them I just I always want
options okay now for gloss I had these
two in SS Beverly Hill one once when is
toffee and when is on doesn't a sticker
on it so I don't even know it looks like
coffee though
another one is buxom sugar which is like
my all-time favorite Claus
another one is another Anastasio just
bronze me now if I hadn't really
lipstick I always have to have like a
neutral gloss with me because you know
like a lipstick sometimes like they fade
throughout the date or they start maybe
they'll start to crumble and it's not
smart to kind of put another layer on
top you come to take it all off and then
put it back on but everyone knows that
we take up liquid lipsticks it's super
eyes take off if you get a gloss
preferably one that's like super neutral
this one barely has color to it it looks
gold but it's kind of like clear if you
get a gloss and you put on top and then
wipe with a napkin it takes it off so
much easier so this is the classic kind
of use for that if I want to take off my
liquid lipstick and you know not take
off my lips with it I just put a gloss
on top and then I wipe with a tissue I
don't get to go would give you gets a
tip and the last one is this lip gloss
by the balm
it's called babe and it's a pink gloss I
just say it's called BAM I had to like
you know really get into it or else I'm
boring alright next I have nail stuff um
I have a nail file and Clippers because
my nails are very annoying and they grow
but when they grow like the rip cuz
every week they suck so I just bring
nail clippers and files with me all time
because like if they rip I can't
function if my nails are ripped so I
just cut them Orange I'll file them to
fix them yeah I literally I can't I
can't function my nose your grip because
then they snag on everything and it
drives me crazy I refuse to buy my nails
so I think that's gross so being a bad
man these things
now what am i should mix okay more
things I always bring this fun I always
bring nice and birds with me now
whenever I post about simpered you know
a sim bird a lot of bloggers work with
them so it always seems sponsored oh
they paid you talked about it but they
really don't look they don't even know
I'm talking about it right now
I love sin bird sin bird is okay I
work with zipper for like over a year
now
yeah it's been over a year and I just
love them because they see one is new
when it's old this one's the older one
is the newer one
umm I don't work with them yeah for a
while and I love them because their
stuff lasts for so long
this is see I've had this for oshu my
god I missed myself
waste I've had this for over a year now
and there's still so much in it and it's
like you pretty much feel like a 30 day
supply but it lasts long thin that I
don't know I just I love them they're so
convenient I brought with me when I went
to Coachella
I bring with me everywhere but I'm
saying like you could just bring them
with you literally everywhere you want
to smell good and you know there's so
little you know say like you see a hot
guy and you see him approaching I don't
know why I wanted to smell me I want to
feel good like you can like secretly
pull it out why my whispering you can
pull it out and then true you know you
can't really see that you're spraying
perfume on you walks by oh yeah that's
me but I thought that before that's why
I'm saying this but sin third I have to
have that with me I talk so much anyways
what's next I only have two more things
this one by really fast or hey I have a
Holy Grail product I don't use what Holy
Grail a lot so this is a totally big
deal but let's just get into it I have
the Agent Zero shine by benefit this is
like you need it if you wear makeup or
your oily skin but if you wear makeup
you definitely need this cuz with make
it looks like your natural your oils you
know they naturally like mask your
makeup your oils are evil you know your
makeup is bound to kind of like you know
say if it's high gets sweaty whatever
the case may be this thing is a
lifesaver I had a coach
and everyone can ask me like oh you know
how should make a blast in this heat
and I'd be like this stuff it's pretty
much like a powder it has no it really
doesn't have any color to it why me it
looks it kind of yellow but it doesn't
really show up on your skin and you
twist this top open I don't waste it and
then you dump it I'm gonna fake dump it
I'm not gonna waste this baby
you fake dump it and then oh yeah you
get this little brush pull that up
drew drew drew and you're like your
makeup is legit it gets rid of all the
oil but the thing I like about this is
that it doesn't mess up your makeup it
doesn't move your foundation it doesn't
mess up it at all
like typically you know we get oily if
you do a blonde paper somebody can like
take off your foundation this is kind
like blotting paper but powder BAM
describe that now because I have this I
always had to bring a setting spray with
me because this it's powder and I don't
like when I use powders and it gives me
like that powdery look so I bring my
setting spray so that work and choo-choo
spray myself so it gets where the
powdery look also I like brings oh this
is uh Nick's dewy setting spray by the
way I like to bring a steady sprays
because sometimes when it gets hot or I
feel like my makeup just needs a
refresher if I'm not gonna use this I'm
gonna use a sign a spray just kind of
like refresh me you know and yeah I
think I described it pretty well so that
has lost my back I don't care that much
stuff oh yeah I care my headphones and
my phone of course but like things that
I really need that's what's in my back
this back comes with a little wallet
part two so of course I have on my my
daddy cards I have my Jack London real
card for the movies a safely card a
dollar I don't like carrying cash guys
let them get robbed or I may lose it so
I'm not a cash carrier at all um but
yeah that's pretty much it I already
talked about the bag a little bit um I
love it I really really love them
honestly when they reached out to me and
said hey you know we want you to check
out our bags I kind of like blew off the
email a little bit I'm just like I'm not
really a purse person and then um the
girl actually recommend this one
let me try this one I'm like yeah sure
okay you know I'm not the first person
so I don't know how this works and I got
in the mail I kind of neglected the
package I'm kind of like a just a purse
and when I open it i literally scream
elegance like I was talking to it like
it was a baby because it's just so cute
to me I don't know why I just think it's
so like girly but womanly you know I
mean it's really cute and the insights
really cute - it's like a it's just so
clean looking it I don't know and I'm
weird but I just love the clean look to
it and how simple did you guys see what
I got in there that's freaking hair dyed
don't ask me how I did it anyways that's
pretty much about it for more details on
my bag you guys could just click the
description box below and I'll also like
list everything I had in my bag in the
description box I'm not sure if even
supposed to do that in these videos but
I'll do it for you guys if you want to
like buy anything that I said out of my
bag um they are having to sell this 4th
July weekend so if you want to check
them out I would definitely do that this
bag is usually I think like 400
something I think right now it's like
200 something and now that I've
experienced it I would definitely buy
another one in another color so um yeah
