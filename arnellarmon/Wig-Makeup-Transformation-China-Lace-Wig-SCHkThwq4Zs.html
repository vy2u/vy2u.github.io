transmission video on my friend 3 she's
beautiful I know
oh so this is Micah okay so they would
happen with what happened was this
coding Sydney away and always only deals
on myself monster I've liked doing them
on my friend John way extra guy a
thousand on like not me Lincoln and his
LMSs pedaling on her it was challenged
because we have a different shape change
the whole thing is I kind of make little
bit but it's cool did you get a lesbian
I'm the internal picture that wins with
a really made for her and we're going to
film that it depends a video but it
didn't fit in so I have to switch
because it's already pre-made I thought
okay it has to fit because he live honey
everyone and sick and we connected and
in her makeup could you can't do hair
without makeup and so on your the video
I appreciate that voiceless on before
I'm going to my opinion on it as well
bill I met where to myself I shouldn't
feel it like that idea of it the hair
assaulted mood soft Brutus has that
yellow juice so only negative we say
both agree on a better half of killer
there so it was hard to like I'm going
to see with a little piece of hair
sticking up because I've Spiller here I
wasn't acting but at the same time using
the hair makes our heroes particular
what it is but if the weird though
because the hair itself a stick so I'm a
fulfilling here to make the top partners
with more full body within a bad little
good I think has monthly super flattened
kind of camera we like make a flat
because it still appears as all up in
there may be a delay car likes poufier
so slowly that thing ever it means
sleazy like oh my god it's really soft
and I was really surprised because I
mean I laughed out when bleaching it
right
girls I will try to be a little crispy I
thought it wasn't because my hair's
going to be in the video is kind of
curling waiting for not gradient I was
like oh you know usually needed wait
that come to you wavy when you
straighten the hair you get tell thin or
it just kind of drive but it's still
super silky at about your Americo some
more from us but contact like this video
yeah we're be able to physically the no
I have a few more friends that'll be
transformational on I don't have like an
abundance of friends so we repaired it
out but I want to correct my channel is
fun and I'm tired to do my will be
Simone here so is my video give it
thumbs up to describe your baby any I
don't know I don't have it weirdest
anyway she's great
even sums of real great so cool to the
thing the literature is party none of
these super annoying maps that by new
hair it is a little bit like I love it
I'm actually shocked domestic Wow dunno
been with roaches lobsters enjoy it or
extension sums up subscribe you later
what we'll see go dude so I lost the
flirting me showing off the extra wig so
I'm going to put this part in slow-mo
and just talk about it right now
this week some child lace wig this wig
is 24 inches long and it's a 360 lace
frontal wig meaning it's a three six
place run till around and then the
tracks or sewed in the middle this leg
is two hundred percent density which
explains the filler hair zone so you
guys do not like about this wig and this
wig was sent to me this bleached color
I'm assuming they just bleached it
that's what it looks like and when I
deposit the color it took the color so
I'm assuming that they did not dye the
hair they just bleached it and I mean
this color isn't bad however it has that
bleached hair color and I wasn't a huge
fan of that so I decided to just dice
and I want to go for more of like a a
burn feel or just something that just
wasn't this and so I used my well a hair
dye the name empting me down below but
it's called light copper
but if I sit in the hair for about 40
minutes while I braid her hair she
actually has really really long hair and
she has a lot of it I have a clip of
before my my getting surgery because it
was kind of crazy but it took me about a
good 40 minutes to braid her hair
because she has a lot of hair i'ma show
you guys the breeze I'm not the best
breather but I just want to practice I
don't like I almost told her to come
with her hair braids it looks like you
know what I'm just going to do it
because the Vinci I may do hair one day
you don't other people so I want to get
as much practice as possible because I
really never do hair on other people
like ever so these are brief they're not
perfect okay
but the braids and that's all that
matters so I put the wig cap on her and
then I you know tucked her hair and
knees you know chisel she's a lot of
hairy guy goes down her back and then I
got the wig and I kind of like you know
use adjustable straps to tighten it to
make sure it's kind of staying on and I
had to pull it up front cause I don't
wanna be too rough but here we are just
make sure the wig fits her head we're
trying to figure out you know like how
do I want to part it I've never seen her
with side part before so I ended up
doing that and so once I figure out the
part I wasn't tribute over it pulling
back because I mean I was going to like
use the free spur anyways I figure out
the part took it off cut the lace off
and Here I am using the guys to be free
spray in order to get the wig to stick
which is surprise for easy and I learned
that when you use a spray and you dabble
with your finger a little bit it makes
it tacky or faster and so you know you
spray it down with your finger and then
you get the blow dryer and you use the
cool setting in order to dry it and so
if you want to make this process fast or
just calm like play with play with the
like positive finger because it makes it
tacky faster I don't know why but it
does
and then straighten most the hair by
machine I'd restrain the front part of
the hair just see how easily this hair
straight as if hair is so silky um it
was kind of shocking just how silky it
was like literally this way wasn't
perfect if it weren't for the silver
hair and I mean if filler hair doesn't
bother you then I guess the wig is
perfect but the failures was alone
bother me because I want the top part to
lay flatter it wasn't by the way my
friends tell me a story about a fight
she witnessed in high school that's why
she looks very dramatic while she's
talking and that explains her facial
expressions but here I am just like
using scissors to cut a little bit for
like baby hairs but bringing her hair
perhaps different and I think she never
has baby hairs and I think it's because
like they don't look right on her head
just her forehead so I didn't go crazy
the baby hairs at all baby has optional
and you can't do that with this wig but
I didn't think she needed them for the
style I was doing and so I'm just you
know going back and forth you know
perfecting it you know tweezing where I
need to be tweeze to define the part
using concealer in order to find the
part a little bit more the only thing
that was killing it was a density
because either way I turned her head to
the side you go to see that it looks so
good but the density the thickness on
top is what's giving it away it's a wig
if it wasn't for that it'd look really
really good but it's too thick up there
in my opinion
and I'm going to cut some layers in the
front part of the bane piece kind of
thought it would look good which you did
by the way this is wrong scissors but I
lost my hair cutting scissors when I was
losing and I have to go buy some more
trust me I know these are like fabric
scissors don't use these but it is a job
that's all that matters but I thought
this look really good and I mean I've
never seen or Bank before so here I am
just putting edge control like on the
edges of course and on the filler hairs
because they kept sticking up and it was
literally driving me crazy like oh we
should get rid of them I still know how
you even do that like how do you even
get rid of filler hair yeah that's one
thing I was really killing this whole
wig but uhm yeah I mean I thought I made
look really good
I was kind of shocked because Bria has a
different shaped head I could end the
video in the beginning so I didn't know
if I'll send me to do this like it's
actually my very first time ever styling
a wig on anyone like I've done people
with natural hair but I never like stop
actually con anyone so I think I did
pretty good for my first time I know I
could be better
eventually but I mean I'm going to do my
braids like these of my friends so
hopefully has to see me improve but I
mean you know it was good okay and
that's what I was doing for I wasn't
looking for perfection and so here I'm
just putting this T straight guard
hopefully trying to lay those filler
hairs do to work no not really but yeah
those filler hairs are really really
really frustrated me but the hair itself
was nice for those feeling airs I could
live without them about the wig I think
the wig is so nice - the filler hairs
can make some good poofy but I felt
great it was so it was honestly easy
work with in my opinion is probably one
of the best lace wigs I've been since so
that was a go not hide from makeup so
first I primed her eyelids with a Mac
soft soft ochre Paint Pot I used a lot
because I learned that when used a
little it dries hella fast I didn't even
know that the generally fast I used a
lot to have more working time and then I
set that with my Lerner CH others to
tell
so now I make this new Macy palette
those are the names I just insist to me
it's funny my mom so I take it because
she loves nudes and take this color in
the middle and I'm gonna use as a base
just because I don't like starting off
with any dark colors I select that's how
you messed up so I'm just gonna take a
light color first then I'm going to take
this like slightly darker color right
here and I guess I decided to mix them
and I'm just kind of like really focus
on the outer crease area now I'm going
to mix these two shaker here I never use
dark colors alone they scare me I don't
consider myself an expert or eyeshadow
just yet
so dark colors may scare me so I like to
mix them slider colors to avoid mistake
not taking this makeup addiction
Cosmetics palette I'm going to take this
weird Kiwi shade right here it's so hard
still me do we make up other people it's
like almost possible and so first I'm
going to put neck mixing medium on top
water list to make sure the process and
move and then I'm just going to just
blend that all over her lid
I'll dump the eyes like a makeup wife
and I just wiped off any fallout that
way should raccoon wipe with the sealer
on now I'm taking this piece deluxe by
Melanie Mills and I'm using to prime her
skin I love this stuff
I actually poured too much on my hand
trying to be cool for the video so you
don't need that much
now I'm taking her foundation this is
nourisher glow that's my favorite
foundation so it's cool that she brought
hers and it's not look too light at
first but um it's not okay her she
circular so don't mind all that
now I'm taking tart shape take the
sealer I mixed two shades only because
the lightest one is going to to light
alone so I mix it so it's not like too
pale and I just blend that out
I'm gonna take another turn shaky
concealer to contour and this is my
favorite part because it looked really
good like even she made it common say no
and that looks really nice because she
already has like a very defined crease
like jawline and cheek so you'll need
harsh contour for her and so I decided
this shade and it looked really good
like is like my favorite part of
application it just looked really good I
feel like I discovered something and so
now to set a place i conceal and taking
my Laura Mercier powder like the huge
and I'm just going to actually forgot I
understand her entire face with this
because I didn't want to use a colored
powder on top because I didn't want to
mess up the overall tone of her
foundation so I've ended up setting the
whole entire face with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and once I'm done
with that I'm just going to go into the
bottom part of the eyes her eyes just
watery but that's because we had to
stand on and that's not good idea when
you do a makeup
now I'm taking hoola bronzer by benefit
oh okay number six is relaxers
blush sorry I wanted it to be super long
this whole section was like 40 minutes
I'm taking this Joey Cosmetics
highlighter in the shade rose gold I
didn't like how it looked so I'm going
back in with Mac's soft and gentle and
put on top because this wasn't doing it
for me all the processing be down below
so if I'm moving too fast don't worry
it'll be down below in the future I'll
get better at editing this kind of
videos because is my first time so I
wasn't sure now to do her brows I'm
going to use two pencils from benefit
these are precisely my brow pencils like
the best pencils ever and her about the
very light so I want to use a light
product I didn't want to go too dark and
so I use two shades I used number four
and number three number four mainly at
the end and number three towards like so
what stops it in the front to get looked
up kind of like a fade but not too much
and so yeah her brows are pretty easy to
do
now I'm taking the Joey Cosmetics
skinny-dip palette I'm using the shade
skinny-dip I kind of skipped this part I
feel like I could have builded this out
a little better but can't go back and I
just put some lashes on and by the way
I'm going to put lashes on once they
fully dry you want to get your thing to
depress them I didn't do that in this
part but um you see how you can see the
separation you want to press the lash
together so you like stare with her
normal lashes and so now I'm lying her
lips I'm using the shapes chestnut and
cork by Mac and I'm kind of like
sloppily line in it because of lip gloss
I'm going to use you won't be to see it
anyways and lip gloss I'm using is by do
a cosmetics these are new actually
they're like pretty much SuperDuper
pigmented lip glosses and so it blend
out the lip liner anyways so the lip
lier didn't need to be perfect
now the top of the gloss take another
Joey cosmetics I would call the gloss
the lip topper it's in the shade rose
gold I thought it would just add
cuteness to the look now I feel like her
cheeks for need more color so I took max
plum foolery
and put on top of the blush I put on to
spent her entire face on these settings
paper oMG glow cosmetics to add a glow
she's trying to sell herself at this
point me and her see she loved led to
her breakup and now I'm just kind of
reflecting the hair to make sure it
looks all good
the foundation on the hair but we're
going to ignore that and this is in the
video if you guys enjoyed it please give
it thumbs up please subscribe and I'll
see you guys later
