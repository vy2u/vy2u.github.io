you asked forums so I'm bringing it back
and I kinda had wondered I've done so
many of these I was wondering if this
series had kind of run its course but I
continued every so often somebody asks
can you do another one brand look so
here I am with a one brand tutorial on
Becca's brand was specifically requested
by Savannah Lee on Twitter so thank you
so much for requesting it had pretty
much every product I needed for this
full face Becca tutorial except I didn't
have a Becca brow product or a mascara
so I had to sub in some other things
there but everything else on my face is
this brand and the reason why I hope
these are useful tutorials is because
you can see how all the products from a
certain brand come together to create a
look we can talk about what some of
those signature products from certain
lines are and then kind of wrap
everything up with a bunch of mini
reviews on these things so feel free to
request what brand you'd like to see
next I go every other with high-end and
drugstore with this look I think we're
kind of able to achieve sort of a full
coverage effect with this particular
foundation that Becca has definitely a
glow on the cheeks and kind of a berry I
look so I hope you enjoy it so for
starters I'm using my ultimate coverage
complexion cream I have this in the
shade buff and it's kind of on the verge
of not being the right shade for me
especially if I get any more color in my
skin I think it's really going to be a
little bit off but it's very onions this
shade so I just use a full pump of that
and I think in the claims it says like
one pump is all you need or whatever so
I'm just going to spread this around and
as you can see it's it's definitely
going to take care of any redness I have
let's put it that way so I just spread
this all over just that one pump then
I'm using a damp Real Techniques sponge
here just to kind of dab all over the
skin this is a pretty thick foundation
and I think it benefits from the
dampness and the sponge just kind of
makes it blend in and look a little more
skin like see this foundation has really
nice coverage but I think if you had
really
dry skin it could possibly you know
accentuate that a little bit because it
has that thickness to it that I think
could get kind of clingy if you've got
some patchy areas
next I've got this under eye brightening
corrector and I do have a review of this
over on the Express channel so if you've
seen that you probably know I don't
really like this product it's kind of a
pinky toned concealer and it does have a
little bit of shimmer or glow to it so I
hesitated to even want to use this in
this video but I thought heck I'll go
ahead and show you I feel like it kind
of could act as a brightener maybe
better on the cheekbone type of thing
but as a corrector as an under-eye
darkness corrector it seems to just kind
of bring glow to those areas but not
really camouflage them and the claims
for this product it was really touted as
something that would completely you know
be all you need to cover up dark circles
I'm just going to use this up-and-up
concealer brush from Target and kind of
blend that in you can probably see here
you know I you can still see the
darkness around the eyes it's just you
know they catch the light a little
better I guess now I know there are some
new like actual concealers in this
format that I have not yet tried I
really want to I want to see what kind
of coverage those have but I do have as
a concealer that I'm not sure if they're
even selling this format still it's the
compact concealer in tahini and it has
like two levels of coverage I got this
off of hautelook so that's what makes me
think it's being phased out somewhere
I'm not sure where you could find it one
side is labeled as medium coverage and
one is labeled extra coverage I'm going
to use just a little bit of that need
iam coverage side and just go over that
corrector that I put down I'm going to
put a little bit of this around the nose
and again with that concealer brush
getting this up to the lash line trying
to take care of a little discoloration
there around the nose
I love the idea with this concealer of
pairing two kinds of coverages or two
textures because they do feel different
once thicker one has a little more like
moisture to it and I really like that
idea now I really would love to set that
and I don't have any becca powder sadly
so I'm just going to use a little bit of
this Ben Nye cameo powder sorry I hope
you don't mind I just I feel like I need
something they're not really going to
use this all over the face the the
foundation for me actually um doesn't
seem to require a setting powder at
least on my skin if you were really oily
it might be a different story I'm kind
of like normal to combo skin so I don't
tend to get SuperDuper greasy unless
it's just a product that's extremely
doing next up I'm going to do a little
contouring with the low-light highlight
perfecting palette these are cream
products in here I think they might make
a powder one as well and I'm using my
Real Techniques sculpting brush if this
sounds familiar actually I reviewed this
brush on the Express channel and the
demo was with this product as well and I
do have that giant Becca one perfecting
brush but I don't love it with this
product I also don't love that brush
with the thickness of this cream
foundation so I'm just going to dab into
this part with the sculpting brush and
then I just start swiping it right here
in the hollow of my cheek where it's
naturally you know a little bit deeper
and this is great for a cool toned cream
contour I mean it definitely mimics just
that natural shadowed look that you
might get lay down the product but for
the size of it it doesn't require a lot
of you know buffing out because just
placing this size of a brush in that
area seems to kind of cover it you know
so I'm going to do the same thing over
here on the other side the nice thing
about using cream contours is they go
exactly where you want them to go I am
going to take some of this around my
hairline as well at the little baby
hairs cropping in I know this review
isn't about the sculpting brush but I
tell you what it's like a team effort
with this and that product they were
made to be used together
and if you wanted to contour your nose I
don't have hardly anything on my brush
right now you could just easily sweep
this down the sides there now since
we've already got this compact out I'm
just going to go ahead and use the
highlight that's in here this is a
really pretty highlight see how it's got
play of glow but it doesn't feel super
you know creamy creamy to the touch and
I'm going to pick some of that up
straight from the compact with my ELF
small stipple brush and I'm just going
to start dabbing that right on tops of
the cheeks and see how subtle it is I
mean it's a really really soft highlight
glow type product these blushes are so
cool this is the beach tint shimmer
souffle and watermelon moonstone I got
this as part of a little kid that Ulta
was selling the best of becca set and i
was thrilled that this product was in
there because i really wanted to try it
i'm going to pick that up also with my
ELF small stipple brush and this has
like a mousse like softness to there's a
little more moisture in this product
than a color pop blush if you need a
little reference there but i just like
to go little by little just has a
beautiful glow in itself you know if you
use no other highlight you would still
have kind of glowy cheeks with this
product it smells great too
very fruity fresh so I just cleaned up
my brows a little bit I couldn't use any
becca stuff I don't have any Becca brow
products I'm not even positive they make
a brow product but if they do I don't
have and the shadow I'm using is the
astro violet quad I got this off of
hautelook it's the most interesting
looking one that I have from Becca so
I'm going to take this shade right here
that has a little bit of brightness to a
little bit of a metallic finish and I'm
just going to Pat that on the inner part
of my lid and then it's like we've got
varying tones of purple so I'm going to
take this matte shade and I'm going to
kind of block that all over the lid and
kind of overlap most of the shimmery
shade and then I'm going to take some of
that a little bit of the deepest shade
with my e25 brush and that's going to be
our crease Cutler so I'm just kind of
softly buffing this into the crease I'm
going to add a little bit of that dark
part darkest color right here to the
outside buff over that edge a little bit
just with a bear brush and then this
color that seems to have the most pink
in it I'm going to pick that up with my
e36 just my little white wispy brush and
I'm going to take this over the edge of
the look I don't know it just brings a
little something interesting to this
because these plums are just very dusty
you know they're not really loud purpley
colors they don't show up with a lot of
purple intensity it's not that they're
not pigmented they're just more of you
know muted takes on purple so I like
using this shade that's a little bit
brighter in this compact where it will
actually show you know kind of up above
the eye okay so I don't have a Becca
eyeliner so I'm trying to be a little
bit creative here I'm dampening a liner
brush with a little water and I'm going
into this deepest shade just got to keep
going back lay it on and it's still
going to be rather subtle but just using
that liner brush to get right up next to
the lashes and then I don't know if I
would really advise this but I did it on
the other side so I kinda have to do it
here but I am doing a wing with this
powder shadow and it's a little bit
tricky because you want it to look kind
of clean but you're dealing with powder
so it's kind of hard to control you got
to make sure that brush is wet and
that'll give you the most precision I
think I'm also pulling that shade while
I'm working with it right down here to
the lower lash line so kind of making
that connection to the wing and pulling
downward then I'm going to use a pencil
brush with this colored I'm just taking
that underneath where that darkest shade
is and just kind of smudging it inward
since I don't feel like this shade makes
a really great highlight I'm pulling in
my shimmering skin perfecter in opal
look at that shine so I'm just brushing
that on with my e-40 right up under the
brow next up I'm just going to curl the
lashes apply mascara top and bottom
adding a bit of a false lash on here I
think these are the Ardell fairies is
the style so it's kind of a natural
i Blache it adds a little length and
thickness for the lips I'm going to be
using one of my beach tints this is the
one in raspberry I'm just going to
squeeze a little bit out on my hand here
and typically I would just get some of
my finger and dab it on the lips but I'm
going to be just a little more precise
here this is what it looks like really
concentrated and then sheared out you
know it's a beautiful blush actually if
you want to shear it out on the cheeks
it just gives this really nice kind of
pillowy effect to the lips that's always
the word that comes to mind when I use
these products because they feel kind of
nice and soft on there it's just kind of
this natural matte stain on the lips I
just love the look they are buildable
too so you could apply it really lightly
and get like the lightest amount of
color or you could add to it just keep
in mind when you add to this product you
will be able to feel like a little
there's a little less weightlessness on
the lips the more product you add I feel
like I get fuller color when I use a lip
brush and so this is what one coat of
raspberry looks like it could be more
sheer if you applied it with your finger
I tell you what having that berry lit
makes me want to apply a little bit more
of this berry color and I quad up above
here just want to intensify that a
little bit because I love how it's
coming together I would just feel bad if
I didn't work in my favorite Becca
highlighting product because this is the
brand that's all about highlights and if
I don't use one of my favorites I'll
just be ticked off with myself and I
don't really need any more but I'm gonna
throw in a little bit of my shimmering
skin perfecter this is the one in pearl
I also have opal and love it the
champagne gold anyone is really nice I
have the trio of these and they're just
great look how my hand has become a
palette this pearl one is fun and
because it's I think the most bright nay
spread it out on my hand get some on the
small stipple brush and just add a
little bit here and I love it because
it's one of those highlights where you
could be head on you could be not
hitting the light and maybe it doesn't
show so much but when you turn and you
catch the light just right it really it
really shines no identifiable sparkles
in this product shimmer glitter I mean
it's just kind of fascinating so here's
the finished look thank you guys so much
for watching this
one brand tutorial the end of these
videos I like to do kind of a wrap-up on
the products I used mentioned the ones
that were my favorites and the ones I
didn't like so much and really the
things that I liked the most from this
line are the products that relate to
blush and highlight I really think
that's what they do best I think one of
the most fascinating products from this
line if you ask me what's one thing I
should try I would say it's the
shimmering skin perfecter in this liquid
version I think these are so great and
these little ones with the wands that's
not how it's normally sold I think it's
a larger size with a pump not sure if
the trio of the small sizes is still
being sold but that's a great thing to
get to just sort of sample them because
they give your skin such a beautiful
radiance that they do so without the
appearance of like glittery particles
they're also kind of multitaskers
because you could mix them in with say a
moisturizer if you just want a really
light dewy glow enos to the skin extend
with foundations wear them on top of
everything I love doing that I love the
beach tints I have two of these I have
guava which is more of a peachy tone and
raspberry raspberry is my favorite this
is gorgeous on the cheeks as well and
I'll link below to a video where I
demonstrated this as a blush it's really
really pretty so I love that also this
Beach tint shimmer souffle really
interesting texture it's creamy but it's
very light and mousse like in this
particular shade I think is stunning it
very easy to blend also if you just
wanted to use your fingers it's a very
easy to work with cream product if you
like cream contouring and you've been
struggling to find the right tone I
think you would really enjoy the
low-light highlight perfecting palette
because this is a very cool cream
contour shade and I just found it to be
really easy to work with gives that
subtle contoured effect and it works
great with this Real Techniques
sculpting brush I don't know that this
is really a must-have for everyone
because I know some people really like
their powder products for contouring and
you know not everyone enjoys using a
cream but if you do if you're in that
specific kind of I don't know sector of
the makeup world you might really like
that and by the way the shimmering skin
perfecter that I have here in opal and
the powder version it gives a more
pronounced highlight look how metallic
that is I think it's a little more
visible on the skin when you wear I not
saying it's not gorgeous but I've tried
a lot of really nice metallic powder
type highlights a little similar to this
and I think the liquefied version of
that product is just a little more
unique from the spray and I don't feel
like the eyeshadows or anything too
special on every quad that I have and
I'll just show you the other ones here
quick had this one in sunchaser that's
very basic neutrals and I also have
Galactica that was one of the first ones
I bought and I think I did do a demo
with this in my other Beca video and the
shades are kind of like you know colors
but they border on neutrals because
they're so dusty seeing if that makes
sense you know they're kind of toned
down they're kind of smoky you're
pigmented but the texture is not like
exceptional I don't feel like saying hey
run out you must find these Becca quads
because I just don't think they're that
incredible as for this foundation the
ultimate coverage complexion cream I
think it's good a really very
person-to-person as to who's going to
love this it's got great coverage I
really enjoy the staying power as well I
was kind of surprised that Becca the
brand known for all the glow put out a
foundation that is so matte and so full
coverage I think dry skin people may
struggle with this a little bit even me
with my normal to combo skin I find that
the best application is when you're
using a dampened sponge even so I don't
like this better than my Estee Lauder
Double Wear most comparable thing to
this would probably be the double wear
that's just in the regular formula and I
think that looks just a little bit
better on my skin it just looks a little
more makeup beyond the skin so I don't
think I'll be repurchasing that this
concealing duo nice I won't talk about
it a whole lot because I don't even know
that it's still available I love that
they put in two levels of coverage one
thing that I really just do not like
from this line that I've tried is the
under eye brightening corrector like I
said full review on this for more
details but it just really seemed to
attract attention to those areas where I
had under eye darkness as opposed to
completely covering it up so I hope this
tutorial and review was helpful to you
when I do these one brand tutorials I go
every other with high-end and drugstore
brands so the next one will be drugstore
thank you for requesting that I bring
these back it's always helpful to me to
know what you want to see so thank you
for watching and I'll see
guys next time by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
