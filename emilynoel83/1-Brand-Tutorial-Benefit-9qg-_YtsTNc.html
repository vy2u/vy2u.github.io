this benefit one brand tutorial I like
to do these videos because I feel like
every brand has its hits and misses and
these videos are a good way to not only
show you how the products work but at
the end give you some little reviews and
impressions on exactly how these
products worked for me what you're gonna
see today it's somewhat neutral on the
cheeks and lips but with kind of a lilac
smoky eye so here's the tutorial so for
my foundation I'm gonna be using the
some kind of gorgeous and this is a
small size it came in some little
palette sets that I got so it looks like
this it's got a real creamy texture and
I'm just gonna start dabbing that around
my face with my finger I wanted to use
the oxygen Wow foundation because I do
have some of that I was just testing the
color and it's just so yellow whoa it's
interesting it feels very creamy and the
compact but when you spread it on your
face it has kind of a silky feel and I'm
gonna just take this brush from Sigma
and blend that in a bit so this seems
like pretty much a medium coverage
product you know it's not covering up
everything but it really does seem to
have like a nice finish on the skin you
know it seems very skin-like
next up I'm taking my benefit array
space this is in shade number two medium
a really peachy and a salmony colored
concealer I love using this on dark
circles and I think it's really good if
you tend to be really dry around your
eye areas carries with it I feel like a
lot of extra moisture so I like to just
dab that around with my finger any
darkness this can work well on dark
spots too so there we really corrected
some discoloration but for some other
areas that I want some concealer for I
have this kit it's called how to look
the best at everything I have a full
review and tutorial just using this I
used up the little foundation that was
in there but there is a boying concealer
has shade zero two and zero of three I'm
going to be using some of the zero two
and just get a little bit of this around
my
knows to tackle some of the redness
there this is a creamy concealer but it
seems a little more dry overall than the
erase paste this concealer can be really
full-coverage so I do really like that
and then I'm going to the powder this is
the stay flawless powder that's in here
and it can kind of function as a powder
foundation it has quite a bit of
coverage oops just lost a little burr
and I have it in the shade I'm as cute
as a bunny honey and so I'm just gonna
buff this in and I'm gonna keep it
really nice and light over areas where
I've done a lot of concealing this
powder is such a nice texture it just
doesn't look powdery at all it doesn't
look dry I mean maybe you can vouch for
that if you own this product but I
really like this and once I do use it up
in this container I may just get myself
a full sized next up I'm using my hoola
bronzer and this is something that i
depotted it's right here it's a matte
bronzer and i depotted that out of the I
think was the cabana glamour kit that I
use this is a contour oops brush hair
just right in the hollows of the cheeks
you know the typical contour zones
spectrum and bronzers that I have it's
definitely darker than like a NYC sunny
but lighter than something like the
bombs um Bahama Mama next up I'm gonna
do some blush and I'm actually going to
be layering a couple of shades one for
my primary blush color and one's gonna
be a bit of a highlight so first off I'm
going to Dallas kind of a dusty rose
type shade it's a very neutral color but
I really do like the look that it gives
on the cheeks it gives a little more
color than you would expect so I'm gonna
go just a little lower on the cheek with
this kind of just right above where I
did my contouring actually it's almost a
little bit plumbing you know next I'm
going to sweep on some of the newest
boxed powder which is called the rocket
or and I actually have a review
specifically on this on my newest
channel Beauty broadcast Express which
is exclusively reviews quick reviews
daily appears that would have a lot of
shine to it it doesn't come off quite
the
shiny on the face it actually comes off
really light not too sparkly it's also
not super colorful that's why I like
using it as a very soft subtle highlight
and swirling that right on top of
everything next up we're gonna go to the
brows and I've got a new product here
that I got from Sephora it's called
gimme brow and the shade I have is
medium deep and this basically says brow
volumizing fiber Chand it's got a teeny
tiny brush like my brows are naturally
kind of full but I like using it to
brush over the brows because I feel like
it it evens them out you know this one
and this one and it also takes away the
need for an extra brow brush or gel to
hold it in place because this really
holds your brows in place the one thing
that can be a little tricky is if you've
got a specific area that you're trying
like just a small patch maybe where
you're trying to fill in it can be a
little tricky to be totally precise with
this if you know what I mean like I'm
going over it and over it but it's
harder to pinpoint that one area next up
for the eyes this is actually a kit I've
had some requests to do tutorials with
so I'm glad I have it here and can use
it in this video it's the world-famous
neutrals and it says this collection is
the sexiest nudes ever and there are
different collections you can get it's
got like your little instructions up
there it's got two cream products and
then for powder shadows the creams are
in bikini tini which is more of a like a
shimmery nude and then
holy smokes which is a like charcoal
grey I really want to make this kind of
a deep dusty lilac look for fall so I'm
gonna start out with the holy smokes
base and I'm just gonna get a little bit
of that on my finger and use that to
prep my lids and just give me a nice
deep base see thank you to these creams
have a pretty thin consistency they
remind me of like my Mac rubenesque
paint next I'm gonna go into this shade
called rain check and it
is a sort of satin finish purpley shade
almost bordering on plum it's a little
bit deep but it's very soft and doesn't
have a lot of like bold purple color to
it so I'm just gonna use this to top off
the holy smokes cream it's interesting
because the last time I use this kit I
topped the lighter cream shadow with
this purple and much more of the purpley
tone will come out so here we're
practically making it plumb then I'm
going to bring some of that shade up
into the crease just by flipping my
brush around and kind of wedging it in
there and then I'm just gonna blend the
edges of that with a bear brush then
it's kind of a transition shade I'm
going to take this rose color it's
called pause for applause get a little
bit of that on my fluffy brush and I'm
gonna take this just above where we've
blended out with a purple and then under
the brow I'm gonna go for milk it this
is a shimmery white in with a fluffy
brush I don't want to pack too much of
this shade on but I'm just going right
under the eyebrow I'm also gonna take a
little bit of that shade right around my
inner corner next I'm moving on to
eyeliner and then we'll finish the lower
lash line but I realized for the longest
time I've never had a benefit eyeliner
so I had to order this one it's the
BADgal liner waterproof and the shade is
extra black so it's just a traditional
pencil and it's got a little smudger tip
there so I'm going to take this across
my upper lash line just starting right
here in the innermost corner it's not
the smoothest eyeliner I've ever used
and I kind of have to build up the
blackness a little bit and they're
getting in here on the upper inner rim
right in between those lashes I'm gonna
use some of this liner on my lower inner
rim as well just go from the outside to
the inside there and then for a really
smudgy look I'm gonna also just kind of
dot it getting it right in there in
between the lashes mainly here on the
outer part and then I
tie the purple shade back in again so
I'm going to get some of that on a
smudge brush here and just overlap and
I'm just adding a little bit more here
of the purple to the crease next up I'm
just gonna curl the lashes and I'm using
their real mascara I just have like a
sample size you got bristles all over
this part of the wand obviously and then
also around the tip as well and I do
have a full review on this which I'll
link to below I'll link to any related
benefit videos that might give you extra
information on some of these things and
he's instantly building a lot of length
for me which I of course like and it's
pretty good about separating as well my
experience with this mascara you know
you can build it up but it kind of only
goes so far like the lashes can start to
look a little funky if you do just keep
layering and layering the product on top
so a couple of coats seems to work well
I'm gonna put a little on my lower
lashes two for my lips I want a little
bit of color but I still want to keep it
somewhat neutral so I'm using the sugar
bomb and it's the ultra plush lip gloss
so this is a squeeze tube style and it
does have a pretty amount of shine the
scent on this is kind of like sweet and
fruity I'm seeing a lot of my natural
lip color through it but you are getting
some shine and just maybe a little bit
of like a metallic finish so thanks for
watching my tutorial now I just want to
pass along some little reviews on the
things that I use it's pretty sure I
didn't have the camera rolling when I
was putting on my professional this is a
primer that can kind of minimize your
pores
Pat it in and it fills in those areas
and creates just a smoother canvas for
your skin I love the texture of this as
far as minimizing the appearance of
pores
I don't really contend with giant pores
that's not a huge problem area for me
but I have heard from people who say
this really does work for them thing I
just love is the texture of this it's
not too heavy but it does feel really
silky smooth and evens out just the
whole texture of your skin so your
foundation can go on more smoothly so I
really like
the station that I use was the some kind
of gorgeous and this is a cream
foundation on nothing outstanding here I
really am NOT a huge fan of the smell of
this either it smells kind of like
almost a clay or some sort of art supply
sort something I feel like there are
plenty of other foundations that can
give you better coverage and just as
nice of a finish on the skin love love
love my erase paste this is a really
great product particularly if you have
dark circles that are a bluish tone that
you really want to color correct this
salmony peachy shape will work well for
you also if you are especially dry in
your under-eye area this kind of product
really adds in some hydration so if
that's not an issue for you if you feel
like you're just oily all around your
eyes this may be too heavy but for me I
get really dry like in my inner corners
and this works really well under other
concealers or even just by itself and if
it's boiling concealer again I used it
in this kit and I have a full review on
this kit if you just want to know how
the how to look your best at everything
works but this is not as unique of a
concealer as erase paste you know it's
more just skin tone concealers here
you've got a couple that you can kind of
mix together they're a little bit
thicker a little bit drier still a very
very good cover
I love the stay flawless powder that's
what I use just to set everything I
think it's got a really nice silky
smooth texture doesn't come off on your
face looking super powdery at all so I'm
very impressed with that hoola bronzer
does remind me a lot of my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil I really like both of
these bronzers I don't know if it's
something so different and so special
that I would specifically seek this out
again to repurchase but it is a nice
matte bronzer Mars the Box powders go a
while back I did a whole blog review on
all the box powders that I had and I've
really found these to be very hit and
miss you know some of the kinds that
have multiple shades worked in a lot of
times feel like those seem very
watered-down you know like not a lot of
colors coming off and then ones with one
solid color like coralista and Dallas
I've really enjoyed I think Dallas is so
pretty and I know it doesn't look all
that exciting
here in the box but on the face I feel
like it's just the prettiest color just
a great neutral tone blush when you
don't want your blush to be too bright
or take anything away from like your
eyes or your lips I think this is a
great option so big fan of that line to
the rocket or as I said I have a full
review on this on my Beauty broadcast
Express Channel but just briefly I mean
I find that it's it's not super shimmery
on the skin I think it's very wearable
but I like it mostly as a highlight as
opposed to a blush I don't think as a
blush it really gives off that much
color the brows this gimme brow is a new
product and after messing with this I've
been using this for at least a couple of
weeks now I think it can take the place
of a lot of different things in your
brow routine if all you really need to
do is just thicken them up as a whole
you know like just go over the whole
brow and even it out if you've got
really precise areas where you just need
a certain spot filled in it's a little
trickier with this wand to just get in
there and do it like I've still got a
spot I'm not really satisfied with there
I'm gonna try something this just
occurred to me as I was messing with my
hair I was thinking what if I took an
angled brush and just got some of the
product on my ankle breath then went in
and that seems to be one way to use this
to fill in and I may have gotten too
much on the brush though oops
I love how this seems to last all day
keep my brows and really the right spot
so it may be something to try if you
just want a quick fix for your eyebrows
and there is a lighter shade than this
is what the world-famous neutrals I do
have swatches and a little review on
this kit and another kit already on my
blog overall I mean I do like the look
that I got but one thing to note is that
when I use these cream shadows if I use
them alone they do not have the major
staying power that like a color tattoo
does or the Mallee shadow stick it
hasn't happened every time but sometimes
when I just used this and then the
shadow no primer underneath I have a
little bit of creasing the powder
shadows in general I have some singles
if you like those powder shadows that
practically feel creamy they're so
smooth you know these don't
we have that quality to them like the
lorac shadows do or the ones from the
balm so but they're not bad shadows and
as you can see the color will pop when
you put them on some sort of a base as
far as just the way this kid is put
together it's not bad but I would really
prefer if there was one deeper eyeshadow
d even darker than this cuz I think this
is kind of really a practically a
mid-tone shade you know it gave me some
depth that gave me a lighter look which
I do like but it would be nice to have
the option of having like one nice deep
dark maybe black or you know deep plum
shadow in this mix I'm not too impressed
with the BADgal liner I felt like I had
to go over my lines multiple times and
even now looking at it it looks like a
soft gray throughout the course of the
day I noticed it losing some intensity
as well I don't notice it completely
like rubbing off or smudging down below
my eye but it just doesn't look as black
as it did to start and it's not even
starting that black so not something I'd
repurchase your real mascara is a really
good lengthening mascara if you just
want really nice length in just a couple
of coats I think this would be a good
one to try I mean it's what probably one
of the better lengthening mascara is
that I'm trying you have an opportunity
to get like a sample size of this to try
it out for yourself I would recommend
even in the full-size I think if length
is your primary focus for a mascara it
may be worth a shot these ultra-plush
lip glosses I just haven't been too fond
of because I think they're too sheer I
think for the price that you're gonna
pay for one I want to see more color
coming off of it with this shade I mean
I'm really seeing my natural lip color
here with just some shine on I'm not
super sticky in fact they have very very
little stickiness to them to the point
where they're not really gonna last very
long
definitely no left-behind staining
effect from these easy how's that person
hits abysus I would say my ultimate
favorite things that I've used from this
line are a race pace that might be my
number one I also am really impressed by
the stay flawless powder I really think
this is a cool multipurpose brow product
that I think a lot of people would enjoy
their reel is a great lengthening
mascara you can't deny
and I am a big fan of the Dallas box
powder the things I probably like the
least where the BADgal liner and the lip
gloss so thanks for watching this one
brand tutorial um I go every other one
so this was a high-end brand the next
one will be drugstore thank you so much
for your great requests and I'll see you
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
