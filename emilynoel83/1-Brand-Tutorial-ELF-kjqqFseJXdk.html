one brand tutorial in this video where I
only use one brand for everything in the
look so face eyes lips it's all gonna be
the same consequently this brand is elf
eyes lips face and so I'm gonna be using
all elf stuff the entire video you're
gonna see exactly how these products
perform without anything else thrown in
you're not gonna see you know a random
Mac foundation or a Lancome mascara or
whatever there is nothing but elf in
this tutorial so I think you're gonna
learn a lot about the brand
I'll have kind of a little review at the
end talking about the products that I
liked and didn't like and with this look
I chose to do kind of a classic almost
old Hollywood feel for this look because
I felt like I think the perception is
that elf is you know like a really cheap
or young brand you know what I mean like
you're not gonna get a really classic
finished polished look and so I really
wanted to go there with this tutorial
we're talking matte eyeshadow red lips
you know everything is just I feel like
kind of really that classic look only
we're gonna do actually some Navy winged
eyeliner so a slight modern twist on
what's going on but I hope you enjoy
this video and keep on watching I'm
gonna be using the elf tinted
moisturizer SPF 20 my shade is nude and
see kind of judging by the sun spot
right there near my eye about how much
coverage this has you can still see my
freckles through it but I'm just gonna
blend this all over very very light
coverage I do like that it doesn't seem
to have a wet or like greasy look on my
skin right now it really absorbed nicely
in the elf studio concealer and my shade
is beige I've tried some other kinds of
the elf concealers but this is one I'm a
little more curious about because I
haven't used it so much so we'll see
what kind of coverage this had I'm just
patting it in with my finger to try to
get the most coverage out of this I can
get it's actually reminds me a little
bit of the Revlon Photoready concealer
it also has a really natural finish like
I've built it up in some areas under my
eyes and I feel like you know it it
looks really nice
so I'm gonna go in with a powder product
now to kind of set some of what we've
been doing I'm using the complexion
perfection powder that one was
suggesting actually taking the yellow
tone powder which often times people
suggest use a yellow tone powder under
your eye to set your concealer so I'm
totally doing that right now to see you
know if that kind of brightens any blue
toned circles there I think that
actually gave me a little extra light
coverage over the concealer I like that
when I have an elf brush to do some
function I will use it I do have the elf
complexion brush so just kind of a
all-purpose face brush and so I'm just
gonna swirl these colors together now
let's say I notice a big difference
except my face does look more matte now
next I'm gonna use the warm bronzer so
just kind of swarm I brush through all
that and I'm not using this like a
contour because it is such a light
bronzer I'm just using it all over to
kind of perk up my skintone a bit and
next I'm using the contouring blush and
bronzer just using a blush brush kind of
run this contour right here this is a
product I use on a daily basis some of
these things have been you know elf
items I picked up but I haven't used a
whole lot but I love this contour so you
can use it on your cheeks you can use it
kind of around your jaw line down your
neck around your forehead this is my
blush I'm using one of the $1 natural
radiance blushes and the shade is called
flushed you only need a tiny amount of
this because it's very pigmented and so
I'm just gonna swirl that on the apples
of my cheeks and the reason why I'm
smiling here is because it kind of makes
my Apple my cheek pop up a little more
then I'm gonna do just a little
highlighting with the elf all-over color
stick in golden peach I think it helps
to kind of swirl your finger on there
for a minute and warm up the product so
it gets a little more creamy feeling and
then I'm just gonna blend a little bit
of this right on top of my cheekbone
here
I'm gonna do a little bit on the brow
bone as well a little bit just right
down the center of the nose finally the
elf HD powder I had a bit of a powder -
explosion over here but I do love this
product and I meant to have this in my
updated elf favorites video but I'm just
gonna lightly apply some of this all
over
it's looking over like the overall
appearance of my skin I'm actually like
really impressed by the improvement my
skin looks brighter it looks more even
for only using a tinted moisturizer and
a concealer and I just I like the effect
of the bronzers and the blush as well
alright I'm using the elf mineral
eyeshadow primer and I'm just gonna dot
a little bit of that on here one thing
that I've noticed is that it dries to
almost a cream to powder finish and so
if you're looking for it to really
emphasize the color of the shadow you're
putting on top of it it doesn't have
like a slightly tacky finish that really
grabs this shadow you know it kind of it
just has a very smooth finish so just
keep that in mind maybe using the elf 32
color palette and we're gonna go for
kind of a matte look actually here so
I'm going to be using this light matte
Brown right here using my ELF eyeshadow
brush I'm basically just gonna Pat that
on all over my eyelid next we're gonna
go down here to this matte dark grey
shade I'm gonna get a little bit of that
on that same eyeshadow brush be aware
you will get some fallout if you don't
tap off your brush and I'm just going to
Pat this shade just right over the outer
part of my eyelid I'm using my ELF
professional crease brush love this
brush love the eye shadow brush too and
I'm gonna go to this matte kind of a
warm Brown I would call it get a little
bit of that on there and just start
blending this into the crease then I'm
bringing in a larger brush with a little
bit of that same color and I'm just
taking that warm brown see how it kind
of is up in here just a little bit that
same color right up here so just getting
it visible on top of the brow bone basic
we're gonna take this peach shade here
which is kind of a little bit of a
satiny finish it's not a hundred percent
matte but it's not sparkly either and
I'm just gonna use that as a subtle
highlight right under my eyebrow finally
using a q-tip or a little detail brush
there is a shimmery white shade up in
corner I'm gonna get a little bit of
that and just since the look is so mad
sometimes it's nice to pop just a little
bit of brightness right around the tear
duct and this shade does it really well
and see how a we've just opened up the
eye a little bit more thing we're gonna
take that darkest shade that we used on
the outer part of our eyelid one more
time and use kind of a smudgy brush a
liner brush or a pencil brush whatever
you prefer and I'm just gonna get a
little bit of that color right here on
the lower lash line I'm using my ELF
cream eyeliner in midnight this is a
deep navy blue staying really close to
the lash line we're just gonna do a thin
line we continued this line we would
meet the end of the eyebrow same deal
over here so it's like pretend you're
coming up off your lower lash line and
drawing a point that would eventually
meet your eyebrows you got that line
it's easy all you have to do is connect
it a little bit build it up a little bit
so it makes sense with your lower lash
line next I'm going to curl my lashes
with my favorite eyelash curler ever the
one dollar one from ELF and I'm using
the elf lengthening and volumizing
mascara extremely natural like I don't
notice a lot of volume and length
through even if you build up multiple
coats I feel like it doesn't give you
too much but I love lots of lashes so
we're gonna do something about that in a
minute it's kind of nice on the lower
lash line though because it is so non
clumpy at all cells false eyelashes
including this dramatic lash kit for
just a dollar so I trimmed the lashes a
little bit off that ends gonna place
these line them up with the center of my
lash line got them lined up now alright
there we go as they dry I like to kind
of blink down onto my fingers so they
dry in a nice upturned fashion and once
you feel those are really starting to
bond to your upper lash line I like to
apply one more
the mascara just to make sure they are
really as one
I also have an elf brow product it's the
studio eyebrow kit I have it in medium
it comes with a wax and just a neutrally
colored powder so I'm just gonna get a
little bit of that wax on here and kind
of run this right over my brow and then
I'll take a little bit of the powder
using one of the $1 lipsticks in food I
wanted to go with a lip that gave us a
little bit of a punch it's kind of a
berry red I'm gonna finish it off with a
little bit of the $1 super glossy lip
shine and mauve Lux just to give us a
little extra pop updated top ten elf
favorites video so check that out for
like overall favorites in the brand but
as far as what I used in this video I'm
just gonna give you my reaction to what
I thought was really good and what I
thought was not so good if you're
looking for a tinted moisturizer that
gives you you know light coverage and
isn't too greasy I think the elf tinted
moisturizer SPF 20 actually worked
really well I mean you notice that it
didn't cover up like everything on my
face it didn't conceal all my freckles
or anything like that but it evened me
out a little bit and I like the fact
that it kind of instantly kind of
blended in and I was ready to put more
makeup on top of that as opposed to
feeling like my face was too wet or tank
I was pleasantly surprised at the elf
studio concealer I thought it works
really great around my eye area
concealing some flaws there and in terms
of blemishes I might say this is maybe
not the most full coverage concealer
I've ever tried but for three bucks I
think it's great my lip products I think
this is a fantastic lipstick for a buck
so I will definitely look into more of
their $1 at lipsticks love the super
glossy lip shine of course longtime
favorite has always been the contouring
blush and bronzer I think that's a
fantastic contour for all areas of the
face warm bronzer is a nice product to
use kind of lightly all over your face
if you're really fair this is a bronzer
that's not going to give you too much
color definitely enjoyed the blush here
this is only $1 the shade is called
flushed and that has been a longtime
great product from ELF in terms of
eyeshadow palette I know I've talked
about it before here and there but um
you're gonna find some really great
shades in this palette and some not so
good shades so it's kind of hit and miss
for $5 I like it because I think there
are enough great shades to keep me
coming back to this palette I have tried
almost
all of them I like that you do have some
matte shades we were able to put
together an entirely matte look today
but you've got some bright colors some
shimmery colors and I think that if you
were looking to experiment with elf this
is a good product to him well my tools
love my elf one dollar brush is the
eyeshadow brush and the crease brush the
eyelash curler big fan of EDS
also hadn't used this much before this
tutorial but I like this little eyebrow
kit this is a waxy based product here
you can kind of keep your brows in line
you know with that without having to go
over the top of this all with a separate
gel so like i've raved about a lot of
different things now just a few things
that are either kind of an or not so
good complexion perfection powder um I
like the thought of using the yellow
under the eyes to set the concealer
thank you so much to those who tweeted
me telling me that's a good thing to do
but as far as the powder as a whole I
felt like it modified my skin but it did
not I didn't quite get that it was
evening out my tone overall mineral eye
primer is good I have had pretty good
staying power with the cream eyeliner I
feel like there are better drugstore
cream liners out there like wet and wild
and may believe that glide on better
that just go on with a little more
intensity like right off the bat I felt
like I had to do some work to build this
or definitely batter better mascaras
than the lengthening and volumizing
mascara like I said if you're trying to
keep it as natural as possible maybe go
for this but most that most of us I
think are going for a little more volume
a little more of a difference in our
last eating of lashes I actually kind of
like these lashes I think I feel like
they're a little different from ELF
eyelashes maybe a year or so ago I'm not
sure if they changed something I thought
I was really gonna like this elf
all-over color stick and golden peach
but there was more I thought it was just
gonna be pearly but there's actually
some glitter in here and with this look
I turned out to not really like that so
much so thank you again so much for
joining me for this video I hope this I
guess my goal was to sort of surprise
you with what elf could pull off because
I'm happy with this finished look and I
think it's totally like old Hollywood
glam brought back to
with products that are really
inexpensive and many of them that I
really like so thank you again for
watching have a wonderful day and I'll
talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
