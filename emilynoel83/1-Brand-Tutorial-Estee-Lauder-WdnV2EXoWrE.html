glamorous in this look and this is my
estee lauder one brand tutorial you
cannot say I don't have variety on this
channel because I've just been doing you
know some videos on wet and wild and NYC
and now here I am with Estee Lauder so
when I do these one brand looks I
actually it's been a while since I've
done one the last one I did was wet and
wild and so now it's time for high end I
go every the way this particular one
brand tutorial came about is kind of
interesting and through doing all the
makeup videos that I do I've become
connected with some awesome people and
one of those is a fellow makeup lover
expert in the industry and his name is
David and he's a makeup artist with
Estee Lauder
he basically sent me the materials to do
a one brand tutorial with Estee Lauder
as a friend gift you know kind of thing
David is the one who gave me the
lipstick that was engraved with my name
which is so special to me and I keep it
in a special place up on top of my
bookshelf eel-like the things that he
like sent me for this one brand tutorial
were so like kind of customized with me
in mind and I think I feel so special
for that you know I mean he even through
just seeing me on YouTube like totally
matched me perfectly on foundation and
concealer which i think is amazing three
components the kind of ideas I had in
mind for this look flawless skin bold
lips and the eyes are a little bit more
natural
extremely blended out and something
curious also about applying eyeshadows
wet that's going to be happening in this
look too then at the end of the video I
provide my little review on the
different thing I'm excited I hope you
like it and here's the look alright
first step I'm going to apply my Double
Wear stay in place makeup it's got SPF
10 and my shade is two in two fresco oh
one looks like then as usual with
foundation I kind of roughly like to dot
this around on the face and then use a
nice dense brush
you get it all blended out it's a really
nice creamy formula it's got a little
more thickness to it than a lot of the
liquid foundations from the drugstore
have also one of the few foundations
where the coverage is just so good I
mean I can see it covering up things
that normally I would have to use
concealer to cover up and this
foundation did win an Emily award this
past time around for best high-end
foundation it definitely is the best
coverage foundation that I own that
definitely minimizes the amount of
concealer I'm going to need but I do
have a concealer to use to show you and
it's the Double Wear stand place
flawless wear concealer looks like this
has a little wand applicator and my
shade is warm light/medium zero I'm
going to just touch up a couple of
places very lightly I'm in my experience
with this concealer it it only takes a
tiny bit using my Sigma P 80 brush to
just blend that in again coverage is
just really fantastic with this and it
really just kind of blends in to the
exact same finish that the foundation
has sometimes I noticed that because I
bounced around with a lot of different
brands and it's like sometimes the
concealer is much more dewy or something
than the foundation was and this just
really goes matte which in turn keeps
you looking more flawless when the
concealer ends up having like a shine to
it or kind of catches the light you can
see those you know bags or contours to
the skin even more so you kind of want
that in matte finish so I really like
that quality to this concealer I don't
have a nest a lot or powder to use with
this look and honestly I don't really
feel like I need it I mean like I said
the skin is totally matte and I've used
this foundation without powders in the
past and my skin actually fairs pretty
well with it
so I'm going to move on to bronzer and I
have the bronze goddess soft duo bronzer
in 0/3 amber bronze media packaging is
so pretty and this is a really large
compact like the size of the palm of my
hand and it's split into two mat
bronzers so one's pretty light and one
is like perfect for contour I am just
going to run this kind of around the
hair
I'm at darker shade to contour the
cheekbone area a little bit as well it's
just the perfect tone it's not to
oranjee so it really can function as a
contour for you next step I'm going to
apply the blush and this is the pure
color blush in pink aunjanue and it is a
shimmer and as you can see it's just
kind of like a pink almost berry toned
blush of this I'm going to kind of start
to lightly dust that in on the outer
part of the apple of my cheek and just
kind of blend upward I could see a
deeper skin tone still being able to
wear this kind of blush because you
could totally go back and build the
color to you know whatever intensity you
lie I'm going to do kind of a strong lip
with this look so I'm going to go ahead
and do that before I do the eyes using
the Double Wear pencil in apple cordial
and this is a really nice kind of
intense berry red I've used this with
and without the lipstick that I'm going
to put on top of it it's incredibly long
wearing I mean I filled my lips in just
with this pencil because I like the
color so much and then topped it off
with a gloss and it stayed like for most
of it day like to fill in my lips
entirely I just feel like it has really
good staying power that way and then I'm
going to take this pure color lipstick
in cheating heart over the top of this
again kind of has that deep red feel to
it but kind of a berry you know there's
a little bit of pink in this as well and
I love those kinds of shades they really
make your teeth look whiter too this
looks like kind of a cream maybe satiny
finish to the lips so kind of bold and I
really like it for the eyes I'm starting
out on my brows and I'm using the
automatic brow pencil duo and one end
this has a little angled brush so you
can kind of brush the product through
but first you're going to use this
retractable pencil side and so it's a
really dry pencil I don't like things
that are too super creamy on the brows
because I feel like it kind of just
makes the hairs cling together and it
doesn't last as long so I'm going to go
ahead and just sort of fill this in with
light strokes in the area that I normal
I would tell her why I like the the
pencil isn't coming off reddish
sometimes brown pencils are just a
little too warm and this one does come
off really natural and then you can kind
of brush the brow up a little bit or the
eyeshadow now I've got this pretty
pretty kind of metallic looking kit in
bronze sands and I'm not sure if this is
still available these I mean have a
decent amount of color payoff dry but
david recommends using them wet so
that's what I'm going to be doing for
this look a little like spray bottle of
water handy and when I do anything wet I
just spritz a little water there on my
hand and then I just dab my brush in
that to moisten it and then go into the
product so real easy I've been asked a
lot about doing stuff wet and how that
works but I'm taking the white pearly
shade in that kit I guess there were two
this is the the real champagne kind of
white shade and I'm just going to dab
that on the lid and you can see the
color payoff I mean you get such a
metallic finish when you do it wet as
well and I'm going to this pure color
shadow and you can see it's got like a
neat little texture it's like rippled
there can you see that this is the cyber
metallic cyber Ruby's the jelly or Jala
a powder eyeshadow similar texture to
the other so again I'm moisten my hand
moisten the brush and then I just kind
of Pat it in the product a little bit
and pick up some of those patting this
beautiful burgundy shade it's not overly
red so like if you've wanted to play
with this sort of a tone on your eye but
you're afraid of it looking too red and
then that making you look tired or
whatever this is a great it has a nice
amount of depth to it and you can see
I'm patting that on the lid and feel
like I've got some more product in there
so I'm kind of pulling it upward it's
amazing how you know these shadows can
be worked with so easily wet taking a
little more of the shadow and kind of
pulling it down this way as well so our
part isn't just on the outside but we're
working it inward some the other
interesting thing is that these can
still be blended out as if they're
powders you can if you think just
because you apply it wet then you can't
go over it and still you know blend it
and buff out the edges I feel like you
still really can not really trying to
create any sort of prominent outer-v
here I just want it to look really
really soft then I'm going to go back to
this first shade we used wet just going
to use it dry with a fluffy brush here
and that's going to be my really light
highlight under the brow want to go back
to the cyber Ruby and use an angled
liner brush here um didn't let this one
down I'm gonna take that under the eye
just a bit under the outside here then
I'm just going to take a pencil brush
and totally soften that up then I'm
going to use this Double Wear stay in
place eyeliner duo so it's two pencil
liners I love the double liner concept I
think it's really handy especially when
the shades are really shade you'd use a
lot like onyx here that's the black and
coffee is the brown so I'm going to take
the black first and apply that right
across my upper lash line I feel like I
always wanted using a pencil I tend to
start in the middle and work my way out
and as you can see this draws on real
smooth without any tugging but it's not
as creamy as some eyeliners that I have
some eyeliners like I feel like Urban
Decay's 24/7 liners you know they'd
glide on real easy and really really
creamy and then they do you know
eventually set to be very long wearing
this one doesn't start out as creamy but
it still is going on fairly you know
effortless we're going to use a little
bit of the coffee side just kind of
right where I did the Burgundy under the
eye except with this I'm really
concentrating on just getting it like
right up in between the lashes I just
want you know I want kind of that fade
of
see how it's nice and deep right in the
lashline and then it kind of fades out
that's what I want I'm just going to
curl my lashes I usually like to hold
this for like probably 15 seconds in all
and then I kind of you know loosen it a
little bit and then work my way out on
the lash somewhat so it's not just one
you know crimp to the lash it's got a
little bit of curl all the way out I
love the concept behind this mascara
it's the sumptuous two-tone and it's got
black on one end and brown on the other
and David says that that's kind of an
old makeup artist trick to make the eye
appear bigger more open because you've
got you know you're not really putting
dark on both top and bottom lashline and
the brush is yours you're going to see
our different sizes a regular brush for
the top here kind of cone shaped a
little bit tapered toward the tip which
i think is pretty user-friendly and I
like this mascara a lot for length but I
don't feel like it's as good with
separating my lashes I've had some
samples of this some smaller sizes and I
feel like you know as I have them for a
while maybe the formula dries out a
little bit and it does seem to separate
a little bit better then check out this
great little brush for the bottom part
totally tiny still with the cone shape I
love that it comes to a tapered tip
because that's really really easy to get
in here and I just love the thought that
you know you're not applying a mascara
that's as deep and dark so you get kind
of a widened effect with the eye I'm
back and applying just a little extra
shadow to this I felt like the other one
and just gotten a little bit dark so I
hope you enjoyed the look I mean
obviously this is a really high quality
stuff very high-end
I mean I'm super grateful for David for
supplying me with the stuff to do this
look and I hope David if you're watching
I hope you liked how it came out no I
was you know gifted a lot of this stuff
I thought it would walk you through the
things like when I run out the things I
will absolutely repurchase again one
thing you know as I said Emily
award-winner the Double Wear foundation
I love this amazing coverage it's so
nice to know that like when you want the
most full-on coverage and this has not
been overly touched up with powders
concealers I mean you saw I used a
minimal amount of concealer but you know
it's basically all this foundation doing
this work on my skin and I just love it
great staying power great coverage those
are like two great things to have in a
foundation so if I run out of this which
I'm sure I will I'm gonna go back and
get more absolutely another thing I
would repurchase is the concealer I feel
like it really works nicely with the
foundation it kind of sets on the skin
to a matte finish yet it doesn't look
like a cakey finish I think that's
amazing for two things to be so full
coverage and not look it on the skin
really taken with this lip color I
absolutely love the Reds that go a
little bit berry toned I think they're
so flattering I feel like it's a lip
color for all season I don't care what
the trend is I don't care what people
are doing this looks good no matter what
so the pure color cheating heart
lipstick umm I hope this isn't limited
edition because I really love the shade
and I love the texture of it as well
it's definitely you know I feel like my
lips are hydrated but at the same time I
don't feel like it's so slick that it
would run outside the lip line I have to
say I would go for the lip liner as well
for repurchase because I think um I've
got a lot of pinks in lip liners I've
got a lot of berries but nothing that
really so closely watched the line
between red and berries so this Apple
cordial is perfect these things are
probably my absolute favorites from this
look this is a gorgeous blush color
I highly doubt I will run out of it any
time soon since it doesn't take much to
get the look I want but I've also got a
lot of blushes and I've got a lot of
things that are kind of around this
color this sort of pink but with a nice
bit of depth to it bronze goddess
bronzer I think it's a great idea to
have two bronzers like a split pan thing
going on the rack that I have found so
many great lower cost bronzers I don't
know that again this would be the type
of thing I would
rush out and repurchase but for you know
hardcore estee lauder fans or people who
think that's exactly what I need you
know this is really nice and it is
entirely matte the eyeshadows are
something I want to investigate more
basically from this brand you saw this
Ruby color at work and I love the way it
came off like I love that you know you
can use it wet
you can use it dry it can still be
blended it can be I mean effortlessly
buffed out this was not a lot of work
you know the eye was easy so I love when
you know the shadow kind of does the
work for you I do feel like I like that
texture and the texture in this palette
you know call so kind of a wet dry sort
of thing I like that a little bit better
well quite a bit better really than some
of the Estee Lauder shadows that are in
sort of the gift with purchase palette
things going on here I feel like these
always end up being a little bit sheer
and so I love the full color you can get
with those other coming automatic brow
pencil duo I like this I liked the way
it looked on my eyes it was a very dry
kind of pencil that you could do feel
like you know it was looking like hair
instead of looking like something overly
thick and creamy that just wouldn't make
sense on the brows so I really like the
way that came out and this is probably
going to be like a go to type thing for
when I travel but I am also really
liking you know the brow powder concept
right I'm kind of torn between you know
those two ideas couple things that I
think are amazing in theory the
double-ended eyeliner the double ended
mascara black and brown on each so you
don't like end up really making the eye
seem so closed in with all black I love
that idea I love that within one mascara
you've got a bigger brush and then a
smaller brush like it's not rocket
science but it's a great idea totally
pleased with the length on this but I
feel like it kind of can bunch up the
lashes sometimes make me look like I
don't have as many lashes so that's the
one downfall first liner went on fairly
easily
it really does last a long time the
thing that I struggle with is the
thought that I have some lower cost
liners that also have great color go on
smooth last all day
and don't cost as much the two colors in
one thing is something I don't see all
the time and I do think that that is the
you know the handy convenience of both
of these products I think there's no
doubt that this is very high quality
makeup and it's not that I'm just
realizing this as if this is the first
time I've used it I've been you know
playing around with this stuff for a
couple months now when it comes to you
know what you would purchase it's like
what are those things that are so
different that you just wouldn't be
without in your collection I feel like I
found some of those so much for taking
the time to watch I hope it was
informative and I will see you again
next time the next one brand tutorial
will be a drugstore one so thanks again
guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
