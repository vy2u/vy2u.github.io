for my it cosmetics one brand tutorial
if you haven't seen any of these that
I've done this is basically a video
where I only use products from one brand
to get a look and I also work in some
reviews of those products along the way
and at the end as well I would love it
if you would request what brand you want
to see next and keep in mind I do go
every other with high-end and drug
stores so my last one was Milani this is
it cosmetics I'll have a drugstore one
coming after this so check out my list
in the description box below and tell me
what you want to see next I've done lots
of these over the past couple of years
so there's a lot to look through I get
tons of questions about it cosmetics
products so I thought this would be a
great way to address a lot of those
question let's check it out I hope you
like it
alright I'm starting out with the it
cosmetics your skin but better CC cream
and this claims to be a full coverage
cream color correcting SPF 50 it says so
a really good SPF it has a little pump
on it here and I have it in the shade
medium spreading it around on my face
first and it is just like a little
yellowy for my skin tone but blend it
all out it really looks fine I'm going
to use it cosmetics brushes where I can
where I have them and it makes sense to
use them with certain products but for
this I'm just using this brush from
Sigma because it's the brush I like to
use with this product it's not super
thick but you know it definitely can be
your moisturizer I happen to just have
like a really really light moisturizer
on underneath this as well but this can
be the all-in-one moisturizer and the
coverage I don't find it to be full
coverage like an Estee Lauder Double
Wear is full coverage but compared to
any other CC or BB cream I've tried it's
definitely the best cuff route I was
wearing some of this last weekend when I
was spending a lot of time outside and I
thought the staying power was really
good and it didn't get like super greasy
on my skin either so even when I got
like a little oily in my t-zone it did
seem to react to that too much or break
down a lot also using my bye-bye
under-eye and hello light brightener duo
I do have a full review on this product
and the bye-bye under-eye concealer is a
really really like moisturizing
concealer product there's a lot of
hydration in this which is good but at
the same time it really makes me feel
the need to set it with some sort of
powder on top just to take away like the
tacky texture on the skin and I did find
this brush that I have and I think it
came with the original buy buy under eye
and a tube that I got a while back
typically I like to use my fingers to
blend out this concealer but this little
brush is kind of nice one thing about
this concealer and it may not do this
for everyone and I mentioned this in my
review quite a bit but I can't use this
around my nose because it seems to like
break out that area like it's too heavy
too moisturizing so I will go over the
under eye and set that but first I am
going to use the hello light side of
this which i think is really cool you
know it's not too shimmery and it's
something that it's it's a thinner
texture than the concealer so I feel
like I can kind of use it everywhere on
my face and it just kind of gives you
that highlighted effect without anything
super shimmery on your skin and then
just to set my under eye I'm using my by
by pores this is a really lightweight
powder on it textured like the rest of
your skin you know not to do a and tacky
this is a nice little thing to put over
it next I'm going to pull in my
celebration illumination foundation and
this is in the shade light and I have
tried the regular celebration foundation
I don't think the coverage was quite as
miraculous as I was hoping it would be
judging by some of the presentations
that I've seen on QVC's good coverage
but I don't feel like it's quite
corrective enough to just you know use
the powder foundation and it will
correct all flaws you know what I mean
this seems similar to that coverage wise
but I do like the finish of this even
better
the illumination aspect is definitely
not out of hand I think it just gives a
pretty finish on this
again and I kind of stipple it over
areas where I have you know applied some
concealer and then buff it in elsewhere
and it just gives a finish that reminds
me maybe a little bit of like a Mac
mineralized skinfinish natural and this
was a cool little light buffing brush
that came with it it's very lightweight
very soft just a very good you know
all-around skin tone even or outer using
the vitality glow anti-aging matte
bronzer and I'm using the wand ball
brush I believe this bronzer when I got
it it actually came with a brush like
this and it's massive and it's like a
really really thick fan brush and I just
feel a little out of control with it but
I really like this brush it's kind of a
multitasker or bronzer or blush type
thing so I'm going to take a little bit
of that and just do a little light
contouring with this love that this is
matte I could see this maybe being a
little bit warm for some people who
really go after those cool very taupe
seeming um matte bronzer you get such a
big pan I feel like I can be pretty free
with it and used to apply it all over
I'm using this airbrush blush stain in
rose glow and this is a loose powder
blush so there's a little bit in the cap
here so I'll take some of that with kind
of the tip of this brush and it gives a
really nice glow to the cheek like it
more for the color than the staying
power there is you know a little bit of
shimmer in this powder but the thing is
this is some of the finest loose powder
you're going to see you know is just
like the same texture of the bye-bye
pores finishing powders really really
light and silky so I don't think tons of
glow comes through on your face but just
a little bit I'm moving on to the eyes
and a couple things first off my brows
are done and I couldn't use my it
cosmetics product because I'm out and
this is the your brows but better skinny
pencil so it's a great like very fine
tip Bourke version of brow power and
it's a universal pencil it's called like
transforming taupe or something and I
like to when I use this
go kind of light in here and then it you
add a little more pressure you get more
depth of Celt and for a pencil this is
probably my favorite brow pencil but I'm
out of that I do have a full review
fortunately so you can check that out
for today and what I've been using
lately I've kind of been enjoying the
brow powders and this is the two-faced
brow envy I also do not own an eye
primer from it cosmetics so I just
popped on my Milani eye primer
palette I'm using is the naturally
pretty matte palette and most of the
time when I use this I feel like I do
pretty natural stuff so I really wanted
to do something a little bit dark and
just show you you know how dramatic this
palette can be as well so I've got my
medium shadow brush here from Sonia
Kashuk and going into this shade this
black called Noir and it's really a nice
black because it's not too flat that's
what I find about the matte shades in
this palette
they're their matte they're not shiny at
all but yet they're not dry looking so
I'm going to Pat this all over my lids
but not take it like all the way into my
inner corner leave a little bit of a
space there I like this brush because
see how it's just naturally pulling some
of that shadow up into the crease as
well so next I want to shape the eye a
little bit I'm going to go still back
into the black shade I'm using this
essence of beauty fine crease brush if
you've got a pencil brush or just any
really small crease brush make sure that
the basically the blackest of this black
is right there in the crease and then as
we get more toward the outside you can
see how this has like this little bit of
almost an upturned you know very very
softened outer-v happening well I'm
thinking about how to build that shape I
keep in mind the outer corner of my
eyebrow and kind of think of pointing
this back toward that if that makes
sense
next I'm going to do some softening and
we're going to do that with this shade
here called mocha you can see it's kind
of a medium brown I'm using this brush
the Sigma e25 dabbing it in there don't
think of really going above the black so
much is right on top of the edge
maybe you can start to see how this is
taking on just a slightly different tone
around the edges now then I just want to
take a bear brush and kind of blend over
this a little bit real quick I'm going
into soulful now this is a really pretty
very soft pinky shade and I'm using my
e36
up above what I've just done it's not
going all the way to my brow but it's
getting pretty darn close and I just
love the softness this gives that really
dark eye and then for a highlight I'm
using sheer joy this is my e-40 and
that's what's just going to go right up
closest to my eyebrow and we have
brought in that transforming pearl shade
that's in this palette and layered a
little bit of that on top and we've kind
of encircled the tear duct so I'm using
on this e46 says shader inner corner if
you've got just any kind of really small
precise brush that would be great for
this pull downward and then pull upward
on that tear duct area just pull the
color up onto the lid
and then I'm just pulling it onto like
the center of most part of the lid under
the eye I'm taking more of the noir
shade and this is my e21 smudge brush
and I'm just bringing that right here on
the outermost part of the lower lash
line taking a little bit softer shade
I'm using all heart a very pretty mom
this is such a fun shade to work with if
you're doing any kind of look where you
want like a really soft crease or
blending anything out above your crease
and stuff I mean it looks so nice in
that way and then the only liner I have
from it cosmetics that hasn't dried out
yeah I'm not a huge fan of these no tug
liners because they've all gotten just
so super dry on me but this plum has not
yet and so that's going to be what I put
here in my waterline just keeps that
real nice smoky effect we're after here
upper lash line I'm just going to leave
that as is I mean I feel like the
shadows vary
dark and I don't have a black liner
anyway and I think it looks fine kind of
how it is so I'm just going to curl my
lashes now and then i'm using the hello
lashes mascara and the first time i ever
tried this which may have been a couple
years ago that little ball like actually
broke off the wand and i guess was lost
in my mascara to go up until recently
I'm using this fresh tube I haven't
really experienced what that little bowl
on the end is really light seems to give
me some pretty nice length it's not
quite as good about separation as I had
hoped and I think part of that is
because I really go in with this tip to
try to separate things out but that tip
actually is holding quite a bit of
mascara creamy mascara product and I
think it sometimes causes them to stick
together so you got to be a little bit
careful and just be really aware to
clean off that tip as best you can I'm
going to hit my lower lashes with some
of this too I'm using one of the it
cosmetics vitality butter glosses and
this is in the shade naturally pretty
it's a really pretty shade as you might
think kind of goes along with your
naturally pretty palette I suppose it's
kind of like a maava paint it's got the
most beautiful golden very very fine
shimmer in it it's so pretty and it's so
comfortable on the lips too I like this
kind of gloss my lips naturally kind of
have a maulvis tone to them you know
they're not super pink and pigmented and
so this would be kind of like a your
lips but better lip gloss for me and the
applicator is nice too it's kind of
pointed a little bit it holds a good
amount of product but you're able to get
precisely you know where you want so
there's the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed seeing how some of these
products come together to create a look
and just to give you some very very
brief impressions on the things that
I've tried as a whole just my overall
recommendations my biggest one from
everything I've tried would be this
palette the naturally pretty Volume one
matte luxe palette with the transforming
burl
this palette is awesome I do again have
a full separate review on this if you
want to see another look and just more
swatches and info on it but I think this
is a great great palette it's a
beautiful color range in there first off
so you can get a very wide variety of
looks but they're so pigmented such a
nice texture for being matte shadows
which mattes don't always look super
pretty but these really do another thing
that I have really been liking is this
celebration foundation in the
illuminating version I think it does
have good coverage but yet it has a
really pretty finish on the skin so I've
enjoyed that I like the brush that I got
with it I got this I ordered it in the
TSB toward the start of the year so I'm
not sure if this brush is always sold
alongside it but it's a really great
soft brush and flat top it buffs it in
so nicely so I really like these
vitality butter glosses they are so so
comfortable not sticky actually a gloss
that feels really moisturizing on your
lips so a fan of the bye bye pores
finishing powder I will use this kind of
interchangeably as a finishing powder
with things like bare minerals mineral
veil or the finishing powders from elf I
didn't actually use this as an all-over
finish for this look because I just felt
like I had enough things going on
already and I used this an under eye
setting powder so kind of multi-purpose
but it really really does give a nice
airbrushed look as far as the CC cream
goes this probably tops my list as far
as these CCS and bb's and stuff like
that go all-in-one products that contain
like your moisturizer like a foundation
II type step as well as a lot of great
sunscreen I think it does a great job
and it really does deliver some comfort
when you're tossing around the words
full coverage in the makeup world I
think people expect a lot if you got
some really specific problems like spots
under-eye circles blemishes be prepared
to go in there and conceal them with
something else another product that's
kind of in the middle for me and you
probably know this if you watch my
review but that duo of the bye-bye under
eye and the hello light brightener
love the concept of these two products
together my only complaint with that
bye-bye
undereye is that it is a very very like
amoliant concealer there's a lot of
moisture in it I can't really use it all
over my face for how heavy it can be in
other areas and it does have great
coverage it's just for me always
something I'm going to need to set with
a powder this blush I think it's really
pretty I don't think it's terribly
unique and I don't really believe that
it has amazing staying power like it's
called the airbrush blush stain and I
don't really see that from this product
I think you could get a similar look
from a lot of different blushes the
bronzer here same kind of story I mean
I've used this a lot I have hit pan on
that woohoo
but um compared to some great drugstore
options like the Milani bronzer XL I
think that's great
essence makes some great bronzers I'm
thinking of things in this similar size
pan that basically do what this does
same kind of feelings about the hello
lashes I know everybody's got different
lash needs and different preferences but
for me I really need for to love a
mascara is for it to really highlight
every lash and then thicken and lengthen
every lash when lashes start sticking
together it stops being a good mascara
from kind of appreciate the little ball
on the end because it does help
separation in a sense but if that bowl
is too clogged up with product it will
have the reverse effect one of my least
favorite products from it cosmetics has
been the noted liners for some reason
pretty much everyone I've had has
completely dried up it's kind of odd for
a pencil liner but it's like they won't
draw a swatch for me anymore and this
plum one has not for whatever reason
done that it does glide on pretty easily
it is pigmented but for the track record
I've had with so many others it's not
something I'm going to seek out to
repurchase and as far as brushes go
again I really like that brush that came
with the celebration illumination powder
foundation and I also do like this wand
ball brush a lot of it cosmetics brushes
are really really big this is kind of a
nice manageable size and I like how it's
so tapered up that it can do a little
bit of contouring and it can do your
blush and other stuff so I think it's a
great multitasker
and if you want a lower-cost alternative
to that think about the Real Techniques
blush brush very similar effect so I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
slash review thank you so much for
watching don't forget to request the
next one brand look which will be
drugstore and have a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
