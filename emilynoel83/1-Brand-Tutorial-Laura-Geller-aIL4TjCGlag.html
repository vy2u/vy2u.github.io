brand tutorial these are really great
opportunities to learn a lot about a
specific brand of makeup because I not
only show how the products go on from
start of the face makeup all the way to
the lips but I also do a little review
kind of wrap up about what I think about
all these products and it lets you see
how they work without any other like
favorite products being thrown in that
could cover up for the way you know
something here their work really enjoyed
making these I've done four so far which
are all linked below in the extra info
section but today we're going to be
doing Laura Geller and Laura Geller is a
makeup artist I know she has a boutique
or a little studio in New York City but
you often see her on QVC and I know her
products are also sold at Ulta or at
least the Ulta where closest to where I
live but I've gotten a lot of just sets
of her makeup from QVC over the past
year and there are definitely some
products that I think are such must-have
things and there are some others that
I'm not as fond of so you're going to
hear all about that in this video
describe this look I would say it's all
about the flawless skin with this look
the eyes are fairly neutral kind of warm
and the lips are pretty subtle as well
so it's definitely a wearable day to day
look but it really strikes me as
something extremely feminine very soft
and very wearable so stay tuned first
I'm going to use my spackle under makeup
primer and this is a really popular
primer actually it kind of has a creamy
look but it's definitely more gel like
when you get your hands on it it takes
just a little bit just to feel like it's
totally dry you know on your skin but I
think it forms a nice barrier between
moisturizer and foundation next I'm
using a foundation that is super full
coverage it's the real deal foundation
it's a stick and it says ultimate
coverage and it is oil free so my shade
and this is
medium so the way I use this is I just
kind of go all over my face and just
kind of draw some of this product on
this has a a sort of a thick texture to
it's definitely doing some of the work
that a concealer might do for me in
terms of like little redness around the
nose and broken capillaries and things
like that I think if you had really dry
skin you might find this kind of dry
next I'm going to use the real deal
concealer this is serious coverage
concealer I have it in medium and this I
believe has one a Q VC customer choice
award for best concealer I don't think
this has been out for that long but it
is really full coverage probably the
most full coverage concealer that I own
so this just totally covers up you know
discoloration that you have or spots or
blotches or anything like that as you
can see I just just dotting it around my
eye area just a little bit goes a long
way so don't feel like you have to
squeeze out a whole
I'm going to put on a favorite favorite
product and to tell you the truth with
the coverage that this product give this
this is balancing Brighton which is
technically a powder foundation I really
don't need that kind of coverage on top
of this but I just want to use it to
mention it and show you because this is
one of my favorite things to use if
you've ever got a foundation that you
feel like doesn't have enough coverage
or it's not matte or you just want you
know a little bit of a brightened up
appearance this is really interesting
because it doesn't make your skin look
shiny but yet it does make it look
brighter as a whole and it provides
great great coverage and as you can see
it's multiple shades swirled into one
this is the small size I've purchased a
backup of this and my bronzed and
brighten because I love them so much
haven't had to touch the full size yet
because I'm still working on these
smaller ones and I use them quite a bit
which is impressive so yeah these baked
products from laura geller last a long
time so I'm just going to do a really
light layer of this powder on top of
everything that my skin's super evened
out and I'm gonna take my bronze and
brighten so this one I have hit the
terracotta tile but these are actually
baked on a little bit of this up and
I've liked them definitely like these
enough to repurchase so and I love the
blushes as well definitely call it a
medium type bronzer it's not super light
but it's not you know one of those deep
deep dark bronzers easier next I'm going
to use the air whipped blush in whisper
petal it's really interesting it has
this little golden dome on it's kind of
like a mousse it feels very cool to the
touch and it's just almost like a like a
some kind of souffle or something like
that and just kind of Pat it in not like
a cream to powder product or anything
like that like it remains to have just
this little bit tacky finish that I'm
not really nuts about one thing that I
do love are the baked blushes this one
is so gorgeous this one's called the
most so this is the blush and brighten
and it came in the toast of the town kit
I think I found it at Ulta
it's gorgeous package definitely a peach
with rose and it's going to really make
you glow it's so
gorgeous when I boost my cheeks up like
this something about it just helps me
see more where to put the product so
that's why it helps me to smile when I
put my blush on but you don't have to
eyes I'm going to be using this cute
little quad here it's from the toast of
the town collection and it's called
Bellini and I'm going to start out with
this sort of pinky lilac shade and just
using the applicator that came with it
it was like an angled brush and sponge
tip I'm just going to put some of this
pink shade all over my lid next I'm
going to take this white creamy color
pick up some of that and just kind of go
right around the inner corner here and
kind of blend in word I'm going to move
on to this darkest Brown it's really
pretty and all of these shades do have
some shimmer to them and some of them
even come off metallic a little bit this
brown really can if you pack it on but
I'm just patting this right on the outer
corner then to really kind of get this
sort of smoked out outer V that we've
got on this eye I'm taking my essence of
beauty fine crease brush here and I'm
just going to sort of start blending
this just a little bit up and out and
this is still the dark brown shade and
I'm just going to blend over that edge
to smooth it out of it and I'm going to
take this metallic gold kind of a golden
e bronze and just blend that right over
the border so instead of having an edge
of brown it's just blending right into
the gold then using an even fluffier
brush I'm going to take that lightest
kind of pearl color and go just under
the eyebrow with that also going to use
my pencil brush with this brown and
that's going to be something that goes
just under our lash line here so you can
just kind of blend it in right there
with that outer corner so you're just
kind of working this upward stroke and
then take it right down here and I'm
pretty much going all the way under but
with more intensity toward the outside
then the
inside then for eyeliner this also came
with the toast of the town kit and it is
the I care waterproof eyeliner in purple
paradise it's just a really dark plum to
be honest you can't even really tell
that it just how plummy it is but I'm
just going to take this all across the
upper lash line it's not quite as dark
as I would like it to be another thing
is you can use any of her like baked
eyeshadow kits you can just dampen your
applicator with a little bit of water
and make those become a liner if you
want just taking it a little bit under
the lower lash line just the slightest
bit to kind of make a connection there
at the outer corner then I'm going to
curl my lashes and I'm going to apply my
at long lash mascara this is a
waterproof conditioning high gloss
mascara it says as you take the brush
out it's got kind of a curve to it and a
tapered end that leaves a lot of product
left on that brush you've got to get
that off of there it's very it's
definitely a wet formula mascara it's
not a mascara that I love to use for the
fact that it takes so much drying time
and just being as wet as it is often
times you know it's not long before I
feel my lashes start to kind of clump up
together and next up for lips I'm using
the light beams this is kind of a lip
gloss lip with lip color type thing it's
in passionfruit and it just squeezes up
through the top of a light berry shade
so let's get to some reviews now I'm
talking about spackle the under makeup
primer this is very similar to a new
product Rimmel came out with called
fixin perfect Pro it's got a very
similar texture a similar feel on the
skin I mean this ends up feeling very
smooth as it goes on but sometimes it
takes a little bit of drying time and I
feel like Rimmel fix and perfect Pro
doesn't necessarily need that waiting
period but this is still a great product
thing it forms that really good barrier
between your moisturizer and your
foundation I notice my makeup you know
wears well throughout the day when I've
got spackle on as far as the real deal
SPF 15 foundation stick this is probably
more full coverage than I want for a
day-to-day basis and that's saying a lot
considering that I am on a high
definition television every day it just
has kind of a thick feel to it it's
going to give you good coverage but I
think if you have even just any dry
patches on your skin I think it will
cling to that a little bit I've had that
problem just a little bit I have some
areas around my nose that can tend to
get dry and kind of between my eyebrows
and I do not like seeing the foundation
definitely if you do use this use your
fingers to blend it in so the warmth of
your fingers can sort of break it down
almost slightly but it's just a little
thick for everyday use not a huge fan of
that foundation however the real deal
concealer if you've got some major stuff
to cover up I mean this can do the job
whether we're talking under eye circles
spots on the face tattoo and it only
takes a little bit so while this doesn't
look like a huge tube I'm looking at
this knowing how much I use each time
I'm thinking I'm going to have this
forever
okay balance and brighten I have the
small size here and I also have waiting
in the wings a full size I just want to
show you what full size is in case
you're interested
full size small and this small one I've
had for so long I remember doing a whole
way way back with it was the balance in
Brighton bronze and Brighton and a blush
and brighten that came together probably
one of the best laura geller kits you
can get if you've never tried anything
and you want
some of the best things she's got to
offer but this is so cool because I have
the regular um that's the shade and it's
just a mix of yellow undertones and so
lighter and deeper shades and I feel
like it just evens the complexion it
doesn't make you sparkly or shine or
anything like that but just by the
nature of the coloring of this product
it makes your skin look really glowing
really even really fresh I haven't seen
anything else out there like this
product yet and it lasts forever so it's
a fantastic value if you do pick that up
so I love balance and Brighton and also
I love bronze and Brighton I have picked
up the full-size backups of both of
these products but haven't had to touch
them yet because these lasts so long
this is a great bronzer shade not too
light not too dark and could serve as a
contour if you wanted it to but it's
world with shades of pink dark bronze
medium bronze and even like light pearly
shades it's not very shimmery I store
this in my matte bronzer drawer if that
means anything to you so I love those
products definitely just looking at
everything I used and yeah those are the
top two for sure
use this err whipped blush and I wasn't
too impressed with it it feels good it
feels cold when you touch it which is
always an interesting sensory experience
but um maybe it's the color I got
whisper petal even though it looks sort
of deep right there this one I'm pretty
light on the skin and I didn't really
love the way that particular texture
blended in on top of the rest of my
makeup so what I do like are the regular
blush and brightens so this one in
mimosa is absolutely gorgeous and this
kind of was my highlight and blush in
one because it just has C that shimmery
pearl kind of effect if you're looking
for something similar to the laura
geller blushes check out Milani baked
blush is only seven dollars and it's
very similar but I do love the Laura
Geller one says who also did enjoy the
eyes shadows usually you will see the
Laura Geller
was kind of coming in duo's or singles
that look like that you've got kind of a
shadow on one side and something that
could be your liner on the other you can
wear these wet and dry so that's great
and yeah I do enjoy these I don't think
that the shadows are the most unique
things in the line but they're still
really nice and very velvety soft and I
like the appearance that they gave me
the liner I was not especially impressed
with could have just been the plum shade
I don't know it glided on fairly well
but didn't have much pigment the mascara
is probably my least favorite thing that
I tried it is just all-around not a good
fit for my sparse fine lashes it's just
you take it out it doesn't totally clean
the brush off it's very wet it is
waterproof and I won't have it smudging
on me it's just I don't like the texture
of it and the gloss is something that
again I don't find it to be especially
unique I do like it that's a very
wearable kind of ma be very soft color
but it's called light beams in my shade
is passion fruit that gives you some
insight into the Laura Geller brand I
know I bring up her products every now
and again in my videos and maybe some of
you have wanted to learn more so here
you go definitely she has some all-star
products in her collection that are at
the top top of any favorites that I
would have and some other things that I
wasn't so impressive thanks again so
much for watching let me know what other
one brand looks you want to see the next
one will be a drugstore look so thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
