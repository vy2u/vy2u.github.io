grand tutorial and this one is going to
be all Mac so I'm kind of going every
other one high-end and drug stores so I
started with tart
then I did elf and now I'm doing Mac so
a lot of you wanted to see a one brand
Mac look from me and I got it say with
some of these you know I've been looking
through my collection the sink which
concealer will I use or which this or
that with Mac for a lot of these
products I only had one of a certain
kind of thing so except for eyeshadows
of lips so I got to be a little creative
there but at the end of this video I'll
kind of review some things for you talk
about maybe some dupes and you know
other products that can be subbed in for
this the look is a pretty classic look
on the face with the eyes are definitely
a fall inspiration using some gold some
cranberries and browns so I'm really
happy with the way the eye look turned
out and if you want to see how it all
comes together keep watching the first
thing I'm going to do is take my Mac Pro
Longwear Foundation the shade I have is
NC 35 and I'm just going to kind of dot
this around on my face this color is
borderline a little dark for me right
now as I'm kind of losing my tan from
the summer but I mean I find that I'm
still able to get a good blend with it
and it makes sense and looks normal and
call this a pretty full coverage
foundation I mean it's going to really
tackle minor flaws around your face
it's got you're gonna see a difference
in your under-eye circles with this just
blemishes uneven skin tone it's
definitely going to tackle that and
really even things out for you didn't
have much options for a concealer this
is the only concealer I have it is
studio finish concealer in nw20 v so
this concealer I feel like for some
reason it seems to look like it can be a
little dry to me
times but this is what I have so this is
what we use so I'm just gonna kind of go
around my under eye and a little bit
around my nose then I'm going to use my
mineralized skinfinish natural powder
and medium plus so um this is obviously
you know it's a mineral powder and it
seems to go on not quite as like fully
met as some other powders is like the
Mac Studio Fix powder does so I'm just
applying this for a little more natural
finish just set everything I do have a
bronzer and it is the bronzing powder in
golden does have just a little bit of a
slight slight shimmer to it it's nothing
that I would call major but it is there
so I'm just gonna use my really fluffy
brush and just kind of blend this all
over it's not a really deep bronzer so
I'm just kind of using it to sort of amp
up my skin a little bit make it look a
little more alive and awake next I'm
going to use this blush it's kind of
let's see it's a satin finish blush sort
of a peach peachy pink shade just a
really basic blush color to have and the
shape is flower power or floor power if
because it's spelled like fleur-de-lis
but anyway get some of that on the blush
brush I do think this is a really pretty
blush it's not an especially unique
blush but it is still pretty and then I
have the Mac mineralized skinfinish in
soft and gentle so this is kind of gonna
act as our highlight here so I'm just
gonna pick some of that up and run it
along like the tops of my cheekbones I
actually really like this as a highlight
it's definitely a highlight highlight so
I didn't have a Mac eye primer so I went
ahead and used Urban Decay primer potion
right there but that's the only thing
that's the only thing that's nutmeg and
then I'm gonna start off this is going
to be a real fall type I look so I'm
going to be using wood winked which is a
nice kind of metallic golden tea color
and I'm just gonna take my flat brush
and Pat this right here on the inner
part of the eyelid I'm also just really
quickly and carefully taking that around
the inner tear duct as well then I'm
gonna take a matte Brown and this is
called hand-written I'm gonna Pat this
all around the outer corner here so
we're taking high high and we're setting
it alongside a matte color and where
those two overlap actually creates a
pretty bronzy color and then I'm gonna
pull hand-written right up through the
crease just like so so I'm flipping over
the brush really wedging my darkest
shade right in the crease then just take
a bare fluffy brush and just blend over
all that then I'm gonna take a shade
called twinks and this is a really cool
kind of shimmery brownish almost with a
hint of copper or something and it's
just got a really nice warm shade and
I'm going to run this just right through
the crease with a large brush it's
really good about looking deep when it's
in a crease but as it catches the light
it looks a little bit brighter then one
of my very favorite shades is cranberry
and so this is a frost shade and it's
just a beautiful red and so I'm going to
tap my brush into that and we're gonna
work right off the outer edge of twinks
kind of overlapping it actually and just
really running that all the way through
here kind of cleaning off my brush here
making sure it's clean and really work
on blending this shade like now that
there's nothing else on my brush we're
just going to keep going over this area
now the brush is somewhat bare and you
can see that that cranberry is really
getting diffuse
used now see how it's just I mean we
can't hardly to detect borders at this
point it's just really blending in
nicely I'm taking Naked Lunch nice light
shade here and we're going to just use
that as close to our brow as possible
and it's gonna overlap a little bit of
cranberry there but that's okay because
we want this to look really nice and
blended but as you can see what's what's
going on here gold - brown - kind of
medium brown up to the cranberry and
then fade it out so I'm really happy
with the way that gooder Neath I'm
taking handwritten again with a pencil
brush and this didn't get enough there
we're just gonna blend this right under
the eye for a liner not a tough decision
this is the only mac eyeliner I have and
it is one of the fluid lines this shade
is called Blitzen glitz it actually has
a little bit of it's like a black with a
little sparkle to it I got it around
Christmas time last year but I mean any
black you can't really notice the
sparkle much so any black shade or deep
brown would be nice for this look so I'm
just gonna go inner to outer corner with
this now I'm not really winging this out
at the end but I am just thickening it a
little bit and really getting it right
into that corner so I can bring it down
on the underside slightly just to get
more definition to the eye here over it
again with a little more of the hand
written matte brown eyeshadow next I'm
going to curl my lashes and I have a
mini Mac zoom lash this is the only Mac
mascara I have the formula is a little
wet for me but I do kind of like that
brush so I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply like a couple of coats to my top
lashline and one on the bottom for lips
I have a lip liner in a whirl and this
is just a real neutral kind of matches
the color of your lips type shade so I'm
just gonna go all
with that and fill in with that applying
my Mac Viva Glam 5 lipstick and some of
the gloss in nymphet this is kind of a
shimmery golden color that's how it
comes off
overall I'm really pleased with the way
this look turned out I think my skin
really came out looking nice with this
look and I'm happy with the eyes as well
so I'll just kind of run through the
products and what I think you know could
be bought elsewhere and what things I
think are really a standout product this
is my mac prolongwear foundation so as
you can see I've used a lot of it up and
I really do like this foundation and
I've got a lot of use over over the
summer with this especially because it
is just a little bit darker shade than
some of my other foundations are so I do
like it I think it performs very
similarly to maybelline superstay and
Rimmel lasting finish I mean it has a
really similar look on the skin so not
saying you have to go out and buy this
but this is a good foundation from Mac
if you're looking for a Mac one the
studio finish concealer honestly I will
not be surprised if I notice a little
bit of a maybe cakey look as the day
goes on or a little bit of settling here
in the lines because this concealer is a
little bit dry so I just you know it did
okay for coverage but it's just not
really the texture I loved so much for
the mineralized skinfinish natural this
is a really nice powder and I know I
gave this an Emily award for high-end
mineral powder the this last time around
because it does have a really nice
finish it's a powder without looking too
powdery if that makes sense so it gives
your skin just a nice natural not
entirely matte look so I do enjoy that
powder bronzer I'm not all that
impressed with you could find as
bronzers very similar to this in the
drugstore I mean it's got a little bit
of shimmer I'm thinking Rimmel natural
bronzer and Sundance perhaps could be
similar to that but definitely nothing
outstanding about the bronzer the blush
is a gorgeous color but this is not
unique I'm thinking Milani minerals and
might I kind of similar to this
definitely the same look on the skin in
terms of a standout product I do love
the mineralized skinfinish in soft and
gentle I think this I mean
you look at it here you're thinking I
don't want my skin to look like that but
I mean it's a really subtle nice look in
terms of a highlight and I love how it
really you know it kind of makes you
helps your Cupid's bow kind of stand out
gives your lips a little more pouty look
you can go right on here down the nose
so I definitely do like that
as for the eye shadows I'm I really like
this look but the good news is that I
have dupes for all of these so if you
haven't seen my Mac eye shadow dupes
video there are drugstore alternatives
to every shadow I used here so you can
get this same look and I mean the dupes
are exempt zoom lash just not a great
mascara really average to below average
I felt because it really kind of clumped
my lashes together a bit okay length
here and there I guess but not wonderful
you like the Mac fluidline but I would
say check out wet and wild check out
Maybelline for their cream liners
because they work very much the same and
lips this is just a really neutral lip
and I do think it comes off with a
really I mean I like how the matte
glosses really give you a nice perfect
look to the lips I feel so I like the
nymphet gloss and that's really pretty
Viva Glam 5 is a gorgeous gorgeous
lipstick and you've got world here in
the lip pencil but I mean this neutral I
know I've compared it to Rimmel's sunset
Rimmel moisture renew and sunset and a
lot of people hadn't been able to find
that since I think that shade has been
discontinued so I will keep my eye out
for a similar neutral shimmer kind of
medium deep neutral shimmer to compare
to that if I can vinyl some up here is
that Mac is a great quality brand it can
give you a great look but there are so
many other things out there that do
compare so don't feel bad if Mac is
something you think I can't afford Mac I
you know I'm not gonna follow this look
well you know you can do these things
you can get this look with a lot of
different products a foundation although
you can get other similar foundations
I like this mineralized skinfinish in
both the natural and the shimmer and
yeah that pretty much sums it up for
products that I think are really like my
thank you so much for taking the time to
watch I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and I hope you learned a few things
about what you will get if you do a full
Mac look and what products may be
similar out there too so thanks again
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
