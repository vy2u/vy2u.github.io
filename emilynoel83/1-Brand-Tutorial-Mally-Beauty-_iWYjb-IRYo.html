another one brand tutorial um this one
is all about malli beauty and if you've
been watching my videos you've probably
heard me talk about malli quite a bit
she is a celebrity makeup artist her
name is malli Ron Cal and you may see
her on QVC from time to time she sells
her brand on there also malli beauty.com
she's on Ustream she's on Twitter she's
on YouTube so you can really connect
with her in a lot of different ways and
find out more about the brand but I
thought I would offer my take on a
Mallee Beauty look using only malli
product is doing these kind of every
other with a high-end in a drugstore
brand to show you really how all the
products in that brand operate without
bringing in any other random items but
just seeing exactly what does it look
like if you do a full look with malli
products so the look you're gonna see
today I think is classic malli beauty
it's sort of a smudgy smokey eye very
effortless to put together and it
doesn't look overdone it's kind of like
the modern smokey eye and then the lip
is kept kind of soft so it's really a
nice pairing for everyday the skin is
really important as well glowing skin
it's nothing too matte but yet it still
is perfected
my primer in glue which should kind of
give your complexion just that little
boost underneath your makeup this is a
really lightweight primer um some
primers feel kind of like a gel
sometimes they feel a little heavier
like a cream and this is definitely a
light kind of I would call it almost a
whipped prize or really a nice softness
and smoothness on the skin next I used
the ultimate performance foundation and
my shade is Meeny and I think oh that
looks a little bit dark but honestly
this kind of foundation if I'm going to
be on the air for the news I need
something that's gonna give my skin just
that little bit of boost and you'll
notice as it blends in
it really looks natural are you here in
the compact and it comes with a sponge
like this that you can just kind of blot
it on your skin and I must say this
foundation probably has the most natural
finish of almost any foundation I've
tried and I think it's the nature of the
product you can see it's it's creamy
it's not too thick I don't think this
gives as much coverage as some other
foundations I've tried but the look that
comes off of it is very natural it's not
it's definitely not cakey at all next
I'm going to be using the cancellation
concealer system and so what this is is
kind of a three product thing you've got
a double-ended brush and then a
concealer and a little setting powder so
to start off with the concealer I just
used you know the little brush tip and I
dotted that all over certain areas where
I need it primarily the under eye area
also you can do you know around your
nose chin anywhere where you've got an
imperfection and then once you've got it
kind of applied all over I go in with my
fingers cuz I just think it's easiest to
use my finger to kind of break it down
and really help it melt into the skin
and look natural so this is really kind
of a brightening concealer I don't feel
like it's the fullest coverage concealer
that Nally makes she actually has a
cancellation conditioning concealer that
I've tried that
seems to be a little more hardcore where
the coverage is concerned but this one
is really brightening so for an
under-eye concealer I think this works
really well for me and you use the brush
end of this double-sided brush and you
go in with this powder which is the
setting powder so it's really you know
its color look it's supposed to really
lock in that concealer for a long
wearing look and I will say this is
extremely long wearing I don't notice
any change in the way this concealer
wears when I first put it on to the end
of a work day another product that is
kind of new to me that I picked up on
QVC here recently is the poreless
perfection glowing foundation and this
is a powder consistency prod I applied
it with a brush that it came with and I
just like to use this lightly over the
top of my foundation just to give even
more coverage and I really am loving
that combination it's something that I
would do a lot for being on the air just
because I want that extra coverage
I believe she called this a powder that
can be somewhat hydrating for the skin
and it doesn't cake up it doesn't seem
to cling to dry areas or anything like
that so I do really enjoy that powder
it's a nice kind of setting powder but
you could use it on your own with just
some concealer for a light everyday type
look next I kind of warmed up the skin
with a bronzer and I got this as part of
a one of the today's special values and
its really dark because I chose the
deeper version because I thought I want
something I can contour with and at
first I was like I put it away cuz I was
like I'm never gonna be able to use that
but then I started using it with you
know kind of a fluffy brush like this
and it really can be a nice contour for
me so I did use that kind of around my
cheekbones kind of dusted it around my
forehead to create a little bit of a
contour there and I'm really quite fond
of this actually is totally matte so it
is gonna look natural you're not gonna
look like you're trying to contour with
something sparkly or something like that
the effortless airbrush
blush and highlight so this is really an
interesting product and I'm not sure if
I've shown this before but it actually
has like a sponginess to it
I've never seen anything like where you
can actually press down on the product
and what this is is kind of a cream and
powder hybrid which is so interesting so
that means when you put it on your skin
once again it's not going to look like
you've put on a powder when you layer
you know say a face powder with a powder
bronzer and a powder blush you know the
the powdery look can definitely be there
and I think Malley kind of wants that
fresh look to happen so what I did it
comes with like a double-ended brush
like this so I used this side for the
blush and she recommends kind of a
cinnamon rule I think she calls approach
where you kind of start here and then
you kind of grow your circle out a
little bit and you get larger and larger
circles and it diffuses the blush just
right in you use this kind of lighter
brush it's gonna apply the product a
little less dense which is what you want
for a highlight tap it into the
highlight and you can go over at your
cheekbones down the bridge of your nose
your chin your brow bone also your
Cupid's bow area you can do that really
quickly and easily with this so for the
texture of this that I've tried nothing
like this it's very interesting once you
get your hands on it
you know it'll feel so weird to you that
it looks it has the appearance of a
powder and then you touch it and you're
like that ain't powder you know that's
something different so I loved that I
wanted to show you something that I
think is a really important part of this
line and it's something I use actually
after my makeups been on for a while
right before I go out like to do the
news before I get on the set it's the
ever color poreless face defender and so
this is a product you can kind of like
blot on yourself and it gives your skin
kind of a perfected satiny appearance it
lets your highlights your blushes
anything shine through but it takes away
you know actual recife is a clear
product totally clear kind of a a like a
solid gel type formula and I just put my
sponge in here and I twist to make sure
I'm picking some of that up and then you
don't want to rub it across your face
but you just want to blot it over
certain areas and you'll find that just
kind of takes away your problems
basically and makes everything look
really even it's great
me being on HD television because you
don't see the buildup of product like
you do if you're putting on lots and
lots more powder moving on to the eyes I
went again with kind of a classic malli
I look because I chose some bronzy
colors that I know she's very fond of
but I also kept it really simple smudgy
not a lot of high maintenance steps and
processes and stuff like that's the more
perfect palette I wanted to use it in
this video because I've talked about it
so much and people have been wondering
you know how does a look come together
with that so the first thing I use and
it's actually under a nice little flap
so I love that aspect but I use this
base and one thing about this base is I
have had creasing when I've used this
used too much of the base so really put
it on you'll notice it'll neutralize the
color of your lid really well but
definitely Pat over that and make sure
you're not getting too much on then I'm
using probably one of the standout
products from Ali's line to me which are
these ever color shadow sticks in almost
any instance if I'm using a cream
product on my eyelids I will tell you
you have to use a powder over that to
make it last these you don't have to you
can and I'm going to just for a color
effect but you could definitely wear
these on their own and they will not
smudge on you it's fantastic and so I'm
going to be using this shade and saddle
shimmer
it's a gorgeous Brown it's I used it
chose to use it because it's one of my
favorites I put that all over my lid
I have no fear with this cream product I
went right up through my crease and then
you're just gonna blot over that with
your finger you also take it under the
eye as well so I'm kind of getting that
smudgy liner I'm getting that shadow I
took another shade which is probably I
can't decide which one's my favorite but
this one is probably the most
multi-purpose and it's champagne and so
this is a gorgeous light color that you
can use just to spot highlight like
right around the inner part of your eye
right here and I have used this this
these are crazy long way you'll put this
here and you will have that glow
throughout the entire day you're not
gonna believe how simple this I look
actually comes together but I'm using
this shade
right here and this is called mallies
glow and I have this individually as
well it's a great kind of deep bronze
shade it's got some shimmer to it I'm
just using this sort of smallish shadow
brush that came in one of my Malley
palettes just dab it in there and then
go right over your saddle shimmer just
warms it up so much and then you can
kind of just take it right up through
the crease I can't believe how easy this
is but you get just a subtle contour
just by the nature of these products
being shimmery they pop on your lid but
they kind of recede in your crease and
look darker so it's so easy so
low-maintenance and then you can take a
fluffier brush if you want to go to this
lightest shade and then just use that as
your highlight one of my favorite Mally
brushes is actually this little smudger
brush and I went in with the black with
that and I kind of topped part of my
lower liner and then I also use the
bronze to just kind of smudge it out get
that smokey softened look right there on
the lower lash line I always got a lot
of great liners but the one that I keep
coming back to and the one that I have
kind of tested against some other
products in the in the inner rim in the
waterline and this one proves to be the
longest wearing for me and it's the
Mallee ever color automatic waterproof
liner in onyx so it's the black shade I
think it's the most saturated color of
any of these kinds of liners and what I
did I just put it on the inner rim it's
very easy and that's gonna last you for
a long long time and then I also put it
along the upper lash line next I curled
my lashes and I used one of Molly's
all-star products which I've gotten my
mom and my sister loving in it is the
Mallee volumizing mascara the brush on
this is really really great because it
is a thick brush
it's a traditional brush mascara amulet
is straight-up creamy it's not super wet
it's not super dry but it is kind of
just creamy and it keeps your lashes
feeling flexible throughout the day it
doesn't turn them to a hard crusty mess
it builds the volume it gives you length
it gives you thickness I am one who has
sparse lashes I feel like they need a
lot of help and this
is a mascara that can definitely give me
what I need and it is one of my top top
favorite mascaras right up there with
Tarte lights camera lashes which I enjoy
this one is also just amazing and so
many of you that have tried that have
come back to me and told me I love that
mascara and a true malee style I felt
the need to put on some false lashes
because Malley oyster Oaks about her
drag queen lash so I thought I want to
have that added bit of glam here so I
just threw on some false lashes but I
put the mascara on top and bottom to
really allow the look to blend together
her lips just did kind of a standard
pink lip but I only used one product
here but I'm still getting the
definition and I'm still getting the
shine and the pigmentation out of it and
it's the Mally's look lip gloss and this
basically comes out through the tip here
this is definitely one of her top
products I know on QVC and it just has a
great ability to be used just right out
to the edge of your lip line and it
doesn't go anywhere actually no shimmer
in this one it's just a creamy pink lip
that I think really works well with this
eye
enjoyed this Malian tutorial I remember
it was pretty much a year ago last
Christmas when I asked for my first
malli kit and my parents got it for me
and I remembered using it and just
really getting hooked on some of the
products she has so in terms of things
that I think are absolute must-haves one
of my favorite things from the brand and
I do have a Mallee favorites video if
you want more ideas but the more perfect
palette is something that you will find
endless ways to you so the effortless
airbrush this is so unique haven't seen
anything like it the texture of the
blush and highlight are just phenomenal
and then also can't forget the poreless
face defender as one of those finishing
touch touch-up products that's not a
powder it doesn't add added weight to
your face with makeup so it looks was
just really flawless with that love the
staying power of the shadow sticks and
also the automatic ever color liner I
think this is just one of the best
eyeliners I like the foundation and I
like the cancellation concealer but I
don't feel like they're some of the most
full coverage products so if you're
looking for you know that super full
coverage you might want to look to
either other products in the line or
just other products for you know super
coverage things that I don't think I
quite mentioned enough because obviously
I've just put this makeup on now and
it's fresh but the staying power of the
Mallee products especially on the eyes
are very impressive and it's lovely that
you don't have to necessarily go through
some whole system to make it long
wearing or whatever you know you can put
on a shadow stick and go and you're done
and you don't have to worry about that
going and it's the same way for the
eyeliner too so I'm really impressed
with that
mallies products are innovative they're
fun to use they're one it's one of the
most innovative brands that I've tried
and honestly there aren't a lot of
misses with her line I feel like the
things that I try I genuinely enjoy
thank you so much for watching stay
tuned for more one brand tutorials and
have a great day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
