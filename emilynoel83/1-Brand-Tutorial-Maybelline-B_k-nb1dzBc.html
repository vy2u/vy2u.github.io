this time it's a drugstore look it's
using 100% Maybelline products so it's
basically going to take you step by step
from the start of the makeup to the end
plus some little reviews on the
different products I use but nothing
else is thrown in so there's no high-end
products no favorite products it's just
this one brand so I've done these on a
number of different high-end and
drugstore brands so far so if you want
to check those out I'll link to them
below but they've been a lot of fun to
do they've been a challenge to do
because not all of these products I love
I mean in this Maybelline one brand look
there are some products that I think are
absolutely great and then there are some
others that I'm like I would not
recommend this at all so it's gonna be
interesting so if you want to see how it
all comes together stay tuned
I have tried a lot of different
Maybelline foundations but I'm going to
start off by using one that I really use
a lot because of its staying power and
its coverage and that is maybelline
superstay my shade is classic beige so
I'm just going to shake that up a little
bit and dot that all over my face then
I'm using a foundation brush to just
kind of blend this in everywhere
next I'm going to use my instant age
rewind this is the eraser for dark
circles it's called a treatment
concealer and my shade here is called
light how to dab this around your under
eye area and then just dab over it with
your finger or you could use a brush
this concealer is very light in
consistency but yet it does manage to
have kind of some concentrated
pigmentation too and then upon a recent
recommendation from a friend named Jamie
on Twitter she said you should really
try the instant age rewind brightener
and she says this is a great dupe for a
Prada a popular product from you Saint
Laurent so I wanted to try it and see if
that was the case and I have been using
this ever at this stage of the game you
know after I do my foundation my
concealer I just kind of dot this again
this is just a little bit brighter and
it has just the slightest pink tone and
I put it there and I kind of go down my
nose Cupid's bow chin and actually right
up their eyebrows like that but it's
just a sheer brightener is how I would
I'm gonna just use very sparingly my
dream matte powder because I don't want
this to be like the most matte look ever
but I want to just kind of go over I
like to go over my under-eye area just
to set that a bit a little bit on the
forehead nose so I didn't have nor do I
think I've ever had a bronzer from
Maybelline so I had to go to the store
and find one fit me bronzer it's the
deep bronzer option that was there and I
didn't think the deep looked extremely
dark anyway and from swatching it's got
just a little Sheen to my you know
suspicions who are correct that these
all looked really light even the deepest
one is pretty light here gonna actually
attempt to do a little contouring with
this if I have nothing else to use for
Maybelline so just deepen things up
there right under the cheekbone a little
bit under the jaw and for this I'm using
an angled brush that's a little bit
smaller that way especially with the
bronzer like this that is kind of light
you can concentrate the color a little
bit when you go to look for blushes now
they all say fit me on them they don't
have the regular I think expert wear is
what they were called before but I got
this one in medium pink and so it's just
a real basic pink it seems to have a
little bit of it so I just put a little
bit of this on I don't put it on my
cheeks and think wow that's a gorgeous
blush but more on that and then just to
ensure that we've still got that glow
going on I'm using my Maybelline Dream
mousse blush this is in peach satin and
this really acts especially we've got
like medium skin or dark skin really
acts like a highlight so I'm just gonna
take this a little bit on top of my
cheekbones and it's so light
it just feels perfect even after you've
worked with powder products I mean it
just seems to work really nicely
alright guys I would describe this as a
simple eye look but with impact because
we're gonna have a wing but the shadow
is really simple and everyday so I'm
using the quad from Maybelline duh in
chic natural so I'm just gonna take a
flat brush and I'm going into this
crease shade right here so it's kind of
a grayish taupe and we're gonna go all
across the lid with that very easy just
lay it right then we're also gonna kind
of pull it up a bit as well so just for
blending purposes that kind of helps to
have like that layer down here so we're
gonna pull it up to the crease too then
I'm going to take a fluffy brush and get
our base shade out of the way so that's
that big light color there take that up
under the brow you can also take a small
brush with the base shade and this is
pretty much matte but it still is a nice
little brightener here as you can see so
I'm gonna put some of that down
counteract darkness and now we're going
to work in the liner matte dark gray
color so I'm gonna take my flat brush
because I want to concentrate a little
bit of that on the outer half of my lid
then i'm gonna take a fuller brush like
a crease brush and we're gonna take some
of this shade into the crease in terms
of a guideline because i think sometimes
people think okay I will put that right
in my crease OOP it's there but I think
for kind of a guideline for applying
sort of a wash of color a soft crease
shade like you see here think about as
you look straight ahead into your mirror
can you just slightly see that color
coming up with your eyes open that's
what I'm going for here I want it to
just be visible right here with my eye
then we're gonna grab a pencil brush and
go back into that shake we just use that
deepest matte gray and we're going to
take it under the eye for kind of a
smoky liner now we're going to use a
liquid liner and a great one to get this
very look is Maybelline line stiletto
it's got a very precise tip it's not a
brush tip but it's kind of like a
flexible
we're gonna start right in here at the
innermost corner with our lung staying
pretty close to the lash line at this
point what I like to do is kind of draw
out from the corner of my eye make a
little line coming up and then connect
it from the top so it's kind of like we
created our own little triangle here for
our wing I'm gonna take some liner in
pencil form for the look for the
waterline it's Maybelline's master drama
in Midnight Master this is a great rich
black I've talked about this as being a
pretty good long wearing liner for your
now kind of an important step you see
how everything's really kind of working
together here there's no real jump-offs
it just looks like that wing just stems
right from the outer corner of the eye
to get that you want to take just a
little bit of your pencil and I'm going
on my regular my natural lash line here
and I'm just making a little connection
there up to the wing I'm not gonna go
any further in with this pencil than
right about there once you hit the iris
of your eye so I'm taking a q-tip and
I'm just gonna go over that then I would
advise you to take your pencil brush
again go back to that charcoal dark
shade here and just top that whole thing
off and there you go you've got softness
going right into kind of a bold look
there next I'm going to curl my
eyelashes then I'm gonna apply two coats
of the falsies flared mascara then for
the lower lashes which we also want to
spotlight I'm using Maybelline lash
discovery it is called the mini brush
mascara because the brush is teensy and
it's so easy to control so I love using
this on lower lashes I kind of like to
wiggle it at the root and then pull down
I'm gonna be also using the color
sensational lipstick in party pink okay
so this is going to be kind of like the
showstopper of this look and it's a
really nice kind of berry magenta it's
not too dark
does kind of make you think party I mean
it's just a great look and then for a
little added added shine I'm using the
color sensational lip gloss in sweet
indulgence and this is just a light pink
shade I have several of these I really
like them but it's super sheer a little
bit shimmery shiny thing so just put
that right in the center of the lower
lip for some added fullness so here is
the finished look
I hope you enjoyed seeing you know kind
of the step by step process of all these
different things and you probably
learned a few things about how to apply
them but now I'm going to tell you what
I really think about them so just going
to be brief reviews here some of these
things I have done more in depth reviews
on so if I have I will link to those in
the info section below but just starting
off talking about this foundation
maybelline superstay I think is a really
great foundation one of my top drugstore
foundations up there with Revlon
Colorstay and Rimmel lasting thing I
might suggest you apply with a damp
sponge with any of these foundations if
you feel like they look too thick
because they are a lot of coverage and a
lot of stain I do enjoy that I wear this
on air off of these age rewind eraser
products are really cool I like them
because they are such a lightweight
consistency which is really great for
the under eye area if you are dealing
with any creepiness or any you know
really thin skin and wrinkles and lines
this is something that is not going to
add too much product to that under-eye
area but it really does brighten the
under eye area so I enjoyed the
concealer which you're going to use for
you know coverage but also I recently
picked up this brightener which I think
is really great it has the slightest I
like to use this all over my face in
different areas to just bring some light
to a certain place the dream matte
powder is a great matte powder I don't
like to overuse this because especially
these days I've been trying to not get
that oh my gosh your skin looks so super
matte look you know what I mean so I
just like to use this in places I don't
often use the sponge that comes
this I will usually use a brush because
that will give me more of a diffused
shear application of this so I just use
it where I need it you may have to
reapply a bit here and there throughout
the day but that's a powder I think I
could recommend to oily skin people
Maybelline does not have a great
selection of bronze I felt like it
didn't have much pigmentation it didn't
do much for me as I'm looking at my skin
I'm not looking for bronzers to give a
drastic drastic difference but I mean I
tried to use it to contour and it really
couldn't do anything and then the blush
I felt like this was not very pigmented
at all i got medium pink and that should
have been the right shade for my
skintone but um it's just so soft i mean
it has a little bit again that pearly
finish it's not totally matte it's not
very pigmented there are so many better
drugstore blushes out there so I would
say that blush and that bronzer not
digging those but you know I do like the
dream mousse blushes wish they had a
wider selection of these but this was a
lot of fun too this is how I'm getting
this glow I can't kind of in conjunction
with the the little brightener product
here
that that's what's giving me the look of
just a little bit of glow without grease
enos so I love I like the color
sensational lipsticks a lot there's a
really wide color selection they are
very saturated colors I would kind of
put them in the same category as revlon
colorburst for the color payoff this is
a nice creamy lipstick this one that I
used in party pink does not have any
shimmer to it so you're getting
straight-up
creamy color and I love this shade love
it so much these glosses I mean they it
smells fantastic this one I have in
sweet indulgence it's really good and I
have one in sort of a more neutral
toffee color and scent and I like them a
lot they're not something I would say oh
my gosh it's the best lip gloss ever but
I mean they're the Maybelline eyeshadows
um this is the one I use this was chic
natural after using other brands like
the Smashbox photo op mega palette which
I love that buttery almost texture to
these powder shadows it's really awesome
and this doesn't really compare to that
and this also
I would put wet-and-wild above this I
would put Knicks for the natural look I
was trying to achieve here I think it's
it's okay but I'm not in love with this
if you were if I were to tell you what
some of my favorite maybelline quads are
they are the stylish smokes collection
where you can get charcoal and amethyst
and sort of a greenish olive color and
things like that
I like those I think they're really good
I have blogged and swatched the heck out
of those but this particular one I'm
kind of like they're trying to achieve
some good matte colors in here and
they're okay but they're not great or
liners one that has just been a growing
favorite of - Maybelline Lines
I like the blackness over this I like
the way it applies it's one that I will
use interchangeably with my Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner I like them both
it's just kind of a matter of okay am i
running out of this one that I'm gonna
choose Maybelline master drama I know
I've talked about this and the NYX
slide-on liners as being great
alternatives to those long wearing kind
of expensive liners that you've seen
from Urban Decay the 24/7 brand and
stuff like that and this is a good liner
to put in your waterline and I like that
it's automatic I like that we don't have
to sharpen this but you can get that
rich rich creamy black the falsies
volume express mascara I've done a full
review video review on this I'm not
convinced that the whole flared thing I
don't get that I know I've talked about
that before but I don't feel like it's
that brush is really functioning to
flare out the lashes it gives good
length and I will I will stop there if
you want to hear learn more you can see
my full review on it but it's not a
favorite mascara by any means lash
discovery however is something I would
recommend to everyone because I am
putting this on my lower lashes a li
basis not getting flaking not getting
smudging which is saying a lot for a non
waterproof mascara I mean if you've got
watery eyes and you cry a lot you might
want to get the waterproof version but
the by far one of the great things about
this is how it applies with a teeny tiny
brush not clumping up lashes down
that you don't want clumpy you know you
want really defined darker like looking
lashes when you do your lower lashline
and I just think this is the way to type
pretty much covers everything for this
Maybelline one brand tutorial I hope you
learn more about how this line works as
a whole as with every brand I mean
you're gonna see it almost every time
there's going to be some products that
are awesome and there's going to be some
not-so-good products hits and misses
with every brand I find so when people
ask me that question what's that one
brand what's your one favorite brand I'm
always like oh I can think forever on
that because I would not be 100%
satisfied all the time but Maybelline's
got some great things that are worth
checking out so hopefully my review
brought those to your attention and I
hope you liked this tutorial thanks a
lot mmm yeah fix this or you can run a
like a it is just a super but yeah just
you just want to UM not so I think that
oh goodness right because it just well I
think that pretty much covers everything
for this Revlon review oh it's not
