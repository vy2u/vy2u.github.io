I'm so excited to bring back the one
brand tutorials this one is a 100%
Milani videos videos it's just an
opportunity to really focus in on one
brand and take a look at the strengths
and the weaknesses and just how an
entire look comes together only using
that line and at the end I like to do
some little reviews and Milani is
definitely one of my favorite drugstore
brands but I do think there are parts of
the line that could use a little more
variety or maybe aren't as strong as
others so this will be fun to go through
and do this look start to finish
full face with you I've got a lot of one
brand tutorials that I've already done
I've been doing these over the course of
the past couple years so I will link
below to every one that I've done check
that list and then feel free to request
any brand that you don't see on that
Lego every other with drugstore and
high-end my last one was benefit this
one's Milani so the next one will be
high-end as well so keep the requests
coming I really appreciate it and for
this Milani look I wish I would have
planned this because it would have been
a good idea but for the palette I chose
to use for the eyes as I was doing my
first part of the look I'm like oh this
is totally a Mardi Gras type look and
that is the way it turned out with the
purple and the green so I hope you like
it and let's get started starting out
with some concealer this is the secret
cover concealer cream in beige and I
have actually never seen this being sold
in any of my local drugstores I had to
order this online kind of a preparation
for this video because I realized I
didn't have a Milani concealer kind of a
thick concealer it has really good
coverage and you just sort of have to
warm it up a little bit
I really prefer to apply this concealer
with my fingers as opposed to a brush
because it does have that thickness and
I think it really benefits from the heat
of your hand so I'm going to be applying
some of this around my under eye area
just taking it right up to my lower lash
line really patting it in and I'm doing
concealer first because the foundation
I'm using is a powder foundation and not
using this as an under-eye concealer but
also kind of a way to neutralize some
redness it's doing a pretty good job of
that around my nose you know just under
my nose
get a little redness on the upper lip so
you kind of have to look at your face a
little differently when you're thinking
okay I'm not putting a liquid foundation
on how much do I need this concealer to
do so getting this around the under eye
here
okay so concealer is on then I'm going
to be using my multitasker face powder
I'm using the shade light/medium today
so this is a really really matte full
coverage powder foundation I'm
definitely one of my favorites from the
drugstore I'm not really just dusting
this over my under-eye but I'm really
pressing it on top of where I put the
concealer so as not to disturb the
concealer and really change the look
that I have too much and then I'll just
start dusting this elsewhere over the
face and I've used this powder in the
past just to set a foundation you know
really lightly but the coverage is
pretty buildable so I think everything's
looking a little more evened out at this
point I'm going to continue on with
bronzer and a really good one from
Milani that I have is the bronzer XL and
I have it in fake tan and this has a
very deep cool matte bronzer in here so
that looks not like that and then the
other side has just the tiniest bit of
shimmer it doesn't show up a lot on your
face but you can see how it's a little
bit lighter I'm going to start off on
the matte side and just pick up a little
bit of that and taking this right along
my cheekbone there and then I like to
use sort of a circular motion to make
sure I'm getting it all blended out this
is a bronzer that kind of gets
overlooked in my collection because it's
a very big compact and I've been sitting
it down in another drawer and just not
really thinking about it but honestly
it's a very big minted bronzer I mean a
little bit goes a long way I feel like
you know I'm able to get a nice
contoured look with that deeper shade so
I think I'm going to be pulling this out
more often now kind of a rediscovered
product I'm taking a little bit around
my temples as well right around my
hairline blush today a shade that I
think is going to complement the
I look really nicely is this shade
called delicioso pink this is one of the
baked powder blushes one of the new
matte ones that came out and I'm really
really enjoying these I do have a full
review on this shade and the other new
shade that came out but just takes the
team hist amount of product here really
gives off beautiful color and I'm just
going to blend that on the outer part of
the apple of my cheek and sweep upward
I'm going to be using the Milani brow
tint pen this is in dark brown this is a
very very long wearing almost like a
think of it as a stain type thing to put
in your brows it's very weightless so
I'm just going to do a teeny bit of
filling in here on some areas that may
not be quite as as thick as they are on
the other side or whatever just a little
filling in my mom uses this product in
the taupe shade and I think for blondes
that's just a great color she's had
great luck with these lasting her really
long time over a little area where I
have a scar here and this handles that
just fine one of the newer brow products
milania's come out with is the brow
shaping clear gel it has kind of a short
mascara type wand there and I'm just
going to block that basically on my
brows sometimes I feel like especially
when they're new when I break one of
these wands through my eyebrows I get
way too much gel in there so I like to
just dab it on and then take a separate
brush to get them in place how I want
them yes no blouse coming down my road
thank you and one more Brown step before
I go any further I'm using the brow and
eye highlighter this is the one in matte
cream luminous lift this is my favorite
one and this is another product that I
do have a full review on all three of
the ones that are available but I like
to just take this right up under the
highest point in my brow here I'm using
the matte side and then I'm just going
in with a little brush and sharing that
out then I'm going to lay down kind of a
base for this look I'm using my shadow
eyes stick in royal purple and I'm just
going to
draw this all over my lid I'm first kind
of focusing it near the lash line just
to make sure I get it nice and close and
then just bringing it up you know so
it's all over the lid and then just use
my finger to smudge it out a bit
using the runway eyes kit this is in
haute couture and I'm going to start
with the deepest purple shade right here
and I'm going for a little bit of like a
gradient effect but instead of going
like dark to light this way like I
normally would I'm kind of going dark to
light upward like that so first off
taking this purple shade that's a little
tricky to just get that one shade that
you want with this packaging so I'm just
applying this all over the lid
and let me tell you that cream base is
for helping out this shadow a lot
helping it have a lot more intensity
because these shadows are not the most
pigmented and then I'm going one shade
up and this shade just a little bit
lighter with a fluffy crease brush and
that shade I'm going to go into my
crease with and end up blending it so
it's like just on top of like my brow
bone area here so maybe you're just
seeing like a gentle fade up of color
there from purple to medium purple and
then one more little effect with these
shadows we're going with the more pinky
tone one and this is my Sigma e30 six so
I'm taking that inward and just up in
this kind of space before I get to my
eyebrow but above all the other shades
I'm just taking the slightest bit of
this white here not too much because it
can look pretty frosty and I'm just
going to go right up next to my brow
with that and then kind of blend out my
edges still want to keep it interesting
on the under part of the eye I'm going
to be using two shadow sticks first the
purple one that we used on the top part
and that is going right on my outer I'd
say outer third of my lower lash line
there so just get a little bit and then
I'm taking a really pretty emerald green
this is the shade called green Safari
and I'm taking this of all the rest of
the way under and I didn't even think of
about this until I was doing these steps
on my other hand I'm like this looks
like Mardi Gras so this is kind of fun
I'm using the purple the deepest one
with a smudge brush I'm going to overlap
that purple that I just applied so the
shadow is going to pop more with that
base underneath you could do this
without the bases but I don't think your
look would be nearly as strong or as
long-wearing then I'm going to go to the
green that's in this palette so it's
kind of a spring green sort of a bright
shade and that is going to top off the
green part and so I overlap a little bit
with the purple but then just carry it
all the way in and then I've got just a
little glow right around the inner
corner that's coming from the white so
I'm just going to take a little detail
brush here and just brighten up right
around the inner corner for the inner
rim I'm using the Milani liquid eye
pencil one of the retractable ones and
this isn't the one just a shade called
purple and it's kind of a deep like
almost a little bit metallic plum shade
the outside to the inside here and then
I'm also going to use this liner on my
upper lash line I might be able to see
the shine coming off of this liner a
little bit more there on the upper part
and I'm not really winging it out I'm
just taking it down to the end and kind
of connecting it there at the lower lash
line next I'm curling my lashes and I'm
using the grandes mo mascara here it
says incredible Volume Mascara the brush
is enormous
really really big and I am just going to
apply a couple of coats of this to my
upper and lower lashes I think you can
see it building some length here which
is nice I've had this mascara for a
little while I really did not like it
all right off the bat it's had a chance
to become a little bit more dry the
formula has and so now I like it a
little better but I still think the
brush is just a bit much for my lips in
this look I don't want anything too loud
but I kind of want to play off of some
of the pink that's fading up from this
look a little bit so I'm going to go
with one of the new brilliant shine
losses and this is in the shade Pink
Ladies so I think this is going to work
well and this is just a creamy gloss
it's super shiny and it's pretty
pigmented too I mean I don't feel like
it's sheer I don't feel like I'm seeing
a ton of my natural lip color through
that so I think that makes kind of a
nice finishing touch to the look so
there's the finished look I just want to
take you through some of the products I
used and give you my overall thoughts on
stuff and I mean the bread and butter of
the coverage for this look was this
concealer and this powder foundation and
honestly I think they did a really good
job at combining joining forces and
being enough on my skin because I feel
like I would normally reach for a liquid
foundation I don't feel like Milani has
a really good range of that kind of
thing this concealer was really good and
I do think if you try this you're going
to feel like oh is that kind of dry but
really just swirling your finger in it a
little bit maybe rubbing your fingers
together warming up the product makes a
huge difference and I mean I think it
was able to handle everything from
redness to dark under eyes this base
shade zero eight is definitely the
perfect shade for me I really love the
multitasker powders I think these are
just such buildable coverage really
matte no problem with those at all if
you're looking for a really really full
coverage drugstore pressed powder that
could stand alone or be layered
over your foundation for extra coverage
this is a great one to try kicking
myself for not using this bronzer XL
more on the one in fake tan I think it's
great I think that is a really really
nice contouring shade think it will be
kind of a nice substitute product for
the Revlon Photoready bronzer which is
apparently being discontinued these
blushes definitely a strength of their
line love the baked blushes they've got
a couple of matte ones including this
one and then a lot of other more
shimmery tones varying amounts of
shimmer in those just a really really
nice shade selection roll good quality
face products I'd love to see more in
the way of foundations and concealers
and concealers that are available
they're actually selling in the stores
because I have only seen this one online
a part of the line that really has
expanded recently are the eyebrow
products Milani has got some great stuff
even beyond just what it I used in this
video but I think the
brow tint pen is a great really
effortless product to use on your
eyebrows very long wearing weightless
the tip could not be more fine to get
exactly where you want it we're gel
nothing super special about it I think
it's cool that they came out with their
own but I think brand to brand these
tend to be really similar and elf
actually has a $1 one that tends to be
available at Target it's got two ends on
it and if you're really trying to save
and go bare minimum on your brow gel
that would be the one to go for I think
I love the brow and I highlighters
definitely one of my favorite things
that Milan E's come out with recently
I've tried different brands many more
expensive ones and this is probably the
best price that I found on something
like this for eye products from Milani I
think they got some great things
happening and some not-so-great things a
somewhat new addition to the line are
the shadow eyes pencils these are super
super long wearing shadow sticks a
little heads-up that Jordana makes these
as well in pretty much all the same
shades but a lower cost and they're all
manufactured by the same company so I
had written about in a blog post that I
thought you know if you just want this
kind of thing you want the lowest price
I get them from Jordana but they go on
super creamy and you don't even need to
set them with anything like they're
really really long wearing the runway
eyes eye shadows this is not the only
palette that I have of this kind and I
really don't feel like these are the
most pigmented shadows the bases that I
used on my eyes definitely helped me get
a more vivid look but just to show you
some swatches from that palette without
anything helping them out you know the
palette itself looks bright but these
come off I think kind of pesto
kind of week where the R my eyes are
concerned and then the strips are so
skinny it can be kind of hard to get a
more full brush into those products the
best thing Milani has going on shadow
wise are these powder eyeshadows they're
not the baked ones they're just you know
regular eyeshadows you're getting a lot
of product in there they're selling
these online I think I might have seen
these briefly being sold in stores but
they are great matte and shimmer colors
neutrals just really really buttery
rich textures I just pulled out like my
last two here for some reason like
Malati's liners they've come out with
some super long wearing liners I prefer
the retractable kind the purple I used
today I was really happy with
I have heard some complaints from
viewers here and they're saying when
they use them on their inner rim they've
experienced some sensitivity I never
have but I just wanted to put that out
there that that is something I've heard
more than once from people on milania's
eye liners know that that tends to be a
problem for you just keep that in mind I
don't know that I've tried a Milani
mascara that I've actually loved they
had something called power lash and it
had a red and black tube and it was
absolutely one of the worst I think I've
ever tried this one is more like average
I would say the grand ASIMO lashes gave
me decent length but not as much
separation as I would have wanted and
the brush is just I think excessively
large for the lip gloss this is a newer
thing these brilliant shine glosses
they've got a lot of shades I have a lot
of shades and I've been trying them out
seen a little variation in how sheer
some of them are some more sheer than
others but I'm really enjoying those so
far I didn't use any of the color
statement lipsticks in this look but
these are great I love these especially
the creamy formula just lots more
innovative fun lip stuff that they've
come out with that I will definitely be
doing more reviews on soon I think lip
products are a real strength of
milania's line also the blushes bronzers
I think those are awesome
I would love to see them expand more
where foundations and eyeshadows are
concerned because like I said you'll run
into some of the baked eyeshadows and
stores maybe some of these runway eyes
palettes but I really don't think it's
their best product you know I love these
singles and would love to see maybe some
pallets put out with this kind of
formula going on if I could put in my
request that's what I'd say a product
I've consistently not liked from the
line has been the mascaras but all in
all as I look at kind of everything that
I've been using from this line I'm
really pretty impressed they're really
putting out some more bold colorful
options and lips and cheeks than a lot
of brands are from the drugstore so I'm
excited to see where this brand
continues to go but I hope this video
was informative for you and thank you so
much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
