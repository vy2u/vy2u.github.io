me for this mix one brand tutorial
consider it a drug store brand because I
feel like the prices of the products are
similar to what you see in other drug
stores too bad that it's not available
in more drug stores across the board I
wish I could just go to what my
Walgreens and pick this stuff up but I
usually get it at Ulta and in case
you're unfamiliar with my one brand
looks I've go pretty much every other
with high-end and drugstore and I
basically just use all products from one
brand in the looks so you can see what
just those products from just that brand
will produce in a full-face gonna see a
look that I think I would describe as
natural coverage on the face and then an
eye look that's a little more bold but I
mean I could have done so much more with
this eye look but I am going grocery
shopping look at her so I try to keep
all of these looks something wearable
oftentimes I do you know I have other
things going on in my day and I wear
them right out of the house so I wanted
to keep this a look that incorporated
color but was still something that I
felt good about wearing out so hope you
enjoy the work
for starters I'm gonna take my HD studio
photogenic foundation my shade is 0-3
natural it's gonna start roughly you
know patching this around my screen
sunless Tanner's have kind of worn off
so it's just a little dark but we're
gonna make it work and then just kind of
using circular motions I'm gonna blend
all over with my Sigma f80 brush right
up into the hairline always important
with any foundation application I'm
actually a fan of going a little deeper
on the foundation can really perk up the
skin tone starting at the foundation as
opposed to putting on as much bronzer or
a product like that and that's coming
from a news person's perspective when
you're under really really bright lights
and you need something to sort of fight
the washdown effect that those lights
can get next I've got a NYX concealer in
a jar and the shade is light this is
kind of a sort of thick cream concealer
so I'm just going to use my fingers with
I want it to really melt into the skin
so I'm going to be going around my eye
area I'm even kind of doing some
preliminary highlighting by just taking
some of this lighter shade down my nose
and on top of the brows and then I'm
just gonna kind of press it into this
area around my eye where I put it here
and it does kind of what you want it to
do coverage wise I just wish they had a
color that was a little more corrective
instead of just being light like this
once I'm using the stay matte but not
flat it's actually a powder foundation
I'm just gonna lightly dust it on as a
powder this is medium beige I find that
when I swatch this powder like I see a
you know it's not a totally matte finish
it seems kind of matte on the skin but
like in a swatch you see just a little
Sheen to the powder I don't see glitter
or anything like that but it's
interesting I think it has some kind of
oil absorbing qualities to it without
being a totally matte town I'm using
very little powder and just dusting it
everywhere over the concealer to kind of
set that
and I find that it just enhanced the
coverage of everything here with this
look you don't have like an individual
mix bronzer so I'm going to my butt
naked eyes palette where they have some
face products here I'm going to be using
this product which is kind of like I
would say a medium a medium bronze shade
so I'm going to pick up a little bit of
that and just kind of dust that as if to
be a bit of a contour just under the
cheekbone there under the jaw as well
and down the neck also gonna go right
around the hairline that's really
important if you want to do any sort of
bronzing on the forehead it's really got
to start like think about where the Sun
would hit you you know right on top here
and there wouldn't be a line between
your hair and you know your tan it would
just kind of all blend together use this
NYX blush in mocha goes on a little more
sheer than that but I mean it can pack a
punch and it seems to be kind of a matte
blush get that kind of on the outer part
of the apple of my cheek and dust it and
a little bit upward fashion so I'm just
gonna go to the highlight here in the
butt naked eyes palette and it's got a
little shimmer it's kind of what some
people might call a candle light type
highlight so I'm gonna go on top of the
cheekbones with that it doesn't seem too
sparkly which I like down the nose I'm
gonna do a little bit on the Cupid's bow
right here like that I just want to get
really close to show you what we're
talking about coverage wise here I don't
feel like I've got like the fullest
coverage ever but I feel like it's
natural coverage for example I have
freckles on my cheeks and you can see
them through this look there are some
foundations where you wouldn't be able
to do that something you could go out of
the house and not feel like Oh am I
gonna look like it's too thick or too
cakey it does not look cakey at all so I
just wanted to make that known from an
up close perspective
first gonna apply my NYX HD eyeshadow
base just all over the lid here taking
one of the Jumbo pencils and cottage
cheese which is kind of a shimmery white
shade and the primary reason why I'm
using this is to brighten up the tear
duct so I'm just kind of going around it
like that does a beautiful job there and
then onto the lid really light strokes
and then I always dab over these because
they're not like long enough wearing to
just go on their own or anything and if
you get too much you can get crease then
I'm gonna take this pretty blue it has
kind of like a satin almost metallic fit
hold Atlantic and I'm gonna take my flat
eyeshadow brush with some of that tap
off the excess because you can't a
little goes a long way here and I'm
going to block this and the idea here is
to just go all over the lid with this
shale so patting this up through the
crease somewhat next I'm taking a deeper
shade and this really has some shimmer
to it this is called frosted ocean and
so with that deeper more like a shimmery
navy blue I'm gonna get that on the same
brush and Pat this on the outer part of
the line you might say well this is a
technique I see you use often and the
reason why is because it looks the best
when I just feel like when the color
fades to a deeper shade in the outer
corner there's just something about that
that's appealing to me I like the look
so that's why I do it and then I'm gonna
pull the shadow up and I'm gonna take a
fluffy brush it's bare and I'm just
gonna blend out the edge of these colors
then I'm gonna move on to a highlight
shade called Aloha one of my favorite
light colors here I'm gonna take a small
brush we're gonna top off remember we
put that cream pencil there so we're
gonna top that off and then kind of
carry that over so we're slightly
overlapping the blue so we're gonna look
like we're going from the lightest blue
to Diamond take this all the way under
pretty much on
lower lashline here may need to clean
off your crease brush a little bit take
a little bit of a loja and dust that
right under the brow I'm gonna go to a
shade I love it's called burgundy pearl
one of my first NYX shades and I
continue to love it to this day so just
get a little bit on the tip of your
brush and get ready for a gorgeous pink
blend here right from the blue to the
pink it warms up a look that would have
otherwise been a very just cool blue
look but we've popped the liner's I'm
going to be using the NYX slide-on liner
in jet black I'm gonna be using this on
the upper lash line and just take that
all the way across you can see these go
on with little to no effort I am just
gonna kind of extend the line just a bit
just like that at the outer edge can you
tell I'm having fun with this look yet
we're gonna go in with some blue this
shade is called sunrise blue and this is
gonna go on the inner rim and this will
be the extent of our lower liner and I
love this on the inner rim because you
can tell it's blue there I love that
it's gonna make the whites of your eyes
look even brighter and then I'm going
just on top of the black just drawing it
on top and it's just gonna intensify the
blue look we've got going so I'm gonna
curl the lashes and the mascara I have
is called lai frou-frou I'm at volume
and length so I haven't had this for
long I got this really especially for
this tutorial
um so really this is kind of like
priming the lashes for some false
eyelashes so I put this on I'm going to
be using some NYX false eyelashes and
these are number 119 the style is called
gorgeous and I've really trimmed these
up but they were just really long for my
eye for some reason I don't usually have
to trim trim down false eyelashes but
I'm just gonna put some Revlon precision
lash glue all along the ban just gonna
pop these right on the lash line here
and
secure it at the outside the inside for
lips we're gonna go with a nice pink lip
I'm using this mega shine lip gloss in
beige funny how it's called beige huh
and I have a blog actually a recent blog
post I did with my top 5 NYX mega shine
lip glosses cuz you know I love this
formula so much so you can check that
out for some faking one of the Jumbo lip
pencils this is a narcissist or Narcisse
it's a nice dark berry color I'm almost
like lining the lips um I'm gonna keep
it a little lighter on the inner part
and I'm just gonna dab a little bit of
the lip gloss again right in the center
now I just want to sort of recap for you
what I thought of all these products
because you saw them in action but you
didn't necessarily get a review so
here's the little review section
starting off with the HD studio
photogenic foundation I show you in that
close-up look you could see that this is
not what I would consider a full
coverage foundation but I would call it
natural coverage kind of like media if
your purpose for foundation is to cover
up a lot of freckles sunspots extreme
blotchiness in your coloration this may
not be enough for you if you've got
pretty even skin overall and you want
something to just enhance that a little
bit I really like this foundation I feel
like I would compare it a little bit too
Revlon Photoready except I don't notice
all the sparkle going on in this which I
really love sealer mix concealer in a
jar I like this stuff I wish they came
out with just a salmon tone that would
be a little more corrective for those
blue tone under-eye circles but the
coverage is really good I think the key
is to not use too much because I can see
this kind of building up in fine lines
because it does have that thickness to
stay matte but not flat powder
foundation this is pretty cool and I
haven't used it purely as a powder
foundation I've used it as sort of a
topper or setting type powder for the
foundation and I love the finish
it gives and I think it's responsible
for a lot of the overall finish you're
seeing here that is just not completely
met but it is coverage so it's
interesting I probably couldn't point
out a lot of powders like this that
managed to do what this does without the
flecks of glitter it gets kind of a nice
description on the title of this powder
stay matte but not flat and the bronzer
and the highlight that I used were out
of my butt naked eyes palette so I'm
sorry I can't tell you exactly yea these
don't these haven't been named
specifically but I used this bronzer
which seems to have a pretty pretty much
a matte finish and then I used this
highlight which is kind of like one of
those nice candle lit glow type
highlights and I like him a lot I really
like that bronzer and I hadn't delved
into that one too much until now and I
like the finish it gives very natural
good for a medium tone medium skin tone
person and the highlights nice as well I
use that pretty sparingly though with
this look blush there's a lot of good
blushes actually in this palette but I
love this one it's called mocha it just
looks like a wonderful pink it's matte
it gives just the perfect look to
coordinate the lips and the eyes with
what I did today so I love that love the
NYX HD eye primer neutralizes
discoloration on the lid helps
everything last longer don't use too
much blended all the way up through the
crease and I think you're gonna like
what that does the Jumbo pencils are
nice for a color enhancing purpose in
other words they give you that base that
your shadow can really stick to and pop
off of but in terms of wearing these
alone I could not do it I mean these are
gonna crease a lot if you just wear them
on their own so I definitely have to top
it with powder but when I do I mean I
love the effect and I love the effect
that this one in cottage-cheese gave
right around the inner Queen shadows
talked about one of the strengths of the
brand I mean I just love these shadows I
like the ones that come in sort of the
the little palettes or the bigger
palettes the but naked eyes palette you
know different ones I just really like
the eyeshadows from they love that deep
blue called frosted ocean that we used
on the outer core
always been a huge fan of this burgundy
pearl shade
I love Aloha for being that little
spotlight color where you want to
highlight key areas so and this blue in
Atlantic that we use for our primary
blue on the lid is really gorgeous too
so I cannot complain about those shadows
one thing to be aware of is when you put
your brush into him a lots gonna get on
there so you always suggest tapping with
these shadows it's gonna decrease the
amount of Fallout you have and it's
gonna just make it more buildable on the
eye hose too getting too much on all at
once
I love the slide on liners amazing color
variety like you're gonna find colors
just like you will with the Urban Decay
24/7 liners so like in this look I had
an awesome blue that's really popping in
the waterline and a great black called
jet black so I would really suggest
looking into those for something that's
gonna go on effortlessly and in just you
know a matter of seconds it's going to
set for you and not move not so much
impressed by this particular mascara and
NYX mascaras are something I just not
have not gotten into I mean I haven't
tried any except for this so Leigh
frou-frou I love the name but I just
this didn't do much for my lashes the
false lashes I'm also kind of on the
fence about because while I like what I
trimmed these into I I feel like the
band is very stiff and it makes it kind
of hard to sort of work with them and I
wish it was just a little more flexible
so I could get it exactly where I wanted
it on my lash line I just struggled a
little bit more with like placing these
on products a couple of my favorite
things from the brand love the jumbo lip
pencils just great color and the mega
shine glosses you know how I feel about
these these are fantastic they feel good
they come in a huge color range and the
color range is something great about
this brand as a whole if you want a
certain lip color lip gloss I mean it's
there in this brand they also have a
great line of lipsticks which I didn't
use in this video but they're called
round lipsticks and they have limitless
color selection there too so basically
what I want to get at here is that I
love the NYX shadows and liners I love
the NYX lip products blush
and things like that I really like to so
the color cosmetics are great and
something I'm just now I feel like
getting into are the face products like
this foundation like this powder I think
they're good for getting a natural look
on the skin without going too overboard
for some people that's exactly what you
want for some people who need more
coverage for certain reasons that's not
what you want you know you want
something a little bit more staying
power wise I'm happy with these two for
me and I don't have overly oily skin
especially this time of year in the
summer I may have to try these again and
then report back as to how well this
held up when I get a little more oily in
the t-zone I hope you learned a few
things in this tutorial about what it
will look like if you just use NYX
products and you didn't grab any other
favorites in your in your collection but
just stuck to one brand and just see
what the look will give let me know what
other one brand looks you'd like to see
I mean this one was largely a requested
look so many people wanted to see NYX
but let me know what brand you want I
alternate between high-end and
so see that later fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
