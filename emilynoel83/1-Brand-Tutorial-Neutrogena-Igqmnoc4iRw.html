brand tutorial if you're new to my
channel one brand tutorials are
basically when I use just one brand to
do a full face makeup look so it's the
step by step you know putting on the
products but also some little reviews at
the end so the point is to just kind of
inform you all about a certain brand
show you basically the look that all
those products can create without
throwing anything else in and with the
whole Neutrogena cosmetics brand I think
sort of their image is light fresh
natural looking makeup if you ever see
ads or if you check out their website
you know it's just a very light and kind
of natural I notice some kind of theme
like that with a brand I also try to
work that into the one brand tutorial as
what so here's the look and then we'll
get to some quick reviews at the end I'm
starting out with my Neutrogena Healthy
Skin liquid makeup I have it in the
shade natural beige this has a SPF 20 in
it and it claims to have an exclusive
blend of antioxidants so this is one of
those foundations that claims to be
really good for your skin so I first
just like to dab it around on my face
just kind of roughly and then I'm using
my Sigma f80 brush just to get that all
buffed into my skin this is definitely a
lightweight foundation I mean it feels
very liquidy like a medium coverage
foundation it can be built up a little
bit if you want to not looking overly
shiny or dewy but yet it just does look
very natural because this is not a thick
foundation step we're going to do a
little brightening I've got the healthy
skin brightening eye Perfector that's
again has SPF 25 you'll notice a lot of
Neutrogena 's products are loaded with
SPF and I have this in the shade light
so this is one of those click up pin
type price generally just dab it off
onto my finger and then dot it where I
need it like around my eyes and because
this shade is just a little bit lighter
than my skin tone
I'll use this elsewhere on the face
where I just want to highlight a little
bit so kind of down the nose and a
little bit up here center of the
eyebrows forehead area a little bit onto
the upper lip and chin using my p80
brush from sigma and just blending this
in around the eyes and I kind of took a
little bit of a triangle triangular
shape like that just to take it up even
further up onto the cheekbone what went
down the nose here and I liked that this
concealer actually has a bit of a peachy
tone to it I don't think this is the
most full coverage concealer out there
that I've tried but I mean brightening
wise I think it does what it says it
will do and I don't have the darkest
circles ever going on but if you've got
really dark circles and you've already
got a concealer that you feel like
tackles those well this can be a nice
lightweight sort of finishing touch just
to brighten the face and you can use it
like I did and highlight elsewhere on
your face not just the under eye I
usually feel like my under eye looks
most perfected when it's a little bit
mattified so I'm going to use this
Neutrogena shine control powder so this
claims to be a translucent powder but I
mean I'm always a little bit skeptical
of that because I feel like if you put
enough of something like this on you can
see that it actually does have color and
it can look a little bit white and that
can easily easily look a little bit
cakey so I go very light with this and
I'm using this tapered highlight brush
here it's getting a little on the brush
and I'm just going to dab over my under
eye here and this is going to also be a
little bit lighter than the powder I'm
putting elsewhere on my face so we want
to maintain that brightness right in
here and I might also just do a little
on the t-zone with this say I have
normal to combo skin so I can use a
little bit of help around the t-zone and
then all over the face i'm using
Neutrogena healthy skin pressed powder
this has SPF 20 that was just like the
foundation did yeah
and this is light to medium in case you
were wondering it does have a little
puff underneath there and a mirror and
this powder had a puff and so I'm just
going to buff some of this powder in
basically outside the under-eye area
where we already have that taken care
you might think well that foundation is
kind of you know lightweight maybe makes
you look a little more glowy as the
powder the same way I feel like it's
just a basic matte pressed powder I like
it but it's just it's not like a glowy
thing then for a little color on the
face I'm using the healthy skin custom
glow blush and bronzer and this is in
Posey glow it's kind of a glowy pink
blush and then a really golden bronzer I
wouldn't use this as like a real
contouring bronzer because it just isn't
quite deep enough and it just has a lot
of shimmer do I want more of a peachy
look on my cheeks I can blend across the
to the bronze will mix with the pink and
end up looking a little more peach gonna
go first off for now into the bronzer
side and pick up a little bit of that
and knowing I'm not really contouring
here I'm just applying a little bit of
this to my hairline where the Sun would
naturally hit just to give me a little
extra color it's not going to give me a
lot this is very light but I do just
want a little color up there and I'm
just going to really lightly dust this
over the rest of the face - just to perk
up my skintone and I'm going to go into
this blush and this is a really pretty
blush I like this a lot and I'm going to
apply this to the outer part of the
apple of my cheek and I just like to
sweep that upward really pretty just
adds a little bit of glow but it's not
too much for the eyes i'm using this
crease proof eye shadow and this is the
only like eyeshadow type product i'm
using the shade is lasting taupe and
they don't have just powder eyeshadows
anymore they've pretty much phase those
out of their lines so this is the eye
shadow option from Neutrogena so it's a
stick like this you don't sharpen it it
has this kind of a look to it just a
little bit of shimmery finish and so I'm
going to apply that straight from the
stick on
my lid here and it's kind of dry feeling
I mean it just doesn't have a super like
creamy glide on kind of feel it's
tugging a little bit at my skin as I
draw that on I'm pulling it up into my
crease a little bit and then I'm just
going to smudge that out with my finger
taking this underneath too a bit it's
even kind of tricky to just blend it out
with your finger you know it's just kind
of a blush and I'm taking my nourishing
eyeliner in cosmic black and these
liners are okay I mean there are some
liners out there even drugstore prices
that are going to glide on more smoothly
than these do and last longer and these
plan to have some good ingredients and
if they claim to have olive oil in it
shea butters I've lined across my upper
lash line and I'm going to take a little
bit under the outer part of my lower
lash line too and then it does have a
smudge tip so I'm going to just soften a
bit and definitely flush out this bottom
part and I'm going to curl my lashes and
I'm going to be using the Neutrogena
healthy lengths mascara and this is in
carbon black and this is a traditional
brush mascara here I'm going to get off
a little bit of the excess product
really like this style of brush I feel
like it does well for you know making
each lash stand out and preventing them
from all sticking together this says I'm
looking on the website it has vitamin E
and olive oil in the formula so it's
really supposed to strengthen the lashes
so I love that concept and I actually
kind of like the lengthening that this
using this in the past I have had a
little bit of an issue on my lower lash
line so I'm going to stay away from
using this on my lower lashes right now
but just be aware I had a little
smudging underneath the eye so I'm going
to keep this to my upper lashes today
and on my lips I'm going to use a couple
different products first off the
moisture smooth color stick this is in
sweet watermelon I've used this a lot
I'm going to mainly have this right here
on the center of the lower lip I think
this is a beautiful pin it smells so
good these color sticks just are awesome
and then I'm using a newer one that I've
picked up recently it's in bright berry
incredibly smooth these were an Emily
Award winner just so comfortable and as
you can see I'm not really overlapping
that lighter shade I'm leaving that
there and just kind of blending over to
it okay so Neutrogena won brand look
what do we think as I look at myself in
the mirror right now I'm pretty happy
with the overall look but we're going to
get down to the Nitty Gritty on these
different products and what we think of
them Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup I've been a fan of this
particular foundation for a while I
think it's got you know good ingredients
in it it's got that SPF 20 it goes on
very smoothly it's easy to blend and if
what you want is that really lightweight
feel for your foundation I think this
would be a good one to try ever I wear a
foundation I really pay attention is it
breaking down in the t-zone is it
looking you know less fresh as the day
goes on and I will say I noticed that
with this this is not probably my
ultimate foundation for staying power
can it be remedied with a little extra
pressed powder or my Malley face
defender or something - you know blot it
up yes think my skin type might be prone
to making it not look so fresh my days
in but maybe if you've got skin that
just doesn't tend to get very oily this
would be even better for you but again
lightweight pretty I do like that
foundation is brightening eye Perfector
I actually enjoyed this as well I have
it in the shade light and as I mentioned
I feel like this actually has kind of a
peachy tone to it which is really the
perfect kind of shade for counteracting
those blue tones circle however this is
a brightening product not an intense
coverage prod I think it has its place
and I think it worked well you know
going here on top of the cheeks down the
nose and kind of working as a you know
brightener highlighter type product in
the makeup Rudy shine control powder
okay this is something I've used in the
past it says with rice protein complex
it claims to be invisible and look you
know
it's not invisible that can show on your
skin so I think if you are going to use
this you know I used it very lightly I
used a little bit on the under eye a
little bit on the t-zone and leave it at
that it helps me stay shine free I'd say
throughout a good portion of the day
maybe half the day it depends on my
activity level but chances are this is
something I'm going to need to reapply
and touch up with later
Neutrogena healthy skin pressed powder I
like this powder and I've used this on
days when I've just used concealer and a
little bit of powder I think it works
well I like it better than L'Oreal True
Match it may not have quite the creamy
um high-end silky feel that like L'Oreal
True Match or the Revlon nearly naked
have a - from the drugstore that I feel
like have an extra silky smooth non
powdery feel for being a powder it's
weird to say but this is a little more
powdery maybe a little more on the
mattifying side but I still I do like
lash and bronzer basically don't rely on
this as a contouring bronzer but if you
just want a little glow it's beautiful
if you use them both together or just
use the blush really happy with the way
that blush came off I think this has
been in a favorites video best in beauty
video recently so love that a Neutrogena
crease proof eye shadow this is the part
of the look where I'm like uh it just it
wasn't very easy to blend I mean my eye
look is maybe not as blended in some
areas as I would like it to be and it
wasn't especially easy to blend it was a
little bit dry feeling the color of this
is you know it's taupe and tilt can be
pretty but it just comes off kind of
blah on my little it feels kind of dry
now this is going to be more likely than
a powder shadow later on in the day to
feel just a little bit tacky I'm not
saying it totally fades away on me feel
a little bit tacky to the touch that
happens to me sometimes with this and
keep in mind we have not put a primer on
it we have not topped it with shadows so
better than a lot of cream shadows for
staying power but not necessarily better
than like the Maybelline Color tattoos
for me and definitely not as pretty
these nourishing eyeliners are kind of
in the middle of the road for me on the
spectrum of drugstore liners there are
some that go on more smoothly with
better staying
our think about next slide on liners and
Maybelline master drama it's kind of in
the middle because there are some liners
that are even more difficult to put on
than this and don't last as well as this
but I like that it's retractable I like
that it has this both a smudge tip and a
little sharpener in the bottom depending
on activity level I mean you may see
some fading with this I've never had
big-time smudging with it even if I do
use it under my eye don't get me wrong I
don't dislike these eyeliners and I use
them from time to time I've got a pretty
blue and a brown as well if it's a day
we're staying power is your utmost goal
this may not be the perfect one to pick
healthy lengths mascara can surprised me
I think I'd used a Neutrogena mascara
years ago and wasn't that impressed this
I actually felt like built up some
length it didn't do a whole lot of
clumping my lashes together I like that
it's got good for your lashes
ingredients in there that makes me feel
good and I really like the brush can't
give it a total two thumbs up if it's
something I'm scared to put on my lower
lashes because of smudging Neutrogena
lip products can do no wrong in my book
I tell you I love these jumbo color
sticks I've got the sweet watermelon on
I've got the bright berry other ones
I've talked about in the past the rich
raisin is a really pretty
deeper tone shade fresh papaya there's
your great summer quarterly shade I
think they're all just wonderful they
smell great they're comfortable on the
lips when I went to North Dakota in the
winter and I experienced the coldest
temperatures my body has ever endured I
mean we're talking my nostrils were
freezing up this was the only stuff I
used on my lips and I never had chapped
lips
I swear that whole trip they never felt
dry because I was using these it was
like 20 below I was freezing
North Dakota is not for sissies that's
what I say in just a couple other great
lip products that I didn't use here but
I love are the moisture shine gloss and
the revitalizing lip balm these are
tinted lip balms look like that I love
these
I think these products are fabulous
great textures great feel on the lips
wonderful colors things are nicely
pigmented I mean check out the
Neutrogena lip product it's lip products
are number one for me from this
face stuff is number two and the eye
products are definitely third place so
that's my wrap-up on Neutrogena makeup
everyone feel free to let me know what
one brand tutorial you want to see next
in the comment section next one will be
high-end since this was drugstore so
keep that in mind and thanks for
watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
