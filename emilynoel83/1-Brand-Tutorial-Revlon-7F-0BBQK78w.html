brand tutorial this has been one of the
most requested and I can't believe I
actually haven't done it until now but
there were actually a few products I had
to pick up for this so you're gonna see
some new things in this video
demonstrated and if you're new to these
videos that I do basically I go every
other with drugstore and high-end for
example the last one I did with Estee
Lauder with a look that was very
different from this one
but I just used one brands products in a
full face tutorial so I demonstrate how
they work and then at the end I sort of
recap you know my little reviews of
everything this Revlon look I just kind
of let the season guide me as far as
what I chose to do here it's really
light it's very simple I chose more of
the lightweight foundation products from
this brand or at the eyeshadow you know
it's very basic use of just a simple you
know Revlon eyeshadow quad there's
nothing intricate about it there's
nothing overly dark about it but it
still has some definition and then with
the lips you know just that pop of pink
I thought it would look nice with this
shirt I'm a big fan of like teal or
seafoam green and then pink alongside I
also want to point out that in the
infobox below I have links to every one
brand tutorial that I've done I also
have a playlist where you can easily get
to all of them
but check that out first and if you see
one that I haven't done you want to
request it definitely request the brand
you want to see in the comment section
so here's the look first I'm gonna use
my nearly naked foundation I have it in
the shade nude I just kind of dot that
roughly all over my face and then I'm
using my Sigma f80 brush giving me you
know kind of a medium coverage quite
enough coverage to you know do away with
under-eye circles and stuff like that
but it's definitely something that kind
of makes you just look a little bit more
radiant perks up the skin gives it back
a little bit of a glow without seeming
shimmery or anything next I'm using
photo-ready stick concealer in light
medium and this is a really good
concealer just coverage wise and I'm
gonna use this around my eye area also a
little bit around my nose and then I'm
using my P ad so this is just like the
smaller baby version of the one that I
used for my foundation all over my face
from Sigma feel like it applies too much
pressure but you get a very even blend
on whatever concealer product you're
using so this does really well for
blending out that stick concealer so
there you can see we've got pretty good
coverage considering it was a
lightweight foundation and then a
concealer that did a little bit more for
us and then over the top of that I'm
using my Revlon nearly naked pressed
powder a really nice texture on this
powder very unpowered or like if that
makes sense I kind of like to blot it
around areas where I've concealed if I'm
just you know going over this real quick
and using my brush I sort of blot over
concealed areas and then blend a little
bit more around the rest of the face and
you know the hairline the jaw I would
say if anything it just adds a little
bit of coverage and a little bit of a
mattified appearance to my face but it's
not chalky cakey dry see my next step is
bronzer this is the Revlon Photoready
bronzer and the one shade it comes in is
bronzed and chic and can you tell I like
this stuff it's a 100% matte bronzer but
it does incorporate four different shape
anything on how dark your skin is you
know this could be contouring for you or
this could there aren't a lot of you
know fantastic matte drugstore bronzers
like a few others that come to mind
would be the Rimmel natural bronzer and
sunlight NYC sunny but this is the one
that gets a little bit deeper than those
so this would be the best you know
medium to deeper bronze because we're
gonna use the Revlon Photoready cream
blush this shade is called flushed as
you can see it's a pretty vibrant pink
here and I'm going
using my ELF small stipple brush I'm
going to go straight into the product
just like so pick up some of that color
and then I'm gonna stipple this right
onto like the outer part of the apple of
my cheek so just kind of dot it on there
and kind of work upward as well with
blush I mean it's all about how you
apply it a lot of people could see this
and be freaked out and be like no I
could never wear that and I've got so
many blushes that look so intense in the
packaging but I mean if you're applying
them lightly you're just gonna get like
a hue of this color don't be too scared
about different colored blushes because
you can really wear them as just as
sheer as you can apply them you know
with this blush I'm just going with very
light amounts and then kind of building
it up you know I put on my initial
application of it and then I kind of go
back for just a little bit more start
off the I look by kind of cleaning up
the brow just a little bit this is the
Revlon brow fantasy and the shade I have
is brunette and basically this is a
pencil on one end and then a tinted and
kind of brow gel sort of thing but it's
not a gel with a lot of hold to it it's
more just about the tint that it's gonna
give your brow just give a little extra
right here in the front of the brow
Tadmor at the end also I really don't
love the way that pencil went on it just
it seems too thick a little bit like out
of control I guess compared to you know
the angled liner brushes that you might
use with the powder I feel like I have a
lot of control with that this seems just
a little too thick and a little too warm
in color so if you're like me you've got
really dark brown hair this might come
off with just like a little too much red
in it but I am gonna use this gel color
stay smoky shadow stick the shade is
smolder it's got kind of a really really
light blue and a dark teal on it and I'm
gonna use both ends of that first the
light end and this is gonna act like you
know just a colored base basically for
the shadow I use so I'm just gonna use
the light and over most of the inner
part of the eye you can see the darker
end just has a little bit more of a
point to it
using that on the outer part of my lid
here I just kind of blend the two
together a little bit with your finger
and I'm gonna go under the eye just a
hair with that also then I'm using this
Colorstay quad and the shade is called
enchanted it has a light pink kind of a
grey deep green and a light sort of
taupe color and I'm gonna use the pink
first I'm just gonna use the sponge tip
because I feel like that does give me
just the most impact here so I'm going
right around the inner corner to
brighten that up and pulling up just a
little bit on to the upper lid then i'm
gonna take this medium shade right down
here and just overlap that a bit and
then i'm picking up some of this dark
green that i'm going just on the
outermost corner here and the stick
that's underneath is really helping
these shadows to pop a little bit more
than they do otherwise I'm taking this
gray with um kind of a fluffy crease
brush and with that I'm gonna start in
the inner most part of the crease here
and just lightly get some of that color
there then I'm going to the dark green
and I work into the outer most part of
the crease I'm not really doing a bold
like outer V thing but I'm just blending
that into the outer part of the crease
and kind of overlap a little bit with
the gray and then I'm taking just a
little bit of that pink again and going
right up under the brow I'm using the
Revlon Colorstay this is the cream gel
liner and it does come up in the top
here with a little brush I don't
particularly like this brush it's just
kind of a flat small brush and I don't
know I just feel like it takes me a long
time to apply it with that so I'm gonna
use my Real Techniques this is the fine
liner brush yeah and you can see it's
just more of that pointed tip style I'm
just gonna go from the inner to outer
corner something about this liner it
seems a little more
wry than some of the other cream and gel
formula now this does seem to have good
staying power for me and I don't feel
like it it fades you know throughout the
day but it just doesn't have that same
you know smooth like one swipe across
the eye kind of effect I'm taking this
Colorstay pencil liner and the shade is
teal and I'm gonna use that just a
little bit it reminds me of like the
dark green shade really in the quad we
used and I'm gonna just sort of make
that meet up with the outer end of the
black and this does not glide on like a
lot of the newer creamier liners do
these days just gonna go about halfway
in with that then with a pencil brush
I'm just gonna go back to this deepest
color over at the top of that teal it's
gonna give us a very softened look on
the lower lash line and then taking a
little bit of like that medium taupe
color that was in there and blending
that the rest of the way I'm going to
curl my lashes then I'm using this
photo-ready 3d volume mascara it's got a
lot of bristles kind of actually long
bristles there and then some right
around the tip as well don't see any
clumps with this but what I tend to have
happen with me with this after you know
just a little bit after I apply it I
feel like the lashes kind of fall and
it's not an instantaneous thing this
doesn't seem especially heavy on my
lashes so it seems kind of weird that
they would be so weighed down but it's
like they just can't really keep the
curl with this one and that's not cool
I'm gonna put a little bit on the lower
part and I really don't hardly want to
do this but because I know that it does
smudge just a little bit on me as the
day goes on this is the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stain and the shade
is cherish and it's a really pretty pink
I don't think I've talked a lot about
this shade but it has a beautiful look
and that's giving the lips you know a
little bit of moisture
not a ton not as much as some of the
other sticks you might find out there in
the drugstore II use my Revlon gloss and
foiled over the top of this just to give
it even more of a shine here I'm gonna
use it primarily right in the center of
my lower lip that's my little trick for
full lips and just really lightly
everywhere else along the lips alright
that's it nothing too tricky there just
my little reviews on everything first
off the nearly naked foundation I do
have a full review video demonstration I
mean very in-depth on this nearly naked
foundation and the powder but I feel
like for this time of year you know I
wanted to keep that in mind you know I'm
doing this as we head into spring and I
wanted to use this more lightweight
foundation now that doesn't mean this
doesn't have any coverage I would call
it medium coverage and wear this for a
whole day and not touch it up at all and
it really doesn't look that bad I mean I
do enjoy you know having the powder to
set this with I think this adds a little
bit of coverage to the foundation and I
think it kind of keeps the skin a little
bit more matte without looking chalky
and as I look at my skin I feel like you
know I can still see some freckles
through there
it still looks very skin-like but it
looks much more even than it was before
I used you know the foundation of the
powder and the concealer is huge I mean
I love this photo-ready concealer I like
how creamy it is it's really not like
stick concealers of the old days when
they was all seemed very dry and seemed
to all give off like way too much
product when you would go under your
eyes or something like that this is a
little bit thinner but it still has
really good coverage in this light
medium shade if your skin tone is like
mine this is a wonderful match for me
and it you know conceals spots or
circles very very well something in the
from the drugstore that has just a bit
more moisture than this would be the
covergirl plus Olay concealer stick but
coverage wise they're pretty darn close
to one another they both work really
well we my favorite drugstore bronzer is
the Revlon Photoready Bronston cheek it
incorporates four different times like
it's great for contouring you can kind
of work from the top part if you just
want a little added glow to your skin
and by glow I just mean like a little
bit of a color boost not a shimmery
glows so it's very natural looking I
would totally recommend this and it's
actually pretty impressed with this
Revlon Photoready blush I've been
wearing this on and off kind of
experimenting with the staying power and
the Saint hours actually been pretty
good for me even not setting it with a
powder which I didn't with this look but
the shade is called flush should apply
it with your fingers if you want to and
you could get even more intensity than
we got using that stippling brush but
I'm just more comfortable with the
stippling brush because when you use it
you don't really mess with the
underneath layers of your makeup so
let's talk about this smoky shadow stick
I have mentioned this in another review
video on Revlon products so we got this
that we used and we also use this
Colorstay quad and enchanted I like the
colors on all of these I think you know
these are pretty shadow colors put
together I love dark green I'm liking it
more and more the more I use it but
these two products are better together
than they are apart your this on its own
I feel like the color fades a lot it
doesn't crease a whole bunch on me but I
feel like the color just doesn't have
the same intensity from you know the
start of the day to the end of the day
it doesn't maintain you use this as a
base it can really function to pump up
these powder shadows quite a bit more
here are some swatches of those powder
shadows just as is with no base and you
can see they're pretty sheer you know
they're not like a wet and wild or you
know a mix or something like I remember
when I thought Revlon Colorstay pencils
we're God's gift to eyeliner back in the
day and then over time like so many
brands I'm thinking Maybelline master
drama I'm thinking NYX slide on liners
even drugstore brands you know if come
out with liners that not only have
wonderful staying power but they glide
on like buttah and this one is just
really not as easy to put on I mean the
color can be nice but I'm pressing so
hard on my hand to get that kind of a
look gonna last for me I know the
staying power is good but it's hard to
get the most out of it without pressing
really hard and you don't want to do
that on your something
new to me now is the color state cream
liners I feel it's not as creamy as like
the Physicians Formula cream gel liner
the L'Oreal infallible I can't complain
about the staying power with this and it
does it is very rich in black it's matte
you know it has the desired impact that
I want from something like this but I
felt like it was just like I kept having
to go back to the product to get a
creamy enough line to go across you know
just a couple centimeters and then back
for more you know so I wouldn't go back
and repurchase that I'm a big fan of the
brow fantasy I'm not sure if there's
another shade deeper from this one
called brunette but this is just a
little too reddish a little too warm for
my hair and my brows I'm just not wild
about that kind of pencil thing I'm more
into like my ELF studio brow kit or the
Anastasia brow Revlon Photoready mascara
let's say I have a I've had a love-hate
relationship with Revlon mascaras but
really it's just been a hate
relationship I don't like hardly any of
them and I really wouldn't recommend
this one either I mean I felt like it
did a good job of not clumping the
lashes it did give me some added length
but for some strange reason I felt like
it practically removed the curl from
them and I did go back secret I went
back and ivory curled up just a little
bit but I mean I don't want to have to
do that Revlon I think is awesome
awesome with lip products and I mean if
I were to tell you what are my favorite
kinds of Revlon lip products I actually
have a video all about that topic but I
would say the lip butters are great the
Super Lustrous lip glosses and the Super
Lustrous lipsticks actually that's a
huge line of lipstick and I mean they
have so many amazing colors that are as
these just bitten kissable balm stains
these are gonna be a little more hit and
miss depending on what you expect out of
these if you really want the stain which
you should be able to expect that cuz
it's in the name right I feel like the
deeper shades and the brighter shades
give off a little bit more of a stain
than say
shades this light and lighter so that's
just the way it is with these I do love
the color that these give off regardless
of whether they're gonna stain my lips
term I mean I like the way they give off
color and I do like the little bit of
shine that they have this I think looked
beautiful
even before I put the gloss on so I
think this is a really pretty springy
pink color and you guys know I love my
Revlon foiled this is the Super Lustrous
lip gloss and foiled this is what I
always like to have around just to give
any any lip product just a little more
pop and give your lips the look of a
little more full really cannot complain
about the Revlon lip products I have so
many I love if you haven't investigated
a lot of drugstore lip products check
out Revlon's the eye products
particularly what I used in this look I
mean I'm not upset with the look that I
ended up with but the individual
products I don't think are that awesome
like they're definitely not the
strengths of everything I've used I
really like the face products I like the
nearly naked stuff the photo-ready
concealer is great also like that new
cream blush and I really like the
Bronston cheek bronzer as well as the
stairs you in the right direction if
you're looking to try some new stuff
from Revlon don't forget to request what
brand you want to see next in a one
brand tutorial and thanks for watching
right
