using only Rimmel products so the reason
why I do these videos is because I think
it's important to see exactly how the
products and a certain brand function
without throwing in anything extra or
any you know longtime favorite product
from this brand or that brand that can
kind of cover up what this one brand can
do so yeah I've gone kind of every other
in terms of high-end and drug stores so
I started with Tarte then did elf then
Mac and now Rimmel so definitely let me
know what brands you want to see in
these videos I've kind of been going off
of what a lot of people have been asking
so then I get to see how I got this
smokey eye that just really has that
effortless look to it instead of being
an eye that just looks like oh it's it's
just so super precise and every little
bit has been slaved over definitely that
sexy smudgy smokey eye that you can get
really really easily so to start out I
have a primer from Rimmel that I'm going
to use it's the newer primer they have
it's fix and perfect pros actually a
really good primer I enjoy the texture
this leaves on my skin a little better
than the traditional fix and Perfector
the first one that came out it was kind
of peachy tone this is just kind of
cream so I'm gonna be using one of my
favorite foundations it's Rimmel lasting
finish my shade is 200 soft beige I
think if I were to pick a downfall of
this product it would be that there's
just not a huge shade selection so I
think that limits some people but 200
has always been just right for me so I
like this foundation my mom who is in
her 60s enjoys this foundation you like
this lasts a long time but it also stays
looking the same you know how some
foundations almost kind of I don't know
they transform a little but they oxidize
on your skin and as you wear them you
come out with a different color by mid
than what you started with and this
really stays looking the same and if
you're looking for you know the least
cakey appearance possible I don't first
off I don't think this is an especially
cakey foundation but apply it with your
fingers if you're a brush girl you know
apply it with your fingers because it
really does kind of help it melt into
the skin better and if you notice any
areas that don't look natural just kind
of press around them next I'm going to
use a newer concealer that I got from
Rimmel it's the match perfection
two-in-one concealer and highlighter and
so I got it in the shade light it's
number 245 it has a sort of brush too
I'm not dealing with ultra dark circles
which I would like to use a salmon tone
concealer for so this is kind of nice
actually seems like it has a pretty
natural finish which some concealers you
know they come out liquidy but then they
kind of almost I don't want to say
hardened but the appearance does not
look as soft as it did when you first
blended it in and this wears pretty well
throughout the day I have kind of a
sunspot going on right here that's
actually fading a little bit but I mean
it's right in this area and this totally
covered that up
just to have a power from rimmel cult
stay mat but I guess I ran out good as I
am not finding that it so I'm just gonna
go straight to the bronzer step and I'm
using the rimmel it's the natural
bronzer it has a lid like that in this
shade of Sundance this one has a little
sparkle to it
sunlight is relatively matte so I'm just
gonna this is a pretty light bronzer so
I'm just gonna dust this on all over
I've been a fan for of this bronzer for
a long time both shades that I mentioned
reminds me a lot in tone of NYC sunny so
I like both of those and it's just kind
of a matter of what you have access to
not everyone has Rimmel not everyone has
NYC so if you can get one of the two
you're in pretty good shape for a light
natural-looking bronzer next for blush
I'm using the blush that I absolutely
love and this is the lasting finish
blush and autumn catwalk and as you can
see it's actually a blush but it's also
a highlight focus the colorful side of
this but I'm just gonna start blending
that right here kind of high on the
cheek for a really natural blush look it
gets pigmented enough to stand out on
even darker skin tones focus my brush
there on the outside and sort of run
this just on top of the cheekbone for a
little highlighted effect great
money-saving product too because you're
getting two functions in one here
all right for the eyes as you can see if
you look at this eye even where it's
sort of a black color there's a little
Sheen coming through and so we're gonna
do a little layering to make that look
happen I'm using the glam eyes just
single shadow in backstage so this is a
shimmery shade kind of along the lines
of Mac satin taupe so I'm just going to
take a flat brush and really blot that
all over the eyelid here really
concentrating it mainly right around the
corner in fact kind of go see how you
could just kind of blot a brush like
this right here and pick up all around
the tear duct if you don't have a tiny
brush next I'm using the single in jet
black and this isn't quite as scary as
it looks it's not the blackest black
shadow I've ever used which can make it
a little more wearable and it doesn't
have a bunch of fallout either so I do
like that about these shadows and I'm
just gonna take a flat brush and pick up
some of the cross and a flat brush it's
just gonna give me a little more control
of where this shadow goes and as you can
see we're just overlapping we're getting
a black with some dimension and it just
looks like a pretty shimmery black then
you can take it kind of up to the crease
as well finish blending that out in a
second first I'm going to take a pencil
brush with the black and we're just
gonna take this right under the eye so
lower lash line smudge this all the way
fight philosophy on smokey eyes I think
it's kind of evolved over time and I
really think they should have kind of an
effortless look to them not that they've
been slaved over and just really precise
but they should look just kind of smudgy
and just like you know BAM there's a
girl with great eyes not look at how
much work she did to get her eyeshadow
on there so as you can see I'm just
taking the pencil brush and using that
as a means to blend the lower lash line
with a little bit of an outer V type
thing we're just kind of bringing the
shape out just a bit then we're gonna
turn to some brown shadow which can be a
great way to blend out the edge of
something that is
black or charcoal or gray because you
might not think of it at first but it
actually is you know kind of your segue
from black to skin you know what I mean
so it makes it just a little more
wearable so there is just a bit of
fallout for some reason with this matte
brown shade called dusk but I'm gonna
pick some of that up and just kind of go
over the border here of your black and
you're gonna notice you know it just
looks a little more natural up against
just the bare skin right above and then
I'm taking my pencil brush with a little
more that Brown and we're just gonna go
not taking it too far down but almost
overlapping the black it's gonna soften
it a little bit I don't have a good
shade that works is you know a wonderful
highlight here so I'm actually gonna go
back to the blush to the highlight
that's in the blush which is just a
light pink it just kind of finishes the
look rather than being a bold you know
white highlight eyeliner I'm gonna be
using the soft Kohl eyeliner and the
shade is jet black so we're gonna go to
the waterline with this so just kind of
gently I mean I'm not even really
pulling down I'm just pulling it back
from the eyeball just a bit and I find
once I do this and when I'm working with
really black kind of you know smoky
tones on the eye the brown in my eye
instantly comes out here and then we're
gonna just I'm kind of smudging it then
right between the lashes then we're
gonna take this across the upper lash
line again the shadow is already dark
but it's nice to kind of really get this
in there with the lashes
so I'm gonna curl my lashes I'm using a
mascara called glam eyes lash flirt
volume and lift mascara looks like this
and it's a rubber brush that actually
has some sort of excuse me oh man it has
kind of like some little combs built
into it see that so it's gonna hopefully
separate the lashes I find it does an
okay job of giving me some separation
what that sneeze happened before I put
my first coat of mascara on have you
ever had that happen I feel like I have
when I'm just putting on my mascara and
it's like oh why do you have to sneeze
no I'm kind of working the brush like
this with little outward strokes to get
any of those little lashes in the corner
they can be hard to get sometimes for
lips I'm gonna be using a few products
I've got the one thousand kisses stay on
lip liner pencil and it's in natural so
it's a nice lip liner that's pretty much
the tone of my lips and I'm just gonna
line all over and fill in as well next
I'm using the lipstick in dreamy and
this is just a really light shimmery you
think of a peachy nude and for the gloss
love this gloss it's stay glossy in oh
goodness there's no name on here I'll
look it up for you but I love the
texture
alright I hope you guys enjoyed that
tutorial and now I'll just try to
quickly go through some mini reviews on
some of these products just so you know
what I actually think about everything I
use definitely a fan of the new fixin
perfect Pro primer if you're looking for
a great drugstore primer I think that's
a really good one evens out texture
doesn't feel as slippery silky s say a
Smashbox photo-finish
but still gives a really nice smooth
canvas always been a fan of Rimmel
lasting finish so I mean it that is just
a universally great foundation that I
wear on the air in high definition
staying power wise a lot of people want
to know you know how does your look last
after you did this one brand look on
this brand or that brand I can tell you
I wear this foundation often and it
lasts me all day match perfection was
the newer face product to me it's
definitely not your heavy duty conceal
you know the deepest darkest search
generally speaking around the face I
think it works ok I've been a longtime
fan of the natural bronzers so just a
great affordable option and the blush
really impressed me recently I haven't
had this for that long but this blush
and autumn catwalk is universally
beautiful so I love that it incorporates
the highlighter as well as far as Rimmel
eyeshadows go on remember when they used
to be kind of packaged like this was
never a big fan of those I just thought
they weren't very pigmented and it just
took too much work to get the color off
but then they came out with glam eyes
and I have blogged specifically about
these eyeshadows I love these I love
these singles so you know I was really
happy with the way they performed I
liked that they gave me a lot of
pigmentation without having fall outs
last fine with a primer I've actually
never used them without a primer but I
haven't had staying power issues with
these either love these neutral shades I
need to branch out and try some colors
but those are great everyday basic soft
Kohl liner yes it goes on really easily
but this is one thing that does not
quite have the staying power with it
it's definitely going to be a liner if
you put it in your waterline which I did
it will have to be reapplied so not
really an eye liner I would say rush out
and get ass Cara was pretty nice in
terms of giving me some separation it
did
give me like fall slash looking body and
volume and just ba-ba-boom lashes but
again this is just kind of an average
mascara for me this particular lip liner
called natural if you're looking for one
of those lip liners that is the shade of
a general you know the average lip this
is really good it's a great base for a
lip gloss or a great base for a nude lip
the lipstick that I used in dreamy in
general I love the moisture Renu
lipsticks I have a bunch of them not
only in nude shades but in more
colourful shades they work really well
they're not gonna last you the entire
day without having to reapply but I mean
I don't mind that too much they're
pigmented they're rich they're
moisturizing and the stay classy lip
gloss this is an interesting texture of
lip gloss it feels so smooth on the lips
it doesn't feel like it's going to come
outside your lip line and stray I mean
it's not that slick and greasy feeling
but it's just really nice and smooth and
it in a way kind of adheres to your lips
and it does last a decently long time so
this on top of your Rimmel lipstick will
I think increase your staying power but
if you've been eating or kissing or
whatever you know it's not it you're
gonna need to reapply obviously but I
love that color too so much for watching
this video I hope you learned a thing or
two about the brand a big fan of Rimmel
face products
I love the Rimmel lip products as well
and I tell you what they've read they're
really onto something with their new
eyeshadows to the glam eyes singles so
thanks so much for watching guys have an
awesome day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
