brand tutorial featuring one of my
favorite brands and it is the balm I
have tried so many great products from
this line I'm excited to put them all
together demonstrate them in a tutorial
using only products from the balm that's
sort of the premise of a one brand
tutorial I've been doing these for a
while now and I tend to go every other
in terms of high-end and drugstores so
like the last one I did was Revlon this
one's the balm the next one will be
drugstore and let me know in the
comments section what brand you want to
see I will also have listed in the
infobox every one of them I've done
first I'll show you the tutorial then at
the end I'm just kind of an overall
review of the products I use so I've
already moisturized and put on my eye
creams so I'm then going to use my time
balm primer and this contains vitamins A
C and E it also is a primer that
contains dimethicone and that's usually
referred to as like a silicon-based
polymer it's the type of primer that's
gonna like glide on your skin really
easily feels to me a lot like let's say
the Smashbox photo finish primer those
kind of primers are also known for
really you know filling pores filling
wrinkles and fine lines and things like
that use this primer for quite a while
now it's just pretty good for you know
giving your face a really even texture
so your foundation goes on more smoothly
and speaking of foundation what I'm
using is the time balm foundation I have
it in the shade light/medium but I do
like to do is take like a wedge sponge
and a little spray bottle of water and
dampen that sponge and because this is
kind of a thicker cream foundation I
mean it can really be good coverage for
that reason but it can also seem just a
little thick as you apply it so what I
like to do first is just get some and
just roughly patch this over the areas
where I want some coverage so I just do
that with my fingers then I feel like I
tend to get the most natural coverage
when I just take the damp sponge and
just really kind of press it into the
skin you know
it gives it the most natural looking
finish and yet I feel like it still
maintains that nice coverage that this
foundation has there have been some
times that I've used this and just
blended it out with a brush and while I
felt like it was evenly blended it just
still seemed a little too visible to me
on the skin the look of the foundation
there's also a time balm concealer so
just like a little baby version here and
I do feel like maybe it's just me but I
feel like the texture on the concealer
is just a little bit thicker than the
foundation and I'm just getting a little
bit of this on my finger and I have this
in the shade light so it's just a hair
lighter than the foundation I was using
and I'm just going to apply that around
my under eye area a little bit here a
little mark here from an old zit that I
had also a little bit around the redness
that I have around my nose sometimes and
with this I just kind of liked to use
the same method using that sponge that I
got a little bit damp and just really
pressing that concealer right into the
skin I'm just going to do a little
dusting of the sexy mama anti-shine
translucent powder I kind of questioned
whether or not this is totally
translucent I mean if you apply enough I
think color does come through and on
some skin tones this may be a little
light so I just use it really sparingly
if I go for this powder I like using
this smallish brush and then just
dabbing it really just under the eye
area and I feel like it mattifies and
kind of perfects that a little bit more
and then I'll do a little bit on the
t-zone it's going to be a hot one
outside so this just sort of is a little
preventative measure next I'm going to
go to my Bahama Mama bronzer and this is
a matte bronzer and it's probably one of
the darkest ones that I own if not the
darkest very pigmented too so I think if
you're my skin tone a little lighter a
little darker you've got to be pretty
careful with this I'm using the brush
from the balm it's the powder to the
people breath getting a
little bit of the product on there I
like to just sort of roll the brush so I
get the minimal amount and then tap it
off start off kind of around my hairline
here
sometimes when bronzers really get too
dark for your skin tone they can sets
when they can start to look muddy or
just a little bit unnatural so trying to
use this as lightly as I can the hollows
of the cheek you can see that kind of
starting to form there a little bit of a
contour and as always I take it down the
neck as well and then I'm gonna move on
to blush and I'm using the in stain
blush in houndstooth this is a line of
blushes that I have reviewed and
swatched all of them and really gotten
in depth on how these blushes work but
basically they're a powder blush but
they really do have like a staining
effect on the skin a really long wearing
powder and this shade is kind of like a
dusty mauve rose color does have you
know maybe a little bit of a satin
finish whereas most of the blushes in
this line are fairly matte and it only
takes a teeny bit in fact I might have
too much on this brush but I'm just
going to start by swirling that shade on
the outer part of the apple of my cheek
and there are some pretty bright blushes
in this line this one might be one of
the more muted ones then to add a little
bit of a glow I'm using the mary lou
manizer highlight and this is can be a
pretty intense highlight or eye shadow
however you want to use it only takes a
little and you get very like opaque
shimmery color so I'm just going to get
a DAB on my brush
are you sensing a trend with the balm
products a little bit goes a long way
and I'm going to take this right on top
of the cheek cheekbone area here so
really tapping out the brush and just
getting a little bit there I'm going to
go right down the nose and then I'm
going to go right around the Cupid's bow
areas and as I just place it and then
dust over it with a brush for the brows
I'm actually going to be using my neat
matte nude palette and I don't have any
brow products from the balm noir if I
tried any I'm not even sure if they have
one come to think of it but actually
between these two shades
I'm going to get a little tap of this
warmer brown called Matt Rosen and a
little bit of the darker cool Brown
called Matt wood and for that I'm just
going to fill in the brow a little bit I
mean my brows don't need a ton of
filling in to begin with but just kind
of works to help even it out a little
bit and I'm going to use the put a lid
on it i prime a much like the time balm
face primer this eyeprimer really glides
on smoothly one doesn't do as much you
know for color correcting any issues on
your lid like some primers do but it
does really have a smooth feel and I had
used it quite a bit and it does pretty
well staying power wise with Jeff's
thing I'm going to do and I'm using my
crease love and happiness brush I'm
going to be using the balm eye brushes
here for this look and I'm going into
Matt Molloy which is the matte white I'm
just going to go right around my inner
corner I'm actually loving the shade the
more I use it I mean it just a matte
white while some can seem really chalky
I do feel like this aspect of the look
brightens the eye so much whatever's
left on my brush should just ease that
over to the edge of the eye then I'm
using this gray down here Matt Abdul
same brush and this is just kind of a
small flat brush really densely packed
really thick with bristles and I'm just
going to Pat that gray shade here on the
outside and since we are overlapping the
white it's going to be a little lighter
than it might be otherwise but you can
wedge it up into the crease also and the
other end of the brush is kind of a
pointed crease brush and so I'm just
going to use that to blend out what
we've been doing here then I want to
give the look a little more depth and
contrast so I'm going to go to this
darker shade here matt johnson and it's
a dark grey that almost has a little bit
of a bluish tone to it and with this
brush i'm going to really bring the
color inward in the crease and i'm just
going to drag that color over to the
outside then this is the give crease a
chance
and it's another double-ended one I'm
going to use this kind of shear duo
fiber end and which is this peachy shade
I absolutely love this color for this
very purpose because it kind of you know
get you going back to skin tone even
after using these cool graves it
provides such a flawless seamless
looking blend when you just overlap the
edge of those Gray's we were using so I
love that and then I'm going to go back
to Matt Molloy just a little bit and
this is a wide wide brush I'm just going
to get a little bit of that there and
just use this kind of stamp it right up
there under the brow so got this brush
that we used for the brows that had the
angled side and it's got kind of a thick
pointed side as well which would
probably good be good for a cream
product if you had it but um I'm just
going to use that to apply a little bit
more of the Matt Johnson shade the dark
gray right under here there's a dog
running through the yard okay just going
a little bit under the outer part there
really softly and then using the angled
side again going to go to the darkest
Brown this probably turns out to look
like the darkest shade in the whole
palette and that's Matt wood I'm going
to just stamp this and that's really I
think the way you get the most impact
just stamping it right across my upper
lash line and that's going to be our
eyeliner because I don't have any other
eyeliner from the ball then I'm going to
curl my lashes then I'm going to use the
watcher type mascara this is the body
builder and this brush is like a
traditional bristle brush here with
really really short bristles and
everything's you know kind of packed
really tightly together I really like
this kind of a brush and the one thing
about the formula though is that I feel
like it goes on and you've got to be
really careful not to apply too much or
your lashes will really start to stick
together and especially if you're like
me and maybe you've got kind of sparse
lash it's a fine line between looking
like you have more lashes and looking
like you have less than you actually
have with
did a decent job of giving me length
there and then I'm going to go to my
lower lashes carefully because like I
said this can pile up quickly for
lipstick on this one is from the balm
girls line and it's called I'm a good
kisser and it's like these are named all
after different girls of this one is I'm
a good kisser and it's kind of soft
coral shimmer type color this is a
pretty shade it's on the verge of being
kind of frosty but it's not oh it's not
overboard for me anyway like the way
it's kind of playing off of the eyes
which which turn out to have kind of a
soft blue look and the way we applied
them those cool Grey's when you get them
really sheared out and really soft in
the crease I think they have a little
bit of a blue tone and I think that
looks pretty with these lips so I hope
you liked the tutorial now for some
little reviews on the things I use just
going to breeze through them real quick
the time bomb primer I think this feels
great on the skin but not really a
unique primer compared to a lot of
different ones I've used foundation and
the concealer both very similar formulas
to one another I've used these and not
used a damp sponge to help me apply them
I feel like they've come off just a
little too obvious on the skin so I
really do think that that helped the way
the foundation applied and I think the
foundation looked kind of pretty all
over the skin and had good coverage this
is kind of a thick concealer I can
already see a little bit of the dryness
of this concealer just settling a little
bit into those fine lines and I think
that's something you really got to watch
out for even though we did kind of
dilute it so to speak by working it in
with the damp sponge still a heavy duty
product you can achieve really full
coverage with both of these things and I
think that can be maybe exactly what you
want for those imperfections elsewhere
on the face or you're just trying to
even out you know some really uneven
skin tone somewhere but I think this is
thicker than I like to use a lot of
times on the under-eye as far as the
foundation goes I kind of enjoy the
coverage I like the way it applies with
the sponge to continued use I probably
reach for this more than I would the
conceived ace products the sexy mama
anti-shine powder I think this is just
fine as a matte
fine powder better than any other you
know shine free powder on the market for
me I feel like this performs a lot like
Maybelline's shine free powder the
Bahama Mama bronzer I was able to use
this in this look and I feel like I
didn't come out looking too deep and
dark and muddy but it is a really dark
bronze and if your tan skin and you're
wanting something that can really
contour and define your features this
may be perfect for you for me I had to
be really careful with it I think
light/medium skin do need to use it very
sparingly but it can be great and it is
super pigmented absolutely love the in
stain blushes these are amazing it's
just so long-wearing awesome I love the
entire line of the insane blushes I also
love you know the frat boy and hot mama
and down boy and some of those regular
line blushes from the balm as well I
think they're fantastic Luminizer I
think I've talked about this before when
I was reviewing a bunch of products from
from the balm and this is a very
shimmery highlight I think it can be
great in certain targeted areas I think
it would be nice you know around your
inner corner here under your brow and
right around your Cupid's bow area and I
think it can be pretty on the cheekbones
to just use it lightly as with any of
these products a little goes a long way
lid on it I primer if you're looking for
something that really masks
discoloration and gives you a total even
canvas color wise for your eyeshadow
this is not it this is a smooth primer I
think it works well as far as the
staying power goes but it's just not
going to be one of those color
corrective type primers if you've got
like redness around your eye or
something like that you might want to
try a different meet matte nude palette
absolutely love this I think this is
such a great thing for anybody to have
in their collection all these basic
matte colors I especially love like
these shades on the perimeter here these
this peachy color is outstanding this
shade that has almost a little bit of
plum in it is absolutely beautiful love
these Gray's the Browns are awesome too
I mean you're getting so much product in
each one big old mirror here I ain't
come on this is a great great eyeshadow
palette I absolutely love it I think I
shadow palettes are probably the
strength of this whole line and the
blushes
I love new tude I love the palm Jovi
palette I have blogged and video done
videos extensively on those this one is
another great one tried several if the
balms mascaras I've tried one I think it
was called tall dark and handsome that
was a rubber bristle brush I wasn't that
impressed with that one didn't like the
one called cheater very much either
this one brush wise this is the
bodybuilder under the what's your type
line or lashes can get overloaded kind
of easily it is a thickening mascara
better than other drugstore ones that
I've tried and loved and like I only get
up and grow at L'Oreal double extend in
different ones I don't think it's better
than those lipstick I love there are
several great lipsticks there's a
beautiful red from this line and there's
one call I think it's my bills be paid
and it's like a nude color and it's
really nice to this I'm a good kisser
one I love this color I think it's
beautiful
I would branch out and try some other
lipsticks from the line they are opaque
they are long wearing brushes
okay the powder to the people brush this
is a nice size I like that it's not
gigantic therefore it can be good for
powder or it can be good for bronzer or
blood maybe as soft as some of my Sigma
brushes but it's still a really good
brush a double-ended brushes when it
comes to storage and when it comes to
cleaning brushes I'm not a big fan of
double and let's just browsing the
website and the balm has come up with a
cute little way where you can store
these like down in a cup and not mess
them up you'll have to check them out on
the website but the gif crease a chance
brush this is a giant flat brush this is
probably too big for my lid I used it a
little bit under the brows brush gives a
really really sheer application and I
like that but I again I don't think it's
absolutely essential on the brush that
has the angled end and then the pointed
is a good brush but angled brushes are
pretty common out there and I think you
can find a lot of different ones from
the drugstore or different brand Reese
love and happiness brush is probably the
best in my opinion it's got a small ish
sized flat brush here that I think does
a pretty good job getting color all over
your lid and then it
got a crease brush that's maybe a little
pointed for my liking if it just comes
to blending something out but when you
really want to get in the inner part of
your crease it's really good you're
seeing all this you know what you need
what you like what you're interested in
but in my opinion the strengths of the
line are probably the color face
products I mean I think the the bronzer
highlight and blush these really pack a
punch and that's been a consistent thing
from all different shades I feel like in
the line and I think the eyeshadows are
great if you haven't checked out an
eyeshadow palette from the balm I would
really encourage you to do it and if
they're great value and I think this is
going to last forever because they're so
big and they're so pigmented and it only
takes a little bit also enjoy the
lipstick and we'll probably look into
some more shades of those he's in mind
if you're really trying to look for
deals the balm is frequently featured on
a website called hope look and some of
these same products I've talked about
can be available at really good discount
if you get subscribed to that sites
emails they let you know you know what's
coming up so that can be a good way to
save on these kinds of product you
enjoyed the video I will link below to
all my other one brand tutorials also
any other videos I have to do with
products from the balm so you can get
some more information that way but
thanks for taking time to watch I sure
appreciate it bye guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
