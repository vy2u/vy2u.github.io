in and thank you for your request
because that's why I'm doing the one
brand tutorials again tons of people
have been asking me to do some more of
them the way I do them is pretty much a
like a drugstore brand and then a
high-end brand I go every other with
these videos and so the last one I did
was a drugstore one and be sure to check
the list below I've put links to each
one brand tutorial I've ever done in the
extra info section so you can see what
I've done if you want to request one you
can see if I've already done it or not
but this one's going to be on Too Faced
and that of course is a high-end brand
you can find at stores like Ulta and
Sephora and of these videos I do kind of
a wrap up just reviewing the different
products that's the benefit of a one
brand tutorial as you can see how do
that one brands products come together
to create a look without some like
favorite or must-haves from another
brand coming in and maybe taking over
for you know some product that didn't
work so well so you really see how it
comes together actually I'm not using
any foundation so the face is really
pretty natural the lip is very neutral
but the eyes incorporate some colors
that are just yummy I mean it's I'm
really happy with the way it turned out
and I used a different little strategy
with the outer edge here to really give
the shadow and air really only using
five products in this video a couple of
kits palette type things and then three
other individual products so I hope you
enjoy the look and here's how to get it
I've just applied some moisturizer and
primer and I'm going to start out with
the Too Faced natural face palette so
this is giving us basically all of our
face makeup here in terms of concealer
you've got a brightener illuminizer
blushes and a bronzer so the first thing
I'm going to do is take the concealer
part just here with my finger and I'm
gonna dot this around on different areas
that I want to cover up so that maybe
some spots some redness a little bit
around the nose I'm just kind of roughly
putting it on there right now
then I'm going to take my P AV brush
from Sigma and just
blend that in I'm really relying on this
concealer stuff in this palette for my
coverage since I don't have a foundation
from Too Faced or a typical one that's
not a nut powder
so definitely this concealer right here
in the palette is pretty good coverage
it's very creamy and it was able to kind
of help out circles redness and some
spots but I'm also going to use the
brighten right here which is just kind
of like a little bit lighter shade but
pretty much the same texture as the
concealer and I'm gonna take that just
under the eye pull it out
almost like to highlight the cheekbone
area I'm gonna take a little bit down
the nose and a little bit on the chin
and then I'm gonna blend that out with
the brush as well so this is giving me
even more of an impact especially on the
under eye area here and this brush is
nice because it gets right up in there
for you next I'm gonna use my Too Faced
amazing face skin balancing flexible
coverage foundation powder my shade is
perfect nude and I'm just gonna sort of
set what I just did there I'm using a
really light amount of this powder and
almost just blotting it over the areas
that I just applied the concealer so
this is just really helping to even out
my skin tone a little bit going back to
my natural face palette I'm using my ELF
small stipple brush in the cream blush
product and I'm just gonna dot that on
on each cheek and then I'm going to
blend that out I know it looks like kind
of a lot right now but when you blend
with this brush in circular motions it
really just diffuses the product and it
doesn't apply too much pressure to the
skin then I'm going to just apply a
little dusting of the powder blush on
top and I'm not using a lot of bronzer
for this look but I am going to use this
shade here in bronze veil and that's
going to be kind
just a little bit of a contour for us if
I were doing a look with more bronzer I
would have probably gone all over the
face after the powder step but here I'm
just kind of using it as a light contour
I'm also going around the forehead with
that product as well and if you're
looking for a bronzer that's darker than
this chocolate Soleil is a great option
great matte bronzer that I women just
for a little finishing touch I'm using
the luminize that's in here this is kind
of a pinky cream highlight and I'm gonna
apply that to the Cupid's bow area here
and that's just gonna make the lips look
a little more full and pouty kind of
once we do the lip product I'm gonna do
a little bit of this up on the brow bone
as well and a little bit right down the
center of the nose I feel like the blush
gave me a little bit of glow on the
cheeks so I'm not gonna do any more
there but if you wanted to you could go
back and use that little stipple brush
to apply some of the highlight let's
start out using the Too Faced shadow
insurance and candle light that's what
comes in the shadow bon bons palette and
this is a really like it's not anywhere
near as sheer as regular shadow
insurance you're gonna see here it
really keeps a golden a tone to it next
I'm taking this shade right here with a
flat brush it starts with an F and we
were having like a lot of difficulty
before figuring out how to say this
you googled it for me what do they say
foam boss right from phone Bob bumble
mostly they are not even saying they are
are they rolling they are a little bit
miss very subtle from Boise from Boise
Boise
frameboys from from Blizzard tom was
wrong Boise from Boise um you're welcome
thank you I don't know if this answers
any questions for refund raspberries it
does yes well that color doesn't look
like raspberries well whatever you call
it it's a gorgeous shade and I'm going
to Pat that all over my eye
this would be gorgeous for like even
just a one-color look because it's
really pretty when it catches the light
but as you wedge it kind of into your
crease I just flip my brush over and I'm
kind of pulling it up into the crease a
bit but as you do that it develops more
of a deeper tone as well so this is a
really great coat and I'm just gonna
soften the edge of that with a bear
crease brush then I'm picking up a
little bit of this licorice a lot a
shade it's kind of like a sparkly black
and I'm picking that up with a flat
brush then I'm going to take a business
card Beauty broadcast and I'm gonna line
that up with the outer edge of my eye
and then I'm gonna add a little bit of
this shade right there extending up like
a little bit past where the crease is
taking a little bit more that shade on a
pencil brush and I'm just kind of
blending on the inner part not going
below this line but I'm blending it a
little bit like towards the the center
of the eye then I'm gonna pick up some
light brown with my crease brush this is
called marzipan and with that I'm going
to go right through the crease
overlapping you know that little purpley
shade and what we did here on the
outside and this is just gonna blend
everything out I'm gonna take a little
bit of this vanilla a matte cream color
with the blending brush and that's gonna
go right up under the eyebrow then I'm
going back to liquorice latte with a
pencil brush and with this we're going
to just work it into the crease a little
bit more again I'm not going past our
line but I'm just pulling it inward a
little more creating more of a deep
increased color I'm going to take that
under the eye as well then some more
this pretty purple shade that starts
with the F I'm gonna take that under my
eye too and that's a really pretty color
right under here I'm using a little
smudger brush and this shade called nude
beach it has some sparkle in it so just
be aware that there can be some fallout
with that
but I'm gonna attempt that right around
my innermost core time he's in the
perfect eyes waterproof eyeliner in
perfect black this came in the return of
sexy palette and of course you can get
it individually as well and I'm just
gonna line my waterline here next I'm
going to apply it all across my upper
lash line starting at the inner corner
then right around the outer corner apply
a little bit more just thicken up your
line a bit and connect it there to the
lower lash line we're not really winging
it out yet didn't take an angled liner
brush and this is so cool get it in
there in the black and this is so creamy
you're just gonna pull it up right along
that line that we did the shadow with so
just stay right on the line and you're
gonna get a nice little subtle wing
there that you can totally control with
this brush and eventually it is gonna
set and it's not going to smudge much
for you so you've got to kind of do it
right away but you just it's just a
matter of pulling up like that keeping
the line and everything looking nice and
clean I'm going back to vanilla with
another flat brush you could use like a
concealer bribe and using it on its side
and sweeping up under that line I just
curled my lashes and I'm gonna apply
some of the two-faced lash gasm mascara
you get a full size with the shadow
bon-bons kit and it is a rubber brush
mascara and I'm going to apply this to
my upper and lower lashes then I'm going
to apply some salon perfect demi
whispies lashes these are ones that are
a little bit longer on the ends and I'll
join you when I'm done then for lips I'm
applying some of this Too Faced lipstick
in nude beach and this is just a really
creamy lipstick nice color to compliment
their really smoked
that's my take on how some of these
products worked first off the natural
face palette this is a gorgeous palette
I love how it really is all encompassing
with concealer products illuminizer
blushes and a bronzer the one problem
here is when you're thinking about
multiple skin tones I'm pretty sure this
is the only color family this comes in
it just comes in one option and that may
work for like my skin tone or a little
lighter a little bit deeper but if you
get into you know really rich skin they
definitely you know these concealer
shades wouldn't work anymore the
coverage coverage was really good
considering I'm not wearing a foundation
at all I thought the concealer and the
brightener worked really well especially
manizer I mean it's nothing out of this
world it's just kind of a shimmery
creamy product the cream blush love the
particular shade z' that you're given
there and then bronze veil I mentioned
it but it's a little bit lighter than
chocolate Soleil bronzer it's still a
nice bronzer but it's just not going to
give you quite as deep of a color so
that's just something to keep in mind
and for reference I do love the
chocolate Soleil bronzer that's a great
great matte bronzer but if you need an
alternative that's a little bit cheaper
check out the Revlon Photoready bronzer
that's a great matte one from the drug
business does happen to work for your
coloring and everything I think this is
a nice way to kind of minimize products
it's nice for travel and you know that
these different shades do work well
together
amazing face powder is really really
good I've raved about this before the
texture is really rich I think it's also
good if you have oily skin I feel like
it sort of keeps that at bay maybe a
little better than some other powders
the amount of drugstore products I have
tried I can tell you that you can get
something similar to this elsewhere this
reminds me a little bit of Mac Studio
Fix maybe not quite as much coverage as
that but if you're wanting something
similar to that and the Milani
multitasker powder is another option so
I'm not really doing this video just to
give you a bunch of dupes but I mean
this powder really is good but I think
it's not so special that you couldn't
find a great matte pow
else for the eyes I've been looking for
this shadow bond months palette for what
recently at Ulta and I'm so glad I did
just to give you a closer look at the
palette it has a mirror up top and it
has 12 different eye shadows here so
it's a good range of neutrals plus some
colors keep in mind some of these shades
do overlap have every Too Faced palette
ever made but I know peach fuzz lovey
dovey nude beach and maybe coffee bean
not positive on it but I know there is
some overlap not every shade is brand
new so if you collect a lot of palettes
you might give your yours at home the
once-over to see if there are shades
here that are unique enough to to make
you want to buy it but for me I love
these colors here I know we struggled
with the name of this one but this from
was a shade is so pretty because it's
like a dusty smoky lilac and it really
is gorgeous but I wouldn't buy a palette
for just one gorgeous shade there are
definitely other shades here that I love
this marzipan color I mean was really
key to taking this look and giving it
this nice natural edge almost with that
really light brown it's just perfect
candy roses gorgeous this pink color
there's one shade that you have to worry
about some glittery fallout and that is
nude beach rich latte has a little
sparkle down here other than that you're
down to some shades that are either
shimmery kind of satiny finishes or
totally matte the candle light primer
it's nice that they included that
typically it's always just the regular
shadow insurance that goes in with their
different palette and I always want that
golden color underneath every look that
you have but it is really pretty and I
got to say I'm not a fan of the lash
gasm mascara I've already tried a small
like sample size of this it's a rubber
brush it was great for defining my lower
lashes I must say but with the upper
lashes not enough volume just I mean it
it made them still look kind of puny so
I did add my falsies to this look which
I think really helps the look out quite
a bit but you might
like that mascara so it may be something
that you want to try it comes in the kit
as does the shadow insurance but the
highlight of the kit in my opinion it's
definitely these shadows I love
two-faced eyeshadows and I think this
gives you a really nice opportunity to
make some neutral looks but with a
little bit of some really feminine
pretty colors like the pinks and the
lilacs and things like that palette is
really relatively new to me I just got
it this past weekend I'm so I've used it
a few times and that's my kind of
initial reaction on it I'll keep using
it and we'll probably incorporate this
into a larger review of holiday palettes
but right now I'm really loving any
eyeliner this is the perfect eyes
waterproof liner this the one that I
have came in my Too Faced return of sexy
palette and you could buy it
individually as well it's not quite as
long wearing as some other ones I have
think if you wanted an equivalent to
this from the drugstore look to the
Maybelline master drama I also don't
love that you have to sharpen this but
it is really soft and creamy and it was
very easy for me to create that special
kind of little cat eye look with this is
a lip color these are really luxurious
feeling lip colors they remind me a lot
of the feel of like matte came out with
something called I think it's Sheen
supreme and it's a very ultra creamy lip
product Revlon lip butters feel a lot
like these do as well but this shade
called nude beach is a very nice
not often that I will do something nude
on my lips and not feel the need to put
a gloss over it because I think just a
flat nude lip looks really like just
that just very flat sometimes kind of
dry but this has kind of a healthy
amount of shine to it and I think it's a
super wearable color color it's kind of
close to revlon colorburst lip butter
and creme brulee only this one that I
have on has just a little more pink in
so while the cost for one lip product
can be a bit much I do think it's
extremely great quality and it feels
amazing on the lips so that wraps it up
for my Too Faced one brand tutorial I
hope you learned a lot about some of the
different products in the line and how
they can come together to create a look
really
happy with the shadow bonbons kit and
really like the lip product as well the
natural face palette is a very
convenient thing the only catch there is
that it's really got to suit your skin
tones so it may be something to check
out in the store if you have a chance
but thank you so much for watching guys
hope you have a great day and let me
know your requests for the next one
brand tutorial which will be a drugstore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
