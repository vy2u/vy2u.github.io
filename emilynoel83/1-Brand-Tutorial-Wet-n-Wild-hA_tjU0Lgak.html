tutorial and this one is going to be all
using wet and wild products so I've
gotten a lot of requests to do a one
brand tutorial with this brand it is
probably one of the most affordable
makeup brands that's out there and I'll
also be including a tutorial on one of
the new 8 pan palettes so Sparkle till
morning will be featured in this video
if you want to see that particular eye
tutorial it's a nice opportunity to see
how a brand's products work together to
create one look and then you'll see at
the end sort of some reviews on each of
the different products that I did use so
I hope you enjoy it all righty I'm going
to start out taking my ultimate match
foundation here and this is an SPF 15
liquid foundation my shade is beige pump
on this bottle so I'm gonna shake some
out in a really small opening here too
I'm just going to dot this around on my
face now I'm just going to use my Sigma
brush here the f82 to buff it in all in
all this is kind of a liquidy foundation
but not liquidy enough to just run right
out of the bottle like I really had to
try to shake it out of there
which was actually kind of
time-consuming it took me a while to get
enough out so I could sort of dot it all
over my face and get to this point
coverage is kind of light to medium I
mean I feel like it's sort of evened out
the skin tone as a whole but it wasn't
heavy enough to cover up different areas
here and there that I'll need to use
some concealer on next I have a
concealer and it is the cover all stick
in light/medium so this is just one of
your traditional stick concealers so I'm
going to dot this around some obvious
areas here where I think I need a little
help little redness around the nose any
other spots going to use this a little
bit under my eye as well these
concealers tend to be kind of thick
feeling and I don't typically like to
use them around the eye but it is really
all I have
from this brand to use as a concealer so
I'm just going to use my finger to sort
of press this into the skin hopefully
break down some of the thickness a
little bit with just the heat of my
finger here actually pretty decent
coverage though around my face is able
to take care of a blemish over here a
little bit of under-eye drama and
whatnot
not too bad around the nose either now I
know what in wild makes a pressed powder
I don't have that right now and I really
don't think it's too necessary I feel
like I have a pretty matte finish on my
face as is and this time of year I don't
really get too oily either but um I do
have a bronzer and it's the wet and wild
color icon bronzer in bikini contest
here's a look at that it's a really
large sized bronzer it does have an SPF
of 15 and they have just the slightest
like satiny finish to it not 100% matte
but it's going to be matte enough for
our needs today I think so I'm just
going to take a large powder brush and
I'm going to sort of dust this in the
area where I would normally contour
right here under my cheekbone and I'm
also going to take it down under my jaw
now wet-and-wild also has a great
highlight that's sold in the same sort
of format and it's called reserve your
cabana and I actually gave that to a
friend who is needing really needing a
good highlight and so that was what I
recommended to her it's great it's not
too shimmery you may have seen it in my
highlight dupes video it's just a really
great highlight and so I gave that to
her and I don't have that right now but
the blush that we're going to use is
going to give us a little bit of a glow
and you're definitely going to take this
up around my hairline too for blush I'm
using a shade that I love it's called
pearlescent pink it's got kind of a
golden shimmer to it so definitely a
glowy type of blush not all the blushes
are that way but this one is and because
I'm not using a highlight that's kind of
the look I want so I'm just going to
sort of swirl this on the outer part of
the apple of my cheek and sweep it up
it's a light pink but it really gives a
gorgeous flush to the cheeks so what
wild doesn't have an actual eye primer
but I am going to use a couple of cream
products from the brand is sort of a
base for this love this shade is called
pixie and
it's a really light pearly color so with
that I'm just going to sort of encircle
the tearduct area and also bring this up
and kind of draw this in about halfway
onto the lid then Pat it just to make
sure you can pick up any excess product
that way and they have a darker shade
called graphite which is like a gunmetal
color and that I'm just going to draw on
the outer part here and then Pat out for
that as well the shadows are really
really pigmented as is but this will
just give them a little something extra
to cling to since we don't have front
I'm going to my sparkle till morning 8
pan palette here and I'm going to use
this brow bone shade it's sort of a
pinky toned highlight type color and
pick some of that up with a flat brush
and I'm just going to Pat that over the
inner part of the eye here next I'm
using the same brush and I'm going to go
to this shade labeled crease it's kind
of a medium brown and I'm going to Pat
that on the outer part of the lid here
and just kind of overlap it with that
sort of pinky color I love these two
shades side by side taking a crease
brush with that same color I'm actually
going to pull that up into the crease a
little bit just with a little product on
the brush so we've got this nice warmth
starting to come up from the crease then
using a flat brush I like using a flat
brush here because it can give me an
even more targeted application I'm using
this definer Shaylee rich sparkly brown
color this color I'm going to Pat this
on the outermost corner here and I'm
also going to Pat it up into the crease
like really wedging the point of this
brush into the crease and starting to
let some of that color come just up
above the crease a little bit here then
I'm going to take my crease brush again
and we're just going to lightly blend
the outer corner the outer edge of that
out these shades blend so easily and
because we already had that
in the crease remember that medium-brown
it's really going to make the blending
even easier because it's going to go
right on top of that but we're keeping
the darkness mainly on the outside here
next I'm taking a small angled liner
brush and we're going to go to that
definer shade again that dark brown I'm
going to go right under my lower lash
line it's you can see we're just keeping
that darkness right there and I'm taking
it all the way under right up in between
the lashes we're not going for a real
thick line here and you'll see why in a
second you could use another liner brush
or I just have like a small smudger
brush that's going to get small enough
to give me enough control for this step
I'm going to this definer shade now this
is a really bold um teal blue and you
could really lay it on and make it
bright but because we're going under
this brown and just sort of overlapping
the brown you can see we have that
little bit of green but it's muted and
that's what I want for this lawless
gives us a deep green tone which I think
it's really pretty
overlapping with the brown so with that
you're just going just under slightly
overlapping what you did with the brown
all across the lower lash we got like a
little more than I wanted there in one
area so I'm going to go back with the
brown or may not have gotten enough
Brown to begin with but I want my lash
line area itself to be kind of dark and
then just have the greenish pop
underneath a couple more steps here with
the shadow I'm taking this crease
colored one of my favorite shades in
this palette it's kind of coral kind of
coppery
and I'm taking my crease brush getting a
little bit of that shade on there and
with this we're going to take this above
all the action happening there in the
crease and above the crease and this is
just going to give us that nice warm
very fall-like beautiful um color there
up above coming on top of the brow bone
still left some room for a highlight
there just under the brow and the color
we're going to use for that is this
buttery shade right here says brow bone
I'm using just a fluffy brush for that
so it can really
go where I want it to go but be soft
enough now I'm gonna put away the shadow
and do a couple things with liner I'm
using this megalast
eyeliner in blackest black so this is a
pencil that you don't have to sharpen
and then it has a smudger tip at the end
and I'm just drawing this on my
waterline the liquid liner which is mega
liner I've used it so much I've worn off
the label it's doing really basic
eyeliner across the upper lash line just
taking it all the way across and I'm not
winging it out I mean the shadow is
doing a lot of different things with
this look we've got below the eye above
the eye outer corner so I just want the
eyeliner to define my lash line
well that's drying I'm going to go ahead
and fill in my brows a little bit this
is the cult brow eyeliner pencil one of
those really long like 99-cent pencils
so you can use it as an eyeliner or brow
product and the shade is dark brown it's
a little bit darker than I would want
and it's a little bit softer than I like
barely applying any pressure here so I
can just really lightly fill in a little
sparse area there gonna really lightly
run it over the rest of my brows then
I'm going to curl my lashes then I'm
using this mega lash clinical mascara
which I haven't been using long enough
to be able to tell you if there is a
lash growth effect from those you can
see the brush is actually kind of flat
when you hold it that way and then you
can see the bristles are kind of long on
either side so not a bad brush to work
with by any means and with a couple of
coats it's actually pretty buildable
it's helping out my length it's not
giving me a ton of volume I'm going to
do a little bit on the lower lashes too
for lips I'm using the mega shield
lipstick this is a relatively new
lipstick line for wet and wild and they
have I believe they have an SPF 15 in
them yeah and this shade is called
birthday suit is kind of a shimmery nude
this is the wet and wild liner number
666 and Brandywine
I'm deepening them up on the outside
here and this is just kind of a deep
neutral
liner I'm using my glassy gloss and I'm
just using the clear shade actually I
have several colors in this and I think
it's a pretty good gloss but I'm just
going to give my lips an extra shine by
going all over with that so for my
little reviews on the different products
I'm starting out talking about the face
just basically Foundation and concealer
as far as the coverage products go I
think the look is overall pretty good
the ultimate match foundation is not my
favorite just in terms of the way it is
I feel like it's got a really small
little opening here and it takes forever
to get the amount of product out that
you want but once it goes on it's
definitely not a shimmery foundation in
any way it has an overall fairly matte
appear is not amazing coverage but it's
definitely not as minimal as you might
find with like a tinted moisturizer or a
BB just kind of average on the
foundation nothing Wow's me incredibly
nothing super bad about it ever all
stick I used it on a blemish I used it
in the under eye and I used it on any
other spots or redness on my face and it
did okay really with the coverage but I
think the texture is more the concern
with that if you have really dry skin or
dry patches that are still maybe red or
something you want to cover up you may
find it really clinging to those areas
like with the face products here this is
where the brand is lacking just a little
bit is some different you know maybe an
updated foundation and an updated
concealer would be nice like this color
icon bronzer in bikini contest I think
this is pretty good it's not 100% matte
which would be nice but as a whole it
gets the job done for a bronzer and it's
a great amount of product to be able to
use all over and I also love this blush
and I love some of the other blush
shades as well but this one I thought
was really pretty give a pretty pink
glow to the cheeks not too much it only
took a little bit of product to get that
coating onto the eye products you guys
know I love their palettes they're eight
color palettes they're trios and stuff
like that I think they're tremendous
quality this is a look I've been kind of
playing with all week this was the first
time I took the green pop of color
underneath it looks very full and I
think it's very appropriate
for the season these blend so easily I
can't say enough about the wet and wild
shadows if you if this is a brand that
you have not visited in a while because
your last experience years ago with wet
and wild shadows wasn't so good try
these out because I they last forever it
doesn't take much to get this kind of a
look and it they blend so seamlessly I
just really enjoy those shadow sticks
that I used are pretty good and they
remind me a lot of the NYX jumbo eye
shadow sticks they're just a little bit
shorter than those but I use these as an
alternative to a primer I feel like I
use primer with this like all the time I
use either Too Faced shadow insurance or
I use the NYX HD eyeshadow base and the
staying power is really great with these
with with a typical eyeshadow base I
don't know that it will be as good
because I didn't use a primer this time
but this definitely gives the shadows a
little something to cling to so it may
help out on the stain not and that's
about this mega last liner in the pencil
form I feel like it wasn't as intense of
a black as I would have liked it really
doesn't measure up to some of those
creamier eyeliners from high-end brands
it also is not as good as like
Maybelline master drama that would be
the equivalent at the drugstore that
would be better than this and better
staying power to this kind of is already
fading a little bit in the water loan
mega liner the liquid is great there's
no problem with that at all nice opaque
black not watery liquid liner that you
can use and they did exactly what I
needed the mega lash clinical mascara I
have not used this long enough to be
able to tell you what the effects are
with it but it's definitely better than
the other ones I've tried from this line
I feel like it gave my lashes a little
more thickness quite a bit more length
and I could build with it for a couple
of coats and actually get a look that I
was happy I use the classic Col brow
eyeliner just the 99-cent dark brown on
my eyebrows it ended up in the end I
think looking okay but you had to really
be careful with it it was so creamy and
actually you know in retrospect this
would have been a nice liner to use in
the waterline because it was so nice and
creamy and then this one that was a
little bit drier
might have been a better formula for the
brown lips if you're looking for a great
classic lip liner the number 666 brandy
wine $0.99 shade is really really nice
and it's kind of like a deep neutral
color so you can use it with a lot of
different lip colors just to define a
little bit I mean with this lipstick the
mega shield which I love this formula I
think this feels like a lip balm but it
was really light so I was able to add a
little dimension to the lips and
actually make them look more full
because I was making them darker on the
outsides and keeping that pop of
brightness on the center part and then
the glassy gloss is just a nice classic
clear lip gloss can't complain about
this and it's comfortable on my lips it
gave me that little bit of shine that I
wanted as a whole lip products and eye
products even the color cosmetics for
the face like the blush and the bronzer
really really good from wet-and-wild
I would like to just see some updates
where their foundation and their
concealer products are concerned have to
say it is probably the most improved
brand from the drugstore from what I can
see in my time using make other things
in their 99-cent range to the stuff
that's a little more pricey like their
eyeshadows I feel like nothing really
goes above like 5 bucks for this brand
and I think that makes it really easy
for people next one brand tutorial will
be a high-end brand so let me know what
you want to see and thanks again for
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
