I had a great request recently to put
together some tutorials using only one
brand of makeup in each and I thought
that is a great idea because you're
gonna get a lot of information on one
brands products but also you're gonna be
able to see exactly how they perform you
know how like in some tutorials I think
there are some standout products and
it's like maybe that really good product
was covering for this not so good
product so here it's kind of all exposed
you know the one brand how does it do on
its own without bringing in you know XY
and Z from these other brands so I hope
you get a lot of information on the
brand I'm talking about today which is
tart tart is known to be
high-performance natural beauty so there
are a lot of great natural ingredients
and their products there's a lot of
not-so-good stuff left out of the
products the end I will give you a total
you know like my favorite products that
I used and also I will link at the end
and in the information bar links to
other videos I've done on that
particular brand I'm going to be taking
you through of course foundation blush
eyes lips the whole bit so if you want
to see how it comes together keep
watching
would start with foundation but because
of the texture of the concealer I have
and the foundation I'm kind of switching
steps I'm going to do concealer first
this is the maracuja creaseless
concealer I'm doing it first because it
has more of a tacky finna have it in
medium I absolutely love it the coverage
is so good I mean and it is also really
nice because that maracuja oil is
something that I've used actually before
bed all over my face just the straight
oil it's extremely hydrating you've ever
been concerned about a concealer making
you look dry and cakey this is not a
concern with this one at all of you with
oily skin or combination skin I think
you'll really like the foundation this
is the Amazonian clay full coverage
balancing foundation with SPF 15 it has
a really lightweight feel but yet it
truly does give good coverage is such a
nice texture it's really creamy but it's
not heavy feeling so I'm just going to
kind of dot this around my face a
velvety is the best way to describe this
foundation and it comes with an awesome
brush this is so thick this is the
biggest foundation brush I own but when
you apply this it really gives you the
best finish with this foundation it's
amazing like it's a really dense brush
and it covers a lot of surface area at
one time so before you know it you're
all blended out for the most part I feel
like my skin is evened out so I'm a fan
of the coverage of this and I do like
how it wears throughout the day because
I do tend to get a little oily around
the t-zone frankly the way that
foundation kind of smoothes out to that
velvety finish you wouldn't even
necessarily feel the need to put powder
on top of that but I am going to use
their bronzer in Park Avenue princess
this is their mineral bronzer I actually
got this this is a small size it came
with one of the kits I guys can
definitely be used just kind of all over
to perk up the skin and kind of have the
same effect as a powder so because it is
a powder
so as you can see I'm just kind of not
really using this as a contour because
it does have a little glow and shimmer
to it so I'm just dusting it around
although moving on to blush I'm going to
be using one of the 12-hour Amazonian
clay blushes I'm not sure if this
particular one is available individually
this one's called peaceful and it came
in a kit and there's also a great little
brush that's kind of unlike most blush
brushes because it really kind of paints
on the product practically rather than
swirling it on but you get a really nice
finish with it so um I'm just gonna kind
of sweep that upward it's such a glowing
kind of blush it's really pretty you
don't necessarily need to go on top of
it with a highlight I mean you get a
gorgeous glow just with the blush and
because it has the Amazonian clay the
glow is coming from the product not
making you not creating excess oil on
your face I actually have a little tart
eye primer it's the natural eye primer
with Firma trawl and it says 51 percent
decrease in fine lines and wrinkles so I
haven't been using this long enough to
really be able to speak for its claim I
haven't had problems as far as like
creasing or anything like that so this
operates a lot like Urban Decay primer
potion or Too Faced shadow insurance or
something like that I use my Tarte
emphasized waterproof Amazonian clay
cream eye shadow one of my favorite
products I have an in shimmering taupe
gorgeous color and if you just you know
basically your finger in there and just
kind of smudge that all over the eye
thing the Tarte smolder eyes Amazonian
clay waterproof liner this is like a
jumbo pencil and the shade I have it in
doesn't say on the packaging here but
it's like a plummy Brown and I'm going
to take that right under the lower lash
line I'm also going to build up some
color on the outside on the outer part
of the eyelid and kind of give myself a
little bit of an drawn on outer V
practically so this will be kind of a
base for the
smoked out out of eating also smudge
this out as well you can also use your
finger using my tart eye Couture palette
love this palette for natural to
dramatic looks it's great for whatever I
go to this shade right here it's kind of
a deep shimmery brown and just using a
pencil brush I'm going over those areas
where I put the dark eye pencil I'm also
taking a little bit of the of that brown
color kind of up into the Korean this
palette comes with a cool double ended
brush one that can you know put your
face layer of shadow on and one that's
kind of a nice crease brush I'm gonna
use the larger side and go to this light
shade right here it's kind of just a
nice pearl color and just use that as a
little bit of a highlight up here then
I'm going to go to this really soft
lilac colors use that to kind of smooth
over the edge it's very buildable so the
more lavender issue you want this to
come off just kind of swipe another
layer over it and you're there the other
thing this eye kit comes with is a
double ended liner one end is kind of a
coppery Brown like that and the other
end is black and we're gonna be using
the black end and this is called the
long wearing eyeliner and I'm pretty
sure Tarte has some more advanced
eyeliner products like some cream liners
and there's an Amazonian clay pencil
liner I believe I have that but it's in
kind of a burgundy shade that I didn't
want to use for this look so I'm just
gonna use the black end and you're gonna
notice that as I line my waterline here
I mean it's not the richest deepest
color and then I'm just gonna use the
same product to line my upper lash line
I'm gonna curl my lashes and then I'm
using Tarte lights camera lashes mascara
if you've seen my mascara favorites
video you know this is one of my top
favorites it's great for being super
long wearing and not smudging and
flaking off but it also takes wimpy
lashes like mine and actually beefs them
up with a you know two to three coats
and
makes them look a lot better for my lips
I am using a really cool product it's
the lip surgence natural lip lustre in
sweet this is a really nice shade it has
a minty scent and I love you know I love
jumbo pencils so this is like you know
it goes on feeling kind of like a
lipstick lip balm more like a lip balm
probably in for a gloss I'm going to use
the Tarte pure optic lip gloss and
golden pink this is a product that is
going to go on much much more I mean
it's gonna be sheer if you wear it alone
it's nice kind of layered but not
something I would really reach for to
wear on its own in terms of my favorite
Tarte things the things that I think are
unique are things that would be
beneficial to have in your collection
the first one is the mark Kucha crease
less concealer I love that this is using
a really great ingredient for hydrating
the skin to help with aging skin and to
put moisture back in an area that can
look really really dry another standout
product from Tarte that I love is the
emphasized waterproof Amazonian clay
cream shadow especially this shade
shimmering tote lasts so long I believe
this was tested out by the US women's
water polo team and it lasts I also am a
huge fan of Tarte eyeshadows
specifically I do like this eye Couture
kit because I think you get a great
variation of colors this is a great
thing to pop in your bag on a trip or a
vacation or something because you can
get as you can see you got a black
they're super smoky dark looks or light
very natural looks I like how the Tarte
shadows are super buildable so you put
on a little bit you get a little bit but
you can layer that up and get a lot
without looking overly caked on so I'm
definitely a fan of that and I like how
they throw in you know a liner a brush I
even got this little primer with that
golf so no I love the lights camera
lashes mascara if you have an
opportunity to try a kit or you know
just pick this up on its own I would
totally recommend it it's great and tour
in terms of
building up lashes that if you don't
have a lot of them it really makes them
noticeable and it's good about not
flaking or anything like that so this
really reminds me of the malli
volumizing mascara which I also love so
to of definitely my favorite mascara I
don't have any products that I would
call duds like I did not enjoy using
them today and I I mean I'm pleased with
the overall look but I will tell you my
opinions on you know the other stuff the
Amazonian clay full coverage balancing
foundation I really like this I have
tapped into the world of drugstore
foundations big-time tried tons and
Rimmel lasting finish Revlon Colorstay
maybelline superstay those are long
wearing - I think this is not
necessarily something you have to shell
out the money for just to get this I
said I absolutely love these blushes but
I think about what else is in my
collection Milani baked blush has come
to mind they can give that similar glowy
effect on the blush but you don't have
to spend quite as much for well I love
the lip surgence and I love that minty
feel and the control that you get this
does kind of remind me of like the
Burt's Bees lip balm can give you also
nice color as well the bronzer the jumbo
eye pencil and the lip gloss there they
really weren't super unique standout
products to me I like them I will
continue to use them but you're gonna
find other jumbo pencils similar to that
from other brands this lip gloss is
nothing especially amazing and the
bronzer honey I got tons of bronzers I
got a lot of drugstore bronzers that I
love and this wasn't necessarily
over-the-top awesome I hope this was
educational for you I guess and maybe as
you look into the Tarte brand you'll
find some great new products and know
better how to use them so thanks again
have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
