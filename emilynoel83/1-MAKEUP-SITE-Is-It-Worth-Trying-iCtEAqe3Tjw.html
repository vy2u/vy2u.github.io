be so much fun this is the first time in
a while that I have known of a website
offering products for just $1 each
I remember when elf was doing that and
since that time you know the products
have gone up a little bit in price it's
still exciting to do an elf haul because
you feel like you're getting a lot for
not very much but you know it's a little
different than it was and now there's a
website called shop miss a calm and
everything on there is a dollar not just
makeup products but also accessories
there's some jewelry items some hair
items there's just a lot going on there
and I would not have even known about
this website had it not been for cater
fly 42 on Twitter who tweeted me earlier
this month
and she said could you do a video
explaining the quality of Miss a
cosmetics so thank you so much for
bringing that up if you enjoyed this
video you have her to thank completely
because like I said this is a totally
new concept to me and I guess the reason
why they are able to offer so many
things that a dollar is that they are
getting products directly from
manufacturers at least that's what the
frequently asked questions section of
the website said so I'm going to jump in
I got like a little bit of everything
for example this scarf one dollar it's a
soft kind of fleece feeling scarf the
way I've got it tied here it ends up
being very short but at full length it's
rather long and it's got some little
fringe on the bottom and I see
absolutely nothing wrong with this scarf
and I would totally you know wear it
with my little black jacket or whatever
you know it's soft it feels good so yeah
that's a thumbs up another thing I got
is this little headband it's got the
knotted bow just black very basic really
stretchy soft kind of a thick band it
seems to be nice quality I had a lot of
others that I wanted to get in this
style but they were sold out but you
can't beat the basic black and if you
were to wear this out I don't think
anybody would know that you only spend a
dollar on it so that's really cool I
think that's a thumbs up
also for a dollar I got these earrings
and they're kind of that design where
the back is visible from the front and
it's just kind of like an oversized
crystal here with gold around it and
then that pearl has a little bit of a
pattern or print on it but I think those
are really cute they're comfortable
they're not super heavy I mean it might
seem like they're very heavy for as
large as the pearl is but they feel
great I love them and those are from the
brand melody and then from the brand
mini it's or that same kind of style
with the larger ball behind I feel like
these look a little cheaper its top pink
part it's like a series of stones and
then you've got this hollow kind of
silver ball on the back and I think if
this was just like a solid stone kind of
like the one I've got on it might look a
little better but I wasn't in love with
those one of the most exciting finds for
me on this website were the false lashes
they're only a dollar there were tons of
different styles I'm wearing some of
them today these are from clean color
it's called angelic wink some of these
brand names by the way are going to like
floor you as I go along you're gonna be
like what but these are the number 48
they're pretty long all around it looked
very similar something I might see you
know from ardell or something like that
and then in the last video I was wearing
these that are a little bit shorter left
to right and these are from the cara or
cara brand and these are called just DW
and they're wispy like the little ends
kind of crisscross a little bit more
they kind of remind me of the effect the
chaotic mascara I might try to give you
it's a little bit of a messy look to the
lashes I don't know how much I love
these these would be maybe like just one
thumb up in my opinion this style the
WSP actually seemed a little bit better
to me it wasn't quite as messy but still
really thick and a little bit longer for
from the lash band left to right just
going across that way so I think I'm
gonna like those these 1/8 teens turned
out to be huge those are SuperDuper long
I'm not sure when or where I'm gonna
wear the
Oh's but those seem pretty big these
Cara for fifteens seem extremely
wearable I like that you know there's
some little clusters of more thickness
in there and then some thinner areas as
well that's really what helps that kind
of lash blend in with your lash line I
got these two O fives again very flared
out toward the end and I think they'll
blend nicely seeing as short as they are
toward the inside lashes for only a
dollar I mean I would buy red cherry
lashes off of lady moz.com for like
$2.99 and I thought I was getting a
pretty good deal there but these are
like the same kind of quality the lash
band is the same nothing about these
feels inferior to me in any way the
tricky part is just going to be deciding
like what styles are going to look best
on you which is always kind of hard
anytime you're looking at lashes in a
package so as I try more of these I'll
make sure to like update snapchat and
kind of let you know what they look like
point out what style I'm using there's
another cool thing
eyebrow razors they have a little 3-pack
here it was just a dollar
it's from the clean color brand and a
cool thing about these is that they do
fold down so if you wanted to travel
with them you can another very cool
element to these is that the razor goes
all the way to the tip there's not a
little cap or plastic end coming over
like kind of cupping around the edge of
that razor so you can really use this to
shape the brow how you want to my mom
always told me and she is you know an
old-school cosmetologist she said you
never would a pluck above your brow and
her logic to that would be that as your
face kind of Falls as you age you can
like tweeze your brow from below and
continue to utilize I guess that hair
that's above your brow and I've got just
so much hair that grows up in this area
like between here and here around here
and razoring it off like this is
different from completely plucking it
out or tweezing it out waxing it off I
think it's a little less likely to come
back but with these little razors I feel
like I can totally shape the brow from
above and get a good result from it so
that's another huge two thumbs up
product gotta say guys another thumbs up
clean color has this Wonder
eyelash curler and I think you could get
it in different colors because I pretty
sure I chose this pink one and there's a
second little pad that's in the box and
it honestly feels pretty cheap and
flimsy just to touch it it feels very
lightweight I don't know something about
it I just did not have high hopes for it
but I love how spongy this little guy is
and it does actually happen to fit my
eye rather well sometimes certain lash
curlers they could be a great lash
curler but if it just doesn't really fit
the shape of your eye if you've got a
really round eye there can be different
reasons why just the structure of the
lash curler doesn't work for you and it
doesn't come in contact perfectly with
your lash line this one seems to work
pretty well for me the one thing to
watch out for because this little pad is
so spongy if you really just clamp down
and hold in one spot
you will have sort of just that single
bend in your lashes and I don't really
like that look so I would say you know
use it at the base of the lash and then
kind of move it outward and clamp down
one more time and that will give you a
nice looking curve but it really does
work it really did curl my lashes the
brand amuse or is it a musee I feel like
I was corrected on this year's back when
I did a cherry culture haul and this
brand was on cherry culture little AOS
style lip balm seems to be a little bit
smaller than an EOS bomb but scent wise
I don't know like they're trying to make
it smell sweet but something else is
getting in the way maybe kind of a
little chemically smell these were just
numbered I think I got like number two
or something so you just kind of choose
what color you want the balm really felt
a little greasy to me not super like
rich and hydrating I would skip this a
couple of other things real quick before
I move into a lot of the makeup products
they have masks they had quite a few of
them so I just chose a couple on the
15-minute mask pack in lovely strawberry
and cooling cucumber I have not used
these yet I'm sorry I will update on
snapchat when I've got these on probably
you will see me in a sheet matte and I
will let you know how it's going but I
definitely wanted to jump on these
because I thought $1 for a mask that's
great
I never really liked the feeling of
paying a lot for just a one-time use
mask you know so hopefully these work
out now in this bag I have the makeup I
got again still everything is a dollar
let's just start with the lip products
I've got this LA Colors lip trio I'm
going to need to look up the exact shade
that this was because it doesn't say on
the packaging it probably said on the
outer packaging but I threw that away
but you've got three different chunks of
color and let me tell you each part of
this really does show up like if you
just applied the nude side like that
really shows and then the more pinky
tone side that shows up too kind of hard
to isolate that middle color but then
when you apply them and just kind of mix
it all up this is the shade you get so
kind of a pinky nude type shade and I'm
liking it feels like a lip balm to me
honestly has the softest scent so I
thought that was really cool and I ended
up with two of these the other one as
you can see has like that light nude
side and then the other side is very
very dark and vampy so it all mixed
together that's going to give you like a
classic berry look so these are so
interesting and so random I just think
it's kind of cool so I would say thumbs
up to those those were kind of fun
um the thing that I would say thumbs
down to or these glosses and I did think
to keep the packaging here these are the
high shine lip glosses from is it clean
color clean ista it says I have tea rose
and beige frost beige Frost I thought it
was going to be like my Jordana lovely
lip gloss the shade name is lovely and
they took it away years ago is it
beautiful like works on everybody type
gloss it was just kind of a Mavi simmer
that looks so pretty and at a glance
this looks a lot like it but it is much
much more shiny and the glitter
definitely hangs around on your lips
after the color wears off it's not a
great look but these are squeezy tube
glosses they just have a pull off cap
this one is beige frost this one is tea
rose as you can see they're crazy shiny
tea rose went on a little streaky it's
just a creamy color I was really wanting
it to work but these are
kind of sticky it's kind of a strong
sort of artificial fruity scent if you
know what I mean you see how my bun
keeps slowly drifting sideways but this
is one of those things where I don't
know that all take the time to pursue
any other colors there might be some
better colors in the line but kind of a
thumbs down for me this is interesting
the brand Santi has come out with
something that looks a whole lot like
baby lips the way they package it but
they're calling it juicy lips this legit
smells awesome it's kind of like
strawberries or raspberries getting some
sort of a berry scent I think I just
drew on my nose and while it is shaped
like a classic lipstick it still applies
more like a tinted lip balm because it
is a little bit sheer but it's still
pigmented you know for what it is so I
think this is kind of cool and frankly
if something is going to be that
colorful I appreciate having the shaped
stick as opposed to just the flat balm
type stick you know it's easier to be
precise with this I told you you were
going to be entertained by some of the
brand names this is Malibu glitz and
this is a blush this is the blush number
three comes in a decent little compact
here with a mirror and it reminds me of
those Milani rose blushes with that
print and it is pigmented it packs a
punch it's like kind of a reddish Coral
and that is what I'm wearing on my
cheeks is my blush today but very
lightly and this was a hit definitely
and I think that could be easily
depotted into a Z palette so awesome now
what I've got on top of that that's
giving me the little bit of glow is this
clean color American chick in lush petal
it says baked blush bronzer SPF 15 and
that's what this looks like it kind of
comes off like a soft rose gold or peach
but if you wear it sheer I mean I feel
like I'm just getting the glow out of it
so I like that that was really nice so
thumbs up for those two cheek products
something I've not yet tried is the
amuse or a muse a summer glow body and
face bronzer this is in the color
diamond shine and I tell you this shade
here is very very similar to that
coppery color in the champagne glow
palette from Becca looks very similar to
that
very intense and then that other shades
kind of like a dusty lilac and these
almost have a creamy feel to them so
very interesting I almost would be more
prone to wear these for his pigmented as
they are as eyeshadows but I need to
experiment with that a little more I'm
very intrigued something that was kind
of a dud for me simply because they did
not set were these master strokes I had
them in rose gold and this one is french
vanilla and french vanilla also I was
hoping it would be lighter it comes off
kind of a little yellowy tone the rose
gold is pretty the kind of sheer and
like I said these can easily be smudged
away so I would go for something else
from the drugstore like the Milani
shadow eyes that really sets these are
the clean color American Idol eyeshadows
I have plum and terracotta I am wearing
terracotta all over the lids you can
wear these wet or dry they actually are
decently pigmented you definitely want
to put them over at least some sort of
base if you're not planning to wear them
wet it's one of those things where what
I got is okay but I wouldn't really give
it two thumbs up because I'm not really
planning to pursue any more look into
this line too much more because it's
just it's just kind of an okay product
but something I thought was really cool
are the Malibu glitz eyebrow powders
these are great I used this one in my
brows today is just a powder it comes
with a little double-ended applicator it
worked totally fine I did a little wax I
have a Milani wax pencil that you can
just kind of go over and it gives
powders like this something to cling to
so this was fine these are pigmented
they could definitely work as eyeshadows
and that's what I used this one for this
is Oh for this is oh five which is
something that would really suit I think
auburn hair but that's what I've gotten
my crease are these two shades along
with that coppery shadow on the lid and
I think it totally worked so I'm about
to run out of memory card space I hope
you enjoyed this little hull slash
reviews a really interesting website and
let me know if you've checked it out
what you've tried what you've liked or
not liked I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
