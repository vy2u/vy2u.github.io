video yeah it seems like it's been
forever since I've done something on
dupes and it might because they're
really hard to find sometimes I've been
working for a couple of weeks trying to
find some great lipstick dude I've
always been a lip product lover but I
feel like lipsticks in particular have
really like blossomed in my collection
lately so I thought I should start going
through and trying to find some dupes I
have found 10 that I feel like are
dead-on great matches for these colors I
have matched not only the shades but
also the finishes of something has
shimmer the dupe also has shimmer if
something comes off really shiny and
kind of sheer that's the way the dupe is
I don't feel like I'm necessarily
mimicking an exact formula like the dupe
is going to feel exactly the same way on
your lips because I've got several bite
lipsticks in the mix and you know how I
feel about those I think they're just an
amazing amazing lipstick formula and
well I have matched them color wise and
finish wise the feel on the lips from
the drugstore dupe is not necessarily
going to be that much like a bite
lipstick just being realistic with you
here I've got a great shade range I've
got everything from kind of like pinky
nudes all the way to some deep dark
colors and some Reds these will all be
shown on my lips as well so you'll see
the top lip I'll put on the high-end
product and then the drugstore dupe on
the lower lip so you can watch that
throughout but starting off a really
light shade that I wanted to find a dupe
for is my urban decay lipstick in native
it's a very soft light creamy pink and I
feel like I definitely found a dupe for
this in the maybelline color whisper in
lust for blush one of the first color
whispers I ever got I've always liked
this Shin it really does come off just
like urban decay's natives so I was
really happy to find that little
comparison there of the first lip
surgence products that I ever had is in
the shade called sweet and this is one
of the lip lustre so it does have a
little shimmer and it's always been a
great go-to kind of peachy soft shade
great for springtime and summer it also
feels really good on the lips and I've
definitely found
for that in the Neutrogena moisture
smooth color stick in fresh papaya same
peachy color that little bit of shimmer
and also these color sticks just feel
amazing on your lips I mean they're so
so comfortable a lot like the lip
surgence field and that Neutrogena is
what I'm wearing as I sit here and talk
throughout this video I needed something
really comfortable to throw on after
trying on all those different lip
products I've found a really tricky kind
of shade to find a dupe for are those
sort of neutrals that maybe just have a
hint of pink or a hint of red but
they're really just sort of a hard to
put your finger on type shade and so I
was really pleased to find a dupe for
this Too Faced la creme lipstick in pink
chocolate and the la creme lipsticks are
kind of a unique formula and that
they're very very shiny they have a
glossy finish and that really matches
the kind of finish you get from a Revlon
lip butter the one in pink truffle is a
great dupe for this shade you know it's
got that rich depth there's definitely
some Brown in this shade but a little
bit of red as well there's a hint of red
in both of these so a unique color and
definitely something different from
anything else I'll be mentioning in this
video I've got a little string of pinks
to talk about first off it's the Mac
Viva Glam Nikki and this is a great like
hot pink shade but it's kind of a warmer
pink you know I almost always think a
little bit coral when I see this shade
and so I feel like I found a pink that
really matches it and it is the wet and
wild lipstick I believe they're called
megalast they're kind of a matte finish
and the shade is called Pinker bill and
it really really matches up with this
Viva Glam lipstick even though the Viva
Glam is a satin finish I feel like they
really come off with the same type of
look and definitely the same color as
well first of several bite lipstick
dupes that I found I absolutely love
this bite shade in Palomino it's a
gorgeous gorgeous hot pink so I was
hoping to find something that would had
that same creamy finish and also match
the intensity and surprisingly I found
my dupe in the NYC expert last in air
kiss this pink really does come off just
as intense as
Meno maybe not the exact same feel on
the lips
but still they look really really
similar
now this next couple of colors are
really along the same lines shade wise
is what I just mentioned but they're a
little more sheer
just a little more sheer and a lot more
shiny so or shinier and the shade that
I'm trying to find a dupe for that I
found a dupe for is fuchsia shock from
two-face so one of those la creme
lipsticks that really comes off shiny
and again I found my dupe from the
revlon colorburst lip butter line and
this is in the shade lollipop same kind
of shine really really similar finish
and feel on the lips so I was really
glad to find that do now as we work
through this spectrum of Pink's I've got
one that I think is maybe a little bit
deeper than those others but still
something you classify probably as a
bright pink and the formulas that I'm
looking at now are a little more liquidy
we're looking at the OCC lip tar and
this is in the shade called prettyboy
a really nice vivid magenta color if
you've got a lot of lip tars this is a
great mixer type color to add to
something deeper or something lighter
and you can create some really
interesting shades but just looking at
it as is on its own it really matches up
nicely with the Milani lip intense in
pink rave the lip intense is going to be
a little bit thicker texture wise but
color wise they are really really nice
matches for one another both creamy
colors no shimmer and just very very
intense now I've got a couple of
different Reds to share with you the
first is a really really true red this
bite lipstick in pomegranate is just
such a dead-on true red like you can't
really look at it and classify it like
oh it's really warm or it's really cool
it's like a neutral just true full-on
red so I was hoping to find a drugstore
lipstick that could give me that very
same look and the one that I found that
I think does a great job of it is the
Milani color statement lipstick in red
lame either of them are going to give
you tons of shine but just like a hint
of shine so I thought they both had a
really nice finish that was very much
the same both of these are just
completely full on classic Reds if you
like your Reds a lot
bit deeper you might be interested in
this next dupe I've got another mini I'm
all about the bike mitt he's like
anytime there's an opportunity to get
bite lipsticks in many sizes and little
clusters and groups I'm always after
them and it's this little guy in tannin
and it looks really dark but it actually
sheers out quite a bit and a lot of red
comes through this little dark looking
lipstick so I was looking for something
that would give me that same level of
pigmentation but still beyond the little
bit deeper side compared to the average
red and I feel like I found that in the
NYX butter lipstick in the shade is
definitely one of my favorite butter
lipsticks that I've tried I think it
gives just grateful on color and it's a
great match for tannin and finally
number 10 my last lipstick and my
deepest dupe that I found was for max
rebel I know this is a really popular
cult favorite lipstick and chances are
you've already seen people come up with
dupes for this shade but I just thought
I'd share with you the one that I found
in my collection to be a really great
dupe for this color wet and wild Fergie
collection and Furguson crest Cabernet
this really has the same finish it's
nice and creamy very deeds an example of
a dupe where I think they really look
exactly the same in the tube and they
look the same in the swatch and the same
on your lips with some of these dupes
you know they don't always look the same
in the tube but they come off with the
same finish or look once they're on your
lips so if you're looking for something
just like Mac's rebel I would totally
check this out
and I hope these dupes were helpful for
you if you're looking for some lip color
ideas and trying to save some money at
the same time only fun to find dupes
except for the staining that inevitably
gets left behind on my hand it's crazy
it happens every time some of these
shades are just so deep and dark you're
really good about these and I definitely
have some others that left me so stuck I
just can't wait to find a dupe for some
certain other shades in my collection
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you again very soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
