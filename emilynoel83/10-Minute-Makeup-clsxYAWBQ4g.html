bathrobe and I'm getting ready this
morning and I'm actually going to be
going to the grocery store here shortly
and Tyler says he would like to be back
home in time to see the football game
and so I thought well this would be a
good opportunity for me to try and do
maybe a 10 minute look you know get it
all finished in 10 minutes and I'm gonna
try it I may not be a super descriptive
with what I'm doing and so don't take
this like a tutorial because you may not
learn a lot but I'm just going to see
how fast I can do it I thought you guys
might find it entertaining so the clock
is ticking so we'll go ahead and get
started I already put my moisturizer on
menus some mineral power concealer just
it's the quickest way to conceal around
my eyes and a couple other places around
my face and just going to blend that out
with my finger I'm going to kind of be
her in here cuz i am not i mean my
typical getting ready time as far as
makeup those i mean it takes me like
like every day when i get ready for work
it takes me a half hour so i'm going to
use my um Abbott's put me up concealer
from everyday minerals and I'm just
going to wear support ok here it is I'm
just going to go over what i just did is
how i'm going to be using um mineral
foundation today so i'm just going to go
over that kind of it helps to set it and
just gets it a little more finished
looking ok so after that i'm going to go
over to my intensive foundation medium
beige neutral everyday minerals will
click this by the way yeah i'm just
going to use a little kabuki brush that
I have not sure what the brand is and
just swirl this on everywhere
keeping an eye on the time a 10 minute
makeup what for me is rare guys so I
don't have a lot of practice of this I'm
just getting in I'm going overlapping
like all the areas where I just did the
concealer to for extra coverage
intensive is the highest coverage
everything minerals offers all right so
we've got that all over and I'm gonna
move on to with the bronzer the everyday
minerals bronzer it see it's easy when
you kind of stay within a set cuz you
know exactly where you go on with
everything so I'm just going to get into
this is every everyday minerals blush in
everyday bronzer that's actually what it
is and I'm just gonna blend this out all
over lunge it on my forehead right into
my canon line even though you're in a
hurry you can't really sacrifice good
blending so
one dick I rider outside my face and
right on my cheeks
this is a nice natural bronzer not too
shimmery all right let's speed this
thing up so there's browser application
now I'm going to do my blush my blush
again everyday minerals this is game
show it's kind of a pinky actually kinda
it's got some reddish tones to it so it
doesn't take a lot but it's very
interesting color I love these blushes
all right and it's the kind of blush
words practically like a contour and a
brighter shade in one so that's nice
okay so there is that part of a look
done with um I'm gonna do a quick I
climb out here because I still think
that's really important even though this
is a quick look I still want my
eyeshadow to stay and not crease so i'm
using my Mary Kay eye primer and I'm
just going to put that on a little bit
too much on it ok there we go I'll off
the excess and this is also a point
where I would go ahead and do my lips
while that kind of sinks in and so I put
on some lip balm my blistex raspberry
lemonade and let's see what lip gloss
don't want to go with today I think I'm
going to use my Maybelline volume
seduction XO whatever it's called what
plumper it's the color is 115 and that
got still little time left i think i can
do it so i just kind of slip that on
over the top and now we're ready for
eyes another tip if you're going for
speed using a little eye palette where
it's all self-contained is really nice
because when you're I mean I love taking
the time to use singles and really pick
out a look but
it if you don't quite have the time this
really streamlines things and this this
quad is for Maybelline it's actually
don't think the sticker is still on
there it's chai latte I think and I'm
just going to put the lightest shade all
over my lid lightest shade
okay and then I'm gonna grab my crease
brush I'm gonna try to make this and
keep this as minimal as possible i'm
going to use this shade that says crease
kind of like a shimmery brown with that
in the crease
okay this appears to be going okay so
far and then I'm just going to go back
with a more fluffy brush and I'm going
to use that light shade again so it's
kind of like I'm sandwiching a darker
shade basically between the same light
shade the shade that is on my lid I'm
also putting right up here's a highlight
okay got that done I'm going to move on
to my eyeliner I can actually do um a
liquid line I think a little faster if i
can find but liquid right I can do it a
little faster than I can do um a pencil
line I feel like so I'm just going to go
across the top lash line I look into a
little mirror this is my live one color
stay in black and carefully carefully
there's one done couple minutes left and
we're going for the second lets out a
minute and a half all right
not quite even
all right there we go I'm just going to
take a little bit of my colorstay pencil
just right in the corner guys you smudge
it out with my finger
smudge it just ever so slightly I left
ok I'm going to give a quick curl five
seconds each I I would normally do more
but hey this is a this is a makeup in 10
minutes video so ok and I'm going to
grab my 2,000 calorie mascara from X
Factor do a quick coat on each ok and
then real quickly grim the blouse I
think I'm gonna make it geez Louise this
is crazy ok done thank you guys for
watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
