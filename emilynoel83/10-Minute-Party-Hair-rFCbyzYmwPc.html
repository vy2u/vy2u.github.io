just curling my hair right now and this
is going to be the first step of a easy
to step hairdo that you can do so fast
it only took me a couple of minutes just
to run my curling iron through the
bottom layer my hair just to add a
little bit of curl down there some loose
waves i'm curling my hair so it's going
kind of a way from my face so as i turn
the curling iron it's turning back and
away and i'm going to do that part here
finish that up on the top layer and then
i'm going to show you how to tease it
just a little bit to give it a little
more voluminous look so let down this
top layer of hair and kind of show you
how I've been working the curling iron
on it i'm also using a little bit of
this heat protectant spray from beyond
the zone it's gonna turn up the heat and
this will size is available for only a
dollar ninety-nine at Sally's it smells
so good probably the best one of the
best smelling hair products i love that
brand because they make everything
smells so good so here I've got a lot of
layers coming down on this side and so
as I said we're going to kind of be
turning them away from from the face so
that's what I'm doing here and this is
just so I mean I'm really not being
precise here at all by how I curl this
I'm scribing little portions and if you
got long layers you know you can kind of
get away with you know it doesn't have
to be too exact because just going to
look like a lot of hair so I'm grabbing
these sections and the reason why I'm
going back is because I do want that to
kind of turn away from from my face I'm
just grabbing whatever ends I have it
and turning them back this would be like
the really quick if I'm running kind of
behind as I get ready for work in the
morning this would be the look that I do
for the news actually quite often but
this is a perfect look for going out or
just you know dressing up your hair a
little bit for the day so I'm getting
these cool
going here if you can see we're just
it's loose it's wavy and we're just
trying to get all those long layers that
I have worked in here really easy to do
and now come over to this side and I
wanted to make sure it turned away from
my head for my face yeah still very
close to my head and there you can see
it's just getting this gentle wave to it
and the curling iron i'm using i guess i
should have let you know this is a
Revlon curling iron it's not very big I
really don't know the exact size of what
I have here is but you guys can probably
see that I mean it's not like a jumbo
curling iron by any means it's one of
the smaller sizes and I'm cuddling the
hair so it takes the entire length of
the barrel of the curling iron that's
how you get kind of that long wave to it
all right finish up here in the back
and then like I just spray this and
we're going to move on to sort of phase
2 of this procedure so just kind of run
your hands through it and spray the hair
a little bit you could totally stop
where you're at right now you can see
the hair is kind of you know turning
back looks good this sort of hair I
kinda have to position my hair like if
I'm doing the news I have to sort of
make sure I know where it's at in this
this hair wearing it this way it just
works well you know off your shoulders
and just that whole motion that kind of
backwards motion that you've got curl at
so you could stay like this just having
curl it back like that well I'm going to
show you a way to take it a little
further if you want to so now that we
got that curl we want to give it a
little more volume and I'm going to kind
of take a section of hair here right the
crown without integrating those banks
too much just yet like if I were going
to use a bump it in this this is going
to kind of show you this style you can
do if you don't have the bump it and you
still want volume there spray the back
take your rat tail comb just add any
comb with bristles really small and
close together and we're just pulling
down on our hair we're just teasing it
just a little bit there okay and it
should as you fold it then you should
have that kind of a lot going on and
then I'm going to just grab a little
chunk over here on this side oops want
practically to blend with what's going
on back there service spray it hold it
up and tease it back just a little bit
I'm going to do the same thing further
over on this side here pull it towards
you spray the back side of the hair pull
it back and back comment and
in just 48 so that all the hair has
worked in we're going to do the same
thing with the bangs you've gotten kind
of in that curled in that direction we
want them to be but we do want them to
be worked into this look somewhat so
we're going to tease those back oh isn't
this a great stopping point we're
getting to hear so got the full hair
that looks like what did you do to
yourself right now you're probably
thinking I like to joke with Tyler and
get to this point and be like okay ready
to go now but um thing you want to get
one of your little pins these hair pins
are great if you could of course try to
go over this again with your comb but it
may take out too much of the teasing
that you've done so I'm using these hair
pins available for like a dollar my
guidance Sally's by the way hairspray i
was using is the so gorgeous volumizing
hairspray also at sally beauty supply
loving their products lately so
basically i'm just going to start
pulling that damn business again sort of
hair do i would probably use on a daily
basis and the beauty of these hair pins
is that you can poke them in and proof
up certain areas and you can see we're
keeping that same direction that the
hair is going is still kind of turning
back nicely for us and i'm going to kind
of pull down the bang area with this
boost up here blend sort of the those
bangs we're kind of blending them back
this may be going a little fast I
apologize if you have questions as
always please ask I'm kind of and then
I'm pulling them down I'm running this
little pin through to take out any
visible signs of what I had done there
with the teasing or the ratting or
whatever and kind of mess with the sides
here and just make sure it's still
directing back like that and stick your
pin in anywhere you want to and you can
get that added added lift to your hair
okay
and then um if you want sort of a pc
look that you can take any kind of like
finishing cream or anything like that I
have something for Billy a brilliant
brunette called SAT and shine at all
sometimes use and it's just like a
little kind of shine enhancing finishing
cream and sometimes all used that on
these little ends just to get them kind
of turning that direction I want them to
know if you can see kind of what I'm
doing here but it smells good too it has
a lot of it helps with shine too and
I've got a nice spray at all sometimes
use it's called final take it's super
sexy shine and hold from beyond the zone
and this smells really really awesome
it's a get available at Sally's smells
so good and it helps with the shine and
everything with your hair as you get
done and I'm just kind of locking in
what we've got here this was the hair if
you visited my blog and you saw the hair
on the black and pink I look I did
there's like a picture of Tyler and me
at the bottom of it and then hey I had
that how I did the eye tutorial so there
you go less than 10 minutes we've
created a hair look that gives you
volume and cool and everything it just
looks really I mean you can put the hair
back you can pull it forward what i
usually do if i didn't use or something
i put one side back and then i have this
side kinda down like that and it's so
just I feel like it's really easy to do
and as you can see we haven't added like
a whole ton of volume but we have it
just enough to make our hair look like
it is naturally thick ok so again your
hairspray is your friend here so a
curling iron and just used I mean use
the products that work for you mine are
just some suggestions but I hope you
enjoyed this video guides and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
