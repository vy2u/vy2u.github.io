really affordable natural back to school
makeup look you have come to the right
place if you especially need help with
eyes this look is going to take you from
start to finish on the eye look and at
the end I'll suggest some products for
the rest of the face but as you can see
the look is just very natural very very
easy to achieve one of the easiest looks
I've done I believe and I'm using this
quad from Maybelline from the new
stylish smokes collection and you look
at this and you might think wow that's a
smoky eye kit but as you can see you can
make it very natural as well and I hope
you'll get sorry first thing I'm going
to do is prime my lid and this is just
going to extend the wear of the shadows
and keep them from creasing and I kind
of rotate between a lot of eye primers
but one that I think really does measure
up to the more expensive ones is L'Oreal
decrease and so I'm just gonna like use
the little applicator there to get that
not only on my lid but also in in the
crease area and just work that up a
little bit just like so and then I'm
going to grab my new Maybelline palette
in stylish smokes
and well actually the the collection is
stylish smokes and this one is called
charcoal smokes and you might see this
and think oh wow that can give you a
really dramatic eye and it could which
is kind of why I thought this would be a
good palette to use and recommend
because you can make this very natural
for a back-to-school look but you could
also with this very same palette you
know one purchase you could use this for
out for a dance or for anything that's
more formal that you wanted to use and
make it a little more dramatic so it's
kind of one of those that can really do
everything for you so if you're really
trying to save money I mean I think that
would be a good idea so anyway what I'm
going to do with that is use this shade
the shades are all labeled which can
make it even easier but I'm gonna use
this shade and that's label lid and grab
my Sigma this is actually my little one
travel SS 239 brush isn't that cute I'm
going to be using that to apply that
shade all over my lid and this is just
sort of a I would call this like a
medium
shimmery taupe and using shimmers right
there on the lid can always make us look
a little more weight make our eyes pop
just a little bit more so just kind of
layer that on as you see if it kinda
gives you almost that little bit of a
glossy effect to the lid this shimmer
does and I'm just kind of blending it
right up to the crease as well and then
I'm going to use this lightest shade
that's labeled brow bone it's really
just a light silver get a little bit of
that on the brush and just to
concentrate that on the inner corner
here just like so okay and then the next
step I'm going to grab a crease brush
and I'm going to use the shade labeled
crease right here and this is more of a
a little bit this is this I would say is
comes off in person as kind of a medium
taupe and this one has a little more
silver or charcoal grey to it so I'm
gonna use my essence of beauty medium or
I guess yeah the medium crease brush and
just apply that to my crease you could
do a great outer V with these shades
especially the darkest kind of sparkly
black shade in this kit but for this we
do want to keep it somewhat natural so
I'm just applying that to kind of go
with just the natural contours of my
crease there I'm not building it out in
this area too much so there we go and
then just for a touch of depth see that
shade that says outer corner right there
it's a black with some sparkle to it I'm
just using my fine crease brush brush
just with a dot of that on there I'm
just putting a little bit of that right
there in the outer corner this is just
gonna kind of make our eyes see me a
little bit bigger along with the way we
do our liner here so for the liner I'm
going to use my almay eyeliner pencil in
black this is a 16-hour pencil so in it
really does last and it's a little bit
creamier and a little bit easier to
smudge if you wanted to do that then say
Revlon Colorstay although Revlon
Colorstay is super
long lasting as well so I'm just going
to apply this on basically the outer
two-thirds of my eyelid here my upper
lid trying to stay right along the lash
line but if you're not super close then
just be aware that you can always take a
q-tip or a smudge tip and smudge this
out and I'm not really extending it too
much I'm just leaving myself a little
place there where I can kind of blend in
for what we're gonna do on the lower
lash line okay
so that'll work there for now so now
that I've just gotten kind of a rough
line there I'm gonna take my blending
tip my sponge sort of a sponge tip
blender here and just kind of soften
that line just a bit for the lower lash
line we're gonna use that darkest shade
use any kind of liner brush that you
like I'm going to use my Coastal Scents
angle taklon liner brush and just use
that to kind of just join right in with
that corner there that we made so so
it's really just kind of you're getting
a finished corner there
and just bring it in about halfway so
it's keeping it really pretty soft and
if you want to top off that a pencil
liner you did with some of that black
you know that would be good because then
you're also sort of setting that
and then on the inner half if you want
to just use that shade that you used on
the lid there it's kind of like that
medium taupe shade just carry that right
on in it's just gonna give you just
super natural look it's not like black
liner all the way in so just carry that
in and then if you have a very small
brush like a detail brush I'm using my C
148 mini contour brush from Coastal
Scents that a q-tip could do this job as
well and I'm using that lightest shade
that says brow bone I'm just applying
that right here in the inner corner just
to give us a little more life there and
then take whatever a fluffy brush you
like in that brow bone shade that
lightest shape
I'm using my Sigma another one of the
travel brushes the SS 224 and just
applying that really lightly right up to
my eyebrow for lashes I am going to curl
my lashes then I'm gonna apply on some
of my Maybelline lash discovery mascara
on my upper and just a little bit on the
lower lash line that I'll join you with
the finger free when I'm back with this
super natural back-to-school eye
tutorial everything I use just from the
drugstore even on face makeup
I mean basically a light foundation I
like the Elm a smart shade makeup
because it is fairly light coverage but
it still does give you some coverage on
your face and it's super easy to pick
your shade because there's only a few
and you just get close to your color
family and it really does blend in with
your skin tone but you know a light
foundation like that any kind of bronzer
I like the Milani bronzer in powder
bronzer in light just something to kind
of put off dust all over your face to
give you a little color and then any
kind of peachy tone blush I'm covergirl
cheekers has a great selection of
blushes but I also like the Milani
minerals blush in might I have talked
about that a lot just a dusting of that
on the apples of your cheeks will really
just give you some natural color to your
face and then of course the eye look is
just you know using a palette that I
think is a very good idea to pick up
because it can go you know dark for any
kind of dressy
or nighttime occasion you might have but
for the day I mean you can make it look
completely natural like I think we did
here so on my lips I used this beauty
rush lip gloss from Victoria's Secret
another affordable Beauty buy here
innocent juice berry so it's more kind
of like a gel based gloss that just has
a hint of red to it and then just to add
even more kind of pigmentation to that I
used my Jordana easy liner in baby berry
Jordana products I know I find them at
my local Walgreens and they're really
cheap you can get like two for three
dollars usually is the deal on them and
so I just put went ahead and put the
gloss on then kind of ran over it with
this baby berry pencil filling in my
lips just to give them a little more
color and anyway this is definitely an
affordable look that you can pull off
for everyday and really look natural but
just give your eyes in and your lips a
little definition so thanks so much guys
for watching and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
