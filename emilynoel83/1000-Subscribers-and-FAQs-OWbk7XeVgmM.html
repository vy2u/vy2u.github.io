really special video because I have
reached more than 1,000 subscribers
today so I'm really really excited for
that thank you so much to everybody who
subscribed and who weaves wonderful
comments all the time I really really do
appreciate that I think it's just always
so fun to hear what you guys have to say
and because I'm doing these videos for
you you know if there's something you
want to see please request it I'd love
it if you'd request it in a personal
message that way I won't forget it it'll
be easier to find and come back to and
refer to when I do requested videos and
I know there have been some requests
that have been going on and I haven't
gotten to all of them yet but I really
really want to and I will it's just you
know working a full-time job and doing
this juggling it all can be kind of
difficult sometimes but I just want
everybody to know that I really love
this I love these videos what I never
imagined that they would have turned out
to get this kind of response but I love
I love it when you guys give me
suggestions and you know like I'm
wondering about this can you help me
with this whenever I get those personal
messages and people are saying can you
recommend a few products to me I always
always reply to those so please feel
free don't be scared to you know send me
a message and ask me about that also
visit my blog it's HTTP colon slash
slash www.beautipage.ca/just a blog I'm
starting up and what it's going to be is
just extended info a lot of similar
things to what I'm posting here on
YouTube but it'll just go a little more
in-depth if you're interested in that
kind of thing but what I want to do for
this video is address some frequently
asked questions because I think you know
somebody asked one
it could be something that a lot of
people are wondering about so I want to
you know answer it and just have a
little fun with it since this is the
1,000 subscribers celebration video so
first question I've just kind of gone
through and written down a lot of things
that I've seen multiple times so um
first where do you get the half lashes
these are the lashes that look like this
where do you get those from well I get
them from Walmart I believe this second
from Walmart and I also have another
brand which I don't have readily
available at my fingertips right now but
you can get them from CVS - those are
the places that I found those and also
where do you get the dark glue that goes
with it
this duo waterproof dark tone I get that
from Walgreens I've just recently
started seeing it at Walgreens so if
your store doesn't have it yet maybe
keep checking back and see if they have
it next do I wax my eyebrows I do not I
tweeze them little old-school tweezers
like this and I tweeze them like every
day because I can always tell when
stuffs starting to grow back it really
bothers me so I am continually doing my
eyebrows every day and not that
everybody has to I'm not saying that
it's like a suggestion because not
everybody's eyebrows grow back as fast
but mine really do so just gotta keep on
it what's oh I get this so much and it
makes me laugh because people will say
are you a news person because your voice
sounds like you're on the news and I
think that is just so funny because I am
I do the news I am a reporter and the
name
and I love doing that kind of thing but
I had no idea people could pick up on
that through the videos I bet it's just
so funny and pretty cool too so I like
that I think it's funny cuz some people
will write that and then they'll see one
of my videos where I reference being in
news and they're like oh my gosh I knew
it so that's really cool I think that's
so funny people who have seen my
collection videos they say how do you
get all that makeup I've addressed this
a couple times before but I do not get
all my makeup at once this is a
collection that is built over a period
of time a lot of it is inexpensive stuff
and it's not like I'm hoarding at all I
mean I get rid of makeup when I feel
like it is too old to still have on hand
but I mean I just I collect it I get it
like kind of a hobby not necessarily
like oh my god
and that out of lip gloss I'm not gonna
get any more until I completely run out
you know I'm like collector like a lot
of people are on YouTube so that's just
kind of how it goes some of you probably
really are like in tune with me on that
so cool what else where do you get else
I've been able to find elf at Kmart you
can find it at some Kmart stores minimal
mind you it's not the entire brand you
can find some of it at Big Lots but the
main place you go you should go to if
you want to see the full brand is wwic
lips face comm that's where you can get
elf products for a dollar piece beware
the shipping is getting slower it's my
first order I got in a reasonable amount
of time I have an order in now and I
still haven't gotten it for a while but
I guess it is the small price you pay
for products that are only a dollar
piece so you can you can still be happy
that you're only paying $1 for this
question do you wear colored eye makeup
you're probably looking at being like
that right now and saying
another friggin smokey neutral I video
but no I think I I just I have lots of
colored eye makeup it's just that when
I'm doing a lot of these videos I have
been at work or I'm getting ready to go
to work and I cannot wear like bright
blue you know bright pink colors like
that on the air I just you know you're
in news you guys understand that I mean
I do have colored stuff and I want to do
more tutorials with it I am planning to
new tutorials with my Clair stuff I
don't like to do tutorials until I've
tried the look a few times so that stuff
is coming it'll be coming on days I
don't probably have to go to work and
wear that kind of thing not that some of
these looks won't be work appropriate
for some of you but for what I have to
do it's hard to get away with a
lite-brite I look I'm gonna have to
speed this up if I make it through these
where do you get makeup forever in
Smashbox brands I get those off of
sephora.com WWF or accom I know I
mentioned those eyeshadows that I like a
lot
what mascara do you use I use a lot of
different kinds but I'm going to give
you some top ones here I like L'Oreal
double extend I like L'Oreal hip mascara
and I like L'Oreal voluminous I like
covergirl fantastic lash those are a few
of the top ones that I use kind of
rotate around on what's your favorite
mineral makeup I really like bare
minerals however it is a different kind
of coverage from say everyday minerals
and which is something that I would
compare two more to Maybelline
everything Merrill's is a brand that has
varying foundation coverages and I would
compare their matte foundation to
maybelline mineral
I really like those both I think sub
people don't work as well with the
bareMinerals because they complain of
oiliness on their skin and that is the
tendency at times with that videos
applying blush concealer bronzer
numerous requests for these and yes I
will do those where does your makeup
mirror come from it's a Revlon makeup
mirror that I got from Walmart a while
back it is it is lighted all the way
around and it's from Revlon and I
believe it can also do Claire's power
test on animals no they do not
how much are some of them they range I
would say $4.99 to around seven to ten
dollars for the large one that I've
mentioned and also are you of Italian or
latina heritage good question back
several times but no I'm not I am
English and Irish that's my heritage so
that is the extent of my frequently
asked questions keep asking questions
keep subscribing and watching the videos
love you guys thank you so much but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
