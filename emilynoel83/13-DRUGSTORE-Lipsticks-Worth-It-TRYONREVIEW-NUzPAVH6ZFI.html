topic to dig into in this video we're
talking about the Loreal and balm on
collaboration lipstick collection this
is the PR package that came it is a
total of 12 lipsticks here three sort of
sub collections I guess you'd say within
the full mine these are available on
ulties website now but it says in stores
on January 27th so it's gonna be some
time before you actually can see these
in person and as I was going through the
shades I have I thought wow you know
from what I see online just from seeing
the photos of the lipstick some of these
look a lot different than you might
expect so I thought this lip swatch
video of them all might be helpful also
they're gonna cost you $13.99 a piece
for a drugstore lipstick and normally a
L'Oreal lipstick is gonna cost you like
seven or eight dollars so if we're gonna
nearly double the price is it really
worth it whatsoever and it says in the
little description for the first time
L'Oreal collaborates with balm ons who
create a range of exclusive Couture
matte shades of lipsticks which I
wouldn't flat-out call every shade matte
first off we'll get into that as we try
them on but there are some different
finishes here and it says the lipsticks
are divided into three color themes
glamazon Couture and rock there are
definitely what you might describe as
out-there shades within each of those
color families but the collection is
limited edition and it's coming from
L'Oreal's color riche lipstick franchise
if you're familiar with that line of
lipstick you know there is a strong
scent associated with those I think that
scent probably goes way way back and I
definitely notice that scent in some of
these shades more than others which was
surprising but I guess if there is kind
of a different formula happening in
different shades it makes sense that
maybe they don't all smell the same now
they claim that it's a matte collection
and I would say most of the shades are a
true matte L'Oreal has recently come out
with a color riche matte collection like
a normally priced lipsticks and they're
nice they're actually a really nice
formula they're creamy but I don't feel
like the Mets in this collection are
quite that same formula many of them
seem to glide on just maybe a bit more
Tooley than those it's honestly kind of
a close call but I think these are a
little less drying the only way to
really learn about this collection is
for me to try them on for you you can
see the shades you can decide for
yourself of these appeal to you but I
will point out my little observations as
we go so I'm going to start off with the
black lipstick collection but the
lipsticks do say Beaumont Paris on the
cap here they are plastic they have what
seems to be kind of a soft gold like
look of hardware on the outside first
one I'm gonna try on for you is called
confession and this one really might be
one of my true favorites from the entire
bunch I love this shade I love the
warmth of the peach enos of it and the
formula is really really nice it truly
is a matte lipstick but it definitely
glides on with more ease than l'oréal's
regular color riche matte formula so I
just I love it gives me complete full
coverage color in a shade that I really
really like next up we've got confidence
and here's a total example of why they
can't call this a 100% matte collection
what this is is a sheer sort of peachy
shade with golden shimmer and after
putting on that last shade this one
looks actually somewhat more normal than
it did the other day when I just put on
fresh bare lips and I was like what's
going on like patchy sheer just golden
sparkle I couldn't make it look good and
another one of my total favorites from
the whole line is in this collection
it's called domination and for whatever
reason the phrase that comes to mind for
me on this is toasted red it's like a
red with a little bit of rust just mixed
in and it's the very same feel as the
first one I tried on called confession I
feel like we're all gonna have different
preferences color wise but if the color
does speak to you I think you're really
gonna like the formula if you like a
matte lipstick that wears very
comfortably oh and the wear time on this
was incredible I was kind of playing
with these mid day and then by the time
I got to dinnertime and ate my meal I
fully expected somewhere down or
somewhere around the lips it did not
budge outside my lip line at all and
really barely look like it had worn down
even after dinner then we have
liberation which is a super deep purple
I do kind of like the shade although
something I have realizes that the
further you get from your natural lip
color the more awkward the wear down
looks with these and this is one of
those where you start to see
like the inner part of your lower lip
sort of show through with this color and
it becomes very obvious very awkward if
you're not planning to really be on top
of it and touch up that product so
pretty shade but I'm not going nuts over
it now let's move on to the blue
collection if there is a purple in this
set that I like even more than the last
one and it's called freedom and there's
more of like a pinky orchid tone in this
shade and I think it looks gorgeous on
the lips actually it makes a little more
sense on my lips than just the
straight-up dark purple and I do really
enjoy it then we've got power and this
is the one I've been wearing throughout
the video and this is like a rich
chocolate brown and I'm kind of not sure
how I feel about it I wanted to wear it
throughout the video and kind of see it
on my lips even longer sort of come up
with a determination on this one but it
is a pretty comfortable creamy matte
formula the thing about the darker
shades as opposed to say the very first
one I tried on called confession which
was more of a mid-tone these darker
mattes I don't want to say they go on
streaky if you got to take quite a bit
more care to get them looking very nice
and perfect on the lips so keep that in
mind but I do think that's an
interesting shade and I don't hate it
now Legend is taupe if you're into a
tote lipstick like this is a topi gray
coming up we'll have another shade
that's like a little bit lighter take on
this color and if I was gonna go for
this type of shade I would go for that
other one that's yeah just this neutral
stone type color that you're used to
seeing you know in an eyeshadow on a
lipstick finally in this set we have
rebellion which is a true blue comes off
is kind of a deep blue on the lips and
there's another example where the
further you get from your natural lip
color the more the wear down looks
really odd but definitely a statement
shade can't take anything away from that
and now we're gonna move into the green
collection and I'm getting major like
old school Revlon moon drops lipstick
vibes with this set with the golden
detail and then the green and by the way
the blue and the green lipsticks have
somewhat of a marbled look to the tube
and then the black ones are just solid
black FYI but the first one in this set
is called fever and this is absolutely
pumpkin spice 100% I like the way it
looks on me but I don't know that I
would really seek it out from this
collection and under this price tag you
know I think I might have some other
in my stash that kind of look this way
they call it fever but that is without a
doubt pumpkin spice now glamazon when I
mentioned that there's something a
little bit lighter than that last taupe
shade this is it it's definitely a
little softer a little more Brown in
this shade which I think makes it
slightly more wearable although both are
just definitely trendy types of colors I
don't personally think they give a lot
of life to my face but if you're out for
that kind of shade it's in this set
okay balm on instinct we're talking a
shimmery olive green again not a fully
matte collection while most of the
things I've talked about
unless I've pointed it out have been
matte some have felt a little richer and
creamier than others but mostly matte
but this is not this is olive green with
some flecks of gold and shimmer and once
you get it built up on your lips at a
glance I feel like it just looks really
dark but if you just hang in there and
look at it for like a few seconds you
see the green and it's like oh I don't
know I'm not sure who out there thinks
they're pretty enough to pull off all of
green lipstick but go you if you've got
that confidence but for me I just I
can't make that look good on me
and finally urban Safari I really
dislike this shade so much this is you
race your lips nude and after trying on
this many lipsticks I might have a
little residue that's making my lips
more pigmented and maybe making this
shade make a slight bit more sense and
when I just wore it alone a few days ago
but it goes on really pretty streaky
while it is a matte lip it's not like
the full coverage matte look that I
could see out of some of the other
shades I'll take any of the deeper more
even more off-the-wall shades I'd even
take the olive green over this like this
just does not do a darn thing for me
so you've seen them all now are they
worth $13.99 apiece well I'm not gonna
be a brand snob to the point where I
look at that number I say oh it's coming
from L'Oreal I would pay that for like a
two-faced lipstick but not from L'Oreal
I'm not gonna do that because if I like
the formula or a color that's just
absolutely outstanding I'm not gonna
restrict like which brand I would buy
from you know what I mean but I do think
we have expectations you know we look at
L'Oreal we look at what their regular
line of lipstick is priced at there are
two shades from this collection that I
think are a supremely good texture
really nice glide onto the lips
fantastic staying power shades that I
would realistically wear quite a bit and
they are confession and domination
that's that toasted like mix of red and
rust which i think is really beautiful
and then this really rich warm peach I
think is just stunning now some of the
really deep dark mattes in the
collection aren't quite as like smooth
and soft as these I really feel like
there's something special about those
and now you might be thinking way to go
and way to go for those super basic
shades in the collection my like
runners-up or more statement shades that
I would be prone to going for from this
line would be freedom from the blue
collection that's that purple that has a
little bit of work it'd kind of thing
going on there and I think that's really
beautiful and power is growing on me
that's what I've been wearing throughout
this video and it's an example of a
really dark vampy shade that's still got
some earthiness to it like even as it
wears a little bit here on the center of
the lower lip like that makes sense to
me that doesn't look ridiculous but it
feels just a little bit drier than those
top two just want to let you know if you
were wondering like okay they're
charging $13.99 for these lipsticks is
it some transcendent amazing formula
happening here not really I don't really
think they go that far above and beyond
standard L'Oreal color riche lipsticks
if you're totally opposed to that scent
by the way that color riche scent is in
a lot of them does talk to that I
mentioned we're incredibly evenly they
look fantastic on the lips and they
apply like a dream I would definitely
pay the money for those too and another
reason why is because I would
realistically get a lot of wear out of
them too it's all very subjective though
we all like our different shades so
hopefully this gave you a little insight
into the collection thank you guys so
much for your time and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
