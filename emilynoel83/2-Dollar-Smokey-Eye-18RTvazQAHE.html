trying to save money these days or at
least you know maybe cut back anywhere
we can and one way i thought i would try
to do it since i am obviously doing
makeup videos is to come up with a
really cheap way to do a great smoky eye
and so i've done that today using only a
couple of products really from ELF and
the cost totals two dollars this is the
first product that I'm going to be using
its black licorice it is from ELF and it
is a duo of cream shadows that we can
use is a really nice base to intensify
our look and then we are going to use
their shadow quad which is also just a
dollar in drama and it's got great smoky
shades in there and we're also going to
use that for our liner as well and then
it's up to you guys whatever mascara or
lashes you want to put on for that but
as for the shadow look just two dollars
there for that and those products are
available at eyes lips face calm so if
you want to see how it all comes
together stick around hey guys getting
started with our smokey eye our two
dollar smokey eye we're going to take
the elf duo in duo shadow cream in black
licorice and we're going to use actually
both sides of this to prime our lids and
we're going to start off with this light
or silver east side so I'm just going to
use my finger to smooth that on my
entire eyelid and it smooths on pretty
easily you know you may want to just
lightly work it up to your crease as
well key here for this to really work to
your advantage is to use a thin layer
you don't want to go overboard with this
stuff or else I really don't think it
will serve you the way it should in
terms of helping your look last longer
so just a tip there go kind of light
with it and then on that darker shade
that really deep charcoal just get a
little bit of that you may want to use a
brush for this or if once again you can
just use your finger like I am and I'm
just going to get a hint of that on the
outer corner of the lid just to
intensify that base a little bit you can
see it's just a little bit deeper there
on that outer corner we're going to move
on and do our shadow here you can see
I've got a elf quad here that is for
different smoke great smoky eye shades
and I'm going to start out with this
light silver shade here it's kind of
shimmery and I'm going to use an
eyeshadow brush my ELF eyeshadow brush
actually and I'm going to apply this on
the inner half of my lid just in a
padding effect and I think you're going
to find you get the most color payoff
there just by patting it on okay and
then we're just going to use that same
brush I'm going to take its this color
right here to the shimmer a charcoal
shade and just dip into that once again
and use that primarily on the outer half
of your lid and just drag it up slightly
to the crease but we're going to really
focus on the crease here in a second now
we're going to focus on our outer v area
even more we're going to take that same
a charcoal gray shade I'm going to use
my Smashbox number 15 brush just dip
into that and sort of start thinking
about forming just that outer um that
outer depth there that can really serve
to make your eye look a whole lot bigger
and basically I kind of form that by
going in finding more of my creases and
going out sort of if I was going to make
a line from the corner of my brow or the
end of my brow to the corner of my eye I
would be like sort of hitting that point
with my outer corner of the V and then
come up from the outer corner of your
eye to meet that and you
sort of getting that rough shape there
so just sort of mess with that for a
little while work on some blending and
yeah just work it into that outer V
shape and then to deepen it up some more
we're going to use this great black
shade it's actually sort of a matte
black here and I'm using my ELF or if
not elf it's the essence of beauty fine
crease brush get a little bit on your
brush there and we're going to use this
to just enhance that that's outer V
really concentrate on getting it right
in here and then work it out into that V
shape and you just want to continue
blending until you feel comfortable with
this and you know don't put any too much
on at one time just continue to build
until you think okay that's where I feel
comfortable because we all have
different comfort levels where this sort
of a look is concerned and also
different times where more or less is
appropriate so you know what you're
using this for so you just use your own
discretion there by all means okay so
now that I've worked with that a little
bit i'm going to take a fluffier brush
I'm going to use my SD for a rounded
crease brush using this dark charcoal
shade once again and just lightly sort
of dusting around the border of what
I've done here in the crease for a
highlight with this kit you're supplied
with a nice matte white shade and I
would say don't go overboard with this
but get a little bit on an eyeshadow
brush put it on underneath the highest
point of your eyebrow arch and just sort
of drag it out word I'm not really going
to go crazy with that we're i'll let the
star of the show be the smokey eye that
we've got going on looking at a
cost-cutting measure here for for this
look you can replace eyeliner with the
black in this palette or the dark gray
if you're more comfortable with that and
just get an eyeshadow brush I'm going to
use my angle a liner brush actually and
I'm going to dip into that black shade
and just use this to line all around my
eye and I find that it's just as
effective really as any other liner goes
I'm going to look down into a mirror now
and just basically get that color going
all around my eye and then go underneath
and you can see how a little bit of this
you know clearly goes along the long way
this is a nicely nicely pigmented black
shadow and not only for just a dollar
not only are you getting that shade in
this kit you're getting several other
shades to work with and here's another
area where blending is going to be
necessary you see this corner here that
we're dealing with we're going to drag
that powder up just a bit and you can
kind of see that we've got we've got
this seamless sort of halo around the
outer outer corner there and so we're
going to try to duplicate that here just
by taking that line and sort of
extending it up with the black and then
going in once again with our fine crease
brush and just blending that out all
right guys now we get into the portion
where it's really your choice where you
want to take this look this is not
included in the two-dollar portion this
is sort of up to you and what you
already have in your collection but I'm
going to go ahead and apply a coat of
mascara and then I'm going to put on
some false eyelashes to really give kick
this look up a little bit so I'm going
to go ahead and curl my lashes now i'm
going to apply a coat of cover girls vol
exact mascara
alright now that we've got our mascara
on we could by all means stop here if we
wanted to but if you want to add keep
going with this at a little more put on
some false eyelashes I'm going to use my
ardell sexies in and I got these they're
just in black and there's no number on
these they're available at sally beauty
supply and the glue i'm going to be
using is the dark tone duo glue what you
can find at walgreens so just if you
want to see my tutorial just definitely
look that up on my channel for applying
false lashes otherwise I'm just going to
go ahead and get these on alright guys
that is the look for this two-dollar
smokey eye you can see it was not too
difficult but I think the outcome that
you get is really impressive for only
using um you know the cream base and
this and then whatever you know you want
to do with your eyelashes I'm really
happy with it so those products again
are available at ww is lips face calm if
you're curious as to what I have on my
lips it is my revlon colorstay mineral
lip glaze in lasting shimmers so thank
you guys so much for watching this
tutorial and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
