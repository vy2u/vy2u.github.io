two-in-one look using the Sephora
Pantone universe facets of Marsala
eyeshadow palette and the first look
it's not exactly one of those natural
barely-there looks but it is more
natural relative to the second part of
the look so it's got a lot of warm Brown
in it that's pretty much the star of the
show with just a little deep red punch
going on in the crease and then the
second look is really really dramatic
we're working in a lot of red but going
extremely smoky on the lower lash line
as well step one for the first look take
a little eyeprimer whatever kind you
like to use I am currently using the
primer that doesn't end Milani eyeshadow
primer I swear I feel like I'm never
gonna run out of this stuff then we're
gonna get some lightness going on here
around the innermost corner I'm using
this shade up in the upper corner this
does have a little shimmer to it I
really wish they would have included
like a light matte in this palette but
oddly they didn't like a matte highlight
shade so this is what we have to work
with in terms of a light cream color so
I'm just kind of gently patting that on
here on the first half of the lid or the
inner half of the lid then really the
key shade of this first look is this
warm brown right down here it can really
look dark when it's applied in a more
concentrated way or it can have this
really nice light warmth to it when you
sheer it out where I first place my
brush is where the most color is going
to go here in the crease so just go back
and forth really concentrate it in there
in the crease this is a matte shade by
the way really basic great kind of Brown
wow that was a great description what
kind of Brown is it it's a great breath
I pick up a little more color and I'm
going to now gradually take that up
above the crease a little bit I'm using
up a lot of that space that I have
between the eye and my eyebrow with the
shade and then to really make it look
finished I'm going back to this light
color
going directly under the eyebrow and
kind of overlapping the border of the
brown then back to this brown shade we
love so much that's gonna go down under
the eye and I'm using a pencil brush
here just to make sure I get the softest
application I can get here for the under
eye area I would say if I wanted it
really concentrated I would use an
angled brush if I wanted a little more
smudged out I'd used my e21 smudge brush
but for these purposes I want it really
really soft so I'm using pencil brush
and same brown shade I'm picking it up
with that medium shadow brush just gonna
Pat a little bit of that here on the
outer part of the lid give us a little
more base color here on the outside and
then you could totally stop here if you
like to look the way it is but I want to
bring in even for this more subtle look
I want to bring in a little bit more red
so I'm gonna go to this shade right down
here it's a really dark reddish brown
and I am using my Sonia Kashuk small
shadow brush and I'm just kind of
patting or practically feels like I'm
just stippling this shadow here on the
outer part of the lid overlapping where
I put the warm Brown first kinda
bringing it inward almost to meet that
lightest shade and then just flipping
the brush over wedging that color right
there on the outer part of the crease
it's gonna give us some nice reddish
warmth here and the amount of this shade
that you apply I think will determine
you know how dramatic this this part of
the look becomes for you you could just
apply very little you could really build
it up the choice is yours my friends but
once you're kind of settled on the
amount you want I'm bringing in the e25
this is the same brush we used to blend
out the brown and I'm just going over
the reddish tone there and I am gonna
pop this light liner on the inner rim
because I do think when you're working
with these reddish tones it's good to do
something with the inner rim whether
it's black or something like this just
anything to take away the sort of peachy
pink tone that our inner rims naturally
have I think it just brightens the eye a
bit
or I also really like black on the upper
lash line because it just provides a
nice amount of contrast with these
reddish and brownish shades you know it
looks really clean so I'm using this
smashbox always sharp liner in raven so
i'm just gonna take this all the way
across my upper lash line and i'm not
weighing it out at the outer edge i
might be thinking thickening the line up
just slightly there toward the outside
but nothing crazy and just curl the old
Blash is there I don't know why I'm
feeling a little bit sassy this morning
and I haven't had nearly enough coffee
to truly develop a sassy attitude and I
feel like my voice still sounds like I
have a cold but I really you know I'm
not feeling the symptoms it's just like
hanging on a little bit this is lights
camera lashes mascara just gonna do a
quick coat of this on the upper lashes
if I really wanted to do the lashes up
big-time for this step I would take that
amazing Estee Lauder little little black
primer that I reviewed over on the
Express channel that stuff is the bomb
and I would put that underneath this for
a really great effect lower lash line
the old favorite covergirl clump crusher
water whoa oMG nearly elbowed off a
whole basket of products over here umm
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
here on the lower lashes other accents
to this part of the look would be my
blush I really like this cream blush
from pure minerals it's in the shade
called coy and I like it because you
know it's bringing some glow to the
cheeks but it almost comes off a little
bit neutral you know it's not too pink
not too peach and I of course applied
that with my ELF small stipple brush
what else and then I used my Mac cream
in your coffee lipstick this was shown
in my color lovers marsala video got
that all over the lips with just a
little bit of this Estee Lauder brick
lip liner on the outsides I applied this
afterward not as like a full-on base
under the lipstick but just to kind of
clean up the lines a little bit so
depending on your makeup preferences
this may be a daytime look this may be a
nighttime
but either way I'm going to show you how
to amp it up even more with a little bit
more of that reddish earthy marsala
color look who wanted to join mommy you
got scary eyes no one is not like the
other one part 2 of this tutorial the
idea is to just kind of drape the look
in that beautiful reddish tone I mean I
feel like it makes the eye look like
it's on fire you know in a good way so
what I'm going to do first is take this
shade here this is label on the back as
marsala matte I'm just going to Pat this
on the lid I don't want to totally
overlap the white but go over it a
little bit and just go all over the
crease as well you know flip the brush
around just really lay down this reddish
tone all over and then I'm just going to
lightly blend around the edge if
anything I've done there with a bear
brush and then I really want to deepen
up my crease a little bit more so I'm
going down to this wonderful
reddish-brown we use that a little bit
earlier I'm just getting that right
there in the crease just darkening it up
the challenge when you're doing these
tutorials one eye at a time it's like
how dark exactly did I make the first
eye and I want to make it even and
everything we've added some red we've
deepened up the crease and now we're
gonna work above the eye really getting
a nice faded effect up here I'm going to
go to Marsala satin which is right here
next to the matte this is my Sigma e30 6
brush it's a really really light weight
so it's only gonna apply a little bit of
product at once and I'm just really
softly applying that red here all around
the outside is creating so much warmth
here around the eye area and then I'm
going to go to this orange it's kind of
like an orange e Brown but really really
warm and beautiful and I'm going to take
that on the inner part here so above the
crease really taking it way far in way
close to the brow then going back to my
e-40 which is for the most part bare and
just buffing over that edge and I'm just
going to tap into that light highlight
shade one more time just to kind of
reinforce some brightness
right there under the highest part of
the arch lots of changes to the under
eye area as well but I'm going to start
off with liner because that's kind of
sort of established everything we're
doing here so we first just had a black
pencil I'm now going to go in with some
black liquid I'm taking it really far in
here to the inner corner also we're
going very dark around the tear duct so
just going all the way across the upper
lash line and then when you get to the
outside not doing a major wing or
anything but just kind of a light
delicate wing I guess you might say
there on the outer corner and did that
lovely little song you might be hearing
in the background is the mobile in the
other room somebody wanted to listen to
that I think they did anyway
and a big key step to this other part of
the look is to remove that light liner
in the waterline and we're going to
replace it with black so I'm just using
a q-tip to get that off and a little bit
of remover since that Milani pencil I
used earlier stays in there really well
I'm just going to take that Smashbox
always sharp liner and put that in here
I am really not holding back with the
darkness on this look so not only am I
getting it on the waterline but I'm kind
of taking it just down in between the
lashes you know I'm really covering the
whole lash line kind of just taking it
down on the actual skin do you ever wish
you had like a little assistant when you
were doing tutorials and you can be like
angled liner brush like like a dentist
in the dentist's office can you hand me
this brush next I'm going into this
really dark kind of plummy shade here
angled liner brush and I'm just
connecting up to my wing and sorry I'm
bouncing around with a lot of different
colors here but I'm going into this
reddish brown with a smudger brush
that's just gonna go all along this
lower lash line we're just kind of
creating varying intensities here like
first we just needed that precise part
now we're bringing some color downward
it's look it's probably as like dramatic
and smoky as I've ever gone in an eye
tutorial so this is pretty fun but I'm
going back to the warm Brown that made
such a starring role in the first part
of the tutorial and pencil
and definitely getting below that little
crease you know that many of us have
there under the eye and part of the
thing is that we have a huge lash that's
gonna go up top and so I kind of like
this big smokiness on the bottom to
balance it out I'm using these Koko
lashes in the style Soho and I will be
trimming off one little outer segment of
these so they fit my eye better so I'm
gonna pop these on the upper lash line
apply one more coat of some black
mascara there on the lower lashes just
because I think they got a little bit
powdery as we were adding all the
product and then I'll join you with the
finished look man is this bold and
dramatic or what I love Anna lips I had
a real brick red thing going on for the
first look and here I wanted to lighten
it up somewhat so I just did a blot just
with a tissue over my lips and then I
dabbed a little bit of a nude lipstick
this is myth from Mac any nude that you
want would do I was just looking for
something that wasn't too pink so I just
dabbed this really on the innermost part
of the lips and then blended again over
that with a little more cream in your
coffee just around the outside so kind
of a combination of these two lipsticks
lessening the effect of like that brick
lip liner that we had in the first part
of the look and everything face wise is
the same didn't add any more blush or
anything like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this two on one tutorial I
really had fun using this palette and
really I feel like I've only scratched
the surface you know we used a lot of
the reddish tones some of the Browns in
here Belle said I'm done with the mobile
I want to come back in the makeup room
can't say I blame her but as I was
saying with that palette you know you've
got all those greenish tones the gold
shades as well which will be fun to you
know continue to work with do some looks
with maybe show you some pictures on
Instagram and what else I do with this
palette it's crazy how from a distance
you know this just looks like kind of a
black smoky eye but you get close and
it's on fire you know you want to get a
look closely at it
oh she's holding it folks
by the way if you're interested in more
details on this little one I did post a
three and a half month post partum
