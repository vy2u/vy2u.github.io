tutorial I'm going to show you how to
use the Urban Decay Naked palette to go
from a really natural look to a dramatic
look the natural look is really easy to
achieve and it uses some of the matte
colors in the palette dramatic look
involves a lot of layering we take sort
of the neutral base that we had in the
first look and we top it off with some
deeper more shimmery colors to make a
really great smoky eye we also add on
false eyelashes and change up the lip it
was really something I wanted to do
because I feel like I've watched a lot
of great tutorials using the Naked
palette but they haven't either been
really natural or really dramatic so I
feel like I'm kind of showing you the
extremes of what you can do with this
palette and I had a lot of fun with it
to see how I put it all together keep on
watching
step1 I just applied some Urban Decay
primer potion all over my eyelids so
it's ready to go it's ready to grab that
shadow and then I'm gonna use my ELF
eyeshadow brush just any flat brush
similar to this will do and we're gonna
go to the Naked palette and actually
choose the shade that is called naked
it's right here it's a matte shade and
it's very just kind of neutral just like
maybe a hair deeper then your skin tone
might be for some skin tones anyway it's
that's the way it is on me and so I'm
just applying that all over and you'll
notice that it really just makes like
your whole lid just kind of one color
and then I'm gonna take a fluffier brush
my Sephora rounded crease brush and some
of that same shade and we're just gonna
get that right here in the crease kind
of go up above if you want to you'll see
it maybe deep in your that whole area
just a little bit and then we're gonna
go ahead and work in a highlight I'm
using virgin which is this shade right
here just a very light shade it has a
nice little pearly tone to it that gives
you just a little shimmer but it's not
it doesn't have any glitter in it or
anything like that so it works really
nicely for this softer look and what I'm
gonna do is take a slightly larger
crease brush I mean it's smaller than
the one I just used but I mean just in
terms of kind of packing the color in
the crease I'm using my Smashbox number
15 and I'm going to go to the other
matte shade in this palette which is
called buck it's right here I'm just
kind of a medium brown really basic but
just get a little bit of that on your
brush and just apply that there in your
natural crease and it's gonna blend in
there really easily since you've just
applied another matte shade underneath
it it's just gonna really allow it to
blend very nicely there for you we're
gonna do some different things with
shadow on the lower lash line but for
now I'm gonna go ahead and do the upper
liner which I'm going to take the 24/7
glide-on eye pencil and 0 that's the
black shade this comes with
palate there's a brown and a black and
I'm going to use the black and what
we're gonna sort of do is go from the
inside out really keep it very light on
the inner part and then we'll just
thicken it up and get a little bit
darker as we get to the outer edge so
I've gone all the way across my lash
line excuse me and just extended it out
a little bit and then just to soften it
up I'm taking my finger and just kind of
taking short strokes with my finger over
the top of this and you'll find it just
softens it up a little bit and it just
makes it just a little bit lighter and
if it still doesn't look perfect that's
fine this doesn't have to be a perfect
line at this point and then I'm just
going to draw up a little bit from the
outer corner we're not going to really
do much lower liner at all but just a
little bit just there to kind of blend
so if you want to also go over that with
your finger as well I just find the
warmth of your finger can really help
that blend next up I'm going to go to
one of the darkest shades in this
palette and it is called creep and it's
right here it's kind of a sparkly black
it seems to have a little bit of a
bluish tone to it as well
I'm gonna take my angled liner brush and
just sort of dot over uhm the eyeliner
we've put on its gonna make it actually
look even though we're adding more
product to this it's a it's gonna make
it look a little bit softer along the
lash line so go over basically
everything you've done there including
as you can see just that part here on
the outer edge as well alright now that
you've got that I'm gonna take a
smallish a smudge type brush this is my
Smashbox number 33 you can see it's just
a really little brush and a pencil brush
would work well here also I'm gonna go
to the shade labeled toasted and it kind
of has the appearance of sort of that
taupe with a little bit of a pinkish
purple undertone to it and so with that
I'm going to just overlap that liner
there
and take that all the way into the inner
corner here so the small brush is
getting me a lot of control to allow me
to do that and it's just gonna really
brighten it up and do some interesting
things for your lower lash clean that
brush off and go back to virgin the
lightest shade the shade we used as our
highlight and I'm going to take a little
bit of that right in under here so it's
kind of an interesting look because
we've got matte in the crease you know
Matt pretty much all over the upper part
but then we brighten it up just a little
bit with some shimmer on the bottom next
I'm going to curl my lashes and I'm
going to apply two coats on the top and
bottom of this urban decay skyscraper
multi benefit mascara so it's kind of
got a large rubbery brush but it really
builds length very nicely so I'm going
to apply a couple of coats of that and
then I'll join you with the finished
look
alright guys here is my finished look as
you can see it's super simple it didn't
take a long time to do and would be
great for those mornings you know that
you're in a hurry but you still want
kind of a polished look that you don't
want to have to put in a whole lot of
effort and blending and working with
really dark shades because this can
actually you know just some lighter
shades and some mascara a little bit of
liner to just define the eyes can really
make them pop so I also another step
that I wanted to do was to put a little
bit of some white eyeliner just on the
inner rim and you can see I had it on
this one and it does make the eyes pop a
little bit more seem even rounder and
more wide-awake so this is kind of a
good way to use that technique as well
and with this palette I mean you see so
many dark shades you see so much
variation it kind of makes you wonder
well how would I use this for a natural
look so hopefully this gives you some
ideas and on my lips I'm using a
somewhat neutral borderline rosy brown
one of my current favorite lipsticks I
would say it's from Rimmel and it's the
lasting finish lipstick in paradise so
as you can see it's got a little bit of
shimmer to it but it's really subtle
just a great neutral for I think
multiple skin tones because it just
gives you that hint of rosiness to kind
of perk up the face a little bit and
then just for some gloss on the end
added fullness on the lower lip I used
my MAC dazzle glass in sugar rim so you
can see I was just crazy Sparkle there
but if you just put a little bit on the
lower lip I think it really makes it pop
and um for just a little bit of color on
my cheeks I applied a light layer of
bronzer over my foundation and then on
my cheeks I use this new NYC New York
color cheek glow I think it's limited
edition the shade is cherry blossom so
it actually looks like just a true like
pinky kind of very cheek color but it
goes on very sheer so anyway that is the
natural look and now I'll show you how
to build on this and make it more
dramatic
all right we're gonna start transforming
the natural I look to the more dramatic
so here's how I went about it I got out
my naked palette and I went back to the
toasted shade which is right over here
again it has sort of that pinky purpley
undertone and I'm taking my ELF
eyeshadow brush and basically going to
like coat the entire lid and up to the
brow area with this shade so it's not
only going to deepen it up it's just
gonna make it all pretty much shimmery
and this is gonna be sort of our
starting point for the look next go back
to virgin the really light shade in this
palette get a little bit of that on the
tip of the brush and just overlap
toasted just going right underneath your
brow next we're gonna go to hustle which
is kind of like a plum II Brown right
here in this palette take a sort of
medium sized crease brush I'm using my
Smashbox number 15 and just apply that
all over your crease and I really like
what this shade does when it overlaps
with with toasted so they look really
nice together so that's kind of why I
wanted to do that wash of toasted
underneath because I feel like when I
layer the two it gives a really pretty
effect so again just go all over I'm
kind of hitting the crease but I'm
taking it up above as you can also kind
of pulling the shade over to an outer V
but the deepest part of that outer V is
actually going to be a different shade
so just kind of again we're layering the
shades we're getting new looks out of
these shadows next we're gonna go back
to one of my favorite shades in this
palette which is creep we use that just
a little bit to top off our liner in the
natural look so I'm going to use my fine
crease brush from my essence of beauty
crease brush duo and basically we're
going to be taking it going right off
the corner of that liner deepening that
whole area up here for a nice outer V so
get a little on your brush and you want
to think about kind of first off getting
it
on the outer part of your crease so you
can even even though this is a crease
brush you can use it to apply some
product there to the outer part of the
crease and just kind of go over where
that liner is and you're gonna notice
that it really just blends in and gets a
nice dark appearance and then we start
building up building it up in the crease
starting to take it you know in a little
bit and also pulling it out as all these
shades overlap it's just really pretty
what they do and I'm also taking it down
just a little bit to kind of overlap
what we already did there and make it
look a little more smooth thing I really
enjoy about these Urban Decay shadows is
that they can blend out so easily even
the dark shades and to kind of prove
that to you now you can see how this is
a little bit more blended out here and
here we've got sort of some of those
rough edges just take a bare fluffy
brush and really just run it over the
edges and you're gonna notice it just
start to really disappear into the next
shade so it's they're very easy to work
with and blend and so that really just
makes our jobs a lot easier I'm taking a
little more of the virgin shade as well
and using that to help ease the blending
- just taking a q-tip and remove the
white liner that was on our inner rim if
you were going from day to night chances
are that may have worn off altogether
but if you are doing kind of an
immediate change and you're following me
all the way through these tutorials take
that off and then I'm going to use them
the Urban Decay liner in Xero and I'm
just going to put that on the waterline
it's going to instantly change the look
of the eye so just gently pull down and
apply that all the way into the inner
corner you can see just an instantly
deeper look it makes all the shadow just
appear a little bit smoky or tough my
liner brush I'm just taking a little bit
more of creep and just smudging out in
between the lash line just a little bit
but I do still really like the way the
inner corner looks so I'm not going to
really mess with that a whole lot now
that we've modified the shadow some
what I'm gonna take my ELF eyelashes
using the false eyelashes in the it's
the natural lash kit so I'm going to put
those on and you will again notice a big
change in the eye look and so once I
have those done I'll join you with the
finished look
alright guys here is the finished
dramatic look I hope you like it I
really love this take on The Naked
palette because there are some really
fun shades to work with to layer to make
the eyes just pop and really be a smoky
eye and you can do it with golds and
browns or you can do it kind of like I
did using some of the plum shades and
then that lovely black shade called
creep that you get in here that's really
really great so I hope you enjoyed this
look also something I changed with the
dramatic look is I took off the more
pinky neutral toned lip color and I
replaced it with the revlon colorburst
lipstick and soft nude so just a really
nude lip that I think makes the eyes pop
even more and makes even more of a
contrast going on there so again thank
you so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this 2 in 1 tutorial and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
