for under $20 it's part of the $20
makeup tag and I was tagged by several
people and a couple of the first to let
me know about it for deep a makeup queen
and it's Tootsie time so thank you both
so much is right up my alley because I
love drugstore makeup so I'm gonna walk
you through exactly how I got this look
so keep on watching I started off using
a product from essence called forget it
three-in-one concealer so it's got
several concealer shades and I'm really
using this as a foundation substitue use
the skin tone concealer kind of just all
over my face to sort of fill in for the
fact that I wasn't wearing a foundation
then I used the pink to just brighten up
certain areas around my eyes and I found
that the coverage was really good with
this I broke out my ELF warm bronzer
anything with multiple shades is a
really good thing to use if you're
trying to minimize products anything
like that can tend to be a little more
multitasking so for a dollar
I used my ELF face brush and I went to
the lightest shade in this palette first
which really doesn't have hardly any
shimmer at all and I kind of used that
to set the concealer in my under eye
area and it worked perfectly and then
after that I just swirled it in all the
colors and used it as a light bronzer /
powder to just set everything I did all
over my face and I was really happy with
the result there since brush selection
is kind of at a minimum for this makeup
challenge I use the same brush to go
into my ELF natural radiance blush and
glow this is a great kind of peachy
golden shade ready to I went to my
silent treatment trio from wetting one
the sponge tip applicator provided and
sponge tips can be great I went into the
peach brow bone shade and put that all
over my lid then I also use that
applicator to take the taupe eye lid
color and I put that on like the outer
half of the lid then for a dollar
I wanted to feature this because I love
this brush so much it's the professional
eye crease brush from ELF
for starters that
back in the eyelid shade and just work
that into my crease some more and then I
took the really dark crease shade and I
worked that into my crease and even more
in the outer corner and this was like no
sweat you know I wasn't sacrificing
anything and that was my whole idea what
this look was to not sacrifice you know
different typical steps of makeup and to
try to make it as normal as possible for
my personal routine went to my liner and
there's a great product from wet and
wild as their color icon liners and I
have one in dark brown this is both an
eye liner and a brow pencil all in one
and so this is great I use this to line
my upper lash line and it glides on
rather easily did it in a little more
smudging you lighter way on the lower
lash line and while I'm at it go ahead
and fill in the brows a little they
don't have to sacrifice brows if you've
got a product like this as in a dark
brown shade it can really work for a
dollar I incorporated another bargain
tool that I love which is the elf
eyelash curler and I applied some of the
Wet n Wild mega length mascara in this
mess hair is a little wet for my liking
it's on a rubber brush then I applied
the elf natural lashes for a dollar so
false eyelashes can be done with within
this challenge I think this comes with
its own glue I'm not particularly fond
of that glue but if you have nothing
else it really can work just allow it
enough time to dry before you place the
lashes on your lash line and then kind
of blend again with your mascara and
apply a little mascara on your lower
lashes finish off the look with a peachy
lipstick this is from Wet n Wild and
it's number five one six C and this is
less than a dollar I was using that I
thought you know to provide a little
extra glow to the cheeks why not
just use the lipstick there lipstick is
a great multitasking product you're done
with that you've finished the look well
thank you guys so much for tuning in for
my $20.00 makeup tag and thanks to
everybody who was interested in seeing
me do this this is really a lot of fun
and I think it would be fun to actually
do more combinations for this tag
because people don't realize how many
different directions you can go with the
makeup look and how do
use different things as sort of a
multitasking way terms of how it turned
out I'm really happy with the eyes even
though the elf lashes aren't my favorite
because the band can be a little flimsy
it can work if you you know if that's
all you might have access to
I love the wet and wild shadow I like
the wet and wild lipstick the elf blush
the elf bronzer in terms of the elf
tools I don't love I don't love this
face brush but the eye brush is I think
a must-have this is a terrific size for
doing outer corner work mascara was a
little wet for me the liner is not
wonderful staying power but the essence
concealer anytime you're in a pinch for
either time or money you know look to a
creamy concealer because that can tend
to double as a foundation so thank you
again guys so much for tuning in have a
wonderful day and I'll see you again
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
