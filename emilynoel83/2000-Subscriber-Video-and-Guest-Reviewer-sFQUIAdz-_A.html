little different kind of video as you
can see I have someone joining me right
now it's my husband Tyler and I'm
sitting on is me that's why I wasn't
here because as many of you have
commented in the wedding video he looks
like a giant compared to me so anyway
this is going to be a celebration video
because earlier this week we reached the
two thousand subscriber mark which is
awesome and also this week I started my
new position as a morning anchor at the
TV station where I work and it's going
really well but it is also taking a lot
of my energy and so I still want to make
sure I put some energy into the videos
here so we have a special review and it
is not a product I use it's a product he
uses and it's a lip balm what is it
would you like me then it's a cocoa
butter lip balm
it's a cocoa butter lip balm and the
brand is what cocoa care okay and where
did you find this you gave it to me
okay we found I found it at Walgreens
and this is what it looks like okay at
this yellow tube it was for 99 cents
when I found it it was in this big tub
at Walgreens 99 cents apiece and I also
later on found it packaged like this at
Big Lots for a dollar
it says the yellow one at the top that's
apparently the slogan here it has an SPF
15 it claims to condition and protect
your lips
and this is something this is like the
only beauty thing
the closest beauty possible thing that
you use right every night before you
little bit so you're telling me you've
got a lip balm that works well enough
that you only apply it at night before
you go to bed that's exactly what I'm
telling you well why do you think that
would be a good thing for other male
viewers who may be watching this right
now well I'm assuming most male viewers
are like me and they don't want it when
they're in the middle of something bust
out the stick a chapstick or whatever
and start messing with their left so
exactly works great for me good sense
but I think people might have a little
bit of a hard time believing that you
can use this once a day and not need it
anymore it's out today so you have to
show me how you apply it quick tutorial
for everybody here it's very basic just
for you guys
okay you're not even using a mirror
application okay so you know just
putting like one layer you're maybe
going around like two three times flying
pretty intensely okay
so you're wearing it and it looks like I
mean I can't see anything on your lips
so if you're one of those people doesn't
like to look like you're wearing a color
on your lips I can't see that I can't
see anything really shiny about it but
what does it feel like on there pretty
much feels normal
what is it what does it smell like it's
probably if you guys are familiar with
cocoa butter products it's probably a
very typical scent compared to that but
obviously at once your ice is really
well if it's something you can put on
once before bed what used to happen oh
dear what my lips would get really dried
up and cracking especially when I was
sleeping you know I actually developed
the crack right under here really that
would crack every night and would you
still be using whatever you use
something so different products like
Carmack's I think he's like chapstick
that he would apply throughout the day
still didn't work as well as this which
he only applies at night before he goes
to bed
and what the concern we're having with
this now is that we can't find this
anymore
at Walgreens that tub that I was telling
you about
where a bunch of these were there for 99
cents it's not there anymore and I am
afraid of what will happen when he runs
out of this stick and then this stick
runs out and because this works so well
and so what we are asking you is tell us
if there is a comparable product or if
you know how to get access to this and
we're talking for a cheap price we don't
want to pay I mean if you guys have some
suggestions of something awesome that's
like 15 bucks that's a little much I
think more than he wants to spend for a
little all right what's your price range
here few dollars five dollars or less
five dollars or less okay so we're
talking then or something that also
works as well as this a cocoa butter
formula because you convinced okay
bottom line last last statement here you
can make about this product
why why is it so good because it's a
they only need these at once once a day
that sets me up for the rest of the day
once a day guys girls that sounds like a
pretty good thing so let's see how much
time I have left here we have a little
time left I don't know if people knows
but Tyler is
going to be a third-year law student
this fall he has an internship this
summer at a law firm in town and how are
you liking it so far I like it quite a
bit it's a lot of fun all the reading a
lot a lot of reading research and stuff
like that but then that's good and like
I said I'm in my first week at my new
position it requires me to get up at
1:30 in the morning be to work by 3:30
go on the air by 5:30 and then I can be
out of there by as early as like 10:00
between 10:00 and noon so that's a good
deal and really like how it's going so
far I had my second day of morning
anchoring today and getting a little
tired right now I will admit but I'll be
going to bed pretty soon yeah so alright
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video and enjoyed
meeting Tyler and please leave some
comments give him some help for crying
out loud we need that we need some cocoa
butter little something that works
alright my line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
