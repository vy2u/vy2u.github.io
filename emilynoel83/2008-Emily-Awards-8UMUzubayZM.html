this video um this is going to be
something kind of special since it is
the start of the new year I thought it
would be fun to look back at 2008 and do
something called the Emily Awards so
kind of a play off of the Emmy Awards
but I'm kind of a dork so I chose to do
that but basically what I'm going to do
is highlight my favorite products in
every category which is something that
people have brought up maybe you know
maybe you should try that and I just
thought this would be a good time to go
ahead and do it just because just
looking back at 2008 it's not all like
new products that were newly introduced
in 2008 but just products that over the
past year I've used quite frequently or
really enjoyed how they work so you can
see me looking up a lot so I've got them
here on my dry erase board up there but
I'm going to go ahead and get started I
am going to go kind of fast I'm not
going to really individually review
every item but I will tell you what it
is and a brief description of why I like
it so much so the first one is the best
liquid foundation and you've heard me
talk over you know over time a lot about
Revlon Colorstay it is a very good
foundation but as the year has gone on
there's been you know one particular
foundation that's really just worked
great for me great staying power great
color to match my skin and that is the
Rimmel lasting finish in number 200 soft
beige available at your local drugstore
it says it's a 16 hour transfer
resistant foundation and it truly lives
up to to its claims there I use this a
lot on air we're anchoring and things
like that and it lacks well beyond you
know the show and the bright lights and
all that it holds up to it very well the
color really matches my skin tone well
and so this has just been the product
that over the past year I've gotten a
lot of use out of and I've repurchased
several times so moving on now to the
best mineral foundation 2008 was a year
when tons and tons of mineral
foundations came out but I believe my
favorite is the everyday
minerals in the intensive formula now
you'll note it this is available at
everyday minerals calm and there are
several different formulations that they
have some are less coverage Center more
and intensive is their highest coverage
narrow foundation I'm the story's been
very impressed with how this cover
squads and you get really a lot for your
money my color here is medium beige
neutral and it just works so well and
this is another thing that you know I
can lend this on camera and it can hide
a multitude of flaws and it can also
double kind of to conceal some areas too
so it is definitely my favorite mineral
foundations come from everyday minerals
and of those is the intensive formula so
very good coverage there as for bronzers
my favorite bronzers um I really like
the matte bronzers I think if you only
could have one it would be best to have
that because it gives you the most
natural look you can use it all over
your face and you can use it as a
contour and one that I've just really
liked over the years so over this past
year has been the Milani sunset duos and
I have a few different colors this one
is Sunset Beach it's probably my
favorite it's a great contour shade it
just looks good all over your face very
natural not too much at the same time
you got to work super hard to get the
color to come off on your face so it's a
very nice kind of instant tan there so
that is my favorite bronzer and then
it's a drugstore buy you can get that it
mmm excuse me probably your local
Walgreens CVS or something like that um
next favorite blush this is gonna be a
tie between everyday minerals which is a
my sample size of Sunday brunch and what
this is I'm gonna have to really try to
describe it because I don't know that
you're going to be able to see it too
well but this is kind of a pinky blush
with some reddish tones that really give
you a natural blush look on your face
but a little goes a really long way I'm
going to have the sample for a long time
if you're familiar with everyday
minerals and you know this color you're
saying yes you know that is a really
good shade it's got sort of a um a berry
tone to it almost but with some reds and
reds I mean that natural flushed look is
really what you can achieve for that pop
of color on your cheeks so mm-hmm I
really recommend that but as for a
contouring blush this is sort of my tie
here
it's the covergirl cheekers in golden
pink this is what I use almost daily to
contour right in here on your cheekbones
it just works very well it's sort of
kind of it makes you think of a bronzey
shade but it does have some pink to it
the golden this flatters a lot of skin
tones I've heard from a lot of people
that have I suggested this in the past
they've tried it and said yeah that
works really well for me too and I don't
even have your skin tones so um that's a
really good option there we purchase
that multiple times this year so those
are my two favorite blushes now for
concealer um really a couple of godsend
products here especially to get rid of
under-eye circles
it's the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer
kit with the concealer up here and the
and the pale yellow powder up here my
color is natural and you can use that
just all around your eye and I'm also
you guys I use the corrector with that a
lot of times in bisque which is sort of
a little bit family peachy shade and
those you yeah using the very you know
big problem areas on the inner and outer
corners so these kind of work
cooperatively together very high-quality
more expensive you could have to go to
google Bobbi Brown's website to purchase
that online if you wanted to if you
don't have a store near you that carries
that but it is a wonderful wonderful
investment
I think concealers are one of those
items that you do kind of need to really
find a good one and this is definitely
the best you can also find these on
qvc.com QVC will maybe put some special
deals on stuff like this so actually I
think that was how I got it I think I
got them together
um the corrector and the
concealer kit so that is definitely my
favorite concealer and the under-eye
area is very important so moving past
the face stuff though now to shadow my
overall favorite shadow this is just I'm
just saying across the board a shadow
that no matter what color I have it in
I'm going to like it it the consistency
is almost creamy I use it just so much
and that is Smashbox this is available
at Sephora calm this particular kit I
have is in smokey eyes the colors are
just so pigmented you don't have to work
hard to blend it the I love the texture
I have in it and like I said you know
it's a good shadow they're a good
product when you get it in almost any
shade and you still like it you know you
know it's a good formulation so that's
my overall favorite shadow but if I was
going to pick one individual eyeshadow
product that I really really like this
year it would be from Jane the be pure
mineral shadow in Red Rocks but what it
is it's actually um it looks like sort
of a topi plummy Brown and then a light
kind of a dirty champagne shade I would
say just not a pure white but sort of a
little bit baby there and this was the
color that I used in my I think I called
it like quick and easy natural or
neutral eye and a lot of you really
enjoyed this and went out and got this
and I just continue to recommend it I
think it's so easy to use it gives just
the right I don't know shadow to your
eye without a lot of work you can use
these two colors and you'll be good and
so that is just the single the single
best shadow if I was going to just pick
one that I really really liked that one
now as for liners this isn't kind of
come as a big shock to any of you that
Revlon Colorstay the liquid and the
automatic pencil are just tops on my
list and they probably will continue to
be for some time
love the liquid for my upper lashline
and then the pencils in whether it's
black brown black the blackberry shade I
like them all and I used those
underneath here I don't get smudging I
really really enjoy that enjoy those
liners and so yes definitely my favorite
liners this year
as for mascaras um I've always enjoyed
the ever since I first used it the
L'Oreal hip mascara and this is one that
I'm really surprised I don't hear more
from people about how awesome this is
because this is the false lash effect
right here and this is L'Oreal hip
that's available at the drugstore it's
sort of if you're not familiar at all
with it you know it's the more colorful
you know line of makeup from L'Oreal but
this I have this in black it's hip high
intensity pigments and the eye it's just
absolutely fantastic kind of a long
brush is the traditional brush not the
rubber brush and it really just works
wonders with your eyelashes and then
just a good everyday mascara that I
really like is the Max Factor 2000
calorie mascara another drugstore find
they're especially like this brush I
just like the shape that it's kind of
narrower in the corner makes it very
easy to get into the smaller lashes the
shade is very rich in black and dark and
you got to worry about that kind of
coming off as too light on your eyes so
a couple of mascaras there that are
worth checking out now moving on to lip
stuff um for my favorite gloss I am
going to go with the Revlon Super
Lustrous
lip gloss I just think that it comes in
a variety of shades sort of along the
lines what I said about Smashbox you
know you give me a color in this and I'm
still gonna like it regardless
I like the nude shades I like the deeper
shades in this the texture on your lips
is not too sticky but it's sticky enough
to stay it's got a very rich look to its
kind of multi-dimensional this I'm
looking at here it's like peachy and
gold and it's got a little bit of
shimmer to it you know it's not just a
flat color so I really like that about
these lip glosses I think they're really
really great um my next thing lipstick
Mary Kay cream lipstick is really
phenomenal
I used the amber suede shade a lot I
think I've mentioned that in different
videos that I just use that a lot for
work but even the other colors this one
is like sheer blush it's a nice nude
shade these last forever I don't know
how they live so long but for some
reason the shades just last a really
long time I'm talking in terms of just
in the tube the fact that you don't run
out very quickly they go on well they're
nice and creamy they feel kind of
moisturizing on your lips and there's a
nice array of shades there too so expert
liner
I have several liners I like but the one
that I have trouble really duplicating
is the Rimmel exaggerate lip liner in
number 57 ravish and this is a true kind
of red shade it's really pretty it's I
mean just awesome
I've liked it a lot because it doesn't
fade outside your lip line it works well
with even if you wanted to do a lighter
gloss over it to kind of downplay the
red it's still not too loud and it will
work with a lot of different tones of
lip gloss or lipstick that you wear
along with it so now just a few other
just miscellaneous Awards here
outstanding brush I'm going to give it
to the elf eyeshadow brush because until
this year I had not found anything that
could really pack on the color like this
one could keep in mind I don't use a lot
of super you know high-end brushes but
this one really gets the job done it
packs on a lot of color and it's $0.99
on eyes lips face comm so definitely if
you haven't tried this one give it a try
because I think you're going to be
really impressed with how it works it is
well made I've not had any issues with
anything falling apart on it or shedding
or anything of that sort outstanding
tool I'm going to give it to elf again
it's the eyelash curler that they have
this is definitely one that you know if
something happens to this or I lose this
or misplace it I'm very worried because
I really just like the way it works
nice rubbery bass there that's to
squeeze your lashes in and then a nice
grip too so you won't slip drop it I'm
going to give an award for outstanding
packaging too strictly on packaging here
to the to face world domination tour
all-access backstage beauty collection
box here it's really like a jewelry box
that's filled with makeup basically and
I just think it's so cute it's got
little drawers that you know pull out
from the side you've got makeup down in
there this little girl spins around it's
just really awesome and very elaborate
and extravagant and so I think it
deserves a mention there and then lastly
my MVP my most valuable product cause
everything I've talked about the thing
that works best in its category I feel
like the one that will I can perform is
the Revlon Colorstay eyeliner this this
liquid liner isn't going anywhere if you
put this on you are it is on there man
and then the pencil I mean I use this
like a pencil and I go over it a little
bit with the powder I bought a little
bit of like light-colored loose powder
underneath or any power you got
basically and you really it's it's going
to work well I like the different shapes
they have and I think it's a great great
product so thank you so much for
watching this whole video I know it's
kind of long but I think it really
highlights some of the best products of
the year in my opinion so thank you so
much for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
