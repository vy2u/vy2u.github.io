in for this video this is the emily
awards for 2009 for I products this is
the second installment of the emily
awards if you like watching these in
order but you definitely don't have to
i'm just gonna go through and basically
let you know what my favorite products
are four eyes in 2009 and i gotta say
I'm really kind of breaking the rules
with this one because i have created
extra categories there are ties i mean
it's just this was really hard for me
just like for the face i have a high-end
favorite and a drugstore favorite for
each category sometimes more but anyway
let's just go ahead and get started
first thing is I primer and I'm going to
start with my favorite high-end and that
is going to go to two faced shadow
insurance if I had a dime for every time
I've gotten on done a tutorial and said
first we're going to put on our two
faced shadow insurance I mean even Tyler
has picked up on on the fact that this
gets mentioned a lot in my videos
because he's usually hanging around in
the background but um anyway this is a
product you can find at sephora i really
really like the staying power i think
that it goes on so smoothly but yet it
doesn't leave any sort of moisture
feeling on your lids throughout the day
it really keeps your lids feeling dry
and the shadow clings to it i just can't
say anything bad about this because i
put this on very very early in the
morning and even at the end of the day
my eyeshadow is still intact another
great thing is the packaging this is in
a squeeze tube unlike some other eye
primers that are in sort of with that
wand applicator that you pull out now my
drugstore favorite for eye primer it
does come with the wand applicator but
fortunately it's a lot less expensive so
if you wanted to get this one even if
you didn't feel like we were getting
maybe one hundred percent of the product
out of it it still works really well and
it is the elf mineral eyeshadow primer
and this just works in my opinion a lot
like the Too Faced shadow insurance this
gives the most staying power I've really
ever experienced and if you watch my
massive eye primer review you will get
more in
depth with all these products but put up
talking about primer wise here but this
is going to go on in like a as both of
these doing sort of a beige appearance
but then they kind of get colorless
basically as you blend it on it's very
smooth it will definitely collect the
shadow you put on top of it and help it
stay so that's a really nice option for
trying to save some money but you still
want a good eye primer next I'm going to
talk about favorite cream shadow and for
many people this is this means a base
that you might put on your eyes so you
put primer on and then you put a cream
shadow on so your powder shadow can
stand out really well and just really
have that bold vibrant color so for
high-end I'm going to go with a mac
product that was one of the first mac
products I tried and I really really
liked it and it is the Paint Pot and my
shade that I like is rubenesque and this
is a really unique gorgeous peachy gold
shade and so this is fantastic for just
giving your lids of radiant glow and
it's interesting to see how it kind of
transforms the powder shadow you put on
top of it sometimes if it's a more sheer
application some of this kind of shines
through and it's really really pretty
and this also does help extend the we're
quite a bit these do now for low-end you
have to be kind of careful with this
product not to put too much on but I
know it's a very popular product chances
are you've heard of it before but it is
the NYX jumbo eye shadow pencils these
come in a great range of colors so
that's one reason why I picked them but
also just the fact that using it in a
pencil form is so simple there's a lot
of different colors I just pulled out a
few that i have here for example iced
mocha very pretty shade very kind of
like a shimmery brownish medium tone but
you can just draw this right on your eye
but what I recommend is keeping it a
very sheer coat so you don't get crazy
and then kind of had it so you make sure
you don't apply too much or else it will
kind of have the reverse effect on
making your eyeshadow last longer
favorite overall I shadow brand for high
end I have a tie for a drugstore I have
a time and I have one
or products so I've got to get through
this somewhat quickly so high end and
I'll tell you why I picked what a bit I
have mac and Smashbox I really love
Smashbox for several years now I've been
using their eye shadow products you know
on and off have gotten them in gift sets
really really enjoyed them because no
matter what i try i just pulled one
random one out here this is from the
glamour eyes kit but no matter what i
try they all feel like creamy no matter
if its aim at smashbox shadow or a
shimmering one they all have that
velvety feel I really love that and I
love how consistent it is no matter what
the finish is of the shadow so I mean
while the color selection which is it's
nice good color selection I mean
probably as much color as anyone would
need but it's not quite as much color
selection as Mac however with all the
mac eyeshadows I don't always feel like
I love the texture of each and every one
of them while some go on super smooth
and feel like velvet like i said i love
that feel others might pull a little bit
or don't go on quite as evenly as I'd
like and so that's why Mac wins out on
the site of color variety and Smashbox
wins out on the side of consistently
always feeling good on the lids just a
few i have from matt just to show you
just how unique the colors are this
one's a shade called tracks and it's
like gold to lavender to almost more of
a pinky tone i mean it's so
multi-dimensional i love that some of
them really have that unique flair to
them i mean cranberry there's a
fantastic shade just beautiful colors so
I like that variety but also you've got
your classic standby carbon which I love
as well for a matte black but I feel
like sometimes there's so many different
finishes I don't necessarily like the
way all of them where has a hole from
Mac but I feel like all the Smashbox
ones feel so good ok I've talked enough
on that now I got to tell you my
drugstore favorite eye shadows
and this is kind of a big step for me
because I know I've said this probably
throughout the year that cover girl has
really improved the texture the feel of
their eyeshadows and I didn't really
think I'd be doing this but i am i'm
naming them my favorite in the drugstore
category for overall i shadow brand
because it really it there really has
been an improvement i have used
covergirl eyeshadow since i first
started wearing makeup and I've seen the
difference so I'm very very happy with
how they wear a couple of good singles
that I just pulled out brown smolder I
mean this goes on i mean it's just like
a a rich rich brown shade that really
takes very little effort to get it on
your brush get it on your eye and you're
not going back and kind of scrubbing it
on like I almost felt like I was doing
in years past with covergirl golden
sunrise that's a shade I use all the
time really sheer as a highlight so I
love those and then I've got to tie this
it's tied again Smashbox with mag were
tied and I've got to give it time it's
going to be tied with Milani because I
think well I don't necessarily like the
Milani shades that are in palettes
except for runway eyes which are I don't
even know I didn't even pull that out I
didn't plan to mention that but I like
those but I don't necessarily like all
the Milani shan't shadows that are in
the pallets you know how sometimes just
this that cut the shadow in the palette
is not always the same as the singles
are but the Milani singles for the
singles alone I named them an overall
shadow favorite because these have a lot
of them are shimmery but they have such
good color payoff flair is a great great
color that it's like a copper eight
orange gorgeous you can see the metallic
finish you can get out of these if you
wear them heavy enough and I mean just
nice color selection I wish these were
more readily available to people in
their drug stores but fortunately you
can find them on cherry culture calm now
for the little category i fit in here
which is I'm going to go mid level I
shadow this is
an eight dollar per shadow purchase if
you got one of these and I could not
leave it out but I could not find like a
category for it because it's not quite
drugstore but yet it's you know it's
less expensive than Mac or other
high-end shadows and I just could not
leave these out it's from glam couture
and it is that they're the bright eye
shadows if you look on the website
they're labeled bright eye shadows and
they're just freaking awesome I mean
look at these colors does that not like
just dazzle you to look at that I've
used these in tutorials I've also used
their pigments but the this one thing
the bright eye shadows are just
phenomenal this is night in Vegas I've
got to warn you if you go to their site
you might find that not all of these are
readily available right now there might
be a bit of a waiting list for some of
these but I mean they're so so pigmented
they're so gorgeous like like I mean
it's just one of those things where it's
it's effortless shadow you just put your
brush in it and go and you're you got it
so love those so much from glam couture
they're the bright eye shadows okeydoke
next we're going to talk about favorite
small pallets so type of palette you
might fit in a purse or a makeup bag my
favorite high-end is from be luscious it
was the first be luscious palette that I
tried and it remained my favorite the
entire time I kept trying other products
and it is the naturalist signature
shadow quad these are all matte shades
and you can't underestimate I've just
shown you the most glittery shadow I
could lay my hands on now I'm going to
tell you how why matte shadows are so
great but you can for all ages for I
mean all occasions using a matte
eyeshadow look with some of these
neutral shades this kind of a charcoal
brown and um this kind of creamy shade
these are so creamy and so blendable if
you want to have the easiest time in the
world blending shadows you've got to try
these what you're going to get is
something that's kind of plumbing which
I don't know if these these are coming
off with a hint more
they seem a little lighter here on
camera than they really are but a plum
type shade a cream a light brown and a
what is sort of like a charcoal / dark
dark brown and they're just so nice to
work with I really have enjoyed them
from day one that I tried that blending
is effortless really love it favorite
drugstore small palette has got to go to
cover girl for drama eyes this is the
smokey eye palette you should have this
if you want to do smokey eyes and you
will be stunned by how great this black
is right there it is i just put it over
a light shimmery that wasn't quite the
wisest idea ever but you are really
going to be shocked by how nice the
black is in this palette you get a nice
red to kind of warm up the look sort of
a burgundy a silver and a white smokey
eye has never been so easy so portable i
love that palette now we got to move on
to big palettes and i'm going to talk
about to um I don't know if you would
consider Coastal Scents high-end or
drugstore or really what you would call
it but I'm going to basically award them
in with two pallets for this category
the 88 warm is the first one that I'm
going to give the best large pallet
award to because this is the ultimate
selection of neutral shadows everything
from smokey too peachy plums Browns
Burgundy's it's all in there I've
recommended this palette to people and
I've heard from so many that say I love
this it makes getting ready for work
every day seem fun against no I don't
know when it was ever really all that
much fun but people enjoy that one and
then for people who are looking for a
colorful Coastal Scents palette I don't
I get this question so much which
Coastal Scents palette do I get and if
you're someone who is just starting out
or you just I mean you want to really
experience the full range of what the
brand has to offer the 78 palette is
where it's at because you're going to be
getting
matte shadows you're going to be getting
some shimmery shadows a whole range of
like metallic / neutral all the way to a
black shade to light shades and then you
get six different blushes in here so
just a good way to experience the whole
brand I have more in-depth reviews on
both of these products i believe so if
you want to check those that you'll get
even more info there now we're going to
go to the liner's eyeliner pencil I
don't have a high-end favorite but i do
have a drugstore favorite that I stand
behind to no end and it is the revlon
colorstay eyeliners and this was a huge
winner last year for me and it remains
that way this year just the staying
power is wonderful I can use it on my
lower lash line daily and not have
issues with it budging I like to top it
with a little shadow for a little extra
insurance there but black is great but
what I've discovered over this past year
is actually how great the other shades
are as well I like black brown but I
also love the teal shade and the shade
called blackberry that's like a pretty
plum so those are all great they all
have equally good staying power for
liquid liner once again I don't have a
high end favorite but I do fully support
revlon colorstay liquid liner in the
traditional little inkwell type tube
this happens to be the black shimmer
shade but either way this is what the
applicator is like its staying power is
phenomenal you don't have to worry about
that going anywhere at any point during
the day and when it comes right down to
it staying power is huge for an eyeliner
you you want that to stay that's coming
very close to your eye area if you have
watery eyes or you know your cried or
something like that I'm not saying this
stuff is waterproof but it is going to
last you all day assuming you didn't go
jump in a lake or something um other
favorite I just want to let you know
that while they have this format they
also have the pen I was skeptical of the
pen at first because I wasn't sure how
long it would last you sell how tight
that cap fit on there and that's what
allows this to be a juicy pin throughout
I hate how these kind of pins usually
dry out
this one less unusual a long time the
color may not be as intensive a black
because you're going to get with this
but you know it's pretty darn close and
if this kind of application bothers you
you might like the pin for cream and gel
liners my high-end favorite is Smashbox
Jet Set waterproof eyeliner truly a
waterproof liner you can put this on
your waterline I've put it on mine and
it hasn't gone anywhere on my waterline
the shade I have is in midnight blue and
this just is a very long wearing product
put it on your upper lash line your
lower lash line use a small brush it's
not going to go anywhere and it's just
got a nice pigmented creamy color it's
not going to drag it's going to just go
on very nice and smooth and then for my
drugstore favorite or once again I'm not
really quite sure where to go with
coastal scents but it's less expensive
than Smashbox so I'll call it my
drugstore favorite the Coastal Scents
gel liners wide variety of colors the
brighter ones make nice basis for your
shadow but stellar is a great shade it's
kind of a shimmery black that once again
has good staying power I don't know if
you saw when I reviewed these drew it on
my hand rev like crazy didn't go
anywhere once you give that a short
drying period it will not go anywhere
and now mascara feel like I'm flying
here but I feel like I'm this video's
getting so long mascara I've got
high-end favorite which I if you read my
blog regularly you know I love the
ultimate lash experience from be
luscious kind of a different-looking
tube here reasons why I like this the
brush is tapered at the tip so you're
going to get right in there to your
inner lashes and it's going to seem
easier than the gigantic brushes that
are not quite so tapered the formula is
a little bit drier meaning it's going to
build better it's not going to
necessarily with a brush like this it's
a traditional brush mascara and it's got
a lot of little bristles in there but
it's not going to make you look like
okay I've only got five lashes when I
should have you know three or four times
that many I
showing up so the dryer formula kind of
allows it to highlight each lash it's a
great brush it's a great mascara it's
really the whole package I had didn't
really have experience with this flaking
on me or anything like that so very very
good product there that'd be luscious
put out and then for my tie for my
low-end favorites I felt the need to
mention one that was a rubber brush
mascara because that is getting so
popular for so many people and one that
is a traditional um I really thought
L'Oreal hip was going to take it for me
again this year until i got i don't know
about halfway through last year and then
i realized that the almay one coat
nourishing mascara had to win I held on
to this container just for this moment
what I knew I would feature in the emily
awards because it sold I shouldn't be
using this anymore but I held onto the
container just so I could show it you
can see the brush has longer bristles on
one end short on the other a dry formula
mascara that's not going to be so wet
that again makes your lashes just team
up and you know go their own direction
this really separates works very well
and keeps them feeling not so hard and
brittle but they still have that kind of
soft feel to this so the one coat
nourishing mascara triple effect it's
like lengthening curls and volumizing I
think that's what it the claims are and
then the other one which has grown on me
throughout the year covergirl LashBlast
for a drugstore winner the brush is big
it's a rubber brush mascara I liked it
the longer I used it because the formula
got a little more dry but it really does
separate number one and number two this
does not smudge i have not had smudging
or flaking issues whatsoever with the
lash blast and if you want more volume
than this gives you if you put this on
first make this the first step mascara
and then use somethin else like a
l'oreal voluminous or something else
that's more like it just your
traditional brush and build on top
you're really going to get big lashes
anyway i'm dropping stuff that's all i
know that's all i got for the eyes i
hope you enjoyed this video guys
I'm sorry it feels like I'm talking
forever but I hope the information is
useful to you and keep tuning in for
more of the 2009 emily awards bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
