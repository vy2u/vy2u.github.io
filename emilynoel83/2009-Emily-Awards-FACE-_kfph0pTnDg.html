joining me for the first part of the
2009 Emily Awards I'm so glad to have
you here we're gonna be talking about
some of my favorite face products of
2009 now I did this video in 2008 and I
really crammed all my favorite products
into one video but I wasn't really
giving that many different categories
and I also didn't feel like I was really
able to get it in depth as I wanted to
get on some of my favourite products so
I thought let's just make a big thing of
this let's split it up into different
parts we'll do face lips eyes tools and
that kind of thing and just make it a
multi-part series so that's what I'm
doing here and what I'm going to be
doing with each category is giving a
high end in a drugstore favorite now if
you hear me say low end I don't mean low
end as in dressin you know low quality I
just mean low lower price range
basically for that item so I tried to go
through and really pick what my
favorites more I'll also let you know if
this is a two-time winner if this one in
2008 and it's coming through as a top
favorite again in 2009 and yeah I hope
you enjoy this I hope you get a good
feel for what some products are that I
absolutely love and maybe it'll become
part of your collection as well so we're
gonna start out talking about best
primers this wasn't a category that I
even had last year so I thought it was
very important to talk about this time
around my favorite high-end primer is
Smashbox photo-finish very very smooth
texture it's kind of like a gel like
formula but you smooth it on your face
and it's just not in the least bit
sticky it's very very smooth if you're
the type that likes to apply your
foundation with your fingers you will
notice the difference this makes in
application it helps your foundation go
on more evenly last longer and you can
just feel how evenly it spreads across
your skin so that is not a cheap item
but definitely a high-quality primer
that I love using on a regular basis
however now for my drugstore favorite
it's like a totally opposite formula but
I still really like it and I recommend
it to a lot of people it's the Rimmel
fix and perfect foundation primer so
this is available at most drugstores and
what you're looking
what this is more of a peachy creamy
colored primer so this is going to
smooth all over your skin your skin is
going to feel quite smooth it's not
gonna feel quite as silky as the
smashbox is gonna make you feel but at
the same time it's gonna practically
provide a little bit of coverage over
some areas if you heard me say peachy
and you kind of freaked out about that
don't worry it really evens out to match
any skin tone it just totally blends in
I've used it I've used it on people who
are definitely a different skin tone
from me and it works on us all so those
are my picks for best primer moving on
to liquid foundation I did not pick a
high-end favorite for this because even
though I have tried high-end foundations
I have not found one that I feel like I
could give the Emily award to the
prestigious award I know but anyway I
just have a you know several low end
ones that I would try if I could give
out more than one I might do that but
just gonna give one low end liquid
foundation favorite or drugstore but it
is from Maybelline it's maybelline
superstay makeup 24-hour you've heard me
talk so much about how I love Revlon
Colorstay and how I love Rimmel lasting
finish but a new one came through to win
this year and as I've used this more and
more I've loved it even more it smooths
on your skin so well it really kind of
hangs together as you as you blend it in
it doesn't dry too quickly to where you
feel like you've got to work so fast to
get it all blended in and also it truly
lasts a really long time and looks fresh
for a really long time like sometimes
when I will do my makeup so early in the
morning and then it's a Friday and I'm
up a little later
I mean we're practically reaching that
24 hour time period and even though I
like to be able to you know wash it off
and start again if I'm staying up
sometimes that doesn't always happen but
this stays looking so fresh I think this
is ideal for a normal skin type or maybe
a slightly dry skin type but if you have
oily skin I just recommend a smooth even
light layer of this all over your skin
and you can still make this work for you
my shade is classic beige and this is a
fantastic
foundation so that is going to be my top
pick for 2009 it's just a really really
great foundation and there are so many
good throughout stored liquid
foundations out there so if you take
nothing else from this just know that if
you can do a little trial and error try
to find your right shade you will find a
great drugstore foundation if you look
at Maybelline Revlon Colorstay or Rimmel
lasting finish moving on to the mineral
foundations my favorite for high-end is
going to be and and sometimes it's a
little sketchy when when these are
online brands it's like I have to go
just by price range and if I call it a
drugstore item it's like clearly the
product may not have come from the dirt
from the drugstore if I got it online
but if it's comparable in price to a
similar item you might find at the
drugstore I'm just calling it drugstore
just so there's no debate on that but
anyway favorite high-end mineral
foundation a lot of thought on this I
went back and forth a little bit but I'm
gonna say my favorite is from Sterling
minerals and it is the rose petal
foundation this is a velvet formula my
shade is Hannah and this is a silky
smooth full coverage mineral makeup that
is great for sensitive skin I actually
if you don't recall a lot that I've done
on this I have worn this in numerous
tutorial videos whether I've mentioned
it or just put it in my sidebar I have
used this quite a bit but when the we
had this huge storm roll through in May
of oh nine and it really wiped out power
for quite a while for me so I had to
when I went to the law school library
with Tyler I would blog about different
things and this was one of the things
that I blogged about because I love this
foundation so much and I reviewed it on
there and I talked about how really
really good it is if you have sensitive
skin so I really wanted to get the word
out about that one more time and then my
favorite you guys can probably guess my
favorite for a more low-cost alternative
for mineral foundation is from everyday
minerals and it's the intensive formula
that's the most coverage formula you can
get from everyday minerals so my shade
is medium beige neutral and this is
very comparable to the coverage I was
talking about with the Sterling minerals
only the Sterling minerals is gonna
cater more to your sensitive skin types
this is gonna be good on sensitive skin
as well it's just that's sort of the
trademark I think Chris darling minerals
this is going to be flawless coverage as
well good price I really like both of
those foundations moving on now to
concealer eye concealer so important to
me I hate looking like I'm tired like it
got bags under my eyes so I really try
to find the best concealers possible
my favorite for high-end and when I say
high-end I mean this is kind of pricey
it's the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer
kit and also the corrector creamy
concealer kit I have been natural and
what you're getting with that is a
creamy concealer on top and then you're
getting like a little loose powder in
the bottom that you can set that
concealer with it's very sheer it's not
gonna look cakey and then the corrector
is I have it in bisque which is a little
bit more of a salmony color and this is
going to do heavy duty color correcting
on those blueish circles so I love using
that that's you know one of my favorite
favorite concealer products that is out
there and these are separate purchases
but I kind of just lump them into one
because I guess I can if I want to write
my favorite drugstore or low-end
concealers for many people who tell me I
don't want to spend the money for the
Bobbi Brown what's the next best thing
I've got to say it's the Knicks or nyx
concealer in a jar this is a cherry
culture not oh my goodness
sorry that was loud this is the cherry
culture calm purchase and this is a
still a super creamy concealer you're
gonna get really nice coverage out of it
it's very similar to the Bobbi Brown
it's not why as deluxe and creamy
feeling but it still is the creamiest of
any concealer I've found from like a
drugstore option and I mean I feel like
you get quite a bit of product for the
price as well so I have that in light in
case you were wondering what my shade is
and then a product that I think is a
great concealer this was a tie then on
my my winners here for the drugstore
concealer
and it's got to be the maple a mineral
power because my shade is sand medium
0-1 but I have recommended this product
to quite a few people who have gone and
used it and said I love that stuff
people who have used this on blemishes
or under-eye this is actually a really
good coverage concealer it's got the
wand applicator it goes on very smooth
it's not gonna rotate your blemishes and
things like that so very good option
there I forgot don't know if I remember
to mention but the Bobbi Brown is a
two-time winner on that now we're going
to move on to loose powder and my
favorite favorite loose powder and I'm
gonna call it high end just because it's
just kind of a little more in that
high-end price range it's from Mary Kay
and it's the loose powder my shade is
beige one and this is a powder that you
put on top of your unit put your
foundation on you want to set it with
some powder this powder actually really
enhances the coverage you can get so I
just really like how full the coverage
turns out it's just really impressive to
me how nicely just how nice your skin
can look after you use it but if you
want to spend a little less and just
head right to your drugstore and be able
to pick something up the NYC smooth skin
loose face powder is a very good bed as
well I've directed quite a few people to
this loose powder is such an economical
choice you get so much product I think
everyone should have a loose powder in
their collection now we're going to talk
about pressed powder and my favorite
drugstore or I'm gonna go high in first
favorite high-end pressed powder I
thought a lot about this and then I
realized hey what have you been using a
lot lately that you really love and that
truly is a good quality pressed powder
and even though I don't use this with a
puff I use it with a brush but it's the
laura geller balanced and brightened I
had this in a small size it's lasted me
forever this is so good what you've got
is kind of a swirled multi-tonal
powder there that is sort of like a
powder foundation practically and I
wasn't really thinking of picking a
powder foundation but just a powder but
really I thought this is so nice in
terms of enhancing your skin kind of
correcting your flaws
I've used it more and more it's one of
those products that's grown on me not
every product is an instant favorite but
sometimes you realize the best way to
use it and you're like oh well this is
really great I like using this with like
a dense like maybe like a mini kabuki
brush you know like the kind that's on
sort of a longer handle and it's kind of
like say that big around and you can
really build up some coverage very great
for that product my favorite on the
drugstore end which I don't have with me
because I had run out of that just
recently and I'd haven't picked up a new
one yet but it's L'Oreal True Match a
very very good pressed powder provides a
lot of coverage in itself just very easy
to use smooth right on covers flaws and
that's what I think about with a pressed
powder you don't want something that's
just strictly powder that you put on
your face but can it do a little
something for you if that's all you had
so that's why I picked those bronzer
we're going to talk about high-end first
this is something that you're going to
be first hearing about from me on this
video because I haven't had the chance
to review it yet but I've been using it
so much lately and it's the Stila SPF 15
bronzing powder this is very similar to
the NYC bronzer and sunny that many of
you have tried I've recommended it to a
lot of you but this has a little more
color payoff you stick your brush in
this you're going to get a little more
color off of it and it's more pigmented
on your skin so it's matte it's great
for just all over your face is sheer
dusting just to perk up your skintone I
love it so much
my favorite on the drugstore side has
got to be the elf contouring blush and
bronzing powder from the studio line I
use this every single day especially for
this it I'm giving you I'm giving this
award for the bronzer in this it's matte
it's a little bit darker than you know
some of the bronzers that I've used but
it makes a great great cheek contour and
just you know just contouring different
parts of your face it's matte it well it
has just a teeny bit of shimmer to it
but it's very subtle overall I would
almost classify it as a pure matte shade
so it's just so undetectable on your
face and
a shimmer that it does have but I really
really like that moving on to a
contouring blush that means a blush that
is in a little bit of a darker shade you
know what I mean for that I don't have a
high-end favorite but I do have a
drugstore favorite and it's the
covergirl cheekers and golden pink
two-time winner love this product this
is just I feel like the perfect shade
for a cheek contour you might say well
you just said you could use the bronzer
for that well yeah I use the bronzer for
that but I use the bronzer in a much
more sheer layer if you really want to
do some heavy duty contouring this is
probably what you're going to want to
use a blush that you can contour with I
like using two tons of blush one is your
contour and one is the bright pop of
color on your cheek for that I also do
not have a of a high-end favorite but my
drugstore favorite is going to be Milani
minerals in my tie a gorgeous gorgeous
peachy pink that I've gotten so much
good out of it really brightens up the
face you use it right out in this region
on the sort of apples of your cheeks but
not too close to your nose because you
don't want to get too much like a pinky
redness going on there but right out in
here you've got your contour a really
good look for cheeks there next we're
talking about cream blush and there I
have two favorites my high-end favorite
it's going to be a Mac product it's the
blush cream in Posie and this is a
gorgeous gorgeous cream blush look at
that shade you might look at and think
wow that on your cheeks you know is that
like you know you want to look like a
clown or something but know this really
sheers out to be a beautiful natural
flush flush look on your skin you can
wear this under a powder blush and
really get some nice staying power there
or wear it alone for just kind of a dewy
glow really really nice this is one of
the first Mac products I tried now is
glad I did because I really really enjoy
that and for a low end cream blush I
guess this is cream but it's actually
mousse it's the maybelline dream mousse
blushes the one I'm showing you here I
like all of them like I really like
these blushes but peach satin is the one
I happen to be holding up here it's
almost like a highlight but it's just
very light it's got that whipped light
texture to it it blends so well
to the skin a lot of people even that
don't necessarily like the dream mousse
mousse foundation do end up enjoying the
blushes so I wanted to make sure I told
you guys about that on highlights we're
almost done with this whole video I
can't believe it but on highlights I
have two favorites my high-end favorite
is the Mac mineralized skinfinish and
soft and gentle been using this ever
since I got it I actually got this this
is a more recent purchase where some of
these I've been using it like all year
long some of these kind of came in at
the end and really surged ahead is that
like a Christmas time favorite and this
is the in soft and gentle I don't
remember if I said that but this is a
gorgeous highlight right on top of the
cheekbones but also kind of like using
this just putting my finger in it
highlighting that Cupid's bow area I
mean just a gorgeous with golden e it's
got some golden a shimmer to it it's
just a beautiful shimmery product I'm
really really happy with this that makes
me want to try more of the Mac
mineralize skinfinish products but my
drugstore favorite which is so
multi-purpose and I love that so it gets
bonus points for being that is the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips in
waikiki strip this is the peachy glow
bronzer i've used this a lot in my
videos you could use this as a shadows
each of these individual strips or just
kind of dust your brush through there
use the top part is the highlight the
bottom part is a bronzer and you are
good to go so this is totally
multi-purpose love that product now
we're going to talk finishing powder
fitting that the finishing powder is the
finishing product on this list and I do
not have a high end favorite but my
low-end favorite finishing powder is the
elf High Definition powder I reviewed
this I've been using it consistently but
for quite a while before I reviewed it
and pretty much every day after this has
been my final step in doing my makeup
you get a nice amount of product here it
comes with a puff which I don't use I
actually use a kabuki brush and then
you've got all that product there in
there that's a very fine powder it's not
gonna be I think I know I mentioned this
in my review but it's not going to
one of those products where you're like
oh my gosh look at the difference you
know it's a subtle product but what you
will notice is that your skin has a
slightly more airbrushed and flawless
look after you put it on and I think it
does have an impact on the amount of
shine you're gonna see in your look I
think it kind of functions to decrease
the shine a little bit so anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed all of those I think I
did like twelve categories of my
favorite face products both high-end and
low-end if I had a high-end and low-end
favorite so thanks so much for watching
I hope you'll tune in for the next
installment of the Emily Awards thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
