emily awards this is the fourth and
final edition that's not to say I won't
do any more like favorites type videos
with other sorts of products in the
future but for 2009 the emily awards
this is going to wrap it up and i'm
calling it my finale because it's a lot
of different categories at some random
categories i had so much fun probably
the most fun working on this part of the
awards because i just really got to use
my imagination and really talk about
some products that are sort of different
or that i like for some really different
reasons so anyway let's just go ahead
and get started on it the first little
award that i have is for outstanding
tool and this was an award I gave out
last year and I actually gave it to the
same product I'm giving it to this year
and it's the elf mechanical eyelash
curler the one-dollar eyelash curler on
elfs website I know they have some
different ones if I'm talking about the
one dollar one with the little black
handles on it this ever since I tried it
has been my favorite eyelash curler I
have ever tried out of anything I've
tried more expensive ones but something
about this this could be somewhat of a
personal thing because maybe it this one
just happens to like fit my eye shape
better but i have like had others
friends and family members try this and
they have enjoyed it very much as well
you get a nice grip on the curler
because of just the way it's constructed
there and there's something about the
pad here that is a little bit more
cushioning and i feel like it really
gives a good curl so I love the elf
eyelash curler only a dollar you've got
to look into that if you haven't tried
it yet if it doesn't turn out to work
for you I mean you only spend a dollar
maybe it'll work for your friend or
something but anyway that's my
outstanding tool next for best brushes I
get asked about brushes a lot and I have
a lot of like little random you know
brushes that I'll use here and there
that came from either a drugstore or you
know who knows where but if I had to
pick overall favorites and brushes there
are two brands for me that really stand
out as amazing quality now um I gotta
say I do love co
still sense precious I think they have
some really good ones but if you were to
say get a set of brushes and are you
going to like pretty much all the
brushes in the set I have got to go with
Sigma for Brett for best brushes and um
I really really like the brush set I
love how it comes in this awesome little
you know you you wouldn't have to get
this but if you have the option of
getting this great brush roll and the
brushes are in there the quality is
amazing I find myself for work using a
little travel brush set quite often just
because it's smaller and it's easier to
pop in my bag but I mean these brushes
are really awesome and they're so close
to the mac brushes I mean they really
are constructed and designed to be like
those brushes that just did a lower
price so I mean some people you know it
depends on what your personal budget is
you may still see the full sigma brush
set is a little pricey but it could also
be something you get maybe in
installments like maybe you get these
some eye brushes or some face brushes or
just work your way up however you feel
comfortable but just know that if you do
get into the Sigma brushes they are
great quality they're so soft I hope if
you want to know more if since I can't
really give you a full review in this
video I hope you'll check out the review
that I did do on the sigma brush set
because it gets much more in-depth than
I'm able to get into in this video now
there is another brand of brushes that I
couldn't quite leave out here because
when i'm using my mineral makeup these
brushes are just like it's it's what i
use it's what i used to get a flawless
application with mineral makeup and it's
the brushes from everyday minerals
primarily the flat top brush that you're
looking at here this is so dense and so
soft they have this way of making the
brushes so like the very top bristles
are there so densely packed but they are
so soft if I want a good mineral
application i'm going to use this brush
you know it isn't it adorable too these
are so neat i love how these are
actually bamboo handles that
they all have and it just feels so good
on your face the coverage I get I feel
like it's so even because of how dense
and even the bristles are here you know
there's nothing weird about them the
flat top is going to give you good
coverage having that blunt edge to it so
that's a great mineral foundation brush
but I also love the eye brushes the
tapered I brush by the way this is going
to run you ten dollars that's another
reason why I mention this because I
think very inexpensive for the great
quality you get the eye brush is like
the tapered I brush I think are around
six dollars the flat I brush is great
these work wonderfully well for um this
is like the short I kabuki brush I think
it is but once again they've got these
lighter softer bristles right at the top
and they're just phenomenal the blush
brush another good one you know it's
same principle they're so soft I mean
these are really well-made brushes so
and I'm saying this primarily for
mineral products i love my small
collection that I have of everyday
minerals brushes so check that out the
next award I'm getting out is for the
most innovative product for 2009 and I
think packaging why's that comes into my
decision a lot here and it's basically
products that are made to be so user
friendly they're made like pins and
markers and that's like the eyeliners
like the Revlon Colorstay liquid I pin
you know we're not talking about just
the traditional eyeliner that you pull
out of the little like inkwell looking
thing which those are great but they
don't work for everyone they're not easy
for everyone these get a lot easier when
they're like a marker like that you
maybe have used before or a pin like
that one I just showed you is I like the
Revlon Colorstay I pin but I mean to
really prove my point here la girl makes
something called mark my eyes it's big
it's like a Margaret's like your your
jumbo size Sharpie here and these are so
much easier to work with I think for
people just starting out and make up I
wish I could have had like something
like this one I was first trying to use
liquid eyeliner and also for lips like
the outlast
lip stain which I really like I mean
look at it it just looks like a typical
marker it's so user-friendly so easy to
use you can grip it like you would grip
I mean a pin you are going to write your
name was on a piece of paper so I think
that is very innovative I think it makes
it easier for people to use and get into
different products so just those
products they're heavier shaped like
pens and markers i think is pretty
innovative and also i have an award for
innovative packaging and I have
something that I really do need to
review for you more and do tutorials on
and kind of explain to you more but for
now it's the award for innovative
packaging and it's from sigma and it's
their pallets that are like I Palace and
they also have a highlighter and blush
palette but you look at it and it's like
okay you know there's a nice little
palette there of eyeshadows this happens
to be like the it's the neutral or
natural eye palette it has like some
Browns and typical colors in there but
what's so innovative I think about this
is the fact that okay you can see the
colors on the outside now you can pop
those out if I pop one out here it's
open there see hello it's open in the
back so you can always see the shade
name this is called brown sugar you can
always see that that's not going into a
palette and then you never see the back
of it anymore you've either got to
remember or put a sticky note by it or
something like that here it just pops
right in it snaps in and you can see
that color on the opposite side you
could you know mix and match you could
take different colors from like they
have a smoky palette and like a colorful
palette I mean you can switch them out
and always know what colors you're
dealing with I think that is so neat I
love how it works that way I mean I like
the big mirror with the palette as well
I like different things about it i like
the quality of the shadows but for now
i'm just talking about the packaging and
how neat that is that you can actually
see the shade name and pop it in and out
next is the cutest packaging and while
that's pretty cute what i just talked
about something that is so adorable
but I've kind of talked about in at
least a couple of other videos it's from
hard candy and it's the Painted Lady
lipstick with the cute little ribbon
tail these are available at Walmart all
of them have a different design painted
on the lipstick so if you get a
different shade it might look totally
different than the one I have here which
is crush it's a nice pretty I mean it's
a great product in itself it's a pretty
kind of golden e pink lipstick but the
packaging is so cute it's got a little
horseshoe and four leaf clovers on it
this cute adorable little tail I mean
you're going to find that when you toss
that in your purse you're gonna be like
oh ok there's my lipstick so maybe it's
practical too i don't know but it's
definitely cute so i really really like
that I like that we're seeing more
products like this in the drugstore that
are just so fun and not just your
typical everyday packaging so very cute
there next I need to give an award for
the best smelling product the stuff
that's going to smell the best is
probably going to be the lip products
and that's the case here I think in my
opinion the product that I would most
like to take a bite out of if I could is
the Nivea kiss of flavor cherry tinted
lip care this smells ah like i just
opened up a container of kool-aid that I
made and took a big whiff of it and it
is so just it's like strong scented it
is some hell it's really sweet really
fruity just intense cherry scent like
there are a lot of Pleasant smells like
yeah everybody loves the smell of
vanilla and all that stuff but this is
bold in-your-face smells like cherry and
it even has that kind of cherry flavor
as well but i haven't eaten it i promise
it's just from like you know licking my
lips of course but this is a neat little
lip balm it's a nice tinted lip balm it
doesn't for me compare quite color wise
in terms of like what the palladio ones
are that i love but it does feel good on
your lips and it does give you a nice
hint of color but the scent is to die
for you got to check that out when you
go to the drugstore next time it's from
Nivea okay next giving it I'm giving an
award
or the product that needs to be in your
purse and this is kind of going off of
frequently asked questions I get from
people who say they have oily skin or
they have shine and they may be like the
products they use on their face are not
necessarily looking for like a new
skincare regimen but they do want to
find a way to reduce the shine without
looking cakey everybody needs to go to
eyes lips face calm or find wherever
they are selling these in stores and get
the elf professional shiny racers you
get 50 blotting sheets in here this only
costs a dollar the this should be in
your purse because if you are feeling
oily chances are if you have a full face
of makeup on by the end of the day you
might be a little bit oily and maybe
you've got something else to do or you
just you know want to look a little bit
more refreshed and you don't want to
pile on more makeup these little sheets
you just pull them out like that they're
like a little folder you just blot it
and I tell you what it helps on the
shine end it just blotting your makeup
is not going to really like pull your
makeup off your face if you got on and
rubbed you don't want to do that because
that is going kind of mess with your
makeup but if you just blot you're going
to be happy that you just remove some
oil but you haven't had to put any more
makeup on to do it so I've got to tell
you guys to get that if you don't have
it yet it's not a big investment at all
it's a dollar you spend a dollar in your
vending machine but that is a great
product that everybody should have in
their purse in my opinion okay now we've
gotten down to it and we're doing the
MVP most valuable product last year I
only gave one most valuable product
award but I thought since I spent so
much time doing so many videos I should
give one for face 14 eyes and one for
lips so that's exactly what I'm going to
do and these are products that if
someone took it out of my collection and
told me I couldn't have it again I would
be really distraught because these are
things I rely on if I ran out of it I
would go back and get it again if
somebody took it from me I would you
know
put it down and try to find it like I
would not want to do without these
things so for face I'm going to give
this award to the Bobby Brown corrector
you may remember in the face video I
gave an award to the Bobby Brown
corrector and the creamy concealer kit
they kind of work together the corrector
is kind of a heavy duty and sort of
product that is big on correcting
discoloration and the concealer kit came
with a nice little powder with it so I
really liked him both didn't feel the
need to exclude one there but here I
just wanted to give it to one product
for face and the corrector is what I've
been using a lot lately and mainly I
really like the color the color i have
is bisque and the lighting may not be
picking up on that very well here but
this is a peachy salmon shade and it
works really well for any bluish toned
um like under eye circles you may have
or any blue tones and the corner of your
eye or right in here it really does a
fantastic job concealing them and it is
so creamy it's not going it's going to
kind of add some moisture to that area
and not make you look cakey or anything
like that so if I if this was taken out
of my collection I would be very upset
so I had to give the award to the Bobby
Brown corrector in bisque for me you may
want to eval you reevaluate that if
you're a different skin tone than me
four eyes I went back and forth on this
quite a bit I love my Revlon Colorstay
liners both pencil and liquid they got
the award last year for overall most
valuable product when I only gave one
award but I want to give the award to
something new and looking at just what I
have used a lot especially say the past
six months drama eyes from covergirl
this quad is amazing I mean this is if i
could probably only have like a one
shadow set to use and I mean this would
be this would probably be it it's so
inexpensive it's a great value for what
you get in case you missed my I video
which I hope you'll go watch if you
haven't seen it it's got white black
silver and like a
cranberry color they work so well
together you can get a perfect smoky eye
you can get like a natural eye out of
this if you wanted to the black can be
your liner it can be your contour and it
is very very rich it's a very nice rich
black shade the silver is you know
highly metallic the reddish shade look
at that this is covergirl guys I'm sorry
but I love it I really really like this
and I had to give it my overall award
this year for eyes because i think it's
the ultimate for a smoky eye but you can
go natural with it too and it's so
versatile i would not want to be without
that definitely i use it a lot for work
but i would use it you know on the
weekend too so great great palette and i
have a lot of eye makeup that I could
have chosen for this but that's what I
picked for lips there's really one
product that stood out above the rest
this year for me and it's the palladio
herbal tinted lip balm I have one on
right now looks kind of like a lipstick
doesn't it the color is fantastic the
pigmentation in these is great I'm
wearing Rosie right now that's the shade
and it feels so good so moisturizing but
the color is great you don't have to
sacrifice anything with this and I feel
like when we're talking about I products
or face products okay you put them on
and chances are you're not going to
really have that connection like you
have to have with your lip lip color I
feel like I'm always feeling the lip
color it's more about comfort with lips
than it is comfort with say I shadow you
know what I mean so you've really got to
keep that in mind with this and so for a
lip product it doesn't just have to look
good in my opinion to be a really
ultimate product it has to feel good as
well and so that's why the palladia
herbal tinted lip balm is my pick for
most valuable product in the lip
category and that is it guys that wraps
it up for the emily awards 2009 this has
been a huge product project on my part
and I hope you've enjoyed it as much as
I've enjoyed making these videos and
really getting down to business on
picking what my actual favorite products
are I appreciate you taking the time to
watch thanks so much for the great
feedback I've been given on these and
have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
