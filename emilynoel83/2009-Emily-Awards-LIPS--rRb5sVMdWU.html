still more Emily Awards to be given out
and this time it is for lip products I
know a lot of us get really excited
about lipsticks and glosses because in
many cases you know even from the
drugstore they're not too pricy and it's
just the type of thing that's really
easy to apply it doesn't take a lot of
know-how so I'm gonna hopefully give you
some suggestions of some things you can
add to your collection or maybe you
already have them maybe you've heard me
talk about them before so let's get
started first and there is in most of
these a high end and a low end favorite
but for some there aren't but first
category is best lip balm and my
high-end favorite is from a brand that I
reviewed huh can't remember exactly at
what point this year I reviewed it but
they do a lot of natural skincare stuff
and it's called silk bee it's available
online and they have two kinds of lip
balm a classic silk version and the Elan
VTOL version and it's very its natural
it's not gonna be one of those crazy
scented lip balms but it is has been
something that has been like a winter
standby for me when my lips have been
their driest it is just super
moisturizing it works so well I will
have links in it to all the information
on all the products I talked about if
you go to the sidebar and click the link
to my blog you'll find more but this is
a really really great moisturizing lip
balm on the high-end scale and then for
a drugstore lip balm that I really like
there are so many I really really love
lip balm but I had to go with soft lips
there's lots of different scents and
stuff but I love the packaging I like
the scent of this particular particular
one which is sugar cookie but it just
glides on really smooth and if it's not
soapy it's sometimes this that I reach
for before I like line my lips so the
liner goes on really smooth so really
good options there and then for a tinted
lip balm I don't have a high-end
favorite but I think you can probably
guess what my drugstore favorite is
because I've been talking about it a lot
lately recommending it and blogging
about it and it is without a doubt I
didn't even have to think hardly at all
about this it's the Palladio herbal
tinted lip balm this stuff is so good
avail
sally's comes in several colors goes on
with the color that is practically like
lipstick type color but it feels like a
lip balm it's wonderful the shade I have
here is called bronzy pink
I have swatches of more shades on my
blog if you just look back in my blog a
little bit but these are just wonderful
can't say enough good things about them
your lips are gonna feel great if you
wear those now for lipliner I believe
that's my next category once again I
don't have a high end lipliner favorite
it's usually the type of thing if I need
it I run to the drugstore and a couple
of brands that I like this will be a tie
one is a 2-time winner from last year
and it's Rimmel exaggerate lipliner
especially the shade in ravish if you
are looking for a good red lipliner a
nice way to really finish off a red lip
and make it really really pop and look
super clean and finished I would
recommend the exaggerated lip liner in
ravish it's the perfect red shade it's
not too terribly like bright cherry
tomato type red but it is just just
right I feel like it'll really blend
with your favorite red lip color and
really make the look nice and polished
and very inexpensive too and speaking of
an expensive a brand where most of the
products are available for like two for
three dollars at least at my Walgreens
all the time and it's Jordana they have
a great color selection on their lip
liners and it's the easy liner that's my
favorite kind from them a couple kinds
one kind that I have on now that's
really the main source of this color on
my lips is the easy liner in plush plum
that's a good shade I also like baby
baby berry for a good classic pink lip
liner but just super cheap really good I
don't notice a lot of like feathering
issues or anything like that but they're
just really nice nice and creamy and can
be used alone with just a gloss on top
for a good look there okay next we're
talking Best Overall lipstick so I'm
gonna just say it's not going to come
down to certain shades it's just going
to be what lipstick do I like for its
formulation and color selection
and staying power you know just various
factors came into play here for high-end
I am going to go with Mac on this so
many shades to choose from I haven't
tried a lot but the shades I've tried
like angel which is a gorgeous gorgeous
light pink I love the scent it's sort of
a somewhat sweet scent almost thinks me
makes me think of vanilla a little bit
but they just they I feel like they have
really good staying power without being
one of those long wearing lip colors and
they're just so creamy and so pigmented
the other one that I've tried recently
Ruby woo a great great red so I just
really really enjoy the MAC lipsticks
and if you have some favorite shades
feel free to let me know because that's
sort of a brand that I'm still getting
into but I definitely know that I like
those lipsticks from the drugstore it's
gonna be it's hi one one kind that I've
really liked for I don't know if it's
been more than a year now but either way
really like the brand from Rimmel it's
the lasting finish lipstick and lots of
great colors I have quite a few this one
I have here happens to be vintage which
is just a nice light pink with a little
bit of shimmer to it nice nude pink
these really do last they have a nice
scent they go on smooth they're very
moisturizing too which is something I
like a lot and then also for its
moisture color selection and just bold
pop of color you can get out of these
lipsticks I had to tie the Rimmel with
the Maybelline Color sensational
relatively new product out in drugstores
they look like this they have these caps
that depending on the shade you get
they're a little different color on the
cat
I have party pink which I fell in love
with it's a gorgeous kind of like
fuchsia slash deep rose really goes on
with a lot of bold color and feels
really good on the lips other shade I
like is born with that I've recommended
this to a lot of people pinky nude very
nice and natural I'm excited to continue
to try some different shades from that
line as well
best overall lip gloss
the high-end favorite is going to be I
mean my sit hiya this is a pricey one
its narce when the first one I tried
ever was Turkish Delight a nice light
pink gloss and I shelled out for it and
I really felt happy that I did I really
do enjoy the way this goes on it goes on
very smooth it's able to actually I feel
like the staying power is better than
some of those lip glosses that
are so slick that it seems like they
just kind of move around on your lips
and before you know it they're gone so
this has just enough of a little bit of
stickiness to stay on but it's not
annoyingly sticky by any means and so I
knew I liked this shade but then I got a
sampler set for Christmas tried a few
more colors like dolce vita this one and
i knew that okay this is a really great
brand and I'm very happy with a range of
colors that they offer so a menacing
NARS for my overall high-end favorite
for lip gloss for low-end
same brand but a couple of different lip
gloss lines within the brand this is a
two-time winner it's the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss if you haven't tried
this kind of lip gloss and maybe you're
maybe are all on high-end lip glosses
but you haven't really tried much from
the drugstore I think you will be
pleasantly surprised with the Revlon
Super Lustrous great quality the one I'm
holding up here is pink afterglow
I like their shade selection I've tried
almost all the shades in that and have
been satisfied with every one that I've
tried so some of them are a little more
sheer pink afterglow will go on a little
more sheer some of them are a little
more opaque I also like the fact that
some have the shimmer and a little bit
of sparkle in it and others don't so you
have some options there and then later
on in the year I don't know it's
probably about mid-year I started to
fall in love with the Revlon Colorstay
mineral lip glaze what makes these
different from Super Lustrous
they have a little more staying power
they are a little bit thicker the color
is very smooth you're not going to run
into a whole lot of sparkle while they
have some very fine shimmer at - I'm
whole
going up here a couple of my favorites
one is in its hurtle blossom and the
other is in lasting shimmer I've
recommended them both at different times
and they are just you can see they got
that fine shimmer but they go on very
creamy I really really like those next
we're going to talk about best lip
plumper I do not have a high-end
favorite on this but my drugstore
favorite is gonna have to go to
Maybelline for the volume
I think it's called volume seduction XL
it's got some really long name that I'll
have to like put down and make sure I
get it correct in my blog but they've
got a couple of shades here that I have
number 705 number 115 for just a nude
and a pink favorite that I like these
really do you do feel the plumping
action you feel the tingle tingles not
for everyone if you don't like that you
may not want a plumper you may just want
to go for it like one of the lip glosses
I recommend it in a similar shade to
these but I do like the color the amount
of color especially with this pink shade
is fantastic you really are getting some
pretty pink color and you do get some
plumping action going on there so like I
said not for everyone I'm not saying
right out and get it but if you know you
like that kind of thing it might be
something to try next I'm gonna run
through and I'm gonna try not to spend
too much time on any one of these but I
wanted to give some specific shade
favorites since until now I know I've
mentioned some specific shade names but
I've really been talking in overall
brands and lines within brands but now I
wanted to mention specific shades for
different color families I'm gonna give
a favorite gloss and a favorite lipstick
for pink plum red and neutral colored
lip looks not necessarily to be worn
together they definitely could but
that's not like my thing here I'm just
gonna give you my favorite not gonna say
you know high end or low end it's gonna
be a little bit of each for pink on the
lipstick Mac angel really nice soft pink
it goes on very evenly very smooth and
has nice staying power and then the
gloss with that I really like NARS
Turkish Delight with that but I
to give a low-end option that is very
close to Turkish Delight that goes on
very much the same way and it's
Neutrogena moisture shine lip gloss and
groove very very similar color there so
if you like a nice affordable light pink
I wanted to make sure I mentioned that
option for plum colors this is a has
been one that I've gotten so much good
out of throughout the entire year and
it's the lasting finish lipstick from
Rimmel in metallic seduction you're
looking here at a nice kind of reddish
plum shade it has a beautiful shimmer to
it it goes on very well I've had this on
numerous times and been asked what's
what's that on your lips and it really
is an interesting sort of unusual but
really pretty plum tones so I recommend
that and then a gloss that I love that
it's been blogged about and mentioned
before is the elf super glossy lip shine
which does have SPF 15 in mauve Lux it's
just kinda it doesn't have a lot of
shimmer has a maybe a very very fine
kind of pearly Sheen to it but not
outwardly shimmery nice and creamy I
like the way all of these super super
glossy lip shines go on for red lipstick
my favorite and I've been recommending
this a lot lately I think people must
just be kind of trying to get into the
red lipstick thing a little bit more but
it's from NYC and it's the ultra moist
lip we're in sheer red this is a great
red I love this you can find this at the
drugstore for right around $1 maybe just
a hair more than a dollar I don't know
but I really really like this red it's
very smooth creamy not shimmery it's
just a cream lipstick and then a great
gloss and as it is so I mean it is red
and it is just dazzling it's from be
luscious and it's in red velvet you're
looking at the shade here you can see
how it's got that definite blue
undertone in the sparkle and shimmer
with this this just screams holiday lip
look and this could take you through the
winter as well I just want to show you
just how sparkly that is it has a nice
brush tip applicator and it's just
gorgeous very very beautiful lipstick or
lip gloss on
now for my neutral pics a lipstick that
really didn't get maybe as much love in
this segment as I would have liked if I
could have just you know kept putting in
ties and with all my things that would
have helped but I had to stop somewhere
so I thought I wanted to include the
eyes lips face elf it's the mineral
lipstick in nicely nude and it's these
lipsticks are really great if you
haven't experimented with them it's I
know elf does a lot of different sales
on their website and next time they do a
mineral sale checkout the lipsticks
because they're very smooth they feel
very much like a lip balm and the color
is nice too and if you're looking for a
good nude type lipstick this one is a
good pick it's called again nicely nude
and then the lip the lip gloss that I
think I get to blog about if I could
only have one lip gloss this would be
would be what it is it's Jordana you
know the super cheap like $1.99 brand at
Walgreens the shade is lovely it's the
pretty shine lip gloss look at that
gorgeous shade it has I found something
very similar in a high-end version it's
from Lancome and it's the color fever
lip gloss and heat stroke they're almost
the same but I wanted to talk about this
one because I think it's really really
good quality for the price so that's
from Jordana pretty shine lips lip gloss
in lovely and it is sort of a neutral
kind of with some mauve tones in it but
overall I'd call it kind of a neutral
natural lip gloss so I hope you liked my
favorites for lips for the Emily awards
of 2009 I know these videos have been
kind of long but I appreciate you
hanging around to see what my favorites
are and don't forget you can go to my
