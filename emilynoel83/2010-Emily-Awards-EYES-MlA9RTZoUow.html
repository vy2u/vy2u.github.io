endless one can spend their hard-earned
money doing countless haul still
searching high and low for the perfect
product becomes a matter of trial and
error we searched the internet for
guidance and product reviews but where
do we turn for answers the third annual
emily awards on beauty broad choice
hi everybody so glad to have you here
for my second emily awards video of 2010
this one is all about eyes i am so
excited for this because i am very
passionate about the eye products that i
use and i feel like i have some really
really awesome favorites to share with
you favorites from 2010 some things you
know maybe we're new in 2010 other
things I just kind of discovered at some
point in the past year and I'm just
really loving them I will have a full
list of all the products i mentioned on
my blog as well as all the makeup i'm
wearing that there will be a link to
that below in the info bar to my
dailybooth page so get that business out
of the way here and we can start talking
about favorites my favorite high-end
primer is two faced shadow insurance I
feel like this not only makes my
eyeshadow look more bold but it also
extends the wear of it it's very similar
to Urban Decay primer potion I feel I
really like them both but I like this
squeeze tube method of using this
because I really feel like all the
product comes out for drug store i love
the palladio herbal i shadow primer this
is another one that's very very similar
to those other high-end brands that i
mentioned but for a fraction of the
price so maybe you're just experimenting
with eyeshadow primers and you want to
try something and you really want
something that'll work this is when I'm
wearing today I wear this very often and
I'm just really pleased with the Palais
do herbal I shadow prime you can find it
sally beauty supply now we're talking
about cream shadows these can be used
alone or a lot of people like to use
these maybe as a base for a powder
shadow and my favorite one that's
high-end and this is a two-time favorite
it's the mac paint pot and my favorite
shade it's really the only 1i have is
rubenesque and i have used this so much
it's lasted me a really long time it's a
very very pretty kind of peachy gold
color and what I love so much about this
is it's one of the few cream shadows
that I feel like I can use even without
a primer because it does have just
really good solid staying power and
doesn't get crazy on me from sort of a
drugstore category although this is an
online brand I'm going with coastal
scents and these double ended I shadow
pencils you probably saw a lot of these
if you watch my game day tutorials from
the fall I love the color selection I
feel like they're really creamy kind of
like the NYX jumbo shadow pencils but I
feel like there's even more colors to
choose around a copper and then a gold
or with this silver 11 is metallic
silver and one is glittery silver so
those are just a couple of my favorite
ones but they work nicely if you put
them on rub them out and use them as a
base for your shadow for high-end I just
don't have a favorite small high-end
palette usually if I get high-end
palette I go for something larger one of
the special things because I feel like
that's a better value I do have some
smaller high-end um you know like quads
or trios but this year I'm trying to
think of what I really used and i don't
think i have an absolute favorite
however i'm sorry to do this but i have
a three-way tie for my brother store
favorite small palettes for this year
and the first one I'm going to mention
is one that I think you might predict
it's the cover girl drama eyes palette
go this is like the go-to smokey eye
palette I love the rich black the silver
the white the burgundy is on such a
smart color to put in this palette
because you can really warm up the look
with that I've used this so many times
it's such a convenient way to get that
smoky eye without having to fumble
around with a bunch of different
neutral palette that I want to recommend
from the drugstore is the Maybelline
stylish smoke squad in natural smokes um
this is great because you can get that
rich smokey eye but the neutral colors
are wonderful i love the top couple of
shades kind of like a shimmery taupe
shade and then a shape that has maybe
just a hint of copper ii brown to it
it's really nice these are very
pigmented and I'm just really really
loving those stylish smokes shape the
color icon pallets from wet and wild I'm
a big fan of plum eye shadow and so I
feel like the palette called lust is
really really great I like that it's
split down the middle in terms of you
got your matte shades
on the left your shimmery shades on the
right I feel like they are unique colors
they're not shades you see every day and
I just find this to be a very fun
palette to where you can get a lot of
different looks out of it as with all
the color icon pallets so those are my
favorite small pallets from the
drugstore for high-end I've got to give
it up to Urban Decay for The Naked
palette um this is just phenomenal I've
talked about this before I compared this
to the two faced natural eye palette I
just find the colors and this to be so
great I love that you're getting light
neutrals medium neutral smokey shades
some plums I mean whoever select it you
know what shades were going to go in
here I just think they made some really
smart decisions and made this very very
ver another high-end palette that I'm
loving so much and this was a Christmas
gift so this was kind of one of those
you know just kind of flew into the
emily awards at the last minute but the
Too Faced enchanted glamour land palette
I like it for reasons also other than
just the shadows I mean the packaging is
great you get some other products like
blushes highlight lip gloss primer but
the shadows in this are so awesome they
are the shadows I'm wearing today and
what I like about it is I I really do
enjoy the neutrals in this palette
you're getting Matt light light shades
you're getting a really rich dark black
but in between some really fun colors
for my drugstore favorite large pallet
this is technically not a drugstore
product it's from the online brand
coastal scents and it is the 36 smoky
palette love this love it blogged about
it recently and I mean I'm just in love
with this palette the idea here is that
each of these sections of six shadows
kind of make their own little mini
palette within the larger palette so
you've got neutrals greens purples smoky
shades blues and pinks and it's so neat
to have them all in this palette this is
smaller than most of the Coastal Scents
talents so it's very portable I like you
that you get some matte some shimmer
it's just so convenient so user friendly
for high end this is a two-time winner
and I'm saying Mac because I have tried
more and more mac shadows over the past
year I am always pleased with how the
color really shows up on these shades it
really pops on the I you don't have to
try to hard the textures are nice there
are some shimmery shades that are just
out of this world some of my current
favorite colors for example are nylon
which actually comes off like kind of a
shimmery very light light golden butter
cream color beauty marked is phenomenal
I mean the shimmer on that and the color
is so unique and I think people have
tried to duplicate that and some other
palettes that I've seen but that's a
gorgeous shade and also twinks this
one's so so pretty to add to your
neutral collection for my drugstore
favorite shadow this is a new winner and
something that I think with the color
icon palettes has just really gone above
and beyond and improved so much this
year and it's been wet and wild like I
showed you you know this one like the
six colors with the lust I know new ones
are coming out that are even bigger and
better this year but also they've come
out with some new trios these that i
just purchased so i think that they're
really really stepping up their game now
with color variety and just it takes so
little to get the job done on your lid
if you buy some of these wet and wild
palettes you're going to have them for a
long time because it doesn't take much
to do the job so yeah hopefully you've
discovered those as well because those
are great talents my high-end favorite
is something that I recently discovered
along with a very popular palette called
the urban decay naked palette and and
talking about the 24-7 glide on eye
pencils and I heard a lot of great
things about these but just never picked
one up and then along with the Naked
palette I started trying these and i
think the staying power is just
phenomenal and i also love the co
selection during Christmas time I got a
set of a bunch of mini ones so shaped
like binge and Rockstar are gorgeous and
there's just so much color variety as
well so long wearing lots of variety I
think these are and they're so creamy
too for a drugstore a pencil eyeliner I
have really been kind of bouncing all
over the place this year I feel revlon
colorstay pencils were one of my
favorites I still like them but over the
course of the year I've gotten more into
smudging out my line or especially like
the lower lash line is where I use
pencils more and I've been you know
wanting to use something that allows me
to smudge it out more colorstay is great
for a long wear but it's not as easy to
smudge it's not as creamy I have gone
back to a product that it really has
been an initial one of the first
eyeliners that I used and I still like
it to this day and it's the covergirl
perfect point plus in onyx yeah and it
comes with a great smudge tip on the
bottom you get a very very small
applicator with this or a very small tip
so you have a lot of control it is
smudge able I like to still top it off
with a shadow just to ensure its staying
power but really really good drugstore
liner if you're looking for something
that's a little more smudge down smokey
looking just haven't tried a high-end
liquid liner that I'm in love with but
from the drugstore here's where Revlon
Colorstay makes its comeback I really
really like the Revlon Colorstay liquid
liners I have tried several other drug
store liquid liners that I've enjoyed
but I like that revlon colorstay gives
you some color option variety is good
and so is the staying power I like how
bold and black a black liner from
colorstay turns out to be so yeah that's
going to be my drugstore favorite my
favorite for high end is mac fluidline I
recently discovered this with a purchase
kind of like a group will kit around the
holidays and I find this so creamy I
love the small brush that comes with it
the mac I
her brush it's kind of like a small
pointed tip and that just works very
well for the application and this
particular shade is blitz and glitz but
I assume the formula despite the color
is kind of similar across the board and
i find that it smooths on very well and
lasts a really long time even on the
lower lash line and my drugstore
favorite is from physicians formula and
it is the shimmer strips custom I
enhancing gel cream eyeliner so these
are very neat very innovative where the
packaging is concerned because look
these just come right apart so they come
in sets of three the one I'm holding up
here is for hazel eyes and I love the
amount of color she gets this one for
example has a brown kind of a pinky tone
and a black that actually has a slight
pink sparkle to it so these are super
creamy they wear a long time for
high-end mascara now that I have really
enjoyed is Lancome Hypnose I've tried
Hypnose drama but I think I like Hypnose
better I just feel like if you've
applied this slowly and I think I
mentioned this sort of in a video a long
time back but it really builds up for
nice lashes the drugstore and honestly
if you're gonna get a great mascara i
would even just go straight for this one
and it's the voluminous carbon black
been using this consistently for a long
time I like how it builds up the lashes
very quickly without a lot of effort on
the brush it's one of those traditional
brush mascaras so it's just been great
for length great for volume great for
just deep dark lashes I really haven't
tried hardly any high-end brow stuff so
this is just a drugstore favorite that I
have and it's from Maybelline and it's
the definer brown this has of course the
brow product on one end and kind of a
little comb on the other what I love so
much about this is what we strive for
with browse is if we're filling them in
we want it to look like kind of natural
hair like strokes and this is such a
fine tip on this product that you can
really achieve
that so thank you again so much for
taking the time to listen to me talk
about all my favorite products I'm sure

me but if you have other suggestions
other tips for those who are watching
