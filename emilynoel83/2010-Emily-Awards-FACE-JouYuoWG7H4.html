endless one can spend their hard-earned
money doing countless haul still
searching high and low for the perfect
product becomes a matter of trial and
error we searched the internet for
guidance and product reviews but where
do we turn for answers the third annual
emily awards on beauty broad
hi everybody it is time once again for
the emily awards this is the third time
i've done this i did them for 08 09 and
now these are my favorite products from
2010 i'll be going through a bunch of
different categories in these videos and
I've split them up into different videos
for like face eyes lips and some other
fun stuff so this first one is going to
be all about the face I'm going to be
letting you know if these things have
been favorites in years past as well I
think those things that have been
favorites year after year it really
gives you an indication of how well it
worked for me also I want to let you
know that I have selected high-end and
drugstore favorites in this video and i
want to let you know that i haven't
always you know not every category may
necessarily have a high end or a
drugstore favorite I'm not just picking
something for the sake of you know
having something to mention in this
video so if there wasn't a favorite
foundation from from the department
store or you know if there wasn't a
favor for a certain category I'm not
just going to fill that void just cuz
you know I want it to be a legitimate
favorite products so um yeah let's get
started favorite primer ok I have two
new favorites to tell you about the
first for high end is Smashbox photo
finish light I've tried regular photo
finish I feel like this one makes my
skin less shiny still makes my skin
really smooth I'm just very happy with
the finish I get it is oil free and it
this is just the travel size that I had
here now for the drugstore favorite
primer this one totally slid under the
radar here just not too long ago I just
recently tried this and I after a lot of
thought I realized I could not leave
this out I had to make this a favorite
because it just works so well and it
smooths on so so evenly hard candy sheer
envy primer look how much you're getting
ok this is a product from walmart and it
goes on so super smooth it doesn't get
any sort of runny texture to it or
anything that's too thick it's just that
happy medium and i feel like it is the
perfect kind of canvas that gives your
face before you put on foundation
for liquid foundation though I have
tried several high-end liquid
foundations I really don't have a
favorite for this video once again
second year in a row I don't have a
favorite high-end liquid foundation but
I do have several drugstore ones that I
just love and I've gone through let's
see I think in a way it was rimmel
lasting finish last year it was
maybelline superstay still love both of
those but I had sort of a revelation
over the past year about Revlon
Colorstay because what was holding this
one back was the fact that it wasn't
blending very well I felt like it always
dried a little too quickly as I put it
on and I wasn't getting the most
flawless blend with this foundation
however the strong points of this were
always that it came in a good range of
shades and two different formulations 14
combo to oily and one for normal to dry
so always you know have thought oh this
is a good product if only it smoothed
out a little bit better on my skin well
this is what I recommend getting a
sponge spritzing it with some water okay
like this is just I just have bought one
of these little travel spritzer things
spritz the sponge get some foundation on
the sponge the finish turns out so
natural and flawless and you also are
able to really get it blended just the
way you want it so now that I figured
that out i'm naming revlon colorstay as
my favorite foundation for 2010 for
mineral foundation this is actually what
I'm wearing right now in addition to
concealer I'm just wearing this is my
foundation it's mac mineralized skin
finish natural my shade is medium plus
and I am so pleased with the coverage
this gifts I've been using this on and
off kind of comparing it to other things
for the past few months and I love the
natural finish it gives I love on the
weekends like this kind of giving my
skin that break but still having nice
even coverage if you are more into the
loose minerals I have a favorite for
that I'm calling it my drugstore
favorite because it's in kind of a lower
price range i feel that it is kind of
just a nom
line brands the everyday minerals this
is a three-time winner okay this is some
serious covers this may be a little more
coverage and a little more matte
coverage than the mac mineralized
skinfinish but the intensive formula for
everyday minerals my shade medium beige
neutral that's the the most intense
coverage you can get and it really does
cover well and I have yet to find a
loose powder mineral foundation that can
really uncover this well past favorite
has been the Bobby Brown corrector and
creamy concealer kit still think those
are great but the one that ultimately I
thought did the most for me was the
corrector I had it in a shade called
bisque and it was very peachy and it did
great things for correcting the bluish
tone circles however if you really keep
up with my reviews I did one recently on
the benefit erase paste and this also
has that very similar samity color great
for the dark kind of bluish undertones
circles but you get so much more with
the array space so I thought this is a
better value for even being a high-end
product you're getting a lot more it
takes very very little to get the job
done if you want more on like
application tips and just more info
about it watch the individual review on
that then I have a tie for my favorite
concealers from the drugstore and they
are maybelline dream mousse concealer my
shade is cream it's light for dash five
great coverage it's very pigmented if
you're wondering well I've tried you
know the dream mousse foundation what
makes this different I feel like it's
more concentrated the pigmentation you
know it takes a little and it really
does cover covers you know broken
capillaries around the nose covers dark
circles you can use this I'd suggest
using your finger to apply this so the
warmth of your finger allows us to melt
into the skin and that can work over
blemishes or anything else something
else that has come onto my radar
recently is the hard candy glama flage I
could not ignore this because of the
absolutely fantastic coverage this has
once again with hard candy they're
giving you a lot of product this is a
big tube you're paying a drugstore price
for this
it covers very very well and it's gotten
more that liquidy formula I wanted to
make sure you had an option that was
more the liquid e type of concealer than
the rich and creamy kind this may not
fall into my start of the day makeup
routine but something that I need
periodically to pull out of my purse
usually what I will want that pressed
powder for is to kind of take care of
some shine a product that I've loved for
that is the elf translucent mattifying
powder that's winning the award for my
favorite pressed powder multiple reasons
why the packaging is wonderful I mean
this is a great size mirror to have for
your touch up without a ton of coverage
and cake eNOS it takes care of shine and
it's a very good option to just keep
their in your purse time for bronzer is
something I use every single day and my
high-end favorite is something I have
reached for so much I've got like the
perfect little circle where I have hit
pan here and it is another two-faced
product it's the chocolate Soleil
bronzer from to face now this is a sort
of a darker bronzer that you can contour
with it is totally matte it smells sweet
it's amazing I have been using this so
much and it is just so great if you use
a fluffier brush you can get kind of
like a lighter coverage all over if you
use a smaller brush this can be your
contour powder so I just really enjoy
that if you have really light skin I'm
not so sure that this would be for you
you just have to be very careful on how
you apply it not saying you can't use it
you just want to be more careful with
how you put it on but listen up everyone
on this drugstore favorite um I've had
NYC study has been a very popular
bronzer that I've talked about I was
really kind of battling with this in my
mind on which would be my favorite but
I'm going with rimmel natural bronzer
and here's why okay I've got to hear one
is called Sundance and one is called
sunlight Sundance has just a hint of
sparkle and shimmer to it sometimes
that's what I want with a bronzer
sometimes I don't just want to have
one Matt option and that is all you get
with NYC sunny but if you do want the
mat sunlight send dance with some
shimmer sunlight is your mat option and
I have users as you can see just kind of
interchangeably maybe everything else on
my face is very matte and I just want to
count on the bronzer for that little
kick with a little shimmer so you have
the option there I really think these
function just as well as any other
browsers that I have they're not too
dark pick either one of these unfair
I've used these on people with fair skin
and it still comes off really well time
for blushes my favorite high-end blush
has been one from Mac that I've used
quite a bit this year and it's called
dolly mix I know this might look scary
it's almost like the color of my wall
here behind me but this actually is kind
of an amazing blush because when you put
it on it comes off kind of here so even
though this looks like that would just
be you know crazy on your cheek you put
it on with a brush and you get this
beautiful pink glow it's a sheer tone
shimmer blush so that probably explains
it for you if you're familiar with Mac
we are moving on to drugstore where this
is a two-time favorite and it's my
Milani minerals blush in my tie classic
peachy pink looks good on everyone blush
this does not have shimmer this is a
matte shade and i have it on today i
feel like it's a very natural look and
it looks good on so many skin tones so
this remains a very very favorite
product now for finishing powder i have
one option here or one favorite i guess
and it's from the drugstore it's the elf
high definition powder this is a big
amount of powder that you get for not a
lot of money it can be your last step to
you or to your face this this will work
for any skin tone get a big brush in
there i like to anyway it comes with a
puff but I like just taking my brush and
kind of shaking it on top dusting it all
over you get that kind of nice flawless
finish no matter what you put on if you
put on some shimmer before that
sometimes I
go ahead and highlight but then I just
want to finish off with this your
shimmer and your other colors and
everything still shine through just fine
but this is a great kind of setting
powder finishing touch and it definitely
elf HD powder I've tried more expensive
versions and this one still wins out
well I hope you enjoyed my emily awards
for favorite face products of 2010 i
hope that clears up some questions i've
been getting about what do you think is
the best of this or that that's me kind
of just putting myself out there with
what my favorites really are so stay
tuned there are more emily awards videos
to come have a great day and thank you
