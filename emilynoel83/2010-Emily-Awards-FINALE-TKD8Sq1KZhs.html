endless one can spend their hard-earned
money doing countless hauls still
searching high and low for the perfect
product becomes a matter of trial and
error we searched the internet for
guidance and product reviews but where
do we turn for answers the third annual
Emily Awards on beauty broadcast
it's crazy and I'm very impressed and
very excite
holy cow
like
I bought it once twice three times four
by six this is awesome
we have made it to the finale for the
Emily Awards thank you so much for
watching all these videos for my 2010
Emily Awards I have gone through face
eyes lips and I'm so thankful for the
wonderful response I've gotten from
everyone I've tried to be as concise as
possible as I've gone through so many
items in these individual videos but I
appreciate all the product suggestions
you've given me as well I think it's
really turned into a nice discussion in
the comments section about what products
are working for people and what isn't so
thank you thank you so much for watching
and this finale is really going to take
you through some MVPs most valuable
products I'm going to talk about also
body skin care and hair which are things
in my last video you guys said you were
interested in in knowing about so yeah
there's a lot to get to here so let's
get started first off I want to talk
about best brushes my winner last year
was Sigma and you know what it's a
winner again this year but I think it's
really really especially saying
something this year because not all
brushes withstand time as well as others
if you're familiar with different
drugstore brands or just other online
brands I mean sometimes you get them you
use them they feel great at the start
and they're not holding up even though
you're cleaning them you know you're
doing your part but they're not holding
up these definitely have withstood a lot
of makeup application a lot of cleanings
and they still feel super super soft and
so this is the sigma complete kit i
would say this would be the kit if you
are just trying to build your brush
collection get that base you know group
of brushes to use this is a very good
one to have you can see this little flap
that comes down here again watch the
video review that i did of this for more
information on each individual brush but
you're getting face brushes eye brushes
there you're really getting the whole
gamut of what you need and if you have
some other favorite brushes that you
want to mix into this kit you definitely
can I mean this brush roll holds you
know any kind of brush you want so Sigma
definitely I'm impressed with how the
quality has really lasted over time and
I would totally recommend this brush kit
now a lot of people ask me what can I
pick up from the drugstore for good
brushes and it's I got to admit it's
hard to find one of those big brush kits
that is really good quality from the
drugstore but you can't kind of pick and
choose and find some good stuff in
smaller kits and Ecotools is a really
great brand for that this is the I think
it's a five piece yeah mineral brush kit
and these brushes are exceptionally soft
I mean if you feel these on the face
they just feel so good and they I mean
not only are they nice to feel on your
face but they actually do perform very
well with the makeup so you're getting
like a powder brush a kabuki brush and
eye brush in a flat concealer or another
eye brush there depending on what you
want to use it for but these just work
really well they are definitely softer
than any drugstore brush your going to
go in and find and they're dense too so
they're really gonna work well with your
products and then there's an eye kit -
and this has five eye brushes in it and
it's got this nice little holder and
these even though they're not that kind
of two-tone fibers they still are soft
they're really a nice selection of small
brushes to give you a lot of control for
your liners and your smudging and stuff
like that so Ecotools check your
drugstores check Target and Walmart
those are some really great brushes as
well for my award for outstanding tool
this is a three time winner I love this
product so much and it is my ELF
mechanical eyelash curler this is the
one that's sold on the ice lips face
comm website for just a dollar and I
think that's part of why this fascinates
me so much this is one of the cheapest
products I own and yet it works so well
I don't know what it is this size just
fits my eye I like that you really with
this this whole configuration on the
handle you can really grip it and your
fingers aren't you know turning and and
potentially tearing out your eyelashes
you can just get a very nice grip on
this
for my most innovative product award
something that I feel like has really
changed the way I do a certain aspect of
my makeup and this applies to false
eyelashes I have some false eyelashes on
right now what did I used to put them on
I use the Revlon precision lash adhesive
this is so great I can honestly say that
ever since I've had this this has been
the only lash glue I have used since I
got it so I mean I've gone back and
repurchased it works so well you twist
off the top you've got a little wand and
that glue is actually you're gonna put
it on the strip of lashes it's gonna dry
totally clear so you can't even see it
at all but it will look have this kind
of bluish tint to it you can see exactly
where it's going you put it on so
quickly this I don't know why we hadn't
had this before and we were trying to
squeeze out of these tubes and trying to
get just a fine line of glue this gives
you just the right amount of glue and I
tell you it stays and stays no problem
with how well these glue on to your lash
line and getting them off just the same
as the duo glue or the lash grip or
whatever you use before they peel off
just fine they're not pulling out your
lashes and this just really will speed
up the process of putting on false
eyelashes for you you just wait a little
bit for it to get tacky I have a full
review on this product that this is
awesome for cutest packaging this was
kind of tough because I got a lot of
neat pallets for Christmas and so often
they are just so detailed with the
artwork on the palette and just really
really neat in the whole construction of
the palette but the one that wins my
work for the cutest packaging is the
Urban Decay NYC palette because when you
open up this top part this lights up you
have a wonderful little world of you've
got you've got the architecture you've
got the Statue of Liberty little faces
and shoes and taxicabs and this whole
little great set up here and your mirror
back there by the way but I just think
that is so adorable doesn't interfere
with the product which you just pull out
down below
and then you've got everything in one
little tray so I mean in terms of how
practical this palette is it also this
you can travel with this you can you can
toss this in a bag and not worry about
the products inside being affected but
for the fun of this I think that is just
too cute I love how that lights up now
for my needs to be in your purse award
this is all about a portable product
that is basically great for on-the-go
use it may not be something that falls
into your makeup routine um when you're
first doing your makeup although it
could but I just think it's really great
to have on the go and it's the elf
Studio translucent mattifying powder so
here what we've got is a powder that you
know it looks like it's kind of a peachy
tone but when you put it on I think this
is gonna work with many many skin tones
and it's gonna take away your shine it
comes with this little sponge you know
just put it on wherever you feel like
you're starting to get shiny and I don't
feel like it cakes on I don't feel like
it makes your face look like okay she
just put on you know layer number two of
makeup there no I feel like it really is
sheer and nice I think those blotting
papers are great they won the award last
year but there is kind of a second
reason to why I chose this this year and
I think we all need mirrors little
mirrors in our purse we all want that
compact that we can pop out and use and
this mirror I love what elf is doing
with their packaging because you get a
nice sized mirror I mean you pop this
out you turn it vertical and you can see
your whole face in it so definitely
great for on-the-go this runs around o
$3 so definitely worth picking up now
for my MVPs my most valuable products
and in the category for face I'm going
to give it to a product that I use every
single day in one capacity or another
and it is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
matte bronzer and I talked about this a
lot if you follow any of my daily booth
pictures you will see this showing up
there repeatedly I have clearly hit pan
on this this smells sweet I use this
with a big brush sometimes just to get
an all-over sort of
glow to my face I use it with a blush
brush if I want to use it as a contour
right here or kind of contour the jaw
line or the forehead it works so well if
you have fair skin use it more carefully
kind of be careful about how you the
concentration of this product that you
get on your face but I love this this is
going to be a little deeper than NYC
sunny but if you want something that
really works as a contour this is so so
good for my MVP for eyes I wanted to
give this to a product that I think has
steadily improved since I've been using
the brand and it's wet-and-wild the
color icon palettes you remember when
they came out with the ultimate
expression palettes and everybody was
kind of like oh my gosh you know these
are great great things from wet and wild
and then they brought out the color icon
palettes and I think we all kind of took
another look at wet and wild and said
hey this is serious this is good stuff
so I just think these are so pigmented
so rich I feel like they have listened
to what people have have said they've
wanted over time they want matte and
shimmer so often drugstore brands load
you down with shimmer but not enough
matte and so they have delivered in that
respect and they've got new trios that
they're coming out with and some new
larger ones that I can't wait to get my
hands on but I mean seriously seriously
pigmented products now my MVP for lips I
thought about this and I really didn't
have to think too long because this is a
product when I look through my
collection I bought it once twice three
times four five six I bought so many of
the NYX mega shine lip glosses you don't
keep repurchasing products and all these
colors if you don't love the formula so
that's one thing is that it is so smooth
so rich you might think well if you're
gonna pick an MVP lip product shouldn't
it be a lipstick or something like that
well the gloss has all the color you
need this can replace a lipstick it's
not about okay I use the lipstick for
the color and the gloss for the shine
this has all the
color in it as well and the shades are
just awesome awesome awesome
I mean I love all the light pinks a full
gamut of nude shades that they have
shimmery creamy somewhat metallic you
name it it's in the collection so the
NYX mega shine lip gloss has got to give
it up I love these I've talked about
these so much because it's all I've used
to wash my makeup off with since college
and basically you get one of these
cloths you lather it up under the water
takes off all my face makeup my eye
makeup my any waterproof eye makeup I
might be wearing it gets it all off you
know I've dealt with some eczema on my
face and that's a very sensitive issue
you cannot just put anything on top of
that and think okay it's a moisturizer
it'll take care of it it'll moisturize
no it's got to be something really
suited for sensitive skin it's going to
work for combos in which I tend to have
and then in the winter time I notice I
am exceptionally combo because the drier
areas get drier and I still have some
oily oily areas too so this works
awesome
you put it on the shower and I don't
know if it's something about the steam
in the shower but you get this intense
tingle with this Friday I use it a few
times a week just to kind of slough off
the dead skin and really really get that
deep down clean but it really is kind of
an experience because you feel it
working so well this is one of those
razors that has the kind of soap
surrounding the actual razor itself so
you don't have to use a shaving cream I
was kind of having an ongoing issue with
shaving my legs and having irritation
afterwards it just doesn't leave me with
bumps or anything so that is my go-to
razor and I've been using it a lot the
past year crazy crazy fruity I mean you
take a whiff of this and it is like holy
cow you know that is so fruity it is
going to liven up your shower like none
other
I love this scent it is just so like BAM
I mean if you want to experience the
best fruity shower gel I think this is
it and I love it so much
this is something that comes out as kind
of a deep bronzy gel you can put it all
over your body
it dries super quick so you can put it
on put your clothes on you've got a nice
bronzy glow you can put it on your face
before your makeup and have a nice glow
there as well and then when the day is
over and you shower it all washes off
you'll see that this does not have a
clip I have a full review on this
product so check that for more
information but in a nutshell when I
curl my hair with this the curls last so
long I can do it
sleep on it get up the next day you've
still got wearable curls
really great for long hold I have this
big can that I use at home I have these
smaller cans that I carry with me in my
makeup bag for work and it I won't be
without this this is the one I keep
going back to time and time again
my hair has grown a lot over the past
year and I need something to keep these
those ends from getting dry keep them
hydrated that's what I need to do and so
the Neutrogena triple moisture silk
touch leave-in cream I will put this on
after I get out of the shower get my
hair kind of towel dried a little bit
and then put this on from about here
down and then I put my hair up in the
Turbie twist for the rest of the night
until I go to bed and then I take it out
and this has softened up the hair a
great deal thank you again so much for
staying with me throughout the Emily
awards and for all your kind feedback I
really do appreciate it and here's to
another year of trying lots more
products and bringing you more favorites
all along the way so thanks again guys
have a wonderful day and I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
