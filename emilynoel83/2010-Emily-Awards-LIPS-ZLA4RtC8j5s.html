endless one can spend their hard-earned
money doing countless haul still
searching high and low for the perfect
product becomes a matter of trial and
error we searched the internet for
guidance and product reviews but where
do we turn for answers the third annual
emily awards on beauty broadcast
hi everyone it's time for another emily
awards video this is where I named some
of my ultimate favorite products from
2010 and this one is going to be all
about lips so whether you're into lip
gloss or lip balm or lipstick lipliner
whatever the case may be I'm going to be
talking about some of my favorite
products in this video and I have high
end and drug store categories for each
thing that I'm talking about however if
I don't happen to have a high end or a
drugstore favorite for that particular
type of item I'm not just going to throw
something in there just to have
something to talk about so I do have
more emily awards to come even after
this one i'm going to have one on tools
i'm going to have a finale and then i've
been talking about maybe down the road a
little bit possibly doing something for
hair skin and body products so if that's
something you're interested in or you
want to see a few people had told me
they did and let me know in the comments
section and I'll kind of get a feel for
what you really want out of that for
high end I really don't have it a
high-end lip balm favorite I tend to
really go to the drugstore for my lip
balm and I have a couple of drug store
favorites they are the Nivea kiss of
smoothness and this is such a fantastic
lip balm put this on like before you go
to bed and then when you're waking up in
the morning kind of doing your makeup
routine put some on then and you are
just going to notice a total change in
the texture and the hydration of your
lips another one that i love is from eos
and this is probably my favorite EOS lip
balm and it's the lemon drop one it has
SPF 15 and I've noticed a difference in
this one and some of the others with the
smoothness this has this one really
glides on and that scent is so
refreshing and rejuvenating I really
like that
tinted lip balm I have tried some
high-end ones but I don't really have
something I can say is my favorite but
for my drugstore favorite if you have
not tried it I mean you really do need
to try this and it's the palladio herbal
tinted lip balms I am nuts about these
things I mean these are and by the way
it is a two-time favorite but these are
so great because not only are they super
moisturizing like I mean they rival some
better lip balms in terms of the amount
of moisture they give but they also have
such great pigmentation so you put them
on real quick quick and easy but you get
color and it's not just like super sheer
like I can barely see it color but you
can get you know a decent amount and
whether it's light pink or berry or kind
of bronzy shades it's all in that
collection no high-end favorite once
again I'm sorry but for my drugstore
favorite I think this this brand is
really going to take care of all of your
lip liner needs and it is the Jordana
easy liner for lips and this is a
two-time favorite and i have so many
shades of these I've just pulled out a
few latte is a great neutral one baby
beri I think I may have gone through
four of those already for my pink looks
and then if you're a plum girl and you
like the deeper shades plush plum will
work wonderfully for you I like the fact
that these don't feather up into your
lip line and kind of start to you know
um my crate outside the lip line they're
so creamy that if you're like me and you
like to kind of fill in your whole lips
with the lip liner and they go up light
on very smoothly and they're so cheap
they're usually like two for three
dollars or something like that I find
mine at walgreens time for a new
category I really felt the need to
create a category for jumbo lip pencils
because number one I love the concept of
a jumbo lip pencil and number two I
definitely have clear favorites for both
high end and drugstore here so for my
high-end favorite I'm going with the
buxom big and healthy lipsticks I think
these are probably the mini size they
came in
package set with some other things and I
think these are awesome i love the fact
that what you're getting is something
that is quick to use it gives you the
precision of a liner but the ease and
application of a lipstick these do have
a hint of a lip plumper in them if you
are anti lip plumper maybe you want to
stay away from this but for me I am
loving these buxom jumbo pencils for a
drugstore option and something for again
if you don't want the plumper that that
buck someone had the NYX jumbo lip
pencils i feel like i'm kind of
conducting with these um but these are
so good because they really really
really glide on so you can put these on
and sometimes you almost get a glossy
finish with with certain ones but i have
like chestnut and Narcisse here and can
be a great base for a loss or just on
their own for lip plumpers I have a high
end favorite for that and deja vu yeah
bare essentials buxom I really really
like the glosses one of the things that
stood out to me the most about this that
was kind of an unexpected thing was the
staying power of these like I have gone
through meals newscasts after whole
afternoons naps you name it with these
still on my lips and I like the colors
the colors that I have for example here
are Denise and Michelle there is a very
minty tingle to these so just disclaimer
again if you don't like plumpers you
will feel this on your lips but I am
nuts about the colors and the staying
power for my drugstore plumper favorite
it's the Loreal infallible plumping six
hour again I'm always some kind of on
the lookout for long wearing products so
this is another good one for where I
like the sparkle that this has without
being crazy over-the-top it gives your
lips just kind of a very smooth down
look so you don't really see the lines
or anything like that in your lips this
shade that I have is called plumped mob
for long wearing lip color and my
high-end favorite is going to go to the
Mallee long wearing stuff the shade i
have is called modern mauve and this
actually is kind of like just a big
jumbo pencil and this color whenever
I've worn this whether it was out in
public or in videos people have asked
what is that color pink on your lips I
don't have it on right now but when I
have had this on I've gotten lots of
questions this is really smooth and so
you put this on and you wait for it to
get sort of to that dryer state and once
it does you put on the clear gloss top
coat and I feel like this really kind of
meshes with your lips and you don't
really feel it on your lips over time so
I love the color and I just like the
formula for my drugstore favorite I'm
going to go with the infallible never
fail lip color compact one shade in
particular that I like and I know I'm on
kind of a pink kick here lightly but
azalea is a really nice pink with a
golden undertone and what this is all
about is basically you've got the liquid
lip product that you smooth on and then
you've got a bomb that you put over the
top of it so my sister uses a lot of the
infallible stuff and she really likes it
this is probably one of her favorite lip
products in general for overall lipstick
so just not talking particular shades
but just a formula a texture that I
really like for high end I'm going to go
with Mac and this is a two-time winner
whether they have been deep colors
shimmery colors met or the cream
machines I really like them that smell
it's got kind of a nice slightly sweet
smell from the drugstore I went back and
forth back and forth trying to just come
up with one favorite but I had to go
with two I'm so sorry but I do have two
kinds that I really like and from Revlon
it's the color burst lipstick these are
a line of lipsticks where if you are not
a big fan of a ton of shimmer in your
lipsticks and you really like the rich
creamy pigmented colors you're going to
get that here
I've got shades at fuchsia for those of
you who want to go out on a limb with a
bright pink lipstick that blends with my
walls uh-huh that would be one for you
and also one that I picked up that I
love from the neutral family is called
rosy nudes and then another favorite
that I just could not ignore was the
Rimmel moisture renew lipsticks these
are the ones in the gorgeous purple
tubes and I have sunset which would be
in my eyes a drugstore dupe for max Viva
Glam 5 i've talked about this one a lot
throughout the year and also spot light
beige for the neutral lip lovers again
this is something that's kind of like
your peachy nude and you're going to get
variety here you're going to get some
really smooth creamy shades some
shimmery shades I like the staying power
I do feel like they give a lot of
moisture to my lips and every time at
the drugstore I feel like I'm going over
there and I'm like looking and seeing
what else is new lately I've really been
going back to something that has been
something I tried kind of years ago I
started trying and they are the
philosophy lip shines my sister got me
started on these I think it was with
cinnamon buns and that what is just
phenomenal these are known for smelling
exactly like basically what their name
is so coconut frosting melon daiquiri
those are a couple that I have on hand
now but these are really shiny and they
make great toppers for whatever your lip
product is that you have on if you've
got on any various lipstick slap on some
of this and it's going to be super shiny
my favorite drugstore overall lip gloss
has grown on me so much throughout the
year and they are the knicks mega shine
glosses these are glosses that are going
to give you rich opaque color meaning
they're not transparent whatsoever you
put them on you're going to see that
color you're not going to be seeing your
lips through them and there's a great
color variety you're going to have a big
selection when you check these out in
the store or online at Sherri culture
calm
real quickly I want to go through some
shade favorites and I did this I did
this last year actually I went through
and I just went through pink berry red
and neutral and I just gave you a
lipstick and a lip gloss that are sort
of my favorites in each category for
pink that these are the two that I'm
actually wearing now and it's the r-mo
lasting finish lipstick and airy fairy
this is going to be a pink with a slight
slight golden undertone very pretty and
for the gloss my favorite is Maybelline
shine sensational in sweet indulgence
and this one is oh it smells so good you
want to eat it but you can't because
it's lip gloss tough but it is so so
super pretty and you just pick that up
from the drugstore great drugstore two
of lip colors and I'm wearing them
together for Barry these are each
products that I've mentioned earlier in
this video for lipstick I'm going to go
with Max craving this is an amplified
lipstick so it's very bold very rich and
pigmented no shimmer to it just creamy
it'll go on your lips with a hint of a
glossy finish so it can look gorgeous
alone or topped with a gloss and then my
favorite Berry gloss is the Loreal
infallible plumping and plumped mauve if
you really get an up-close look at this
product I mean you can see just the the
beautiful shimmer that it has but also
just great pigmentation of the color
itself and it's very accessible it's
from the drugstore I love it my favorite
red lipstick this is a two-time winner
I've talked about this so much this is
my go to read I've gotten a lot of
people onto this one I think and so many
of you have told me yes it worked really
well for me too and you may be finding
this for a dollar or less at your drug
or discount stores so this is from NYC
and it's the ultra moist lip where in
sheer red a very wearable shade for
multiple skin tones love that one and
then on the totally opposite end of the
spectrum an expensive lip gloss but it's
from NARS and it is dolce vita and this
one is kind of think of more not so much
bright bright red but kind of a dusty
rose almost sort of shade it's very rich
and pigmented very creamy no shimmer but
this is great topping
a red lip or just alone for a little bit
toned down red lip finally we have
neutral lip my favorite lipstick is
going to go to rimmel for the moisture
renew in sunset and this is the one
remember that said is a good dupe for
mac viva glam five and it really is
beautiful and if you have the option I
mean go for this because it's a little
cheaper obviously it's from the
drugstore and it just has a beautiful
shimmer and it's going to bring out your
face you know what I mean sometimes nude
lips can really not do much for
brightening up the face this one however
does give you a little something extra
the lip gloss this one's a two-time
winner this is a much-loved lip gloss
and I can't recommend enough from
Jordana that's a drugstore line on you
may find it in a lot of walgreens stores
but the pretty shine lip glosses are all
really good they would have gotten more
love in this video if they would create
more shades please but this one is
called lovely and talk about a color
that can work i think on so many
different skin tones it has the most
gorgeous light reflecting quality in
this i love this one it wouldn't be a
two-time favorite if it wasn't awesome
in my book there you go guys there are
my favorite lip products of 2010 i hope
