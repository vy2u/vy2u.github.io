to doing videos I feel like I have not
gone this long in a really long time
without posting a video it's been like a
week exactly I was home for Christmas I
hope you all had wonderful Christmases I
got to spend and actually kind of an
extended period of time with my family
at home we got to see Tyler side of the
family and my side and some friends I
hadn't seen in a while
I also celebrated my birthday on the
27th so what that kind of brings me to
today is a birthday haul and Christmas
haul as well so thank you so much to so
many of you who posted nice things on
Facebook and Twitter
telling me happy birthday and stuff I
really appreciated that and was just
kind of overwhelmed but people thought
of me but thank you so much for that
when people are like what do you want
for Christmas you know I'm almost always
you know something beauty related on the
tip of my tongue because hey it's what I
love and B it really kind of feeds back
into my channel by giving me material to
review and this year I feel like I've
really actually gotten exposed to some
things that I knew like I really knew I
wanted and I knew I kind of liked
already and then there are some things
that are totally new to me this year new
brands new products so I really tried to
keep it intact to do this video and then
I'm gonna totally jump in and really try
a lot of things so this is not a review
oops hello this is not a review this is
just a whole cuz a lot of this stuff I
haven't tried a few things I have here
and there but first thing I want to tell
you about was my gift from Tyler and it
was the Clarisonic Mia and this is the
Mia - isn't this like an adorable little
print on this it's like a black and
white leopard print and he got this when
it was the today's special value on QVC
maybe a month or so before Christmas and
I still haven't gotten to try it yet
because I got it like right before we
left he gave it to me and so I'm getting
it charged up and gonna be using it soon
but it came with a little carrying case
it came with another brush head and
philosophise purity face cleanser so I
cannot wait to try this I have held off
for so
long on trying ok we're just gonna there
we go there I've held off a long time on
trying the Clarisonic because I thought
I had a good method in place with the
Olay daily facial cleansing cloths and I
just I guess after enough time had
passed and I've heard so many good
things about it I just wanted to see if
it was really worth it so what was the
mia this is a little smaller I guess
than the full-size like Clarisonic plus
I believe but I'm really really pumped
to try the sister always gives me great
beauty related gifts this time of year
and the thing she gave me this year
actually she gave me one of these last
year too but it's special because it's
new every year and this is the Too Faced
sweet dreams palette and Too Faced has
some of the most extravagant packaging I
feel like for their holiday palettes and
this one is so gorgeous like I mean talk
about a beautiful like girly item to sit
out in anywhere where you have your
makeup or just your own little area on a
dresser or something it's so pretty it
looks like a gorgeous like coordinate
frame here and then you open it up and
it's just as gorgeous when you sit at
their open because this has 5-10-15 eyes
shadows and I especially like the
configuration of shadows you get here
I'm actually wearing this today I used
it today
I use mainly the tones of pink and
purple so I used like I use satin sheets
this light pink on this really soft
lilac called cut the cake party girl
kind of a bright purple and there's a
wonderful matte shade called first-dance
right down here really dark matte plums
so you do get a good amount of matte
shades in here and some gorgeous
shimmery shades I'm so excited about
that green and then you pull out the
second drawer you've got what I'm
wearing is my blush today which is sweet
pink and Coco rose which is kind of a
nice little bit deeper blush chocolate
Soleil bronzer which I love I'm so glad
that's in there and candlelight glow
which is a highlight so I just add plus
the little cards with some ideas kind of
separate in what she gave me but I think
it comes with a full-size Too Faced
shadow insurance because she had that in
there too so I
it just comes with this palette but I've
always been a fan of the Too Faced
shadows and this is just a gorgeous way
to deliver it so that's great my sister
also got me a great makeup book because
she knows I like to read about makeup
and most of my books are sort of on
basic everyday makeup but this big ol
thing how gorgeous will this be on a
coffee table it's called makeup is art
and she found this on Amazon I believe
it says professional techniques for
creating original looks and the
illustrations are just gorgeous and it's
a lot of kind of inspiration type things
like the looks are things you know you
might not do on a daily basis sorry I'm
having so much trouble holding this up
but I mean it's just a lot of great
information pictures are just stunning
so I can't wait to dive into that and
read that book my brother got me a great
gift here it is the Sephora favorite
slash stash he asked me what I wanted
and this is something that's always so
fun to try I've gotten it for a couple
years now and basically it is a
compilation of various mini sized
mascaras that you can find at Sephora
but this time not only is the packaging
like way cooler than it's ever been but
you get 2 full-size products here in
large size product here's advance lash
booster so you've got some sort of
treatment and then the other one is the
Stila Forever your curl mascara but then
you get a bunch of you get one two three
four five six seven eight minis and a
Clinique makeup remover so those are
from Urban Decay two-faced makeup
forever
bare minerals hourglass Josie Maran and
tart and fairy drops so I mean it's just
going to be tons of fun to experiment
with those and thinking I might do
something I believe I tried to do it a
couple years ago on Facebook but I like
took a picture every day I used a new
mascara and just put it on Facebook or
on my blog or something like I also got
something from Malley and it is her
brand new palette it's called the even
more perfect palette she has the perfect
palette the more perfect and this is the
even more perfect so gorgeous fun
Packaging there and then you get several
brushes you get a lip magnifier which is
like a jumbo pencil a gloss a sharpener
and then the palette which is so cool
which I did get a chance to use I
believe I use this on my birthday
but you get a couple blushes you get six
great colors here most notably I think
the pretty purple here and a great dark
green which I'm super excited about I
wore that and not too long ago and then
there are two bases one is a like a
matte base and I think one is a well it
says it's illuminizer but I wasn't sure
if maybe you could use that it's like a
shimmery base for your shadow but anyway
I love these palettes because they're so
quick and easy to use just on a daily
basis for news and things like that all
the shadows I feel like are wearable
they're great quality great pigmentation
it's gave me this wonderful kit of
philosophy stuff because my some of my
favorite sense I don't know about you
but my favorite scents are the holiday
since stuff that comes out around
Christmas and Thanksgiving I feel like
is the best so this is the sweet kiss
kisses and Mary wishes set so it's
basically four of their body washes
slash shampoos that smell really awesome
and then for coordinating lip shines
which I also happen to love so those are
right here one is sugar sprinkles funnel
cake
then there's peppermint bark pomegranate
bubbly and eggnog so you get a lip shine
with each of those and as you can see
they kind of coordinate color wise and
everything but I am all about sense in
the shower and I just can't wait to bust
that out and try some of those these are
things that I really I'm not familiar
with these brands that all these are
brand new products for me
one is this kit from josie maran and it
is the seductive golds argan oil infused
color collection so you've got quite a
few different things in here that you
can try that are infused with argan oil
and like I said I haven't really tried
this before I do have a sample of argan
oil which you get another one here but
then you get several other products to
try and I've heard a lot about this line
from
liberté makeup artists actually Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist Mario dead
Ivana vaq I believe mentions josie maran
products quite a bit there's a lou
manizer a color stick and i just wanted
to see you know is this stuff really
wearable can it be long wearing even
though it's infused with that oil and
stuff and there's AG lip gloss and this
is some sort of an eye product here it's
a gel liner and a shadow so kind of a
double-ended thing there and get a
little mascara too so that's gonna be a
definite learning experience to see how
all those products work I have a little
eye shadow kit from Laura Mercier but I
haven't tried any of the skin products
which I know I've heard from more than a
few people that you love like the tinted
moisturizer and the concealers and
different products like that so I
thought this would be a good chance to
try that so it comes in this nice little
bag here you get a couple of different
applicators here one is kind of a velour
puff and one is a sponge and then you've
got a foundation primer as well as the
tinted moisturizer SPF 20 there the
under cover concealer you can see there
it's got two sides here and then it's
also got a loose powder underneath and a
couple of brushes you can use like one
really defined brushes the secret
camouflage brush and this is the
camouflage powder brush so there's a
little guide that you just dropped it
there's a little guy that goes along
with this to tell you exactly what to do
and I have used this once and I've
really liked the effect of it all it was
a natural look but yet it covered just
what it needed to cover so that is my
Christmas and birthday haul thank you so
much for taking the time to watch I hope
everyone had a wonderful Christmas and
please have a safe and happy new years
and look for more reviews on all of
these products in the future thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
