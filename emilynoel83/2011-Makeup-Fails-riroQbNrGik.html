misses I don't like the texture of it
not digging those there will always be
those few products that somebody's not
gonna like was ever a big fan of those
increased like none other
some of those misses are bigger than
others and those are the ones you'll be
hearing about in this video not a huge
fan was slightly painful it was that bad
hi everybody thanks for joining me for
this video this one's going to be kind
of a negative video because I'm gonna be
sharing my failed products of the past
year or approximately the past year
things that just didn't work out for me
and that's something really important to
remember is it just because these didn't
work for me doesn't mean they couldn't
work for you but there are some key
things that I'll be pointing them out
about each thing why it didn't work for
me and then you'll kind of be able to
say well maybe I don't have a skin type
or I actually like products that do this
or that so then you'll know if maybe
it's something worth looking into for
you but for me these are the things I
really didn't like and I didn't just
pull out certain things out of my
collection that I just kinda didn't like
or I was on the fence about I mean these
are things that I will never purchase
again I have a handful of products for
face then some for eyes lips and kind of
a body and a skincare product as well
first product I want to talk about is
this Almay wake up hydrating makeup and
so this is actually a powder product
here you can see the powder down here at
the bottom it actually the construction
of this product is sort of cool you pull
out this brush you've got something
that's like a typical foundation brush
actually nice tapered bristles here
rather soft brush and then you unscrew
this part and you've got your makeup
here and what's odd and sort of
interesting about this product is that
when you it appears to be a powder but
when it starts to come in contact with
your skin and like blend into your skin
it almost becomes like a cream and it's
it is an interesting idea but I found
this to go on really streaky and it
actually especially you know you're
applying it with this brush so it needs
a certain amount of pressure to make
that reaction happen where it kind of
gets turns creamy a little bit but
something I noticed about this was that
it has actual glitter and this is a
foundation and I know that's been a
complaint of mine about like Revlon
Photoready but this is much more obvious
what you're looking at right here see
that Sheen as I move my hand that's the
foundation and so it's just definitely
too much glow for me I wore this and
looked at myself not even a few hours
into wearing it and I thought what
happened a line of products that I am
NOT impressed with it all are the
Maybelline fit me bronzers and blushes
these are the qualities that a lot of
drugstore products had years and years
ago like when I first started using
makeup I kind of remember things
operating like this you know you put
your brush in it it didn't come off with
a whole lot of color but you kind of saw
well I guess that's the way that's just
the way makeup is that's the way it's
supposed to be well now you've got
awesome blushes coming out from like NYX
and Milani and covergirl cheekers and
all these different drugstore brands and
elf elf studio blushes you know they're
great and so the standard is so much
higher than it ever used to be and I
feel like now Maybelline has put out
this fit me line and I heard somebody
trying I've talked about these before I
think in my one brand tutorial and
somebody told me
that these are for younger these are
geared toward a younger generation so
that's why they're so sheer I say
baloney to that I mean this stuff should
you're paying for a blush you should
have a blush and I mean honestly I this
is medium pink this was supposed to be
for my skin tone looks like it should be
okay
but check out I mean the swatch on my
finger here it's like it's so light it's
like a highlight kind of that's what the
name of this bronzer is deep bronze this
is not deep I'm just saying that's not
deep bronze that's on my pinky there if
you can see it I I do not I do not
understand there is there are so many
other alternatives now in the drugstore
that I'm sorry but it makes these look
really bad
I'm all fired up about base products
let's move on to some eye products this
was one that I reviewed earlier in the
year L'Oreal the one sweep yeah this is
a applicator you're supposed to sweep it
across these and then sweep it across
your eye and that's it that's your Lois
would need to be a stamp you know
something that you directly put on your
look from here to here but you know
you're supposed to it's it's called
sweep what it was what is a sweep it
sweeps across and it just does not look
finished the quality of these shades are
not what and the okay it just broke it
just broke the quality of these shadows
is not that bad it's gonna be difficult
to use them and that's why I haven't
really gone back and used this a lot
because they're so so skinny it's hard
to get a brush in there to use them make
a lot of people's lives easier if that
did work and look good but it doesn't
you know how I love my wet and wild and
I love their regular eyeshadows but they
recently came out with these glitter
creams don't know if they're still
floating around in stores since they
came out like kind of a little while
before the holidays so I don't know if
anybody still got these they are limited
edition but they're it's a glitter cream
palette and really once you get through
a top layer of glitter if glitter was
what you're looking for you will soon
not have the glitter crease like mad you
can't just wear them alone so let's say
you got some partial glitter on there
and you're like oh I like to look at
this glitter on my lid well you're gonna
have to top it with a shadow to make it
last and that does not make sense why
would you want to top glitter with
shadow like what's that going to do but
that's what you have to do if you want
to stay and then like I said some of
these you get through the glitter and
it's like the glitter doesn't even exist
anymore it was just a topper for this
product and so I thought I wish they
would have just made me come out with
some new regular powder shadow shades
instead of giving us this which was kind
of a disappointment another product
probably my least favorite mascara that
I've used
it's from Laura Geller it's called at
long
lash mascara that claims to be
waterproof conditioning and high-gloss
part of the thing that makes it be a
high gloss mascara is that as if it is a
very wet formula and wet formulas
generally don't agree with my lash the
other part of the problem is when you
pull this out of the container it
doesn't clean off this smaller end it's
a very tapered brush and it curves and
when you pull it out you've got just
tons of black inky goop of mascara there
on the end and it's like you have to go
cleaning that off and then you still are
left with a wet and sticky form you
don't like the brush I don't like the
formula it does not do anything great
for my lashes so it's just not good
another eye product I want to talk about
are some false eyelashes and I don't
have them here to show you but I will
show you some video that I still have
when I did my initial review on these
but they are the kiss lashes with the
applicator strings basically what you've
got here is a great product that the
brand added something else do add a kind
of a little gimmick to make people think
oh this will make it easy to apply apply
false eyelashes but in my opinion it
made it way harder I struggled in my
video that I did with these because then
you've got these these strands and
they're supposed to help you position
the lash just so you know you've got
your glue on there it's supposed to help
you position it just right on your lash
line and then you pull the strips off
you are the strings they just pull off
and that was a struggle as well that was
not a pleasant experience my any means
plently the kiss lashes the zero threes
are my favorite and I mean they were
they got an Emily award for my favorite
false lashes and I went on to just take
the strings off and I continue to use
the lashes themselves because I like
them want a good tip for applying false
eyelashes and this is probably going to
oversimplify it to some extent but hold
them in the middle of the strip and then
align that with the middle with the iris
you're the pupil of your eye look
straight ahead into a mirror and try to
align it like that you don't need to get
like four fingers in here trying to do
this kind of a
set it on there and then press on the
inside and the outside to make sure it's
on
that's a easier way to do it then trying
to use these strings that really make
you feel like you're working a puppet
show or some product formula really
don't like it's covergirl shines last
all the shades are really sheer they
don't show up really much as different
colors on the lids
it's just slippery greasy oily I don't
like it for any reason when you put it
back in you have a real good tendency to
get a little bit of product coming out
around the outer edge of the cap or the
cat meets the container and I just don't
like that another unfortunate product at
least in my eyes so this year from wet
and wild were these juicy lip balms with
SPF 15 I've got a couple of these and
initially the smell is not great but not
awful this is a strawberry one that I
have here and when you put it on your
lips it's not it's not that it has no
flavor it has a bad flavor it's not like
oh that kind of is a little bit like
strawberry but not quite no well no it's
just like it's not good juicy lip balm
wouldn't that be something that might be
kind of pleasant to have on your lips
well this will like when your tongue
comes in contact with this it's it's
kind of like something that would keep
you from wanting to lick your lips
if you are kind of getting to that point
where you're like oh I want to perk up
my skin with a sunless tanner just a
heads up on one that I didn't think was
too good and it's sublime bronze splash
of Sun for body and so this is like
basically a spray gel sunless tanner
first use this it I thought it gave me a
really nice glow when on fairly easy it
dried decently well issue was how it
wore off like even after I knew I
exfoliated extensively it wore off kind
of like an alligator like it looks so
blotchy it got me dark rather quickly in
a few days but then it wore off and it
just looked it was not attractive I was
forced to wear sleeves on days I would
not have worn sleeves I mean it was just
not pretty so I would caution you
against getting the sublime bronze
because as nice as it will look in the
days you put it on it will not look very
nice in the days as it starts to kind of
wear off now a product from Sigma that
is probably their worst brush because I
love their brush sets but this is called
the cleansing and polishing tool and
it's basically this it's rotating in a
full circle you can see more on that in
a second but it comes with comes with
three total brush we're first using this
and thinking this hurts like it's going
in a full circle like this on your face
using the most gentle brush head and
thinking if this is what the Clarisonic
is like I'm not interested and then you
know I started to learn more about the
Clarisonic and that has a technology
that more so just wiggles the brush back
and forth so quickly like you can hardly
see it to the naked eye when they talk
about it on QVC they put a special light
on it they're moving back quickly and
that small of a movement this is moving
in a full circle and it really felt like
it was pulling the skin a lot and I mean
it only took me a few times to use it to
realize that like I should not have to
be in pain when I use this and I don't
have especially sensitive skin and you
know it may have been cleansing my skin
it
and you know getting off makeup better
than I do on my own but for me to have
to feel that way well I use it I was not
impressed so there you go guys lots of
products that did not work for me over
the past year I hope this was useful too
I know some people will say I don't want
to waste your time with a review that's
something I didn't like but honestly
those are things that need to be shared
because if it's really that bad then
folks should know and be warned so
that's kind of what I'm doing with this
video if you like some of these things
please don't take offense to the fact
that I don't like them we're all
individuals here with our own opinion I
tried to just explain to you why I
didn't like them so that way you're able
to make your own decision there you have
it thank you so much for watching thanks
for watching the Emily awards as well
which was all about wonderful favorite
products and have a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
