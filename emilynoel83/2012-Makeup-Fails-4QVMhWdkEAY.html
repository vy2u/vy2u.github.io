that you just don't like everything you
try some things are just you know maybe
not something you would prefer or
something you wouldn't wear all the time
and then there are some things that you
just most definitely would never buy
again and they did not work for you at
all and so that is what this video is
all about I've kind of split it up into
face eyes and lips and chosen a couple
things from each category that were
really fails for me in the past year
really important to keep in mind that
you know these are my experiences with
these products it's not to say they
couldn't be you know a great product for
you but for me they didn't work well
enough and hopefully as with any review
that I do I'll explain them well enough
to where you know whether you agree with
me or if maybe you've got a different
skin type or a different preference all
together and you'll be able to go from
there and figure out whether this might
be a fail for you too
first thing for face and this is sort of
lays on rrah of products that I found at
least in the American drugstores and it
is the BB cream holding up this one from
L'Oreal said magic skin beautifier and I
did a whole video comparing four
different drugstore BB creams and the
bottom line was that they had claims of
like perfecting your skin and you know
instantly beautifying the skin or
whatever and really they were nothing
more than a tinted moisturizer in
CoverGirl's case they just repackaged
what was sold formerly as a tinted
moisturizer started calling it a BB
cream now just to get in on the craze
you know people want to try BB cream I
feel like I wouldn't mind these
drugstore BB creams as much if they
didn't seem so like a deceptive I guess
like for example this one from L'Oreal
it says - it will prime perfect hydrate
and karez comes out like white and it
has the little beads in it and then it
adjusts to your skin adjusts I mean it's
gonna be the color it's gonna be
basically but it's it's not enough for
it like to be your moisturizer I don't
quite get the priming aspect because it
doesn't leave any sort of texture that
that totally smoothes it certainly does
not perfect because there's just no
coverage in it really and it correcting
I mean it's not coming close to what a
concealer might do so I just an example
of that were marketed more as what they
are which is simply a tinted moisturizer
if that this I wouldn't even call a
moisturizer I would call this like zero
coverage foundation I don't know I know
people talk about better BB creams that
are out there maybe it's high-end brands
maybe they are Asian brands while I'm on
my rant about products that promise
perfect skin and don't give it to you um
I would say the Maybelline Dream nude
air foam was one of my big foundation
disappointments this year it says air
infused foundation nude perfect finish
and basically this is something to shake
up and it comes out like a total thumb
I'll show you here in case you're
curious boom see in the little variation
of this tone from my own skin tone it
like it tints the skin but
does not cover anything is claiming to
be your foundation I mean it says
foundation on the can so I don't feel
like people might be attracted to this
because they're like ooh something new
air foam it's in a can it's kind of like
a little gimmick to to draw you is in my
opinion doesn't perform much more like a
foundation than one of these does
product from ELF and it's one of their
blushes I have it in blushing here and
it looks like kind of a decent shade of
pink
there's a lot of glitter in it and it
barely shows up that's the story on this
blush in a nutshell they used to have
the really affordable blushes they were
like one dollar and a little top slid
off of them and I actually liked a lot
of those here I think the price maybe
one dollar more and this particular
shade anyway I'm like what happened you
know that does not show up probably one
of my biggest makeup frustrations is
paying for product that does nothing for
you do want to try a good elf blush
their studio line which is three dollars
are I think amazing this is one of those
blushes where you know even on your
finger in a very opaque concentrated
swatch it's like it really doesn't show
up much sheer that out with a brush it
really doesn't you
on the eyes this was a product I was
initially very intrigued about it's from
it cosmetics and it's called hello
bright eyes and it says silk anti-aging
waterproof bright so this is like a
product a pencil that you could put on
your inner rim and I guess it would take
away the look of any redness there and
just make your eyes look wider more
wide-awake and the way this comes as you
get one that has that says matte
brightener so it's just like creamy and
then one has sort of a pearly look and
you know you could use these on your
waterline you could go around your inner
corner the issue with this is is
anything that's going to go on your
waterline needs to go on in my opinion
very gently very smooth I mean you're
getting right in there next to your
eyeball sometimes we lose sight of the
fact that no pun intended but when
you're getting something right there on
the waterline like you shouldn't have to
struggle because that's a very delicate
area and these I just couldn't believe
how dry they were I mean I'm having to
go fairly with a lot of pressure on my
hand to get a swatch out of these and
there's this other one the the matte one
here like I can't even make it show up
like it there's a little chunk of it on
there something that is a great
alternative to this if you are looking
for that eye brightener thing the Tarte
emphasized cells one and it glides on
like nobody's business like one swipe
and I mentioned that in the Emily Awards
I mean really really outstanding product
next up you got the top ten eyes shadow
collection from hard candy um this was
something that I saw and thought ooh
this is gonna be super cool but it was
kind of a dud and the reason why I
thought it would be good is because I am
such a fan of the hard candy baked
eyeshadow duo's the little round ones
with two shades I mean I think those are
absolutely awesome so I kind of thought
hard candy knew what they were doing
with eyeshadow sorry about the mirror
but the colors seem actually kind of
pretty there you know but when you
starts watching on these you start to
see that it's either like no color
payoff or a very very flaky finish very
weird place for me to swatch it but I do
swatches of it and it's like there's an
odd sort of clumpiness that
happens and I've had that happen with
some cheap I show you the shades in here
pretty good and then you hit a few words
like it's got this clumpiness when you
try to smooth it out it's a little bit
hard if I give you an alternative you
know of a comparable product I'm trying
to do that and if you're interested in
hard candy
definitely the baked duo's are the way
to go next up to face better than false
lashes this is a lashes Sten ssin system
says nylon lash extension little furry
dry fibers ok so there is no cream
binding this together to first apply a
little bit of the plain traditional
mascara and then the thought is that
those little furry parts I don't know
what the film but those extensions will
then stick to it lengthen out the lash
then you finish it off with another coat
of the black to cover all that up and
the first time I've used this I thought
wow this length is amazing you know I
really really liked it but this system
is such that I feel like with multiple
uses I was seeing more and more clumpy
thick spidery lashes I was seeing
actually seeing these fibers more I mean
you want those to just kind of work in
with the lash and end up being a pretty
sleek long lash but I mean it looked
really weird think part of the problem
was the fact that once this was coating
the lash and getting more of those loose
fibers on it then you're putting the
brush back in here those fibers are
getting back in with the formula and
then when you use this more and more
times becomes a thicker mascara that it
was designed to be a nicely designed and
applied false lash in my mind is pretty
incomparable that any mascara I've tried
I mean that is gonna give you the best
look and this mascara I mean thanks for
trying but it's not
next up for lips it's one of those
products where it's like wow great
concept
not so good delivery and it's these
benefit ultra plush glosses they're made
to coordinate with their boxed powders
so for example right here I have sugar
bomb
they have Dallas they have coralista I
think a different one look really good
like I would think that's a shade I
would really like for example for me
these just go on so here and end up
feeling kind of like a gloss with a big
lack of pigment on the lid I got the one
called Dallas was probably a little bit
better it was a little deeper it did
give off some color or a high-end price
tag to give me something where you know
it's a gloss it doesn't feel overly
sticky that's nice but it's not
especially long wearing and it doesn't
give off a lot of color it's just kind
of like an find a zillion drugstore
glasses that do more for me than got
into an Ulta or Sephora you could try
them out for yourself and see what you
thought but I was just kind of
disappointed with that line and next up
I hate to do it to your Revlon I love so
many a Revlon's lip products but I think
that standard that high standard in my
mind this product could not hold up to
it and it's the Revlon Colorstay
ultimate suede these lipsticks and I got
several because I just figured you know
they're Revlon they'll be good um not so
much basically are a rather dry lipstick
I loved some of the shades they put out
the way I make them work now is if I
want to use that particular shade I'll
top it with a gloss to make it feel more
comfortable other people have suggested
putting a lip balm underneath is the
thing when you put it on like as ice
watch it now I'm thinking ooh nice
creamy swatch you know and at first it
seems fine but it does not take long for
these glosses to really feel kind of dry
and a little bit uncomfortable on the
lips definitely not in line with you
know some of those more moisturizing
hydrating lip products which are coming
out left and right right now because I
think brands have discovered people like
those are my top makeup fails if you
want to call them that those are my
biggest fails of 2012 in the makeup
world least
be offended if I talked about not liking
something that really ended up working
for you I mean if it worked for you I
think that's great sometimes people get
really I don't know a little bit hostile
about you know a product even if it's
something I like and then you didn't
like or the other way around it seems
like people get very adamant about their
product bottom line I mean it's makeup
we're talking about here and this is one
person's opinion so take it for what it
is many people wanted to see this video
so I hope it was informative for you
thanks for watching all the Emily awards
videos those are where you go to see
some really great products in my opinion
and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
