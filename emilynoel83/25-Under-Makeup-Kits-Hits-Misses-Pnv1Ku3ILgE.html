me if you notice my voice is a little
bit deeper than usual I have a gold I'm
feeling quite a bit better than I was a
couple days ago but yeah I'm happy to be
sitting here happy to have some makeup
on and be talking to you you guys have
probably noticed I've done a lot of
high-end makeup reviews on this channel
lately especially with the holiday
palettes this time of year everything's
coming out in stores and pretty much as
soon as those things hit stores I know
we're all kind of wondering what's worth
buying how does this one compare to this
other one that this brand put out so
it's my hope that those videos that I do
help you make those decisions have been
asked like what are the drugstore videos
coming back and they are coming and this
is one of them but I guess I just wanted
to point out and you know if you've been
watching all of them like my high-end
videos haven't been all about like go
buy this this and this all these things
are must-haves because they're not so
that's what my channel is all about is
trying to help people make more informed
decisions well I've been trying a lot of
the high-end products you know I'm ready
to pounce if I see some drugstore sets
that come out that might be worth trying
and so I saw a bunch of them come out
recently on ulties website and I thought
yeah you know these things look great I
want to do kind of a under $25 makeup
gift set recommendations video and then
I got them home and tried them and only
a few of them turned out to be
recommendations the season is young I'm
sure I'll come up with maybe some more
recommendations still as the months go
along here but there really are some
things that were not so great that I
tried and I know you guys want me to
give it to you straight so I'm going to
tell you what worked and what didn't I'm
going to start out with the things that
worked this first thing I was really
really happy with it was $24.99 and it's
the NYX tricks of the trade travel kit I
guess the butter gloss in the all-over
balm are full-size but your other things
you know are a little bit smaller size
and I think it's a great opportunity to
try so many different kinds of products
because it's not like one of those
flat-out basic kits where it's like okay
here's your blush
here's your highlight here's your
bronzer here's lipstick you know it's
like there's some kind of interesting
things like the pore filler which I've
been using this I already had this and
it's kind of similar to the pore
fessional from
benefit only I think it's a little bit
more lightweight it comes out like very
almost fluffy out of the tube
it's very mattifying like on contact you
will notice your skin looks matte I do
think it does a good job of camouflaging
pores it makes your skin very very
smooth it's the type of thing you could
wear like all over your face for sure or
I think you'll definitely see the
benefits even if you target it in areas
where you just feel like you have the
most visible pores like for me that
would be kind of around the nose we're
into glow liquid illuminator this is
like a soft pinky pearly type highlight
it's definitely the tone of benefits
high-beam it's a nice mixer product so
you could put that in with the
foundation to make it more luminous you
could put it in with a moisturizer even
a body lotion or if you want it to look
very concentrated you could just apply
it you know straight to the tops of the
cheeks with the stipple brush or
something like that so that's great to
have the butter gloss and creme Brule I
love that they threw that in there
because that's a great classic nude kind
of peachy nude gloss I love that one I
really like wearing it on top of
different nude or neutral lip liners
it's just a great classic gloss very
comfortable smells amazing this video is
going to be a bear to edit because I've
stopped and coughed like so many times
this NYX HD finishing powder is a
pressed version and that's really really
handy I think especially for travel if
you use a lot of like the loose HD
powders I know ELF has one makeup
forever sometimes the loose stuff is a
little bit wild and crazy to take with
you but the pressed version here works
really well and I actually use that as
an under eyes setting type thing really
modified and helped perfect that area so
I like that this blush and contour duo
I'm wearing it today and the bronzer I
think a lot of people will be able to
wear that it's you know I've worked
pretty lightly today for my skin too and
the blush looks kind of deep here but I
feel like it wears like sort of a I
don't know soft peachy shades so really
like that this all-over bomb is kind of
cool it's in a little tin so it's like
an argan oil bomb it says and this
really kind of saved me today because my
nose was so like red and crusty from
blowing my nose non-stop and
really like just softened up the skin so
nicely so I could put makeup over it and
I don't know if you'd know that my nose
was in as bad of shape as it was I also
even put it on my lips to kind of pre
soften them before putting any lip color
on so I think you'll notice a lot of
uses out of that sure I will figure out
more uses as I continue to use it and
then you get a matte finish setting
spray so it's great to have a small size
of a setting spray there nice right
after you finish your makeup but they're
also great for like the periodic misting
throughout the day you know to kind of
freshen things up and I've definitely
used my dewy finish setting spray a lot
more than the matte finish but I was
using it today just playing around and I
spray quite a bit of it on and it was
kind of surprising how my skin still
maintains such a matte finish it was
definitely taking away any sort of
powdery look to my skin but I I didn't
have any do a shiny glow after spraying
this on so I guess bottom line this is a
great little try me set for NYX products
if you haven't tried a lot of the things
that are in here it might be a nice gift
for you or if you know you've got a
friend who's sort of try and step up
their makeup game with some different
products plus you end up having this
great clear zip around bag which I love
clear bags for makeup storage or travel
it's great to be able to see what's in
there the other thing from NYX is also a
$24.99 kit and I was so pumped to see
this on the website do you guys remember
when Nick's first came out with the
butt-naked eyes I was like The Naked
trend was going real big and the NYX put
out this like very cool toned eyeshadow
palette I got that way back when and I
know I've talked about it before they
came out with a second version which I
did not get I guess I just wasn't
compelled enough by the colors to try it
but this one I felt like I had to have
and I really loved it it's the butt
naked underneath it all here are the
colors oh is it this is not a palette
for all seasons I don't know what is I
look at this and I see fall I see
summary type shades I see winter a kind
of cool colors as well it's got a little
bit of everything in terms of finishes
pearly finishes shimmer metallic a lot
of matte in here also I think the matte
lovers will be really happy with this
now
really chunky and flaky about this
palette everything hangs together nicely
really nicely pigmented a few shades I
just like to point out I know the burnt
oranges are really hot right now so I do
have that shade worked into my look I
use this kind of gold any color on the
lids along with this peach and then I
put this in the crease and a little bit
of this as well really happy with the
way that look turned out and I feel like
I'm wearing that orange sheer so that
should give you a sense of how pigmented
that shade is it can really go big if
you want it to
I like this deep teal shade right over
here I also think a lot of people will
be interested in this shade here it's
like a classic taupe with that little
bit of plum thrown into it as highlight
is so buttery and amazing love that so
that's a lot of eye shadow product there
up top but then here's what you have in
the bottom you've got three tones of
highlight one is like classic champagne
one's a little more golden one's more
pinky and then four great blushes a
matte soft pink a matte like little bit
deeper rose shade this is a shimmery
coral and then this soft nude I'm really
interested to try it because it looks
extremely soft in the palette but it
swatches very peachy so I may be kind of
surprised with how that one comes off on
the cheeks I may love it I may not I'm
not sure on the whole I really like
what's happening down there and I love
what's happening up there with the
shadows so that's something I would
really recommend I think for 25 bucks
ish it's a really good deal the third
thing that I tried and really liked was
an Ulta brand thing and it's this love
your lips six piece lip collection and
basically they combined it says ulties
favorite lipsticks and glosses enjoy a
new look everyday mix and match for
beautiful buildable color so they put in
six different formats of their lip
products so I really like that idea
especially being one who is not
extremely familiar with oldest line you
know I've just kind of dabbled here and
there with certain products that have
interested me if you're like me and
you're just kind of curious this is a
nice way to test out I guess what they
see as their really good stuff and I do
love what they've put in if you're into
the really deep vampy matte lips they
given you one of their matte lip creams
in the shade a loose
if I think that's a really pretty shade
that I'm going to get some use out of
the butter bomb in the shade Anja I was
thinking this was going to be a lot more
sheer than it was for whatever reason
sometimes I'm just disappointed in a lot
of glosses I tried that this one very
pretty soft pink gloss this lip crayon
and daredevil kind of a similar texture
to a tarte lipsurgence it's a nice deep
brick read interesting choice and giving
you a clear lip liner that's kind of fun
to be able to sort of prime the lips you
might notice products clinging to your
lips a little bit better when you put a
clear lip liner underneath some people
also like to use these to prevent like
feathering outside the lip lines so I'm
going to need to use this one some more
and kind of test it alongside different
products to see how truly effective it
is but I think it's cool that's in there
to try the lip product I've been wearing
throughout the video is this super shiny
lip butter in Vienna this is kind of the
neutral of the bunch it's kind of like a
glowy neutral it's a little bit peachy I
definitely needed something today my
lips are just feeling so so dry I needed
something that was going to be
moisturizing I could not go matte today
if I went matte you guys would be like
scared of my lips because they're so
crusty but with this on top you wouldn't
really know it right it gives me a lot
of shine it really packs in a lot of
hydration so I'm super pleased with that
and then this lip color and you know
just looks like classic lipstick it's
number 215 raisin it's got a little more
like purpley Berenice to it than that
jumbo lip crayon does and there's just a
little sheen and the finish as well but
it's definitely my kind of color
I guess just something to be aware of
with this kit is that three of the six
products are pretty deep so if you don't
generally like to wear any deeper lip
colors you may not get a lot of good out
of this but if it's something you want
to try and then maybe split some things
with a friend you could do that I just
having to really like the different
things that they put in here and I
thought this was a definite like Ulta
win next I've got a product that I'm
kind of in the middle on it's a concept
that I love I think it's really fun but
the products inside I've just I don't
know I feel like this is maybe a like
younger teen type product and maybe some
of the stuff an adult might like but a
grown woman might start opening some of
boxes and be like another product with
glitter but basically Ulta has a little
beauty advent calendar and I think it's
really super cute so there's a little
like plastic sleeve that just slides off
so that's why I'm able to hold this and
nothing's falling out but I love the
color of it I like how each of the boxes
are like different shapes and you've got
these 12 days and you could give this to
someone early and they could open it
like each one on 12 days leading up to
Christmas or maybe like give it to them
on Christmas and then each day after
they've got some fun little surprise let
me just list out first of things in here
that I I could see is usable for me the
highlighter funny that the highlighter
in here like there are so many things
that are glitter packed but the
highlighter is not it's like a creamy
highlight kinda reminds me of benefit
high beam again like one of those NYX
products did but it's pretty you know
it's usable it's going to look nice and
glowy and work for a lot of people
there's a brow tint and it's one of
those little wand applicator style
things so that's kind of a fun thing for
people to try if you haven't used one of
those I like that they threw that in
here the lipstick is in a nice deep wine
color I could get into that for sure and
there's a butter balm in here that's in
kind of like an iridescent sort of opal
type shade which i think is a lot of fun
but that's kind of where the likes stop
for me because then it's a glitter eye
top coat which is flaky as all get-out a
glitter mascara there's an eye primer
which I kind of liked but they give you
this tube and you think you're getting
actually a lot of product but you
squeezes like there's nothing in there
there's hardly anything in there an eye
liner a glitter eyeliner I'm not a huge
fan of the basic pencils like that both
the blush and the bronzer are pretty
sparkly and then there's a mascara
primer which I could have seen the value
in had it not been one of those brushes
where the bristles were so spaced out
because the last thing I want to do
before applying mascara is like pre
clump my lashes together and that's what
a big brush or a widely spaced bristle
brush on a primer will do for me so
after hearing my thoughts you probably
know whether this is a hit or a Miss for
you or maybe it's something you want to
get and like split with a daughter or a
friend who loves glitter or something
like that
now that
was $16 by the way and these last few
things just I was not feeling them and I
really wanted to but I'm not and I've
just got to tell you and Maybelline put
out a little lip gloss palette okay this
is just I mean there's nothing special
about this to me if these were all like
really opaque popping on the lips type
colors I could rally around it
potentially but to me this just seems
like the cheap lip product that you
might get in some generic large holiday
palette and I'm just I can't get into it
for $11.99 I'm sorry but I think that's
hugely overpriced for what it is and it
really did excite me at first that a
drugstore brand was putting out a lip
compact but if you're going to take this
with you gotta have a mirror they do
give you the little lip brush which is
nice and these all are going to have
that shiny appearance it says actually
lip gloss palette which is odd and I
feel like that's just kind of a cop-out
for saying hey these are sheer and shiny
they're not really that pigmented then
these last couple things I have to talk
about something a lot of you all have
been tweeting me about I think some of
you have run into these in stores
already they're 14.99
and it's the gilded and Gold palette in
the up in smoke palette and so these do
have little mirrors on them and they
each have their own kind of
configuration of products inside and you
pull apart the shadow and blush and
underneath there's a highlight inside in
both of these you're getting like this
jumbo eye pencil in black and I mean I
feel like there's a higher standard for
eyeliners these days we put on eyeliner
we expect it to set not move this is not
that kind of a product and plus I mean
not being able to have that precision
it's just kind of bulky and unusual I'm
kind of surprised that they didn't just
throw in a smaller pencil there maybe I
mean I could see you know putting it on
for a black base but the amount of times
I actually use an all out black base on
my eyes is pretty infrequent in the up
and smoked kit you're getting the sheer
kind of baby pink gloss you know I still
think it's pretty I'm not a huge sheer
gloss lover but this one you know it's
not sticky I think it does have a really
like fresh pinky look to it the blush is
a soft baby pink as well very powdery
not a huge fan of that
the eyeshadows in this up and smoked kit
I think are quite nice I was very
surprised when I stuck my finger in
these and swatch these so nicely
pigmented in this highlight down here
very very shimmery a little bit on the
powdery side definitely usable I don't
think anybody's going to try this and be
like oh I love this so much more than my
favorite highlight I've already been
using but you know it's there the only
thing I've really loved about this kit
were the shadows and for me like knowing
what I know now about the rest of it I
don't think that really constitutes the
whole purchase of the kit this gilded in
gold palette again same liner situation
a really opaque red gloss I do like that
lip color that's probably the strongest
part of this kit because you look at the
shadows here and there's nothing super
golden like why wouldn't they give you
one incredibly strong gold shade for
shadow if this is called the gilded and
gold kit the one shade that I would
identify as the gold in here is just
sheer kind of flaky and just not a real
gold I just I can't rally around that
the blush is like a soft neutral matte I
do like that the highlight is a little
bit chalky to me whereas the other one
had a really like nice level of Sheen
kind of what you would expect from a
highlight this one is just like a little
to just plain white for me and you give
you a puff in there for the highlight
one of those teeny tiny blush brushes
which I don't usually tend to get any
use out of and a sponge tip for the
shadow but bottom line with these
maybelline kits as much as I love to see
a drugstore brand putting out some
pallets
I'm not going to automatically love them
if they're not great quality so I just
wanted to put that out there pass that
along because I know a lot of you have
been curious about these so that wraps
up this under $25 makeup kit pallet type
video I'm betting that by the time the
holidays roll around I'll have another
video like this as well but I just
wanted to throw this out there for now
since I had so many things to talk about
there were some hits some misses and
yeah I'm happy with the things that I
liked I mean those NYX kits the palette
and the little travel set I thought were
really cool and I like that old tulip
set as well so as always thank you guys
so much for watching I really appreciate
it and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
