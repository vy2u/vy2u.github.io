my video thank you for stopping by what
I'm doing is I get you it's one of the
video responses to the question what
three makeup products could you not live
without and I'm taking that as if you
were told one day for the rest of your
life you'd only use three products what
would you pick so and I'm going to try
to stick to some people you know get
like a family of items like all these
liners of a certain brain you're always
whatever and that's fine but I'm going
to try to limit myself and I thought
that was a lot so I've narrowed it down
to three and the first one I'm going to
say is mascara and picking a particular
brand it is covergirl fantastic lash
this is the product that I have on in
most any time you might seen you this is
usually what I'm wearing it's not
waterproof it's in the very black shade
it's very thickening it really separates
it makes it look makes you look like
you've got a lot of eyelashes not only
that though it makes them look very
thick so that is number one number two
is a lipstick that is in sort of a not
too shimmery basic red sort of shade the
reason why I'm saying that is because
number one I feel like for me I need
something a little color on my lips to
really warm up my entire face
and a particular brand is Mary Kay's
lipstick and amber suede is what I'm
wearing right now and another reason why
this is such a good idea to pick as one
of the three is because you could
actually you know use this rather like
on your fingertips and kind of rub it in
as like a cream blush almost okay so it
can kind of double as a product for you
there and the final thing is a bronzer
I've got a lot of bronzers that
like but one that I know is once again a
fairly inexpensive product but it's
really a favorite from a lot of makeup
artists is the wet and wild bronzers
this one's Bali bronze it's just got its
got some shimmer to it it's got quite a
bit of color that it gives off and I
like it so much and the reason why I
would pick say a bronzer over a blush is
because the bronzer can kind of warm up
your entire face you can use it all over
and really alter your skin skin tone
somewhat and a blush really you can't
quite take it that far so that's why I
picked a bronzer a mascara and a
lipstick another thing I'm really bad
with with what I thought of you right up
there would be an eyelash curler because
I think that's so important if you're
gonna do mascara at all to really make
it pop you've got to curl your eyelashes
but there is a trick if you have a spoon
you can actually like put that up
against like the rounded part towards
the inside of your eye and it will like
it will curl your eyelashes somewhat so
I mean if I gotta love it myself
those are the three products I would
pick and I hope everybody enjoyed this
little video response I hope lots more
people will try it out alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
