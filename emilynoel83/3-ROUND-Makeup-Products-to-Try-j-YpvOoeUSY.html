day um just wanted to pose a question to
you have you noticed how more and more
balls of makeup are finding their way
into our stores I mean it started with
the EOS lip balms right and now I'm
noticing a few more brands are trickling
out some round makeup products and I
mean they double as cat toys that's
really great I predict this is just the
tip of the iceberg I think in the coming
year we're going to see more and more
makeup products packaged in a vault many
of us have kind of been there done that
with the EOS lip balms so now you might
be thinking and this is just kind of a
gimmicky trend right now but I have
actually tried several round makeup
products or egg-shaped makeup products
that really work well and that I think
just as a product on their own not even
taking into consideration their
packaging I think they're really good
things the first thing I want to mention
are the EOS visibly soft lip balms now
these are different from the traditional
AOS and I do have a full review on these
bombs in the stripy containers but these
are actually I think a more hydrating
lip balm this is the kind of thing that
I have been reaching for when I had a
cold you know I wanted something that
was really going to nourish my lips and
let's face it the regular AOS lip balms
are super cute and I like them and they
totally have a place in my makeup
collection primarily it's like a lip
primer something I could wear under a
lipstick that's not going to really
change the consistency of my lipstick
it's not gonna change the finish I'm
talking about the ones in you know sweet
mint or summer fruit or those different
ones that came out initially you know I
can put those on under a matte lipstick
and it's gonna give me that extra little
bit of hydration but it's not going to
leave my lips too shiny to where it
changes the finish of my lipstick so I
like those but at the same time those
aren't going to be what I want to reach
for when I've got like a crack in my
lips cuz they can practically drag
across that and just not be quite
moisturizing enough when your lips are
in trouble so these are better for when
your lips are in trouble um it's vanilla
mint is this blue scent but the one I'm
really loving is the coconut milk
there's just kind of a soft natural
scent and these are colorless like I
said a great thing to reach for if your
lips truly are dry they leave maybe just
a hint of shine on your lip
in case you haven't tried these I do
think they are a step up moisture wise
from regular AOS second thing I want to
recommend is not only a lip product but
it's also a cheek product and it's the
physician's formula super BB and I have
it in natural peach and yeah it's in
that ball type shape it's a little
smaller than an EOS lip balm and I saw
this on ulties website I think it came
in two shades and upon getting at home
and looking at that I thought oh my gosh
totally reminds me of the majorette by
benefit you know just in the coloring
it's a pretty Coralie shade plus I was
really happy to see that there's not any
shimmer in this product I wouldn't say
it goes totally cream to powder and it
does seem to have like a little bit
drier consistency once you start to
blend it out which I love if I'm gonna
wear it on my cheeks I don't want it to
be super sticky on a different day I was
putting this on so I'll show you some
clips of how it looks but I love to just
take my ELF small stipple brush and kind
of drag it across there and then stipple
it onto my cheeks I think it's a
beautiful beautiful cheek color probably
my favorite way to wear this is on the
cheek I applied this with my fingers too
it is not difficult to apply with
fingers I just love the light touch that
that brush provides on the lips it's
really pretty too because you can kind
of create that harmonious you know cheek
and lip coordination on your face and I
think that looks really nice this is not
a lip product I would put on to help my
lips recover from being chapped or to be
you know that super super moisturizing
thing because it's not super shiny it's
not going to feel as super moisturizing
as a lot of other lip balms out there
but at the same time I don't feel like
wearing this dries my lips out if that
makes sense I feel like it lasts on both
cheeks and lips a really long time it's
got an SPF and an SPF 20 which i think
is kind of unique and it also has a
really fresh scent as well it's kind of
a little bit fruity I like it a lot I
would totally consider buying the other
shade but I must say I'm really really
glad I did end up with this peach
because I think the look on the cheeks
is just so fresh and the third ball of
makeup that I wouldn't recommend are
these Sephora kiss me balms again I
reviewed this on the Express channel
when I only had the Sodapop shade this
is the darkest one it's kind of a berry
tone
and it's really really beautiful these
are lightweight shiny tinted lip balms I
would use the word sheer to describe
them if I were comparing them to like a
bite lipstick let's say or a really full
color traditional lipstick but I do
think wear a tinted lip mom is concerned
they're more colorful than most but soda
pop is really pretty this was the shade
that got me on to it they each have
their own scent this one happens to
smell like a Dr Pepper lip smacker so if
you love that from the good old days or
maybe you're still using one of those
that's fine but this is really really
pretty I love that color a couple more
of these I got the candy apple shade
which is what's on my lips been on my
lips throughout this video and also the
one called strawberry fizz another thing
I should point out about these is once
the shininess wears off you do have a
little bit of a stain I was actually
really surprised at how much color this
strawberry fizz shape left behind on my
lips but they're all beautiful they are
a little more egg-shaped than an EOS lip
balm but I think as I said in the review
of this soda pop shade it's kind of a
diaper bag beauty product for me it's
the kind of easy quick thing you just
throw in there it's easy to grab for
especially if you're throwing any of
these things into a big purse one of the
benefits even though they're a little
bit bulky they're really easy to grab
for you know what you've got your hands
on when you just dig around blindly in
your bag so there you go those are my
balls of makeup that I would recommend
my spherical round products that are
coming out so thank you for watching and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
