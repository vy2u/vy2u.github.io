drugstore lately you've probably seen a
lot of new products from Revlon I'm
going to be talking about several of
them in this video giving you my review
on them I could have done individual
videos on all these but I just thought
hey I feel kind of at a place right now
where I feel like I can review all of
them so I'm just going to do them all in
one video so that's gonna include the
Colorstay whipped cream makeup also this
color stay shadow stick and the kissable
balm stain first thing I'm going to talk
about is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
cream makeup and it says 24-hour wear I
have it in the shade true beige which I
have it on now I feel like it's not
perfect for my skin tone I feel like
it's just a little bit dark but it was
very hard to make that shade decision
with these glass jars I mean I just kind
of thought well that's maybe about right
but it's pretty clever stim pression on
this was why are they putting out a
cream makeup which I considered to be
one of the heaviest forms of makeup
right at the start of summer I thought
that seemed a little odd but then as I
used it I came to realize this is not as
heavy as you might expect the packaging
and the packaging is really big in my
opinion it's a little bigger than it
needs to be because you look here you've
got a lot of extra glass going on the
product is actually right in here so
it's got a thick layer of glass all
around I actually love the way this
feels going on as you look at it here I
mean it looks like okay it's really
picking up some shine it looks like it'd
be kind of liquidy it feels to me almost
like the texture of pudding I think and
I really like the way it goes on I feel
like with regular Revlon Colorstay it
was kind of hard to blend you had to
work rather quickly once you got regular
Revlon Colorstay on your face you really
had to work with it fast because it was
going to set very quickly this you can
kind of dab it on your face you can take
a little more time and it just feels
really good as it blends in and it feels
a little bit more lightweight I think it
applies really well just with your
fingers but I do love using my Sigma f80
brush I think I talked about that before
it's a nice kind of flattop dense kabuki
style brush that you can really buff it
in and circular motions and I think that
works really well it's just the coverage
the appearance of this product on your
skin it reminds me of Revlon Colorstay
in that I consider it to be kind of a
medium to full coverage foundation this
sets to be a little more natural-looking
on the skin than color stay does color
stay you know some people will say oh it
just comes off cakey on me or whatever
and you know there are ways you can
combat that by using a damp sponge and
things like that but I feel like this
just has a slightly more natural
appearance I can't even say that one is
more matte than the other because
there's definitely no shimmer and really
no glow in this but it just seems like
the texture just the way this is texture
wise it just has a little more natural
look on the skin feel like this is good
for evening out your skin tone as a
whole it's not single-handedly going to
tackle your dark circles your sunspots
maybe
acne scarring things like that you know
some of those spots are still going to
show through it's going to become a
little more even but you're still going
to be able to see those things so that's
something that you may have to tackle
with some concealer after the foundation
but I do expect to do that after pretty
much any foundation I use in power with
this is really really good I also
consider regular colors today to have
really good staying power it has the
little 24-hour wear thing on there I
don't even want to know I do not want to
you know have this on for a full 24
hours and and then look at myself and
say hey look great no I just don't want
the makeup on my skin though what I have
on my face now has been on for 11 hours
and I purposely did not touch this up so
you could see what it continues to look
like after a days initially put it on I
did put a little bit of powder on
because I wasn't gonna go on the air
without like kind of feeling like I was
setting this so I put a light amount of
powder on over this and I have some
bronzer and blush too but I'm really
paying attention to this t-zone area
because this is my danger zone this is
where it starts to kind of break down
because I have come
oily skin so if you know that's what
seems to attack foundation the fastest
on my face and I feel like now I feel
like it's kept that you know natural
matte appearance throughout the day
which is great who is this good for I
would say normal combo even dry skin I
think this would be a really good
texture for you to try if you have
really severely oily skin I still think
that the original color stay for or
later combo skin is probably the best
thing for you to try I mean that seems
to be the foundation with the least
amount of excess moisture and it really
lasts a long time and it does have a
very kind of matte appearance to it so I
think if you've got severe oil struggles
that might be best but other skin types
I think this might be something you you
want to try if you felt like the
appearance of regular color stay wasn't
quite right for all I'm gonna keep using
this I really do enjoy it
and while the packaging is a little
bulky I like the way it performs staying
power is hugely important to me and I
like the way it feels does it go up goes
on it goes I'm very smooth and evenly
and it covers like you would expect a
foundation to so I like alright the
Revlon Colorstay smoky shadow stick
first impression on this I was pretty
skeptical because there haven't been a
ton of cream eyeshadow products from the
drugstore that have been truly long
wearing but this did have the Colorstay
name on it so of course I was holding
out a little more hope for this one
shade I have is smolder and it's kind of
like a really light icy blue on one end
and a very dark teal on the other end
and this is what the swatch looks like
you can see they're both shimmery and of
this stick is rounded and the other end
almost looks like a lipstick like it's
been shaped a little bit more mine might
have been might be losing its shape a
little bit more but it's actually got
like a little bit of a tapered tip going
on which you're going to inevitably lose
as you continue to use it more because
there isn't an
method to sharpen it back to the way it
was location-wise this glides on the
lids really easily but being a cream
product it's gonna be kind of hard to
blend it throughout your crease and
that's just kind of comes with the
territory of cream products you know
we're so used to grabbing an eyeshadow
brush and using a powder shadow and
going back and forth in our crease but
this you know you've got to kind of get
in there with your finger and I was
actually wearing this and only this
in my last video the flawless face
routine and I kind of was having some
struggles getting it blended because I
had the lighter shade on the lid the
darker shades starting to get it up in
the crease and it was like as I rubbed
with my finger I almost felt like I was
taking too much product away as opposed
to just blending out what was there so
it's kind of difficult in that staying
power for me when I use just this with
no primer and no powder shadow on top to
set it I would say the staying power was
average about 5 hours I would say the
intensity of the product really went
downhill it wasn't the color of it
really wasn't showing up that much
anymore the there was a little bit of
creasing not much but I would say there
was a noticeable difference in the way
this product looked halfway through my
day is supposed to when I just put it on
its own this does not beat the staying
power of the Maybelline Color tattoos or
Milani has some new shadow sticks out
that are really really good that I like
that I will review for you soon other
ways people will choose to use shadow
sticks and the way I use this today was
I actually wore it under some powder
eyeshadow staying power is fine no
problem made sure not to get too much on
there it kind of intensified the shadow
that I put on top of it and it worked
well and most cream products assuming
you don't put too much on most will work
well that way what's outstanding about a
cream shadow practice when it can be
worn on its own and you have no worries
about where that thing's going to go and
this I say is not totally worryfree
because it faded and increased a little
however this is not as bad as the
covergirl double ended smoky shadow
blast I think they were called those
were
really really greasy and Creasy and this
is not quite as bad as that let's talk
about the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stains my first impression on these
when they first came out I was just
giddy with excitement because I love a
jumbo pencil lip format and I knew I
loved the tarte lipsurgence products so
when i thought something's coming out
that's going to be like that but a lower
price I'm really into it is a jumbo
stick that's going to actually twist up
from the bottom so when you need more
product you twist it up you don't
sharpen it what's going to get a little
annoying is as you use them they're not
going to maintain that kind of a tip
I'll show you what happens with one of
my Tarte ones this is eventually what
happens to a tip like that this is my
tarte lipsurgence and it just gets
rounded off it's not like super wide I
mean these are jumbo lip pencils but I
mean you can still have some nice
control with them but they're just not
gonna be as precise once you wear them
down a little in terms of Halle supply
they go on super smooth not at all
greasy when you first put it on you are
gonna notice that little bit of shine
you like with most of these they really
are accurate to the color that you see
on the outside of the packaging that's
the color you get also they're all kind
of creamy in nature there they don't
have a bunch of shimmer in the stick
which is kind of nice because if it's
going to turn into sort of a more long
wearing product where you're gonna have
that kind of balm finish and then once
that wears off you're gonna have a stain
you don't want to see just random chunks
of glitter dry kind of just remaining on
your lips it's it's weird and I've had
that happen with other products that
have contained a lot of sparkles so I
like that these are just creamy and you
don't have to worry about staying power
wise I can wear one of these brighter
shades and actually still have color
left over at the end of the day without
reapplying so that's pretty cool you
definitely can reapply these for example
today I'm wearing this nude shade called
precious and I did reapply it before I
did this video and so you just because
they're long wearing and they're kind of
a stain doesn't mean you can't go right
over the top of it
and give yourself a fresh application
here the more colorful your bomb stain
is let's say something like one of these
the more staying power you're gonna have
left over at the end of the day the more
color is going to be saturated and
obviously still on your lips as the day
goes by a shade like this or shade like
this are not going to be as evident on
your lips as time goes on and part of
that is because what's helping this
stand out on my lips right now freshly
applied it's the fact that there's that
little bit of shine right there
once that shine goes away it's not going
to be as easy to notice that it's there
anymore you know what I'm saying so I
don't fault it for that because I like
this color and I will gladly reapply it
but I'm getting at is the lighter shades
even even this shade you know it's a
little bit lighter so as the day wears
on it's not going to be as obvious on
your lips
these are gonna give more of that
stained feel tearless far as color
selection I don't have everything but I
have a lot of them and I think there's a
really good selection especially in the
pinks and berry sort of family so I'm
going to swatch these for you and tell
you about which ones are my favorites
okay with the colors here first we have
precious that's this one it's right here
at the top and that's the one I have on
my lips right now so think kind of this
is your classic nude one then we have
charm and this one's kind of a light
peachy color it's right under here again
it's just a little bit lighter a little
more peachy whereas the other one is
more nude and then I've also got this
one in rendezvous which is your corally
orange really really oranges shade there
so keep betting some medium Pink's to
talk about first up this one here is
called honey and it's kind of like a
neutral dusty rose type shade it's not
real bright but it's got that little bit
of pink to tell them that takes it up a
notch from being nude then we've got a
shade called cherish that's this one
right here so this one we're seeing a
little bit of a lilac tone to it it's
very pretty
I mean I think it's really flattering on
but she just got that hint
of of lilac feel not too much though and
then this one is sweetheart is probably
your most classic pink in my opinion
okay the final three that I have this is
lovesick right here and you can see
where sweetheart was a little more
classic pink lovesick is incorporating
just a little more purple it really does
look brighter on the lips has more that
fuchsia vibe going on this one right
here is kind of a maroonish burgundy and
that one's called crush that's this one
and then my final one this is romantic
and this is the red and it's kind of it
like tomato red it's got a little bit of
an orange tone in there but I really
really like it I have been falling in
love with this shade and wearing it a
whole lot I think it's really pretty I
kind of got a thing for all of them I I
like this nude shade because I like the
shade I overall prefer the brighter
colors just because I like that they
function better staying power wise
throughout the day that stain shows up
more but I do think this is a really
pretty nude and I like the way it looks
with my skin tone I also like cherish
I've talked about this one but think
it's a really pretty pink and I think
it's fun to wear a pink that has just
that little bit of lavender twist to it
as I said I like romantic a lot which is
nice red and I also like lovesick think
of cherish just really taken up a notch
brightness wise the others are great too
I mean I like honey I like sweetheart I
think that the orange one is fun too but
just the ones I've been wearing a lot
more lately have probably been these
four really I mean I am making my best
effort to collect all of those because I
like tarte lipsurgence and I think these
compared to those a lot even with a
little better staying power they also
have kind of a minty scent to them that
I noticed most when I first apply them I
don't notice that that much after I have
it on for a while but I mean the texture
the feel I just love them and I love the
vibrancy of the colors as well you so
much for watching this big bulk review
of new Revlon then I really try to
thoroughly test out all the products
before I review them I was tempted to
put out reviews sooner on some of those
stuff but I felt like I just needed to
use it a little bit more just to be
certain about it so thank you very much
for watching let me know what your video
requests are as always and have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
