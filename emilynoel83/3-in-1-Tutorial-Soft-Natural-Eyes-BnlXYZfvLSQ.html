favorite soft and natural eyeshadows and
they're like quads and trios and
different little ones and I asked you
guys for your requests for tutorials
you'd like to see with some of those
different products so I've looked at
your requests I just do one video and do
three really quick easy tutorials all in
one so it's kind of one-stop shopping
you can see it all you're not the
product recommendations definitely check
out the first video but if you want to
see some tutorials keep watching and the
first one is this look that I'm wearing
now and it's using the covergirl
urban basics quad so I just applied my
Fergie wet-and-wild eye primer and then
I'm going to use kind of a base color
stick here this is from Milani it's the
shadow eyes in champagne toast it's a
really pretty color and I just feel like
the shadows especially these covergirl
ones really cling to this and pop a
little bit more with something like this
underneath and if you don't have this I
mean a primer will will help with that
too but as you can see this look this
particular shade is very pretty here and
I'm taking the urban basics quad and I'm
using this lightest shade here you can
just use the sponge tip no harm in using
a sponge tip and I'm just gonna blot
over my inner corner to brighten that
I'm gonna go to this light pink this has
a lot of shimmer in it I'm just gonna
blot that right here still kind of on
the inner most part of the eye then I'm
using my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
with this dusty lilac color going to go
all over the outer part of my lid here
then I'm using a fluffy crease brush
with that same color and guess what
we're going to the crease and I'm just
kind of with this brush I like to almost
blot the shadow in the crease first and
just get the color right where I want it
and then start to really buff it out and
as you can see we're going right into
this inner part and you know depending
on how much space you have between
your eye and your eyebrow take it up as
far as you want I've brought it up just
a little bit more just to kind of go
along with the shape I have in my
eyebrow but it doesn't have to be any
big thing just kind of make sure it's in
the crease and then just pull it up as
much as you wish if you want to really
define the crease even more use a
smaller brush with that same purpley
shade and you can you know get it right
where you want it and don't get me wrong
this is not purple purple this is a very
you know soft lilac shade that's not
gonna show up with a lot of Bandai life
I mean it's it's soft its sheer then I'm
using a smudge brush and I'm going into
this taupe color and this is great this
shade would be awesome you know all over
the lid if you want to do it that way I
also like using it as my lower liner so
this is just very soft you can see
there's not a real prominent line or
anything going on but this is just gonna
softly define the lower lash line
because it's not a dark shade at all
then you keep the look really bright I'm
using my Rimmel scandaleyes in nude
brightens the entire eye it takes away
the look of any redness you might have
there on the waterline just makes the
eye look a little bigger
what number two is a totally matte look
we're using the Physicians Formula
Canyon classics matte eyeshadow quad
here's a look at that I also throw in
some winged liner for kind of a glam
touch on the look but it's still really
natural eye shadow and as you can see
it's the kind of shadow that you could
really pair any lip with and it's gonna
work and not compete you know in any way
with the lips you've got on so I hope
you'll like it first stop I'm using my
Fergie wet &amp;amp; wild eye primer so just get
a little dab of that and blend it all
over your lid up through your crease and
up to your brow bone then I'm using the
canyon classic squad and I'm just gonna
use the sponge tip that comes with it
and go to this light ivory shade right
here and I'm going to take this right on
the innermost part of the lid and kind
of right around the inner corner as well
for some added brightness and just Pat
that on the wood next I'm kind of taking
a little bit of this dark shade and a
little bit of the brown right beside it
I'm gonna Pat a little bit of that just
on the outermost corner here just to
deepen it up a little so it's not like
100% white all across the list I'm using
a small brush and I'm again going to
blend these two you could just use the
darker shade for a little bit more
dramatic look but I find kind of going
back between these two just gives it a
little bit of a softer look and this is
natural I hear an inner to outer the
outer part we're going right in the
natural crease area that we have here so
whatever shape your eye is just stay
right there in your crease you can
really feel your brush there in the
socket not a lot of Darkness here but
it's just a little bit using those two
colors together then with a fluffy brush
I'm just gonna take a little of this
shade I'm just gonna also blend in the
crease a little added softness there
just above that I'm gonna take the
second lightest shade and I'm gonna
blend that right above this all kinds it
kind of depends on the amount of space
you have between your eye and your brow
if you don't have a lot of space then
you
skipped his last step that I did but
it's just kind of helping blend it even
more riding a sprint brush going to the
lightest color and using this right up
under the brow next I'm gonna take a
liquid liner just to give this a little
bit different look than the other
tutorial we did this is a nice way to
take natural eyeshadow and just give it
a little extra flare I guess so I'm
using my Milani color play felt tip
liquid pen in black lines so these pins
are really easy if you're new to liquid
liner I think they're very easy to work
with things just to make this look even
a little bit softer taking a smudger
brush to this dark gray I'm actually
gonna go on top of our line our liquid
liner with a little bit of this color
it's going over that a little bit it's
amazing what a little difference that
can make from the stark black line
having just a little smudge over it and
then I'm also going just under the eye
with the same shade
my third and final look in my little
natural eye miniseries all-in-one video
the first look was kind of cool and
neutral worked in sort of a dusty lilac
shade second look 100% matte a little
bit of winged liner this look is just
gonna be perfect heading into spring and
sensing this kind of golden a bronzy duo
from bareMinerals called the top shelf
and it's a very natural look I hope
you'll like it's time priming the lid
with my Fergie wet and wild eye primer
just a little bit of this goes a long
way and going all over my lid through
the crease and to the brow bones
sometimes I find that because these
shades are so close it can start to look
a little bit muddy if you don't sort of
layer them the right way so I'm starting
in the crease with the deeper shade so
then I can really make the lid pop with
the lighter shade and not get too
overlapped by all the blending so I'm
taking just a smallish crease brush here
and going into that and then I'm
starting in the really innermost part of
my crease see how its deepening up the
crease a little bit once we've done that
I'm gonna pull it upwards a little so
like when the eye is open you can just
see that shade peeking out above the eye
next I'm taking a fluffy blending brush
nothing on it and we're just softening
out the border then with that same brush
I'm gonna go into the light shade and
this is gonna become our highlight under
the brow I don't like this to look too
frosty and metallic so I just get a
little bit on my brush and then I can
build it up as I need to I'm taking a
small flat brush to this pinky parole
color and that is gonna go right around
our inner corner and all over the lid
and see how the brightness of this shade
will really show and once I get to the
outside taking a little more of the
bronze and just putting a little bit of
that on the outermost corner just to
make it seem a little more natural and
not quite so stark if you want you can
go back in with a little bit more of the
bronze build the shade out just as much
as you're comfortable with another great
shadow that I like to sometimes
incorporate with this duo is
single and brown smolder from covergirl
it's a nice kind of matte satiny brown
and it works great in the outer corner
just to give even more definition like
if you're taking this look from day to
night it can look really nice paired
with these shimmery shades next we're
going to do a little eyeliner layering
and this gives us a softened look on the
lash line and it's also good if you're a
beginner with the liquid liner because
it doesn't have to be incredibly precise
and perfect but first step I'm taking
this brownish bronze color from Tarte
and it's the skinny smolder eyes and
Sunstone bronze and just any creamy
liner that you have doesn't have to be
this exact one but I'm taking this in
kind of a somewhat thick line all across
my upper lash line and then I'm gonna
take just a little bit of that kind of
connected at the outer corner and just
do a little bit right there on the lower
lash line the outermost part and this
end has a smudger tip if your liner does
not have a smudger tip you can
definitely just grab a q-tip here and
just soften out that line a little bit
I'm one who loves the definition that
black liquid liner can give but
sometimes you do just want it to have
this softer look so here we've got
softer liner that I'm taking my Milani
color play um felt tip liner in black
and we're doing a very fine black line
just right next to the lash line
nothing thick not winging it out you
could though let's see how that gives
you just that nice little guide of where
to put it and it also you know instead
of just seeing black you see kind of a
blend more blended out look you could do
this with any liners you want you know
you could put purple under black or navy
under black any shade that's not stark
black you can even it could be really
pretty with charcoal too going back to
the top shelf taking that same small
crease brush that I used which actually
works nice as a smudger and taking the
bronze II shade and just going under the
eye and my trick all throughout these
videos to get that added
is to go with a light shade in your
waterline Rimmel scandaleyes and nude so
thank you so much for watching this
series I've never done anything like
this before where I've kind of plugged
three totally separate tutorials all in
one video but I thought you know if
people want one natural eye look maybe
they want three so let's see my full
video on all the recommendations of some
great really soft natural eye palettes I
will link to that video below I'll see
you guys later and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
