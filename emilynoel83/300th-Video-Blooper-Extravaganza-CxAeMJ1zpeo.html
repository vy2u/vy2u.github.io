abs this has been so loved that the
there's no label anywhere on this but
the shape makes me think it's Jane Doe
yeah I was thoroughly blown away but I
were to recommend something to guys in
makeup and out there let's uh let's say
have a foundation you know like you're
building a house you know it's a
construction all right that's more of a
guy problem than a girl problem I think
what you had to do you got to be all
manly and construct that layer of
foundation on the face okay oh wow this
is kind of cool
so all manly like you'll you'll put on
the beige foundation what brand like I
use covergirl you don't have to use like
all the colors of the rainbow in one
look lay down some powder on the cheeks
you must show the world okay this is my
brush I don't know what's with me and
two packs these two hazel it's a little
it seemed better day so we'll say that
let's just say and it's at its best and
it's a shining moment it was a great
brush it's got emu oil EMU or emu I know
everybody says it differently
Tyler has to show up forget about the
sky oh the eyelash curler let's of
course when I'm sitting here talking all
the examples are
leaving my mind but close your eyes a
little bit well not all the way just
look forward look that looks like right

meant to do this other people but you
got to kind of learn to laugh at
yourself in some situations you got to
get rid of your unibrow - gotta get rid
