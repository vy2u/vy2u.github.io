been getting some questions from some of
you asking for more Duke videos I've
been doing those kinds of videos for
years but it has been a little while
since I've done one recently and
actually just a few days ago I stumbled
across a really good dupe and anytime I
do that that's usually what spurs on a
video like this when I find one dupe I
want to look through my collection see
oh do I have more because you know time
passes you try new products both
drugstore and high-end chances are
you've got some things sitting around
that are dupes of one another and you
guys know this but I don't do these
videos to diminish the quality of a
high-end product I mean if we're wanting
to find dupes for them obviously we like
these products we're just doing this to
point out the similarities and give
people an alternative if they don't want
to spend their money on a high-end item
another thing that's kind of interesting
about the highlights I'll be sharing
each one has a little different tone
I've got one that's sort of pinky one
that's more peach one that's champagne
and one that's very like white I almost
added gold I almost had dupe for my
laura geller gilded honey highlight but
in this lighting I thought I had it last
night but today I looked at it and it
just didn't look close enough to me
first one and this was the one I
mentioned kind of stumbling across as I
was trying an older product in my
collection and it's a dupe for clear
radiance from bareMinerals so that is in
this little holiday trio that I reviewed
not too long ago on my channel and clear
radiance is really kind of a unique
shade first off the glow is extremely
subtle and it just has the slightest
pinky tint to it so when I was trying my
Physicians Formula happy booster in
translucent it does have a slight pinky
glow and the shimmer in this is super
subtle so I feel these are very much
dupes of one another if you are looking
for that slightly pinky tone highlight
this would be a great option now this
next one is kind of a peachy highlight
slash blush I think if your skin tone is
light enough this could definitely come
off as a blush on your cheeks and I'm
talking about the cindy lou manizer from
the balm and the dupe for this is the
Maybelline master highlight in the shade
called coral I've had both of these in
my collection for quite some time so I'm
kind of surprised I'm just now realizing
what great dupes these are for one
another
cindy lou manizer you know there's a
beautiful glow to this as
there are two all of the Luminizer
highlights from the balm but this one
very peachy and just a little bit golden
as well and so coral from Maybelline you
swirl your brush or your finger in all
of these you really pick up that similar
effect because there are some little
shimmery parts to this mosaic highlight
as well as some very pigmented peachy
aspects to it as well so I think those
are awesome dupes my next dupe is for a
beautiful Becca highlight love the Becca
highlights this one is champagne pop and
it's the Jacqueline Hill creation it's
got a beautiful glow to it that's like a
little bit golden a little bit peachy
it's very very pretty and the dupe that
I found in my collection is the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips in
Vegas strip so these are kind of
interesting because depending on you
know what parts of this palette you use
you can get a different look and the
trick to getting the champagne pop look
out of this palette would be to stick to
all of the shades south of this really
yellowy gold at the top because that
does make the overall look a little too
gold but everything down below all mixed
together it definitely gives you the
champagne pop look and to kind of
demonstrate that today I've got
champagne pop over here I've got the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips and
Vegas Strip on this side and I feel like
I'm getting a great glow on both sides
and these are actually marketed as
bronzers they're really pigmented and
it's all about the way you want to use
them you know if you go more toward the
light end of the spectrum you get more
of a highlight if you wear it deeper you
know maybe it could act as a glowy
bronzer or I have been known to use
individual shades as eyeshadows as well
so they're a very versatile product now
I was recently sent the Becca champagne
glow palette which i think is kind of a
holiday release featuring champagne pop
and a couple of other shades you've got
blush copper and then this shade called
pearl and let me be honest with you
pearl is not an especially hard shade to
do because unlike some of these others
have like a little bit of pink or a
little bit of gold or a little peach
this one is just like a very pure glowy
bright white highlight and the dupe for
that is actually from colour-pop it's a
new one called fanny pack and I believe
it's actually like a limited edition
holiday one that just recently came out
but intensity wise when you swatch these
side-by-side they look identical one
thing to note about the colour-pop
texture is that they're almost like a
little bit of a powder cream hybrid so
you touch the product your finger kind
of sinks in but I find application wise
you know you can apply these with a
brush you can apply them with a finger
really will give you the same look that
you get from pearl and you can choose to
apply it more heavily lighter so those
are my highlight dupes that I have to
share with you right now like I said I
would have had five but I just was not
satisfied with my gilded honey dew pup
with I hope this was helpful thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you soon
