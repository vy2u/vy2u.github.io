a wonderful day gather round we're gonna
have a little discussion about four
relatively new palates at Sephora I've
been playing with these for a while and
my decision to include them all together
in one video isn't really because I find
that they especially have anything in
common and I'm trying to like compare
one to the next it's more or less just
the fact that I've realized what I think
about all of these and I thought it
might be fun to just kind of provide
some swatches and some mini reviews and
just a little discussion about them all
in one video I found a lot of positives
quality wise across all of these pallets
but there are a few drawbacks here and
there sometimes with shade selection
sometimes with the textures of maybe
certain formulas in the pallets might be
a few things that I question here and
there but I'm gonna go ahead and start
with the one that impressed me the least
I'll say and it is the crystal drama
palette from Bobby Brown now I don't
think this is an all around bad palette
and as I open it up and I look at this
color selection I actually think it's
very very pretty because I am definitely
one who can enjoy these kind of dusty
lilac shades happening here but I also
love the warmth and sort of this golden
tone that's enclosed all within one
palette but there are a couple of things
that are a bit of a problem for me first
off when you look across the top here
we've got quite a few light shades and
when you have this palette in your hands
and you really look closely at the
finishes yes there are some different
textures one might be labeled as one of
their classic matte eyeshadows one's a
metallic eyeshadow one's a sparkle
eyeshadow but ultimately when it comes
down to getting these somewhat sheer
doubt on your eyelids certain ones look
a lot alike in a relatively small
palette I mean I've got three shades
here where I could practically use those
interchangeably they look so much alike
another problem that I have with this
palette is depth and I used it for my
look today at first few times I used it
I found myself always being drawn to
these kind of purpley and cool colors up
here in a time or two I did mix in some
of these but today I wanted to just do
like a purely warm look with the more
golden colors and what I found time and
time again is that there's nothing dark
enough in this palette I feel like for
all of these shades they could have
swapped out maybe a couple of light
shimmery colors and given just a rich
matte plum or a really nice deep dark
Brown let's say just something that kind
of allows you to break up some of the
shimmer that's happening with this
palette not knocking the shade an
eggplant right here I think that's
gorgeous cognac is great and I've got
some cognac in my look today as well as
a live this shade and some of this in my
crease but I find myself wanting at
least the option of having a little more
depth there to really set off some of
these highly shimmery colors so it's a
palette that in my opinion has gone a
little bit overboard on the light shades
and I think at least we need to have a
couple of dark mattes the only too true
mattes that you have in this palette are
right here this shade called dusty lilac
and then this one called toast another
thing I'd like to point out is that
there are a handful of shades in this
palette at least from my research there
might even be more it's possible I
missed some but I went through Bobby
Brown's actual website where individual
shadows are sold and I found that
eggplant rose gold toast and cognac are
all available individually and for some
people maybe those who collect a lot of
Bobby Brown eyeshadows maybe you don't
like to see them repeated in different
palettes or maybe you think gosh I've
been wanting to try those kinds of
colors it's great that they're in a
palette a lot of people might have a
different perspective on whether that's
a good thing or a bad thing but I just
wanted to point that out for me
personally I don't own a ton of Bobby
Brown singles but I do happen to have
two of these I have rose gold and I have
con yacon there own and those do happen
to be a couple of the strongest shades
in this palette I really am not hating
on Bobby Brown's formula as a whole
because I think there are so many things
going right here with the textures of
certain metallic shades I do love the
way those two mats that they give you in
here feel and apply but not only am I
not in love with the textures on some of
the lightest shimmery shades I also
think we could have done without just
the sheer amount of those shades in the
palette and I think I mentioned in a
vlog that this palette color scheme wise
kind of reminded me of Too Faced
white peach hard to not get a glare on
these but a main difference I think
you'll notice is that the white peach
palette has more like peachy pink tones
in there although they also do have kind
of that golden a warm peach have got a
deep color that kind of reminds me of
that Bobby Brown eggplant shade if you
kept up with my past videos you might
have remembered I didn't give this
palette a glowing review because I found
quite a bit of inconsistency in the
texture of the shades so
little more pinkness happening in that
one that's the main difference that I
noticed next up I want to discuss the
violet Voss hash tag palette I was
really drawn to this palette when I saw
it on sephora's website I do love what
I'm seeing here in terms of just the
range of color and that sunset vibe you
know oranges Purple's golds all kind of
mixed within one palette it was just
really eye-catching to me number one and
number two I'd never used a violet vos
palette before so I thought now's the
time I'm ready to jump in like this one
has finally really drawn me in I'll
point out here that the top row is all
matte and then there are just a couple
more mattes sprinkled throughout this
color called goals and then TBT right
here are both matte shades everything
else is really really shimmery this is a
palette that's full of what I would call
statement shades those mid-tone colors
that you know in a swatch they're just
gonna practically bounce off your arm
you know they are so glowing so intense
I really don't have quality complaints
with this palette because I do feel like
all of these shades are really what you
see is what you get colors there's
nothing that was really disappointing me
or not turning out to be what I expected
so from that standpoint I really like it
I also do like that they made the effort
to give you some really nice basic
shades but here's what I want more of
guys and this is what allows I think
some of these statement shades to really
be shown off and look their best and
give you the biggest variety we need
more dark colors and now I know they've
given you a black and they've given you
some kind of mid-tone Browns and warm
stuff here but I'm talking like a really
dark purple or a really dark red a very
very rich Brown and if you're not with
me on this statement just hear me out
here I've tried a lot of eyeshadow
palettes and it's so easy to get like it
sort of knocked over by the beauty of
some of the highly shimmery shades that
are in a palette and they are doing that
formula right and they are delivering on
the intensity but what can create the
most potential for variety is having
dark shades that can kind of layer up
over some of these shimmers and
completely change the direction of the
look now yes they did give you a black
in here and that's nice and that can
create contrast and that can create
darkness but having maybe a few more
dark colors in here
and I think really changed the game like
layering a dark matte red over one of
these goals that could be gorgeous
having a really rich dark plum to play
with over some of the Reds and other
Purple's in here it would create an
option for so much versatility because
when you have a good quality matte dark
color you don't just have one color
there you tend to have a range I know
I've said this before with different
visi art palettes I think it's the
purple in the amethyst palette you know
it can look one way full on you can then
shear that out and it can have like
about three or four extra levels you
know and so I think there's always value
to have some rich dark mattes in a
palette especially one that has this
many bold mid tones we need some more
richness to balance it out I mean we
have literally like five variations on
metallic gold here we could have lost a
couple of those in exchange for a couple
of really deep dark matte colors that
can switch up the looks I have done some
looks that I thought were really
beautiful with this palette I mean I'm a
purple fan on the gold fan I'm a rosy
gold warm lover so I am behind the
overall concept here I just think there
are a couple ways it could be done a
little bit better and shirt pull in
those shades from other palettes make
use of other colors and singles that
you've got combined palettes that's
completely legal you guys know what I'm
sitting here reviewing a palette I'm
looking at the palette itself I'm saying
is this everything I need and this just
lacked a little bit next I want to chat
about the Urban Decay backtalk palette
so you've probably seen a lot of images
of this floating around on social media
Urban Decay is kind of working with a
similar concept here to what they did
with their shapeshifter palette which
had like powders on one side and creams
on the other for contour and correcting
and whatnot I thought that was a
brilliant packaging design and I think
this is another brilliant packaging
design because look how compact it is
ultimately no wasted space here and the
mirror does come out so if you'd like to
you know lay your pallet flat hold your
mirror however close you need to to your
eye you know what I'm applying mascara I
like it close I just think that's a nice
touch and I love a good combo palette I
like something that's going to give me
just utter satiety so here on the blush
side you've got a matte blush with this
shade called double take and then you've
got a shimmery blush which I am wearing
that
and that's in the shade cheap-shot
brings out some of those kind of plummy
actual natural blushing tones that our
skin gives off I think that's kind of
cool you got a couple of highlight type
shades loci for me is something that
looks pretty just sort of layered right
on top of where I would place blush and
then party foul party foul I love that
shade just as a statement type
highlighter like it's very bold I
haven't always had the best success with
Urban Decay's highlighters but I really
do like that shade so I thought the face
products were really strong here and I
do enjoy the eye shadows as well I tend
to be a fan of a color scheme that is
gonna give me some read a little bit of
purple couple of kind of mid-tone mattes
this verging on a little bit deeper
matte here with the brown I thought that
WTF shade is so strong and even 180 here
while this brown does have some shimmer
to it I do feel like it's rich enough to
create some decent contrast with these
looks still could have maybe used like
one really really deep dark color but
you guys probably already could have
guessed that by now but as a whole I
have enjoyed the looks that I got with
this I felt like it was an easy everyday
you know you throw together the look
you're not overwhelmed with
possibilities but yet you do have
distinct possibilities here these two
shades called shade here and attitude I
think are wonderful assets to this
palette because you can go a little bit
more pinky with it you can go a little
more rusty and warm and you can also
forgo those shades entirely and keep it
a very classic neutral eye now bare and
curved I feel like these shades swatch
pretty solidly these are just light ish
shimmery eyeshadows but I don't love the
way they apply on the lids I think they
feel actually a little bit dry and I
would like them to just pack on a little
bit better I wish those shades here were
more the texture of these deeper shades
because those feel like really soft
buttery smooth metallics that's probably
my biggest complaint with this palette
and all in all I mean if you're looking
for a multitasker if you like the idea
of having so much in one and those color
tones that involve kind of Mavi getting
into reddish and purple shades if that
really appeals to you I think you'd
enjoy this palette it is brilliantly
designed and if you've ever been
confused about like oh what blush looks
good with this eye look or whatever I
kind of love that it's all there for you
and it takes a lot of guesswork out of
it so I
like that back talk palette but I would
say that my top palette out of
everything I'm going to talk about today
comes from pretty vulgar and it's their
new Phoenix Rising palette a lot of
their stuff has a bird theme on it so
there you go if you feel like this brand
is coming out of left field they are
fairly new to Sephora and I did a video
months back reviewing a lot of different
things they have several other palette
safes products lip colors blushes I've
already reviewed actually quite a bit
from this line so I will include a link
to that video below if you're curious
but this latest palette is really
impressing me first off I think it's
beautiful just to look at and I do like
their little birdcage you designed here
the way they lay out shadows and their
palettes I think that's really fun and
creative even just to completely
disregard the cuteness I think this is
one of the best like rich palace like it
is just rich rich rich as the word I
would use to describe it I've been
asking for deep matte colors because
deep matte colors can be some of the
most transformative colors in a palette
here we go we have them we have ways to
go warm and kind of brownish we've got
gorgeous Burgundy we've got purple
really really dark red and perhaps one
of the darkest richest plummy Reds that
I've ever seen I feel like the quality
of these shades both shimmers and mattes
is so comparable to visi art I mean the
smoothness the evenness of them the sort
of little bit goes a long way
pigmentation and yet they're not overly
flakey and just creating copious amounts
that fall out that's not an issue for me
and at a glance I think you look at it
you think gosh that is kind of a dark
palette but there truly is a lot of
balance happening here because you've
got light shimmers this peach this
always rising shade is just gorgeous and
then there are a couple of other really
nice rich shimmers up there here's a
desire right over here this gorgeous
rose gold that's right there on my pinky
pinky swatch when you take these shades
and start playing with them all over the
lid and then start coming back the other
direction layering back over them with
something like blowing smoke down here
or resurrected sin or devilish darling
down here or just keep it a brown look
there's a great like milk chocolate
brown right here you'll find so much
versatility as you shear out some of the
deeper shades and layer them up with the
shimmers it surprised me I wasn't really
thinking that I would see
a huge must-have palette coming from
this line but I am eager to like bust
out a tutorial with this palette for you
guys so you can really see what I'm
talking about in action but it is a
strong strong palette now if you're a
die-hard cool a shadow lover this may
not be for you because there's so much
warmth happening here if you do like
your warm shades and you've been craving
that richness of color
it's totally here for you so guys I hope
that was helpful just a little roundup
on for new ish palettes from Sephora I
would say my fourth place thing here
would be the crystal drama this is the
one that I think is lacking the most
questionable quality on some of the
light shades and we definitely needed
some deeper colors in there to highlight
voss hashtag palette absolutely stunning
array of statement colors and I think it
once again needs more dark colors to
come in there and help balance it out
and create endless variety potentially
backed up palette I was really pleased
with this I think it's a great everyday
grab it and go basic I really do enjoy
the color scheme I like the quality of
the face products as well as the eye
products there are a couple of shadows
that I think could have been better I'm
not saying you can't work with them and
create a look with them if I had my
choice like I said a couple of those
lighter shades could have been a little
bit smoother richer texture in my
opinion but a real gym here phoenix
rising from pretty vulgar i mean it's
gorgeous it is just so beautiful if
these kinds of colors are up your alley
i think you would absolutely love this
palette no disappointing shades so thank
you guys so so much for your time i had
a lot of fun doing this video and i will
see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
