video's sorry my hair is wet right now
just got out of the shower not too long
ago but I am putting together a look
with only four I products and they're
all one dollar piece so that equals a
four dollar I tutorial so very very
affordable it's using some products from
ELF I've gotten some requests from
people saying you know you told me to
get these different health products and
now how do I use them so I wanted to
just kind of combine a few items there
and see how you can get kind of a smoky
light brown sort of natural i look with
them and you know i think it looks like
you know you probably spent a little
more than you did on this look so if you
want to see how i pulled it all together
keep on watching its to just apply an
eye primer all over your lid and then
i'm going to take my ELF duo eyeshadow
cream in butter pecan and I'm going to
use this peachy shade here first it's
kind of like a golden a peach it really
kind of reminds me of rubenesque Paint
Pot only it's a little more it goes on a
little thicker than that but you really
don't want it too thick because too much
of this will give you kind of a lot of
creasing so just keep it a really thin
layer and apply that all over your lid
all right next I'm going to take this
sort of like golden a light brown shade
next to it and I'm going to apply that
mainly on the outer half of the lid and
kind of up into the crease just a little
bit just like so
you ain't even more like a base color to
work with next step I'm going to take my
ELF brightening eye shadow quad in Lux
and this is one of the one dollar ones
so you get four shades in here one
dollar and I'm going to use this
lightest brown shade right here and I'm
going to use my Sigma SS 239 brush this
is from the travel set get some of that
light brown on your brush and then just
Pat it all over your lid and you're just
going to see a you know a nice warm
brown color it kind of come through here
looks really really pretty over that
peachy shade and the shade doesn't have
a whole lot of shimmer to it but when
you put it over that kind of creamy
shade it does seem to have a little bit
and then just putting that very same
shade right here in the crease I'm going
over that cream shade we put down there
this would be a really nice stopping
point for a nice natural look if this
was all you are going for because I
think that looks really pretty and warm
but we are going to keep going a little
bit and the next thing I'm going to do
is just go ahead and get my highlight on
there which is going to be this light
cream shade right here Justin that
creamy sort of like a butter cream type
shade and I'm just using my SS 224
getting some of that on there and just
going right under the brow bone with
that ok
now the next step is to take the darkest
brown shade it's so dark it's almost
like a brown black I would call it right
here and I'm going to use my SS 219
which is kind of like a little pencil
brush it's very very stiff and it's it's
nice for getting some control in here if
you're working with your crease in your
outer V area so get some of that shadow
on there and you'll be surprised at how
a little bit does kind of go a long way
and just kind of work that into the
inner part of the crease blend it down
on to the lid just slightly and work it
out here in the outer corner
and just build it up as dark as you want
I'm just kind of keeping it kind of with
a smoky sort of look here but it's not
overly dramatic so you can see it's
still kept pretty natural but just using
that as your outer V shade can give you
a little more drama and then you'll
notice I'm using this brush to kind of
blend that shade right in under my lower
lash line here so it's like I'm getting
it in my outer corner and then just
dragging it down you might want to get
just a teeny bit more on your brush and
just go right under here this is this is
a ideal brush to give you that kind of
smoky look underneath your eye because
it's it's just this is such a stiff
brush I have other brushes like my
essence of beauty fine crease brush that
is very much the shape but and it's
great for doing an outer V but it's not
quite stiff enough to keep that shadow
you know very controlled right under
here because if you're messing with
shadow under your eye in this way you
really don't want it to be going all
over the place you want a nice stiff
brush to use there okay so I'm just
getting that all the way under next
we're going to play with this really
pretty red shade right there so that's
going to be kind of our transition color
between these dark Browns and this light
cream shade so I'm going to get some of
that on my SS 224 it's that fluffier
crease brush and see how that really
just warms that up there very very easy
to do a little bit of this shake can go
a long way also so don't load up the
brush too much but I'm just blending
kind of circular motions just on top of
that light cream shade for our liner I'm
going to be using the elf brightening
eye liner in coffee this is a brown
shade and again this is one of the one
dollar pencil eyeliners um not really my
favorite kind of eyeliner but I
you guys may know about me I like to
even if I get something that's not my
absolute favorite I do like to make it
work and I actually think this is a nice
shade for the waterline and so that's
what I'm going to use that for I'm going
to take that coffee color and just run
it right there this is kind of a medium
brown and get it right there on the
water line I'm usually i would use black
on the waterline but I kind of like the
look of this more of a smoky Brown type
look so just get that on there and then
if you want to what I did a little bit
on the other side was I ran it down on
my natural lash line as well just to
kind of smudge it in there between the
between the lashes adding a little look
of thickness they're going all the way
into the inner corner but again the look
is very smudged out it's not super
precise or anything like that on the
upper lash line I'm just really not
doing a whole lot with this liner other
than just kind of getting a really you
know not to define just kind of smudging
it very very close to the natural lash
line here we're not really going all the
way in or anything we're keeping it
mainly on the outer half and just kind
of smudging it on just to give a little
darker shade there but not necessarily a
defined line okay and if you'd like to
at this point to sort of set what you've
done you may want to go back to that
pencil brush and dip it in the dark
brown go over that one more time just
helps to set the liner that you've put
there you can kind of read to find this
area go over your upper lash line again
just like so next is mascara I'm going
to be using my ELF regular and
waterproof mascara duo this is another
one dollar product so as you can see
here we've used only for products and
they're all one dollar apiece so a very
very affordable look and once I get that
on there I will join you what the
finished guys here is the finished look
very natural yet a little bit on the
smoky side for this brownish kind of
look using the elf quad in Lux and that
is just a one dollar product all in all
I used for products for this look
they're all one dollar piece all from
else I like to just challenge myself
every now and then to just use you know
the bare minimum to see you know what
kind of a look you can pull off with it
and this could be even darker or even
lighter you know you can definitely go a
lot of ways with with a quad like that
but it's definitely easy to pull off and
very affordable no matter how you look
at it so what I have on my lips here is
one of the new maybelline finding its
color sensational lipsticks and this
shade is called born with it and it's
just a really light nude shade with a
hint of pink so I really like the feel
of these lipsticks I'll have to do an
actual review on them soon I have two of
them and this is the only one I've tried
so far but I'm really a fan of it it
feels good very moisturizing and the
color is very true to what it appears
like in the tube as well so anyway guys
thanks for watching this video and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
