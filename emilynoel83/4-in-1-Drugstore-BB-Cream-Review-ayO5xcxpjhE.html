about baby creams and I've got four of
them here to tell you about BB stands
for beauty balm or blemish Punk in my
experiences with these it's a very
similar to a tinted moisturizer I'm
going to take you through how all of
these work for me talking about a couple
of big factors that I always think about
when I'm testing makeup and that is
coverage and just like what does it look
like on the skin and also staying powned
overall how does it live up to the
claims that these products give as we go
through these you're going to see the
claims are huge so can they live up to
what the brands say they can do also
you're going to see pictures of these on
my skin just the BB creams you can
compare them kind of before-and-after
style you can compare them all side by
side and see what you think covers best
and just what looks best couple things I
want to get out of the way before we get
started are I am aware that there are
Asian BB creams that many of you have
told me are way better than any of these
and so I haven't tried that yet I plan
to and that's probably going to be like
a sequel to this video coming out in
near future so I really want to kind of
dive into that and see just what the
differences are also um I want you to
keep in mind what is your own skin type
and what kind of coverage and needs does
your skin have my skin is combo its
oilier here in the t-zone and a little
bit more like normal or sometimes even
dry on other parts of my skin so if you
have really oily skin or really dry skin
you kinda have to think about the things
I'm saying and consider well you know
maybe I would need more moisture than
she does or maybe I need less brands I'm
going to be talking about are the
covergirl BB cream the Maybelline dream
fresh BB cream the Garnier skin renew BB
cream and the L'Oreal magic skin
beautifier BB cream is a miracle skin
Perfector Maybelline's is a eight and
one skin Perfector l'oréal's is magic
skin beautifier these claims are huge
I take them serious we're talking
miracles and magic and stuff on our
bottles of mega I mean is there really
much more they could say like this has
got to be God's gift to the makeup
counter like one is trying to top the
next with the most outlandish claim they
can come up with for this stuff and I
think that they should be held
accountable for that as a whole I'm not
thrilled with the concept of BB creams
as they exist in these brands in these
products because I feel like they've
taken tinted moisturizers and put a new
name on them it with in the case of
covergirl that's literally what happened
they used to have a product called CG
smoothers that looks like this and it's
a tinted moisturizer that I've actually
recommended to a lot of people now they
have CG smoothers BB cream it's in the
very same packaging in the same spot
where you know these used to be sold and
it just says new look and they are now
calling it an instant skin enhancer you
know it's it's like repackaged
repurposed you know tinted moisturizers
so none of these are going to give
amazing coverage none of these made my
skin perfect none I did not feel like I
was experiencing magic miracles with any
of this stuff but they can serve a
purpose in one's makeup routine and so
that's what I'm going to try to describe
on the covergirl CG smoothers BB cream
it has an SPF 15 again this is a tinted
moisturizer this is essentially the
exact same product as this old why am
light to medium I think they had about
three different shade options for this
and I often have recommended this in
terms of being a good drugstore tinted
moisturizer now they're calling it BB
cream whathave light light coverage as
all of these are but I mean you can put
it all over your skin and you can get a
little bit more evenness I mean I felt
like it brightened up my skin a little
bit it evened out even from the under
eye area elsewhere you know it took
those minor issues and made them it just
kind of made them a little less obvious
wears pretty well throughout the day I
mean I'm a top it with some powder but
still are the Maybelline
this is the dream fresh BB cream 8 and 1
beauty balm skin Perfector this one has
the highest SPF of 30 and it says it's
going to blur imperfections enhance
brighten adjust to skin tone smooth
hydrate have the SPF 30 and 0% oils and
other heavy ingredients one good thing
about these is I felt like there were
more shade options when you're picking
out one of these and my Walgreens
actually had little testers iam is what
I have in this and this I felt like was
the best skin color match my skin looked
a little bit more alive with this one
coverage wise it was pretty much the
same as the covergirl I thought but the
thing about this one was staying power
even though it felt somewhat light and
it felt texture wise a lot like this got
pretty greasy on this not just in my
t-zone area where I would expect but
also just elsewhere on my face it was
unexpected because it felt so light but
it still made me oily been on to the
Garnier this one definitely feels the
thickest out of them all this is the one
I've had for the longest this is an SPF
15 I have it in light to medium and this
set is called the miracle skin Perfector
coverage doesn't necessarily mimic the
thickness of this product in other words
like as you see it on my face um you
know you're still seeing the
imperfections a hair more coverage but
not much not it's nothing that really of
note but it feels much thicker going on
and it does you know especially on days
where I've got to be outside you know it
can make me a little bit greasy so if
you've got real oily skin this is one
that I wouldn't necessarily recommend
because it just does have a heavier feel
it's a thicker cream winter months this
could be maybe a little bit better for
me because my skin needs a little extra
next we have the L'Oreal magic skin
beautifier BB cream I have this in
medium it says for beautifying actions
in one primes perfects hydrates and
corrects this does not have an SPF in it
and that's something to keep in mind
also I didn't feel like this was very
hydrating
so there were a couple reasons why I
would put a moisturizer on underneath
this number one a moisturizer with SPF
so you do get some SPF and number two
because I felt like this was the most
foundation like of them all and there
were some areas like I get kind of dry
sometimes right and here around my
eyebrows or around my mouth sometimes
and I felt the need for a little extra
moisture what's interesting about this
is this actually comes out of the tube
white and if you're familiar with a
product called smart shade from al May
they put out something like this years
ago and basically it's got beads in here
it's got tiny particles that are holding
the pigment so when you start to blend
this into the skin see how it's still
liquidy but now it's turning skin tone
so you're going to get for whatever
shade you get it's not magic that it's
matching your skin it's got a set you
know kind of color of pigment in there
and once you start blending it out
that's going to blend into your skin
this is the most foundation like of all
of these it's still light coverage don't
get me wrong but I felt like it covered
probably a little bit more than the rest
and it evened out a little bit and it
didn't get me as oily at the end of the
day as severally others I am wearing
this one today I have also since topped
that with concealers powders bronzers it
set off the board talking staying power
and the ones that worked best for my
combo skin were probably the covergirl
in the L'Oreal you didn't feel heavy
when I put them on and they didn't look
like an oil slick by the end of the day
the Maybelline and the Garnier this one
felt lighter this one felt heavier in
the process of putting them on but by
the end of the day both of these made me
a little more oily than the other two in
terms of the way these looked on the
skin they're all light coverage can
light coverage make your skin look
perfect as many of these claimed not for
me and I don't feel like I have a ton of
skin issues but I've got a few you know
light coverage is what you're looking
for that's what you're going to get with
these if it's not what you want you're
probably going to be happier just
putting on your moisturizer maybe a
primer if you're into that and then
putting on a regular old foundation that
can give you that medium to full
coverage you're after because these are
light
the covergirl the Maybelline and the
Garnier we're all pretty similar you
might be more satisfied with the
appearance on your skin with Maybelline
and just because you have more shade
options but they in terms of coverage
they all kind of did the same thing and
those all served as a moisturizer and
you know the color on my skin the one
that gave me just a hair more
I thought evening out and just the more
of the look of a foundation was the
L'Oreal but I did need a little extra
moisturizer with that but how can you
use these and how can these to be good
in your roots if you find one that works
well for your skin type and ends up
having decent staying power for you
throughout the day it can be a nice
light alternative to a thicker
foundation for example today like I said
I'm wearing the L'Oreal magic BB cream
and I put this on I also put on some
concealer I used the Neutrogena healthy
skin brightening eye Perfector I threw
on some laura geller balance and
brighten for a little bit of powder and
a little more coverage all over did my
blush and bronzer and what not actually
feel good with the look but the thing is
this product didn't stay make skin
beautiful after you also apply concealer
and powder and all these other things
you know they just gotta act like this
is the thing this is the miracle product
and in a if you're just starting out
with makeup or if you've got a daughter
who's maybe just thinking about getting
into something and just learning kind of
how the process goes you know maybe
start her off with some covergirl
smoothers and let her see you know what
that's like to put kind of a liquid
product on and blend it in and see a
little bit of a difference in your skin
you know that might be something to try
I hope this answer some questions for
you I know how misleading those claims
can be on the products and it's not just
BB creams that make crazy claims I mean
there are mascaras and you know every
product in makeup has something that
makes you think can it really be that
good and a lot of these things sound too
good to be true and I'm excited to test
out some other BB creams the Asian
brands that many of you have recommended
to me and
we may try this again in the near future
so thank you for watching everyone have
a great day and I'll see you next time
