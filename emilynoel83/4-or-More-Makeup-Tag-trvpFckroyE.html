day this is going to be the four or more
tag and in some cases you're gonna see
there's a whole lot more than four
happening in this video so you just go
through your collection and you round up
those items that you have four or more
of and let me tell you I went through
and I wrote down all of the things that
I have four or more of and there's a lot
and if I were to go through this entire
list I think we would all be asleep by
the end of this video so I'm choosing to
talk about things that I have the most
of out of all of these categories and
they are things that I have bought
myself because I think that's the whole
point of this video
if you've gotten you know PR samples
from a company let's say they've sent
the entire line of a certain kind of
lipgloss I don't think that stuff should
be factored into this at all because
this is all about the things that you
were motivated to go back to the store
and buy more and more of repeatedly so
that's what I'm sticking to with this
video also you're not gonna see a lot of
face stuff like foundations concealers I
mean that's just not stuff that I have a
lot of multiples within one specific
line thank you so much to Bailey from
making up the Midwest she tagged me to
do this video and she has a fabulous
channel herself I really have a lot of
appreciation for someone who can take
all their beauty thoughts which I'm sure
there are so many things you can say
about this or that product and boil them
down to a really quick concise video
that's still super informative you know
cutting through all the BS so to speak
and giving you just the facts you need
so I think she does a great job of that
she's beautiful she's super nice I mean
as if I know her personally I don't but
she seems like she'd be really nice
so check out Bailey thanks again for the
tag let's start off with the elf spiel
blushes I have five of these I look
through my blush collection and I was
surprised at how many different kinds of
blushes I have but not necessarily tons
and tons from one line couple of my most
favorites are pink passion which happens
to be the shade that I'm wearing today
you look at it in the packaging is this
matte
pink and you think no way Jose but I
mean it looks really good
sheer doubt it sheers out beautifully
and it's matte did I say that lushing
Rose is another favorite great intensity
with this shade beautiful pigmentation
and a teeny bit of gold Sparky single
shadows that I have the most of are the
Sally girl singles from Sally Beauty
Supply and I have 16 of these bad boys
they're very collectible I will say that
because they're like 99 cents apiece and
they link together they're ten times
better than those Revlon shadow links
that are out in the drugstore you of my
favorite standout shades would be beige
which is a really nice matte cream color
great for blending and highlighting
cinnamon is a really pretty rose gold
spresso is a beautiful taupe and
cranberry for all of you who like those
kind of berry ma Biche tones on the eye
that's down from that I do have 15 Mac
eyeshadows and they are all held in this
nifty Z palette here so over the years
I've definitely built my collection I
will say it's plateaued recently I mean
I haven't done and purchased any single
Mac shadows in quite a while but there
are just so many good singles of this
kind that you might put in a Z palette
like makeup geek Coastal Scents etc that
I guess I just haven't been too
motivated to buy a lot of these but a
few that I really do like are nylon it's
a great buttery shimmery highlight
twinks has always been a nice shade for
a one shadow look beauty marked is
another great shade makes a lovely liner
and it's got a pretty spark and I
thought I'd give a mention to the
shadows that I have nine of and those
are the L'Oreal infallible shadows these
are really really great I enjoy pretty
much all of the ones that I have they're
kind of like a pressed down pick by
shimmery shades in this line but very
very nice pigmentation and three of my
favorites and all of these are great for
one shadow looks I think they just are
stunning on their own nothing else added
I love amber rush that's for the rose
gold lovers the people who love taupe
you must check out bronze to taupe that
is a gorgeous shade and a fun pop of
color for spring I don't think I've
gotten so many compliments on it
look as when I just used this shadow
called burst into bloom it is gorgeous
great for that radiant orchid trend as
far as pallets go the thing that
dominates my collection by far are the
wet and wild color icon palettes just
counting the things that I believe are
not limited edition I have twelve and
then beyond that like there are so many
more limited edition things that I have
some of those have been sent to me so I
didn't want to include them but even so
twelve of them that really is the leader
of the pack for my collection I almost
feel bad saying I like certain ones over
others but I'll tell you the ones I use
the most are probably the comfort zone
and petal pusher palettes from the eight
pan I love those I'm wearing comfort
zone today a very typical comfort zone
look for me also love walking on
eggshells some great basics there for a
super natural look and silent treatment
is an awesome smoky eye so the ones that
you see swatched here are the comfort
zone on top and the silent treatment
trio below is in case you're not
familiar with these color icon shadows
they really are some of the best of the
drugstore also have 12 of the maybelline
eye studio quads these are a really
really great buttery smooth texture a
lot of shimmery shades in this line but
still some really really pretty and in
some cases unique color combinations so
I've been very happy with the ones I
have I'm not totally sure what all I
have that is limited edition compared to
just regular line but a couple that I
love that I know are always available
are Coral Oasis talk about a great shade
as you head into spring and summer so
love taupe temptress this works in taupe
alongside a really pretty deep burgundy
and I think that just makes for a great
eye look
eyeliners Mally like dominates my
collection and part of this is because
I've gotten some really good deals on
QVC when her starlight liners are sold
and sets and stuff so I've got a great
color selection of these I really really
like them they're so smooth extremely
long wearing quite a few of the
retractable versions as well but not as
many as these pencils and a couple that
I like best are Lucky Penny which is
really pretty as a
hop on your lower lashline and I also
love sailor because it's a navy blue
with just the slightest bit of Sheen so
it really does show up blue on your eyes
as opposed to almost looking like black
is that too many also I have eight of
the Physicians Formula liners these are
kind of easy to stock up on because they
are sold in trios which is kind of cool
so you get several shades at one time
usually there's a black something more
neutral like a brown and then for
example the trio for brown eyes comes
with a purple in there and that is
probably my favorite little groupies are
retractable so I love that they go on
really smoothly a cream shadows again I
feel like I'm living what I talk about
like in my Emily awards videos when I
talk about loving something so much like
these malli every color shadow sticks
they really have a presence in my
collection I have 13 of these and those
are just the ones I've bought because I
have been sent even a few wore a top of
that so I love these things these shadow
sticks are my ideal cream shadow format
they're in a pencil that you don't have
to sharpen they go on you have a little
time to like smudge them out use them as
a base use them on their own they will
still last all day and I was thinking
because I've gotten a lot of questions
about malli lately since she is turning
up in every Ulta store which is super
exciting so I thought you know if I
could tell people what is one shadow
stick that you would absolutely love if
you picked up it would be dust
taupe mixed with a little bit of mauve
it's so shimmery use that as a base for
my eye look today it's also my smudgy
liner on my lower lash line so I wanted
to mention I have 11 of the Maybelline
Color tattoos these are another cream
shadow that come in little pot there's a
pretty good color range with these and
then they'll come out with
limited-edition collections every so
often a couple of my ultimate favorites
especially with the pinky shadow trend
like if you want to layer some sort of a
base under your Naked 3 palette or
anything that's kind of pinky mauve
cranberry a couple of bases you would
love would be the one in inked in pink
which is from the metal collection this
looks beautiful
under anything naked3 and also the one
called Palmer
at Punk which is a little bit deeper
this can be really pretty smudgy
eyeliner if you want it to be talked
about the buxom lip plumpers I have 17
of these and a lot of the reason for
this I always feel like justifies
Holiday collections of these where the
minis are sold and like sets of four or
five you know I can snip those out no
problem so I'm always after that I love
this formula because Varrick gloss that
actually doesn't annoy my lips but it
hangs around a decently long time
actually some of my favorites are the
creams and those are the ones that are
in like the frosted sort of matte
looking - they do have a lot of great
shine but it's just like more opaque
color not too far behind are my NYX mega
shine glosses I have 13 of these this is
a very very collectible type of gloss
because NYX has so many colors in these
more often than not I get exactly the
shade I would expect to see on the
outside of the tube that's the shade I
get on my lips and three of my
must-haves would be beige pearl because
I think this is a great layering shade
it's also nice just kind of highlighting
the center of your lower lip makes your
lips look fuller I also love Cosmo this
is such an interesting shade like a
deeper neutral but with a lot of
multi-dimensional shimmer if you fell in
love with jordanna's lovely gloss but
now you can't find it anymore
check out Cosmo you'll find it's very
similar and also beige which is not
beige at all it's a beautiful classic
creamy pink moving on to lipsticks
specifically Revlon lip butters I have
19 so far that is the thing that I've
mentioned that I have the most of but
wait they're still going to be more at
the end I still have one thing that I
have more of than this and Revlon lip
butters my goodness some of the lighter
shades are kind of sheer I won't say I
am in love with every single one of them
but I really like the brighter and
deeper colors because I think they give
great color payoff super comfortable on
the lips and a lot of great shine and I
thought it would just highlight three
that I think are great for the spring
and summer you see
the Pyatt great for those of you who
want to try coral but you're scared it's
not to oranjee also I love wild
watermelon I am wearing that shade today
because I thought my swatch did not do
it justice at all it's a really pretty
like reddish pink so bright a really
summery take on red and then sorbet is
beautiful as well it's a great classic
kind of hot pink shade I have seventeen
MAC lipstick it's got a lot of like
classic popular shades from the line I
really really like the cream Sheen
formula I know I've mentioned that
before a lot of colors that are pretty
subtle and wearable are in that line
what can I say Mac's got some great
lipsticks a few that I loved I'm not
sure if this is available all the time
but I got it around the holidays it's a
shape called dark deed and it is a
really pretty like deep deep berry color
also love Viva Glam five classic and
creme Cup is a gorgeous like pinky nude
I reach for that one a lot and also
craving which is a pretty like wearable
berry shade finally a drumroll please
the thing in my collection that I have
the most of any guesses anybody want to
guess before I throw it out there it is
Maybelline Baby Lips you guys I have 21
of these I know it's a lot and it takes
me back to my lip smacker obsession of
like junior high in high school I had so
many says like that obsession carried on
into adulthood
I mean it's crazy I am after every
collection whether it be the doctor
rescue or the electro collection or the
limited edition stuff and then there's
just the regular line I mean I'm all
about these I won't say I have every
single one but it's got to be close
I love the formula I love a good tented
lip balm low maintenance lip product you
can toss in your purse couple of
long-standing ones that I've loved
forever it seems like
our peach kissed a nice light like
peachy nude sheen that gives your lips
also love cherry me if you are into the
reddish Pink's think about the shade I
have on now but maybe a little more
sheer that's what cherry me is
soft not so much for the doctor rescue
aspect of this but for the color this
gives my lips such a pretty pink color I
just fell in love with that shade and if
you love the smell of fruity pebbles
check out quench'd this is just a clear
lip balm but I tell you it's like a
table of people at Maybelline sat down
and said we need to create something
that smells just like fruity pebbles
because this is it dead-on check it out
if you love that smell so that's it
folks we made it to the end of the list
thank you for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
