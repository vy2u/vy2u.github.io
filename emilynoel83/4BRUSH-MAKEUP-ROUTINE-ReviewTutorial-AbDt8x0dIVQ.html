this video I am so pumped to give you a
full face tutorial using only four
brushes the four brushes that I have in
this little roll right here and I got
this set from Coastal Scents it was sent
to me as you know something new that
they've got on their website now and
it's called actually before everything
brush set it comes in a little box like
this says for everything so I think oh
my gosh is this really gonna be able to
pull off the full face because I've
tried a lot of travel brush sets if
you're familiar with my beauty broadcast
Xpress channel which is purely reviews I
have tried a lot of smallish brush set
and I've been dissatisfied with so many
of them because they can't really do all
the steps and they're just not quite as
versatile as you would need them to be
so with this one I thought okay let's
see and I've been playing with this and
I actually can say these are four
brushes that can do the job but I'm
gonna prove it to you in this video and
who is this for I would say this is for
my more minimal crowd out there who
doesn't really care to have a huge stash
of makeup brushes and maybe you've heard
me rave about up and up brushes or Real
Techniques or elf but you don't really
feel like going on a wild goose chase to
turn up all of those different brushes
to create like your perfect drugstore
set or maybe you don't want to spend a
lot on a high-end set 1195 I believe is
what this brush set is selling for at
the moment I think it may range anywhere
from like 16 to 11 dollars depending on
what the deal is so while I often will
take a lot of different steps to do
makeup and use zillion in one different
products for a look I think those of you
who are hanging with me in my channel
and you have a much more simplified
mentality toward things but you still
watch me I'm this is for you guys who
want the simplified look so it does come
with the brush roll that has the four
slots for these brushes magnetic closure
which I enjoy as you can see incredibly
compact you don't have to worry about
your brushes you know getting messed up
and then the brushes do have this kind
of I don't know dark brown wood look to
the handle kind of lightweight not that
that really bothers me but I just want
you to know what to expect it feels like
there's more weight toward this side of
the brush than the handle the ferals
seem to be nicely constructed I've been
using Coastal Scents brushes
on and off like from the very start of
my channel so I've been pretty pleased
over the years with the construction you
know the lack of shedding especially
these synthetic bristle brushes I don't
think you're gonna find that to be a
problem and very very soft just as soft
as you could expect any makeup brush to
be you are getting a powder brush so
that could be powder that could be all
over bronzer you're getting an angled
brush which is going to be good for your
blush your contour even highlight I've
got a trick to using that for highlight
this flat foundation brush some of you
may really like to apply foundation with
a flat brush me not so much but I do get
use out of this for padding and
concealer and it could also be good for
a very targeted bold pinpointed
highlight there's one I brush in here
and I got to say they made a very good
choice by including this kind of brush
and as you'll see in the demo it's not
too flat it's not too fluffy it's just
the right fusion of both to be able to
blend out an eye look I did not even
pull in you know a blending brush or
anything this did the entire thing with
this tutorial I really seek to show you
everything that I feel these brushes can
do you might even have some other ideas
beyond what I've shown but I want to
show you everything you may not feel the
need to integrate every single step into
your daily makeup look but I just want
to put the ideas out there so you are
aware of what they can do so for
starters I'm just gonna put on a little
BB cream this is the Physicians Formula
install ready super BB and I'm using
this because this also contains a good
SPF it has SPF 30 so I have it in the
shade light/medium i was playing around
with this yesterday and I was actually
really pleased with the staying power
and the coverage isn't too bad either as
far as BB Creams goes so I'm just going
to put this on with my hands hands
worked fine especially with something
that feels so much just like a standard
moisturizer then we got some things some
things need cover in here I'm going to
use my it cosmetics bye bye under eye
corrector in the shade medium this time
of year I'll still use your race paste
on and off but I do find that this
little bit deeper peachy shade does an
even better job as my skin you know just
gets a little more Sun this
here so I'm going to just lightly dab
some of this product on the under eye
area and then we'll blend it in here in
a second and since this is really the
only concealer I'm using today I've got
a little problem around the nose I can
just dab some of that on there no
problem then from my set I'm going to
use the foundation brush and this is
where I think this kind of brush comes
in really handy when you just want to
Pat in some concealer because it can
kind of blend it out but not over blend
it and I'm just applying you know very
light pressure I'm not really sweeping
back and forth across the area I'm just
kind of patting it in
and I feel like it's maybe even a little
bit small compared to some foundation
style like flat brushes that I have so
that also seems to help it like I have
no problem getting around my eyes with
this brush getting around you know the
sides of the nose to blend that out then
this product kind of came back on my
radar after I saw Lola Maurice Evan
mentioned this in her monthly favourites
video and it's the wet-and-wild
contouring palette and this is in the
shade caramel toffee and it's really
perfect I think I've talked about this
before as being like one of the most
simplified highlighting and contouring
ballots because it's a really nice you
know kind of cool tone contour shade and
then this light color um she was talking
about using that like up under the eye
area and I did that the other day and I
just loved kind of the coverage that it
had and also the brightness so I'm just
gonna take this brush again dab into
this product and kind of lightly just go
up on top of my concealer that I did now
that concealer from it cosmetics is not
incredibly goopy you know but it can
stand to have a little bit of setting
powder at least on my skin type which
can be a little bit more combo this time
of year if you feel like you're one who
just can't handle powder in this area
then you are welcome to skip the step
and then elsewhere on the face for a
little more coverage and mattified look
I'm bringing in my powder brush from the
set and I am using my Bobbi Brown Skin
weightless powder foundation this is in
the shade beige 3 so I'm just kind of
buffing this in in the areas of my face
that don't already have concealer and if
it does have concealer I just dab over
it so I don't mess that up too much
definitely a mattifying type powder I
would say it's like a medium coverage
when it comes to powder foundations
though I can still see certain little
freckles and stuff you know through the
skin as I look up really closely you
know it's not just like you know it
didn't just take my entire skin tone and
make it 100% super even but it did even
it out a considerable amount I think
next we're going to be using this brush
a lot this is the angled brush in the
collection and I'm
glad that's in here because it can do
blush it can do contour it can do
highlight like so many things really
well and honestly if I were just
touching up my makeup this is probably
the size I would use just to put on some
powder so I'm going to go back to that
wet-and-wild palette and I'll just go
into this contour shade here
this is a totally unmad product by the
way in case anybody was wondering both
the highlighter type powder and the
contour are matte shades and I will get
some of this around my forehead as well
and take it on down the neck too
then we're gonna do a little blush I'm
using one of my becca luminous blushes
and this is probably one of my favorite
ones from the group I would sent the
whole line and I've had fun
experimenting but I'm really liking
Snapdragon here I just think I don't
know maybe it's just this time of year I
love that kind of pink and coral mix
it's kind of bright dip into that with
the brush it only takes a little bit of
shapes like this and I'll just blend
that right here kind of on the outer
part of the apple of my cheek and sweep
upward it's amazing that just the tiny
amount of product you need with these
blushes and then for the highlight I'm
going to throwback to some classic mary
lou manizer from the balm and i will
just be using the same brush but kind of
the advantage to having the angled brush
you do have some surface area to work
with here and you can confine product to
just one part if you want to so I'm
gonna mainly just get product right in
here right on that pointed side and
it'll keep me from you know having a
fully like overloaded brush and it'll
only apply product maybe you can see
there that products only in a small part
of the brush so then when I apply it to
the cheeks
I'm only you know confining it to that
one part of the cheek where I want it
same thing on the other side a little
bit of product on the tip great way to
use this brush as a highlighting brush
and then of course you can easily
highlight Cupid's bow area anywhere else
you like to highlight on your skin be my
guest
one other way though that I think works
really nicely to highlight is you can
pinpoint an area if you're going for a
very strong highlight because this will
apply more concentrated color than this
angled brush will but if you want to go
that way you could do a cream a liquid a
powder highlight with your flat brush
and just go right on top of your cheek
and that would work fun too and this is
typically the stage of the game where I
will bust out a little bit of setting
spray this is my heart
candy Shiren be hydrating primer mist
I've learned to keep my mouth shut
during that phase I mean it's fine it's
like a setting type mist after your
makeup - I really find that it does make
a difference with the overall dewy look
and just taking away a powdery look we
used a lot of powder kind of all over
the face today with that bobbi brown
stuff so I do like the way this Sun kind
of finishes off the face so we'll pull
you in a little bit for the eyes and I'm
just gonna do my quick and easy dope
taupe pencil here from colour-pop with
as few places in my brows that I
actually need to fill in this kind of
color just fills those gaps perfectly
without looking too intense so I think
my brows have been in good shape while
I've been using this thing
and I'm just putting a little gel over
them to help them stay in place this is
just a wet and wild clear brow gel all
over the lids gonna use a little Milani
eyeshadow primer here that's what I
always do I love this stuff I love how
little it really takes just kind of rub
it between two fingers dab onto the lids
up through the crease a little more on
one side than the other
this does a little bit of neutralizing
discoloration on the lids I've had a
couple questions about that it's not
maybe quite as full coverage as some
things that you might put on the eyes
but it feels a lot like an Urban Decay
primer potion type of consistency I also
forgot to put my lip oil on when I'm
shooting this tutorial it just takes me
out of my routine you know this is the
Milani lip oil the lemon honey one it's
such a nice way to prep the lips before
product it's become kind of like my
favorite thing to have on there first on
the eyes we're doing a one shadow look
today and I'm gonna be using a shade
that I haven't tried yet actually is a
one shadow look I suspect I'm really
gonna like it but I mentioned this in my
Bobbi Brown haul this is the shade
cognac that I got and it's one of the
metallic eyeshadows although it's not
like overly metallic and shimmery but it
does have some sheen to it and it's a
little bit on the dark end of what I
might use is a one shadow look but
that's good because that'll really
challenge this one brush that we're
going to use as far as blending goes as
you know if you've seen my Bobbi Brown
video I've loved burnt sugar for a white
shadow look so I'm interested to see if
this one will be good to brush that
we're using here the reason why I think
this works so nicely for a-1 shadow look
is because it's a good fusion of flat
and fluffy it's flat enough to be able
to pack something on the lid but it's
got enough like give to the bristles and
enough fullness and fluffiness to be
able to do a little blending not maybe
to the extent that you're accustomed to
with like a full sort of domed blending
brush but I still think it's going to be
able to do the job and it can wedge
itself in the crease and it can even get
below the eye so here's how we do it
with a one shadow look
and a one brush look I'm pretty excited
so I'm going to pick up some of this
shadow and I go a little at a time
especially if it's a shadow that's new
to me I haven't used a lot I'm not quite
sure how it's gonna play on my eyes just
build up little by little and pat all
over the lid this is where you want that
shade that's got the little bit of
shimmer to kind of catch the light and
this is what allows it to really look
like two even three separate shades on
the eyes it's because when you've got it
on the lid it's actually showing some
shine next I'm gonna pick up some
product a little bit more focused right
on the tip of the brush the bristles are
tapered all the way kind of down the
sides so when you lay it in flat like I
was doing to go all over the lid I was
picking up product on the side and I was
able to Pat it you know all over the lid
and keep it kind of controlled now we're
going more for the tip because we're
wanting to wedge it into the crease and
I'm just kind of dabbing it in there I'm
not really raking it back and forth
we're not totally in a blending mode yet
just wedging shadow right into the
crease from the inner part of the crease
to the outer part here and if you want
to shape that shadow a little bit more
give yourself more of an outer veers the
time when you would do that but I like
to just kind of bring it up just above
where my actual crease line is now that
I'm at the point where it feels like a
lot of the shadows kind of wearing off
the brush I'm going to make sure the
brush is as bare as possible and brush
it off on my hand and then we blend
we're gonna just blend over the edge and
allow that shade to just be nicely
sheared out and I think this is a
beautiful one shadow look you know we're
getting multiple effects from what's
happening on the lid with just a little
bit of shine there's not a ton of
shimmer in the shade eped in the crease
and then a sheer more sheer look to the
shade up above the eye now I haven't
done the crease step yet on this eye so
I will again tap the brush straight into
the product just wedge it right in here
dab dab
dabbing all along the crease just to
apply the product and then as you're
really working that product off of your
brush you start to bring your brush
upward a little bit so the color is just
starting to appear above your natural
crease and when you kind of feel like
you've gotten all the product off of the
brush that you can ensure that you have
by brushing it off on the back of your
hand and then just use this kind of as a
blender back and forth over the edges
sharing out the edge of the look even
more no harsh lines now the area under
the eye I think I want a little smudge
there too so I'm going to work with just
the tip of the brush I'm going to just
softly go under the eye
you could take whatever highlight you're
using I could use the mary-lou manizer
or this matte one and just kind of take
that up under the brow and that can aid
in blending too
then a gel liner pencil that I'm so
excited about this was sent to me by
colour-pop I believe the shade name is
honey dude it's so metallic I can hardly
focus it on it but it's a nice
retractable nude pencil that transfers
so nicely onto the lower inner rim and I
think this might have been part of their
summer collection the way that transfers
on to the waterline it's just effortless
and unless I'm going dark and smoky or
even colorful on the waterline I am all
about like zapping the redness the
pinkness the tiredness out of that area
by putting a nude liner there then I'm
going to do the upper lash line I've
been trying out this hardest it's a
double ended eyeliner NYX put out
something very similar to this that I
had reviewed in the past but you've got
your retractable black pencil on one end
and then your felt tip liquid liner on
the other so I'm going to take this
liquid and go across the upper lash line
next I am curling my upper lashes and
I've been trying to work through this
Almay one coat multi benefit mascara
and then I am gonna pop on some of my
favorite lashes of the moment these are
so you can see them better the style
there the salon perfect go glam multi
pack and they are the 6:15 style your
noodle lashes I will link to my false
lashes 101 video below but I'm going to
just put these on and join you back here
for lips
okay so lashes are on and I've done a
little lower lash mascara too with my
covergirl clump crusher water resistant
and for lips I'm just thinking I kind of
want to go along with what's happening
with the eyeshadow shade you know this
little bit of a rusty Brown so I'm going
for a brownish neutral on the lips this
is the read my lips lip gloss from the
balm and the shade is called agar and
yeah I do think this is going to be a
pretty pairing with this I you know it's
not too heavy but it really kind of
stays in the same color family here I
say it's kind of like one of those your
lips but better lip glosses mm-hmm your
lips but way shinier
alright so finished look for brushes
only I'm pretty dang happy with this
look because we didn't even pull in any
sponges or other makeup tools you know
it was this or fingers and I really did
rely on the brushes quite a bit and I do
want to share one other thing that the
big brush is really nice for if you want
to do like any sort of shimmery glowy
body bronzer or highlight like I think
betty lou manizer from the balm is
really good for this I've had a few bomb
project sin this video a brush this size
can be great for like a little touch-up
later in the day and maybe you're going
out and you've put on something that's
showing the decollete or the shoulders a
little bit more this is a really pretty
look and you get a nice even application
when you're using a larger brush like
this and you know I can't do this stuff
left-handed right and right shoulder
otherwise thinking of any other ways you
might use these brushes isn't on the go
touch up set the angled brush is
probably one of the most versatile in
the kit because I would probably if I
were going to touch up any powder I
would just grab for this one because the
size is so perfect for just dabbing it
over you know certain areas like the
t-zone
again great for blush contour all that
sometimes if I'm wanting to change up my
look a little bit day-to-night one thing
that I'll notice staying power wise
normally I don't have a lot of staying
power issues with eyeshadow but one
thing that can sometimes fade is when
it's a shimmery or even glittery shadow
you can see that kind of fade off as the
day goes on so if you wanted to you
could dip into something that was a
little more shiny and kind of just use
this brush to dab it right on the center
of the lid or something like that and
again this brush pinpointed highlighting
it's really great for that or if you
need to go over concealer nice little
touch-up tool there as well this is one
of the only like small brush sets that
really can pull it all off so I would
highly recommend it thank you guys so
much for watching my video and I will
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
