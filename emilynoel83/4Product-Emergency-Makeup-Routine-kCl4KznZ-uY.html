video is not a tutorial on the most
glamorous makeup look by any means it's
not maybe even something you'd want to
use every day but this is a go to
emergency makeup look now if you've got
a major emergency like your house is on
fire someone's been in a horrible
accident obviously I'm not meaning those
kinds of emergencies then you just want
to get out and do what you got to do but
if you're just kind of running late and
you need a really really quick look I
think this might be an option for you so
the first thing I do I take my flower
Beauty foundation stick this is one of
my favorite foundation sticks I have it
in the shade sf3 and I just draw this
all over my face I love using this as a
multitasking product because it can
almost work as a concealer for me as
well I can take my fingers and blend the
foundation into my skin and then if I've
got other areas where I need a little
extra coverage it's very very buildable
so I love that to just take care of any
concerns on my face you could pull in a
foundation brush for blending but if
you're really in a bind fingers work
fine then for some color I used my josie
maran argan stick this is the mini stick
and I have it in the shade petal pink
this is a really great product because
it can be your lip and cheek all-in-one
okay so you can dab this on your cheek
or you can get a little on your finger
and then blend it into your cheeks to
get a really nice natural-looking flush
I could see this shade working for so
many different skin tones and then you
can use that same stick and apply it
like a little much like the foundation
stick you can build it up to the desired
amount of color or coverage you want on
your living the number one thing a lot
of people wouldn't want to leave the
house without is some mascara so I'm
using a mascara that it's kind of a
multitasker for me it's the almay one
coat triple effect and I love this brush
because it's actually got longer
bristles on one side and shorter
bristles on the other so you can use it
both ways to kind of comb through and
separate the lashes or to really get
some product on there and thicken them
up as well just really works wonders for
my lashes if you've got time curl your
lashes first finally you can't forget
brows
and a product that I found has taken a
lot of steps and put them all into one
is from benefit and it's called gimme
brow you may have seen me demonstrate
this in my benefit one brand tutorial
but it's a teeny tiny brush and
basically this has a little fibers in it
that will thicken up your brows and help
even than that I don't find this to be
the most precise brow fill into if we're
in a hurry and we just want to do our
best to get them for the most part
evened out this will work and I don't
feel like I have to pull in an extra
brow gel an extra brush or anything like
that once I've got this on they're done
and they really hold their shape
throughout the day so that's it that's
the emergency baked up face only four
products was all it took to get a really
natural look that did still give us some
coverage a little bit of color where we
want it is that it is not incredibly
glamorous but I do think that it can
correct some problems for you and just
enhance a few key areas on your face now
I would advise if you're doing this look
and then you're heading out the door
make sure in your purse you've got some
kind of little touch-up thing whether
you like the oil blotting sheets the
Mallee face defender or a pressed powder
something to kind of take care of that
issue on your skin throughout the day in
case you tend to get shiny but I hope
this gave you some ideas on a quick look
you can throw together thank you so much
for watching and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
