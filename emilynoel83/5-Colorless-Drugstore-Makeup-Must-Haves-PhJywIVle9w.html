these favorites videos month to month
and shows the things that they're liking
right now but I know that every time I
do those videos I'm thinking about a lot
of the newer things or maybe some
rediscovered products that have just
kind of popped in recently but there are
some things in my collection that I use
all the time but I think they rarely get
a major shoutout from me but they're so
useful they're super cheap they are
colorless they would work for anyone of
any age you know I have mentioned these
here and there from time to time but I
just wanted to do a little roundup of
these things that you know kind of don't
get a lot of other thing I want to
mention is my favorite favorite clear
brow gel this is the best I've tried a
lot of them I've tried more expensive
ones the less expensive ones but the NYX
control freak eyebrow gel has got to be
the best one I have used there's a big
reason why also I used to use the
Maybelline Great Lash quite a bit I
found that when I would pull the brush
out of that little tube there would be
so much gel on the brush and I'd barely
be like tapping it on to my eyebrow and
then using a separate brush to kind of
rake it through this brush comes out of
the tube so cleaned off it's got just
the right amount of gel and the gel
holds so so strongly on your brows I'm
actually able to utilize that brush
without getting gel overload on my brows
and use it to help me get that final
finished shape that I'm after then I
don't have to touch them again for the
entire day so I've been loving this
stuff I think if you're into you know
the brow pomade Zoar powders or pencils
whatever you like to fill in your brows
with this can be a great finishing step
also a colorless makeup must-have for
the eyes that I always have a backup of
I think I might get anxiety if I ran out
its my Revlon precision lash that he
said love the wand applicator it gets
just the right amount of product on the
lash band faster round between this and
the dark tone but I really think there
are some advantages to the clear one
particularly if you are new to putting
on false lashes and sometimes you know
when you get it on the lash band you
start to place it
then maybe you get little dots of glue
on your lid or you just don't get it
placed quite right at first this is a
lot easier to kind of clean up those
messes with you know you go in with a
q-tip and you remove it with the black
sometimes that can leave its mark a
little bit more and be more difficult to
remove if you had a problem or maybe
you're like me you're pretty comfortable
with lashes you've been doing them a lot
but then you get comfortable you get
cocky and before you know it you got
lash glue and your eyebrows and this is
a lot easier to clean up that tacky
place that you kind of need your glue to
be at before you place it on your lash
line really quickly so I think it's just
super user friendly and I love the
system over the lips something I've been
loving and I've been so good about using
this religiously lately like a couple
times a week I will spend probably
between I think it's between 30 seconds
and a minute just running this thing
over my lips it's the elf studio lip
exfoliator I've worn mine down so much
it's kind of like sugar particles
suspended in a really moisturizing lip
balm so I just rub that over my lips
really take my time doing it by the time
you've finished you know 30 seconds to a
minute of that you might have some
residue from this on your lips it does
taste kind of sweet you could rub that
off if you want to it does leave quite a
bit of moisture on my lips as well if
you want to add even more you could put
on a separate lip balm I swear my lips
feel fuller after I use this it's like
they are allowed to bloom or something
you're removing that dead skin and just
revealing such a nice fresh surface for
your lip products to go on top it's made
my lips just feel and I think look so
much fresher and healthier another thing
that I am throwing on every time after I
finish my makeup but I really haven't
been talking about it much it's the next
dewy finish setting spray I have quite a
few different settings pretty sitting
over here actually this is the one that
I think is the lowest cost and the best
effect I do like a couple of spritzes I
like to do them kind of up in the air
not directly in my face and then it kind
of just falls down onto my face and it
takes away the powdery finish so in that
respect if you've got dry skin this is a
great thing to reapply later in the day
if you feel like things have developed
any sort of a cakey look on your
skin you can go back to this I think if
you want your skin coming off really
really dewy you could apply more
spritzes I know some people like to
really spray themselves down with it
some sort of setting spray but I just go
with a couple because I can tend to look
a little oily in my t-zone anyway by
midday so I just want you know that
little bit of setting action and and
freshness to the complexion and a couple
spritzes seems good for me another thing
that I love kind of an oldie but a
goodie totally and on the go type of
makeup thing I've got a whole video
devoted to a little before and after
that I did with this but it's the elf
daily moisture stick the only way I
don't like to use this is on the lips
anywhere else is pretty much fair game
cuticles dry patches of skin on your
body dry patches of skin on your face
but a really super useful way is if you
find that you start to look dry and you
start to see lines on your under eye
area like from your concealers or
foundations that are up in there just
give my finger one swirl on the surface
of this product that's all it takes and
then dab it right on your under eye area
and it doesn't mess with your makeup
assuming you're not rubbing back and
forth you just want to blot and it seems
to totally revive the under eye makes it
look less dry takes away the look of the
line the sake of this demo I just did it
right after I finished my makeup so I
didn't necessarily need it neat I do
have another video on this where it was
like an end of the day before after type
of thing when I started to use it I
think the difference is pretty
outstanding one last thing I know those
are my five like drugstore picks but if
I could mention one more thing for the
sake of the people who get kind of oily
as the day goes on I love mine ally
poreless face defender this works really
really well it is colorless so any skin
tone can use something like this you got
a little sponge I twist onto the product
and then I would blot over my skin and
it really does kind of mattify really
handy on-the-go thing because you barely
even have to worry about looking in a
mirror when you use this I have reviewed
and
paired the covergirl products that came
out that is similar to this but it's
definitely a different consistency so
I'll link to that video if you want more
on the differences but this is kind of
the thing that reigns supreme as far as
clear modifiers go in my book I hope
that video was useful on just some real
basic must-haves that I think could fit
into absolutely anyone's makeup routine
or makeup bag you so much for watching
I'll see you later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
