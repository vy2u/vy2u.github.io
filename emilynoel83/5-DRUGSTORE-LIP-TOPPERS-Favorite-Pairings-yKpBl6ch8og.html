about a topic makeup wise that's kind of
like already out there it's definitely
an existing thing lip glosses shiny
metallic kind of pearly finish lip
glosses that are these days being
referred to as lip toppers you're seeing
things being released by different
high-end brands or at least I am anyway
Franz likes you way you have the skinny
dip lip topper and Becca is putting out
some lip toppers so that's some things
from Smashbox also bite that had these
like really intense shimmery opaque
pigments in them and they're kind of
being marketed as a way to amp up all
these matte lip colors that we've all
gotten so I'm finding a lot of what I
have lip topper wise has come from
high-end brands and I started looking in
my own collection and I found some
things that definitely have some similar
qualities to those and what are the
qualities of the lip topper well it
seems that they are shiny they have a
shimmery if not downright metallic
finish and they're opaque they can kind
of hold their own on top of something
that might be deeper or just a totally
different texture and they give that
nice contrast and pop and I like to
apply these kind of on the center of the
lower lip it gives more of a look of
fullness to your lip and then I kind of
fan them out and sort of blend them out
into the lip color that I'm wearing so I
guess with this video I'm kind of saying
you don't necessarily have to buy
everything that's being sold today
market it as a lip topper from some big
name brand when you can also look at the
things that you might already own or
seek out a few things in your drugstore
that can actually perform the very same
function and they're called lip glosses
I'm not trying to like set forth any
rules here I'm just going to be sharing
in this video some of the ways I like to
use these and the ways that they're the
most effective pop on your lips okay so
let's say you want to top off your light
nude neutral lip colors with some sort
of lip topper gloss add a little shine
and interest to the lips I think a
really good one for that is from the Wet
n Wild mega slicks line this has taken
me way back down memory lane because
this is a line of lip gloss that I wore
back in the day like in high school this
one I found somewhat recently at Walmart
and it's called Sun glaze and it's a
really great pearly peach gloss and I
think on top of any of your mat neutral
lip color specifically on the lighter
end of the
this would look really nice and so for
an example here I want to show you the
L'Oreal infallible matte paint in Peach
Pit so I've got that on all over my lips
and then I take this and kind of dab it
in the center of the lower lip and I
like to either use a q-tip or my finger
to do this so I'm not dipping my wand
back into my gloss and kind of
compromising the color that's always
something that can happen when you're
layering gloss on top of something else
I know that's a pet peeve of my buddy
Davis and I totally get that too that
using a q-tip or your finger actually
works really well for this method
because you end up layering it up right
in the center of your lip and then you
can kind of use your finger to blend
that out and you've got that great look
of fullness and shine in the center of
the lower lips so that's one option for
you next up I want to talk about the elf
Perfector this one has been around for a
while I would not be surprised if they
like rebrand this as a lip topper
because that's exactly what it is this
product is put out in just this one
shade it actually does have some little
flecks of sparkle in it but it makes it
really really reflective and it can look
good on top of almost anything like this
one is very I think all-purpose color
wise some that sparkle in this is almost
silvery but yet I find that this color
looks really pretty on top of any type
of like warm toned lip color so
throughout this video I'm wearing it on
top of kind of a brownish lipstick it's
one of these new matte color riche
lipsticks from L'Oreal and it's the one
called he thinks he's macho if this
beautiful kind of deep caramel color
looks great on its own but you top that
pout Perfector right in the center of
your lower lip and it brings this
element of shine to it that I think is
so so beautiful except I've got the Wet
n Wild mega slicks gloss and bronze
berry this has a ton of shine but yet
it's a little bit deeper in tone it's
this beautiful just neutral metallic II
kind of gloss and I think this looks so
pretty on top of those kind of trendy
like topi grayish type lip colors this
is a really neat accent so one that I
tried this on with is the L'Oreal
infallible matte paint can you tell I
like this formula it's really good the
one in velvet pout is a very pretty
interesting shade it's got like a touch
of lilac some taupe in there and then
you pop this gloss on top and it is such
a beautiful accent I would say the
difference between this and the elf Pelt
Perfector this has
less actual sparkle to it it's more of a
metallic sheen next up I want to talk
Pink's I've got a great pink lip topper
in this color from Revlon it's whether
Ultra HD lip lacquers in the shade pink
diamond this has a gorgeous shine
Skellig a little bit of a golden twist
to it it's very multi-dimensional has a
really interesting look for a pink gloss
and so the matte color that I wanted to
use to display this topper is the
Maybelline matte lipstick in lust for
blush I've had this one for a while it's
a great Mavi pink so it looks beautiful
on its own then you'd add this pink
diamond right in the center of the lower
lip and it's so beautiful creates a
gorgeous amount of shine there just dab
it in with your finger really
concentrate it in the center of the lip
and blend outward and I think it's so
gorgeous
y'all have said that phrase over and
over in this video but that's really
what it's about it's just about making
these really pretty combos with products
that exist in the drugstore cost less
than 6 or 7 bucks you can get the same
kinds of effects that you might get with
higher cost lip toppers now another lip
topper option that I would describe as
like a rosy metallic shade is this
infallible paints metallic finish in the
color moon lust mentioned this in a
recent video it is so beautiful like I
can't get over how pretty this shade is
it kind of reminds me if you can follow
my videos from way back when do you
remember a gloss from Jordana called
lovely this is sort of that type of vibe
I think if not even more metallic than
that so it makes a great lip topper but
because of its rosy tone I think this is
a great lip topper option on top of
those deeper berry colors so I put on my
wet and wild perfect pout gel lip liner
great lip pencils by the way from Wet n
Wild here they glide on so easily and
this is the one called plum together and
I dabbed moonless right in the center of
the lower lip it brings so much shine
and contrast to a deeper color of course
you could use a really light shade on
top of a deeper color to create contrast
this just makes a lot of sense it's got
that little bit of rose in it anyway and
it just plays so nicely with those berry
shades so guys that's my roundup of
drugstore lip topper options again keep
in mind these are glosses you might have
some great options in your own stash
already and you never really thought of
them necessarily in this way
I think with different high-end brands
releasing products with the purpose of
being a lip top it kind of prompts you
to think are it prompted me to think
anyway what do I already have that might
do this same type of function but for a
lower cost and it's just called a lip
gloss not a lip topper I think these
definitely allow you to have some fun
with the matte lip colors that you have
in your collection not that you can't
layer up these types of metallic shades
on top of just about anything that you
get the most contrast with the finish if
you put them on top of mats so that's
definitely the way I wanted to show you
these in this video so thank you guys so
so much for watching I hope you're
having a great day and I will see you
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
