thought I would talk about a few things
relating to skin care and I know with
makeup we often can achieve that instant
gratification right we can put something
on we can get the satisfaction of seeing
a total transformation happening and
skin care generally speaking is not that
way it's about a slower process we're
doing a treatment on our skin many
things aren't designed to give you some
sort of like really quick turnaround and
I'm not saying they should however I
thought it would be fun to focus on a
few of those things that I think
actually do get a very quick result for
a variety of skin issues so want to talk
about five in this video that are really
the best for giving you that quick and
effective result not saying it couldn't
be even better if you continue using
these things over time but they really
can you know do something for you in a
hurry
and they're all drugstore priced items
which is fantastic so the first thing I
want to talk about caters to dry skin if
you've got dry patches this pertains to
face or body this is a great tub of
product that you want to keep under the
sink or you know wherever you need it
it's from CeraVe and it is the
moisturizing cream I have Kristin game
wholeheartedly to thank for this I think
it was a two-three years ago when she
introduced me to this when I was having
some dry skin issues and it is truly the
best like I treat it more as a spot
treatment for your dry areas although
you could put it over large areas of the
skin as well like I said face body it's
super gentle it says with Sarah Meads
and hyaluronic acid moisturizes restores
and maintains protective skin barrier
it's heavy duty moisturizer and it also
claims that it was never greasy will not
irritate sensitive skin I can totally
vouch for that I've dealt with eczema it
has the little accepted by the National
eczema Association seal there on the
back SuperDuper gentle but very deeply
hydrating so if you've got a dry patch
on your skin and you're thinking gosh
you know I'm about to do my makeup I
don't have time for some sort of
overnight mask right now you can use a
little bit of this and I think use it
under your make
and it can perform really well and it
can totally even out those areas that
are dry and patchy whether it be face or
body I've gotten my mom into using this
I've gotten my dad into using this my
mom's like 90 plus year old friend who
has fantastic skin also uses this and
she has been for quite some time that's
another person I want to feature here on
my channel but if you don't own this and
you have any kind of dry skin concern
you need it number two what I found over
the years to be the fastest solution for
a blemish is the clean and clear person
gel and I remember dealing with this
back when I was in my high school days
or college years it's the 10% benzoyl
peroxide acne medication maximum
strength I found this to be the fastest
solution for is it so I'm not saying
you're going to sit in front of your
mirror and like watch it just you know
disappear in fast-forward but it does
dry up the zit faster than most anything
let's say you wake up with one I would
wear this under my makeup and then I
would notice probably by the end of the
day a drastic decrease in the blemish or
it's a great thing to put on and use
overnight and you'll wake up and
actually see a change see a vast
improvement just in case you're
concerned being pregnant now I'm not
using any kind of acne medications of
any kind but this is still something
that exists in my medicine cabinet for
when I can use it and it has always been
a go-to for blemishes just a very very
effective spot treatment another thing
that's going to give you instant
gratification for the skin on your lips
is the elf lip exfoliator I've talked
about this more than a few times but for
good reason this is the best thing to
use to smooth out your lips this is
totally the season for waking up with
the dry cracked like doesn't look good
under any lip product type of lip
condition and so I think you definitely
want one of these to run over your lips
before you apply your lip product or you
can make it kind of a nighttime ritual
whatever you want to do it's very
convenient and it's not super messy and
the thing I love about these elf lip
exfoliator sticks is that they really
stay intact tarte has not too long ago
put out something similar and I tried it
just very recently and
I noticed the stick feels like it's
almost just falling apart as I use it
like I can hardly apply any pressure
with this type of stick I can apply some
pressure to my lips I can really feel
like I'm scrubbing with this gritty
stick that's been bonded together with a
balm like substance run it across your
lips you'll find out about how long you
need to do it maybe it's 15 seconds
bottom lip 15 seconds on the top lip the
cherry scent is really nice they have a
mint they also have just their classic
that has a brown sugary kind of
appearance to it I truly enjoy all of
them they may leave a little residue
behind on your lips that you can just
wipe away but it's not this sloppy like
there's stuff everywhere and I've got to
get my finger involved no it's
hands-free you're just using the stick
and your lips feel so nicely smoothed
out afterwards and if you do this like a
nighttime treatment you know after you
do this step put on your favorite lip
balm and your lips will feel so good one
of those Nivea lip balms will be awesome
or if you've got that Alma aged
essentials lip balm that's a really good
one you talk about an instantaneous
feeling of before and after when you use
a stick like this you will notice it for
sure product number four is a face mask
and a lot of masks that I like to use
are of a very hydrating nature so maybe
if my skin is feeling a little bit dry
at the end of the day you know you put
on the hydrating face mask and it feels
like okay it's soft its supple again and
that is a nice kind of before and after
but I still think I noticed the most
drastic probably feeling of improvement
and radiance in my skin after using a
face mask comes when I use this Freeman
diamond mineral rinse mask and it says
for all skin types boost brilliance and
radiance and it's kind of like one of
those masks slash exfoliation treatments
in one so you let it sit on your skin
for anything five to seven minutes and
then you're going to massage it as you
rinse it with water and you get just a
great exfoliation the granules are so so
fine so when you do kind of get that
scrubbing action going all over your
skin you don't feel like oh there's you
know a few beads up here on my forehead
and a couple here on my cheek like it's
everywhere and then it's all happening
over the course of like five to seven
minutes by
time you're done it's a look of your
skin improvement and a feel of your skin
improvement with this any time I'm
thinking about it I will pick up two or
three at the end of an aisle in Walmart
I've been told that these are sold in
like a full tube but I haven't found
those yet but these are a great stocking
stuffer as well if you've got some
people to give to a little face mattes
particularly one that works this well
would be a great thing to give to
someone the last thing that I think is a
skincare game-changer gives you a quick
result on your skin is a setting mist
and this really does walk the line
between I think skincare and makeup but
when I think of what it's doing for my
face what it's working with it's my skin
you know so after I've done my makeup
giving a few myths of a really good
setting spray can make all the
difference in just the look of your skin
instantly even if you don't feel like
you're one who's like dipping your face
into a bunch of you know loose powder
every day but the powders that you use
are maybe like a bronzer blush or
highlight those things still can you
know have a dryish look on the skin at
times so going over your skin with the
setting spray I think can make all the
difference in making everything look
really really finished and smooth and
just more hydrated all around I think
those of you who have spent any time
watching my videos in the last I don't
know six months probably know that I'm
going to talk about the hard candy sheer
envy primer mist I love that stuff last
time I was shopping I could not find a
backup so boo I will keep looking the
reason why I like that so much is
because sometimes I feel like certain
setting mists
like they are strictly kind of setting
your face makeup and that can be a good
function I think of the Urban Decay all
nighter spray for example that stuff
does work really well that all-nighter
the D Slig those seem to actually have a
function to improve the staying power of
your makeup however after I missed those
on I don't always feel like my skin
looks extra radiant because I've applied
it the thing about the hard candy is
that like with three mists a very
minimal amount of product used I feel
like there's just this radiance that
comes across like that and this time
when I haven't had that it sort of
forced me to go through my stash of
other setting mists and find things that
I feel like are kind of on that
wavelength and one that I've been a long
I'm fan of I've been kind of reminded of
here is the NYX dewy finish setting this
very similar to the hard candy with a
minimal amount of sprays use like one
two three you will feel like you notice
this instantaneous radiance back to your
skin because it's just giving a little
bit of moisture back I think some sprays
give back a little more moisture to the
skin than others another thing I kind of
like for that purpose is the glossy a
rose setting spray if you like a rosy
scent that's a good one too and I'm not
saying these different ones that I
recommend are going to have you like
leaving the house feeling like tacky
glossy dewey dewey is almost a really
exaggerated description of it it just
takes away the look of powder and gives
back the look of like glow from within
so those are my five quickest skincare
game-changers the things that will give
you that instant gratification type of
feeling when you use them on your skin
sometimes we need that there are many
effective skincare products out there
that aren't going to give you a quick
result but they still totally have their
place in the skincare world I thought
it'd be fun to focus on those things
that can truly give us a really fast
impact so thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch and I will see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
