may remember not too long ago on this
channel I did a video talking about five
worthwhile high-end makeup purchases
things that I think are worth any
positive buzz that's going around about
them just products that I've really
enjoyed and I felt were worth their high
end price tag and as I mentioned in that
video there are also some high-end items
that I haven't been quite so pleased
with please don't take offence if some
of these products ended up working for
you we all have different preferences we
all have different needs but my goal
here is just to hopefully describe these
products and my experiences with them
well enough to you to where you can make
your own decisions as to whether you
think the work for you or not the first
thing I want to talk about and this was
something mentioned in a whole it seems
like a couple months ago but this is the
kula makeup setting spray with green tea
and aloe it has SPF 30 in it which was
sort of the unique draw to this product
that made me want to try it out it says
it's made with certified organic
ingredients and I got this from Ulta now
this is a spray that you have to shake
first that was a little off-putting to
me at the onset because you know when
there's a napping baby possibly nearby
the last thing I want to do is shake a
loud bottle around but if that's not
your circumstance that probably doesn't
really matter to you at all another
thing that happened to right off the bat
with this product are all the little
cracks around the cap now this was not a
cheapo product by any means but almost
immediately that cap all the way around
started cracking now with these makeup
setting miss a lot of times people will
do you know and several quick passes you
know over their skin several pumps of
the product now the issue with this one
is that when I do a pump with it see
what happens here
the pump actually stays down it doesn't
pop right back up like it should and so
it sticks every time like that's not
just an occasional thing that's every
time so I have to pull it back up and go
back with it and it's just something it
shouldn't do on the SPF with this this
has never been like my sole SPF I'm just
not comfortable with this light mist
being the only SPF product on my face so
if I know I'm going to be outside or
maybe I'm going swimming I will still
have a really heavy duty you know
and type SPF on my face and then maybe
use this to kind of touch up a little
bit I think it may have prolonged my
ability to be out in the Sun before
reapplying more of like a lotion to my
face and it also does claim to be a
makeup setting spray but that's a
function of this that I really didn't
enjoy now keep in mind I am doing what
they say I'm shaking it up first but I
feel like this is a spray that I can
really feel on my skin and it really
changes the texture of the products on
my face and you might say well aren't
you applying makeup setting sprays or
facial mists to give you you know an
added do eNOS to the complexion and yes
I see I get you on that but normally
they are still weightless this actually
I feel like has a heavy feel to on my
skin when I apply it on top of makeup
talking two or three pumps of this stuff
Max and I feel like it just gives the
products on my skin like I can almost
feel like my cheeks moving around a
little bit more like I can feel my
makeup more after I put this on so
packaging wise I have some concerns with
this product and just the way it feels
on the skin I'm not a fan of it another
product and this is from a brand that I
have had so much success with but for
whatever reason this product is just not
working out and it's the Estee Lauder
Double Wear stay in place ice shadow
base I wanted to try this out because
I've run out of several different eye
primers in my rotation and I thought
okay I want to try this from Estee
Lauder because it's got the Double Wear
name and I have had so much good luck
with Double Wear you know just face
products and so it looks like this it's
like a skin tone you know beige colored
primer there's no shimmer in it it goes
on matte and it does have you know a
little bit of coverage to it so when you
apply this across your lids it can kind
of cover up discoloration bluish tone
veins but the problem I've had with this
and I've had it with multiple eyeshadows
whether they're cream powder some sort
of mousse like hybrid like color pop
shadows I have creasing with this I am
NOT one who really has a super oily eye
issue so it really surprised me and it
really kind of made all fingers point to
this
as being the problem because I used it
with matte shadows like shadows I just
have no problem with with other primers
but this seemed to cause an issue I've
used more of this product I've used less
of this product but whenever I use this
I consistently notice my powder shadow
collecting in my crease perhaps if
you've got excessively dry eyelids
maybe something like this might just be
the balancing you know answer for you
and I really wouldn't advise anyone with
oily lids to test this out I mean it
really wasn't long I'm talking like a
midday
I noticed the creasing it wasn't even
like you know okay it'll get me through
the whole day and then right when I'm
about to take my makeup up then I start
to notice creasing no it was like midday
this just did not perform for me so it
just goes to show every brand has its
duds and I guess for me this is the dud
from Estee Lauder let's talk about
another eye product this is from Mac and
it's called the Studio sculpt lash and
we've all got different eyelashes you
know think of eyelashes is just an
extension of your hair type
some people have great curly thick
lashes some people like me have lashes
that are straight like to point downward
and the story behind me getting this
mascara
I've been trying I feel like quite a few
Mac products here recently many of them
have been really happy with I saw this
particular mascara on the website and I
had like a flashback to a mascara that I
loved back when I was in college so this
would be the early 2000s early to mid
2000s and it was called Maybelline lash
stylist does anyone remember this it was
just a straight up tiny comb for a
mascara wand and I wouldn't have thought
I would have ever really liked a mascara
like that but it built such nice
separation and length it was like
amazing length it built off of itself so
well and I love that I repurchased that
time and time again and lo and behold
you know as things do it gets
discontinued so when I saw this studio
sculpt on Mac's website I thought that
kind of reminds me of that one from
Maybelline because it's got like this
flat wand here and then you see the comb
only instead of having just one row of
bristles it does have two I don't know
if you can
there there are two and they kind of
come out like a V and so I was
definitely willing to give this a shot
in hopes of kind of recreating my
experience with that Maybelline mascara
that I love so much years ago sadly
there are a few issues with this for me
and it's also funny I was looking on the
makeup Alley website which is just
chock-full of reviews that people do on
all kinds of products written reviews
and ratings and stuff like that and
several other people said they loved
that Maybelline lash stylist as well and
we're looking to this mascara but I
really don't think this is a great
mascara for my kind of lashes because
first off it doesn't hold a curl very
well and it with some mascaras you know
they'll appear to be okay right after
you apply them and maybe even you know
as you continue to finish up your makeup
or whatever it's like okay they're still
looking good but maybe in a couple hours
time your lashes fall I feel like my
lashes fall very quickly like within the
first 20 minutes of wear with this thing
I can notice them straightening out
again so that's pretty disappointing I
really need to wear mascaras that keep
the lashes up because when my lashes
straighten out I've learned over time my
lashes aren't that bad they're not that
short but when they straighten out it's
as if I'm not even wearing anything on
them you know it's like they don't even
get credit for being there because they
don't show up and I even hesitate to
wear this as a first coat before I wear
false lashes because the false lash is
so nicely curved up and then with this
you know my natural lashes fall downward
and I look like I've got this weird like
a two-layered lash thing I do think this
lengthened nicely so if you've got maybe
relatively thick lashes and you just
want to extend them out you might be
happy with the length that this gives
but when I go back to apply extra coats
I feel like my lashes stick together too
much really not what I was expecting
with this kind of a mascara I thought
for sure if nothing else a mascara with
two little combs on it is probably going
to give me good definition but it wasn't
good enough
I need a mascara that really helps all
of my lashes stand out not clumping them
together in little bunches and I really
just didn't expect that a comb style
mascara wand would require me to bring
in
another separate comb like this Real
Techniques one to go through them and
separate them out again my fourth
product here is the tarte energy noir
lip surgence skin to ative lip tint now
if that name sounds a little bit
familiar they do have an energy skin to
it of lip tint that does not have the
noir as part of the name and as you can
see I already have one of these it
reminds me very much of the it cosmetics
vitality lip flush elf also has a
similar product you know it looks like
just light pink in the tube and then you
apply it and especially when you apply
it to your lips
it really takes on a real pinkish hue it
can look slightly different on different
people depending on just the natural
coloring that you might have in your
lips here you can see the original it's
going to be very much a pinkish type
color and I do think it looks kind of
fresh and pretty on the lips and so when
I saw that came out with this noir and
it looks so deep in dark I thought I
wonder what that's gonna do for my lips
and I thought of it it's looking like a
really rich deep vampy color but maybe
being super lightweight and comfortable
and it does have a great feel on the
lips I like the texture of tarte
lipsurgence it has that same kind of
minty smell so the only question was
what's it gonna do color wise I think
whether or not you really turn out to
like this product may depend on how much
natural pigment you have in your lips my
lips naturally have kind of a soft mauve
look to them they're just kind of cool
and tone and just not super pigmented
looking naturally so this when I put it
on top it's got see how it's kind of a
purpley vibe and when I put it on my own
lips it almost looks like I've put a
grayish veil over my lips I guess what
I've learned from this is that putting a
sheer purpley veil of color over my lips
just kind of makes them look ashy and
unhealthy and even though this feels
great I mean it's a product I'm a you
know uses a layering type thing maybe if
the people out there who have been
naturally like a lot of pigment in their
lips maybe they could handle you know
popping that on top and it would really
be interesting over someone who has
naturally very rosy lips
but on mine is just not doing so much
now the final product that I would have
mentioned is something that when I first
tried it I thought gosh I don't know if
I'll ever be able to make this work I
just don't get this product I was just a
little bit dumbfounded by it because I
felt like repeatedly I've tried
different brushes with the product and
it just wasn't working wasn't
transferring translating onto my skin I
now feel like I found a brush that does
work a little bit better with this
product but I'm still not over the moon
about the product so I just thought I
would share it in this video and it's
the makeup forever Pro bronzed fusion I
have a lot of different shades in this
because it was sent to me by make up
forever and this shade is 30 M and this
is marketed as a ultra natural and
waterproof undetectable compact bronzer
and it really is a different kind of
texture happening here when you touch it
with your finger it really doesn't feel
like a traditional powder like it
doesn't kick up any powdery product and
I think that's kind of a cool function
but I really struggle to pick any of
this up with a brush and so I'm kind of
like what's the point you know they do
say undetectable combat bronzer I didn't
take that to mean like it was gonna be
invisible on my skin I just thought
maybe the finish of it would be so
natural you wouldn't be able to tell it
was makeup and then they sent a brush
that was supposed to work hand in hand
with this bronzer but I could not make
like anything come off I couldn't make
it
pull the product from here and still
have it show up on my skin to be honest
with you even if this brush was doing a
really good job of picking up a lot of
product and making it show up on my skin
a dense mini kabuki brush really isn't
my idea of what I want to use to apply
bronzer with anyway you know I want
something a little bit fuller fluffier
it's gonna give me more diffused color I
mean even if it was showing up with this
brush it might be a little - streaky
application for my liking anyway so you
might say okay just use the elf
complexion brush no this picks up like
nothing it won't it will not pull from
the product to the brush so I try all
different kinds of brushes and
eventually what seems to work is a goat
hair angled type brush this is from Mac
and it came from like a little travel
holiday set but I also have you know
goat hair angled brushes from Sigma that
are the
same style of brush you can tell by you
know I've used it you can see what's on
the brush there it picks up the product
pretty well and it does make it show up
on my skin so you pee I finally found a
brush that seems to work with this
product but I still have to do quite a
bit of building up as far as you know
intensifying the color and I'm just not
really getting what the great advantage
to this product is there are many other
bronzers both high-end and drugstore
that can do you know great work with
relatively low effort and pretty much
any brush you want to use too I've had a
similar gripe with the deeper tone of
the products in the makeup forever Pro
sculpting duo's that have come out you
know it's that same kind of texture
however the highlights and these are
beautiful they take like nothing to pull
up and they apply beautifully on the
skin they look great I love the
highlights why can't the bronzer the
deeper side apply more like the
highlight I don't know so that wraps up
my five I guess high-end makeup duds if
you want to call them that I could call
them fails as well I mean they didn't
really work for me they may work for you
guys though they may be things where
you're like oh that's exactly what I
wanted that was just the kind of mascara
I was looking for fortunately I love
being your product guinea pig I love
getting to try things sharing my
opinions
I really don't regret trying them
because I did still come away with
useful information that I could share
with you guys so thank you for watching
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
