me today I have a canker sore on the
left side of my tongue and it's really
bugging me I'm gonna notice that the
entire video but I still want to do this
video I want to talk about some
technique related things I have noticed
personally that there are some mistakes
that I make blending wise on a somewhat
repeated basis like you think you spend
all this time doing makeup you know you
try to do it every day basically you
would maybe have the practice makes
perfect theory right that it's just
gonna be really good all the time but
it's not it's not I think actually you
get so used to putting your makeup on
you can have what I think are best
described is just some oversights and
I'm not saying these are like huge deals
I mean in the scope of the world and
everything that's happening in the world
makeup is a very very small minor deal
but I thought it just might be worth
talking about because I'm a real human
being you all are human beings I mean
there might be a few robots watching but
basically we are people you know who can
make mistakes as we put makeup on and
sometimes I catch it before I finished
my full face sometimes I catch it like
hours later when I'm in the car doing
the rearview mirror test like what does
it really look like a whole week out
something's wrong sometimes I don't
notice it till I'm sitting down editing
a video and I'm cringing like oh well
nobody else saw that so I just thought
I'd call myself out on some of these
things and maybe I won't make the
mistake so often and maybe you guys
won't either
five blending mistakes or oversights
that I've been making one of them is the
lower jaw like area down here blending
out foundation on more than one occasion
I have found that I will have my
finished face done or nearly done and
then I'll see that I've got like a
streaky blend of foundation like
somewhere down in here and usually it's
with a liquidy foundation maybe it's
something that sets kind of fast on my
skin so like I didn't work quite quickly
enough I might have passed over the area
but didn't really make the effort to
work it in and then you've got this like
set makeup streak on your skin and maybe
if you've passed over it with some
powder and didn't pick up on it yet
you've really got it locked in there so
in my little demo Clips today I'm trying
to
show you me doing it the right way so I
really you know made a point to buff it
in taking that extra effort there on
that lower jaw area which to me tends to
be an area where I need less coverage
anyway the zones that I'm really paying
attention to you know are right up here
like this is always priority number one
is this area around the under eye right
I'm trying to brighten it even it out
make it look perfected make it not look
too dry the list goes on but then down
here it's like everything yeah it tends
to be pretty even so I'll just kind of
glaze over it and then that's what I end
up having a mistake another area where I
have failed to blend at times is the tip
of my nose I've noticed this like after
videos or I've noticed it when I've done
my face makeup and I'm doing my eyes and
then I've got a mirror like up to myself
like this putting mascara on and I'm
like oh I see like actual like an end to
my foundation and maybe just a little
powders been tossed over it but it
hasn't really been blended this area
under the snout right here like what's
going on so that is a place where I
think I have to make a point to go over
that with my brush and I don't always do
it I mean if you've watched any kind of
fast-forward and demo of me applying
foundation you probably haven't seen me
like totally catering to that area a
whole lot you know here's another thing
that I want to talk about that I think I
sometimes do wrong and I think the tip
might help a lot of people but it's when
you're working with a really shimmery
highlight like the one I was using today
is from my lorac pro contour palette I
love this palette so much you use it all
the time and this shimmery highlight
right it's like a light pearly really
going there beautiful highlight wearable
still but it's very shimmery and I think
sometimes what we do is we lay those
products on like we see them going on
our cheek we just kind of put it there
admire it in our lovely lighting here in
our room and then just kind of move on
but sometimes with these powder
highlights I'm talking about powder
highlights here even though they're
catching the light and maybe looking
pretty on camera in full-on daylight
they can look more like just product
sitting there on top of the skin I
actually feel like buffing it in and I
think the more potent the highlight the
more strong and shimmery and frosty it
is the more you need to do this and
one time I made this point with like one
of those Smashbox little highlighter
trios the one that collabed with Casey
Holmes it's like the most shimmery one
and that Perl palette I always thought
it'd look best when I would really like
kind of work in circular motions going
over it and nowadays I'm also enjoying
taking my highlight up above this area
that might not be a real thing everyone
wants to do but for me I think it kind
of flatters my face a bit more but when
you buff in the highlight and then you
see yourself in broad daylight
it looks more like glowing skin and less
like product just sitting there and I
really think that's what a lot of this
comes down to for me is like things can
still play off okay and this lighting
that I've got myself surrounded by up
here in my makeup room and if you're at
home and you're just sitting in front of
a makeup mirror you know you've got this
artificial light on you that might make
things look a little better than they
look when you're looking at the rearview
mirror or just in full noonday lighting
right so buff in your highlights you'll
still look highlighted and glowy but
it's gonna make those powders more one
with the skin okay here's another thing
I do wrong and I welcome your tips as
well but the inner part of my crease
this is a real problem area for me in
terms of blending I feel like for my eye
shape I'm very preoccupied with what's
happening out here I feel like it
flatters my eye shape most when I've got
like the outer V you know the color kind
of pulled up and out a little bit from
the eye and then I think I'll flat-out
neglect putting product very far in here
or I just simply won't blend it as much
as it needs to be blended so I think I
need to be more mindful of like when I'm
going in with my e25 brush and taking
that first crease color like really
putting it in there making a point to
blend it out go slightly up I'm not
saying I want a lot of darkness
concentrated in there because I just
don't think that's flattering for my eye
but you know it needs to come up and be
blended out a little bit more and then
maybe with a separate brush going over
that I guess maybe another thing that
might work for me is taking a smaller
brush in there with a little product and
getting it into that crease area but
again I don't want too much going on
there I want it to be light I wanted to
look blended and mesh with everything
else I don't know some days it's fine
some days I'm like oh that could have
been you know worked over a little bit
more so I think it might just be taking
a little more time to pay attention to
the
inner part of the eye as much as I'm
dealing with and working over the outer
part of the eyes but that's an example
of something I sometimes pick up on as
I'm going back and editing videos and
I'm like a little blended that just a
little bit more and here's my last thing
and this is more of like just an effect
I want to go for more often on my lower
lashline brushes that I often pick up to
do my lower lashline would be my e21
smudger brush you know it's a really
small brush it's smudgy but it's it's
small or like just an angled liner brush
and those are two pretty precise brushes
even though this is a smudger you see
what I mean it's gonna get the product
pretty precisely where you want it and
then I'll say in videos like oh I'm
gonna make it smoky so I'm gonna use
like one of these brushes well I think
really a pencil brush or even like the
brush that I'll use for my outer corner
here this 315 from mua makeup academy
professional something like that like if
I really want to go there and make it
smoky and I get it with this brush today
I took it down there under the lower
lash line and that really you know just
allows the shadow to pull out just
slightly from your lower lash line it's
a touchy area
I know because we've gone to these
painstaking measures to get this all
brightened and evened with concealer so
it's like I don't want to have my shadow
drift super low and I don't want to risk
fallout coming down too low I think if
it's just not too big of a brush but
slightly bigger than one of these you
know it can buff that shadow out a
little bit more and I did it today and
I'm liking what's going on there because
it's ultra soft still it's not too harsh
on the eyes and it diffused the shadow
actually a bit more than it might
usually be but everything looks super
blended on my under eye and it might
just be coming down ever so slightly
lower than that little like primary
crease that I have under the lower lash
line so I don't know just something to
think about you all might you know have
those habits already everyday in your
makeup but that's something I'm gonna
try to work on yeah I hope this was at
least a little bit helpful to you guys
just kind of calling myself out on a few
things that I think I could do better if
I just pay a little more attention to it
you know but thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch and I will see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
