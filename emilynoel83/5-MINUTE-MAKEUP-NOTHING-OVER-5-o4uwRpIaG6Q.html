me this video was a great request from a
viewer recently and the idea is this to
do five minute makeup but not use any
products that are over five dollars now
they didn't say that this had to look
good but I'm going to try my best to
create a look that doesn't actually cut
too many corners but it should be very
quick and I think it's going to be a
good look I have not actually done a
test run of this five-minute makeup look
but I was scheming about it I was
thinking like which products I would use
I was looking for which things made the
price cut and then also from the other
standpoint which things were just fast
to apply and well I know this is going
to be hard because it's always my
preference to take my time when I'm
doing my makeup I actually don't feel
quite as scared with this challenge as I
have in the past where I've done other
like five-minute makeup things I feel
like after two kids now I have been in
some vines where I've done stuff really
really fast I guess the question is are
these particular affordable products
certain things that I've chosen going to
be able to all come together and be
really quick but I've got my timer here
I'm going to set this up somewhere where
I can see I have looked up all the
prices of these things beforehand so
they are all under five dollars or the
last thing my lip product is right at
five dollars I don't know though guys
I'm looking at this there are quite a
few products how many products actually
am i using in this one two oh five oh
eight nine it'll just say now in case I
don't describe the product enough or say
the right name or I could get really
flustered and forget to talk about what
product I'm using I will list everything
down below in the description box and
yeah ready set go
timers running what in wild photo focus
gonna dab this all over the skin and I'm
trying also guys to use like really
affordable brushes as well so I've got
my wet wipe flat top brush
really soft really good gonna blend this
all in there are some steps I think I'm
going to be able to breathe through like
really really fast with this but
foundation blending kinda need to make
sure that gets done right already been
like their distance
hello man okay pretty good oh my phone
is like going to black like as this goes
on I mean okay concealer this is from
essence well 299 concealer here I'm
hoping it's going to brighten enough
again load steps are not take forever on
to use this brush a little bit to death
over that
we can do this y'all we got this you
guys cheer me on at home
concealer wet-and-wild come to our
palates great great multitasker here and
I'm going to use the light side and I'm
going to try to set under-eye with that
it's matte by the way matte powder and
then right there handy I've got the
contour
on tour the chips
there we go it's all happening you got
to take us through my hairline to my
word three minutes that'll do
okay got this wet-and-wild cheekers
blush soft sable this David for watching
he's laughing because I'm making
important to hold my brush still in my
compactor okay not bad not bad
oh I forgot I was going to is a little
concealer right there it's AI primer oh
man I'm freaking stressed okay light
shade on the lid again a little wet and
wild brush like never use this brush
week 212
this is Colin should I needed that sorry
I feel like I'm mumbling I'm just
totally in a mumbling state okay little
crease colors there I'm going to use my
regular lash curler here that go in get
the mascara ready essence lash princess
this is the sculpted volume oops a new
one tip make sure you unclench the lash
curler before you try to pull it away
from your freaking eye the last minute
30
a minute minute 20 that's a long time
that's really a long time right word
a little sludge on that one I
go ahead and take care of the lips this
is color pot by the way this is the
exactly five dollar product in the shade
called Baywatch okay let's make make the
words go around those okay
eyebrow product here this is elf and I
little two dollar brow pencil we're
going to do this we're going to make it
guys fifty second just filling in the
major here just get them even letting
section my highlight that I was going to
use is on the floor by my foot
twenty-second yeah please
did another was going to be a fiscal
challenge okay here we go
essence pier news little blow here and
run this fully proof boom all right what
do you guys think here should turn this
off oh my gosh okay you guys I don't
hate this I do not hate this look I am
really proud of myself as good pat
myself on the back right now I mean it's
not that I need a q-tip seriously I did
use everything oh there was one thing
sitting here that I had to use that
wanted to use it was the wet and wild
ultimate brow highlighter I was going to
put that in my lower inner rim but that
was at kind of a small detail overall
look the foundation actually does look
blended like that was a big goal was to
just get foundation concealer looking
good enough and then the other things on
top just as far as the products go that
I used I mean the Wet n Wild photo focus
like this is probably one of the best
cheapest foundations it does come in
under the five dollar mark if you get it
at Walmart that was good this did not
disappoint this gave good coverage and
this did give brightening it's the cover
stick in Sant mats and I chose a stick
concealer because I sometimes feel like
they're just a little bit faster and
faster coverage build up I guess you'd
say compared to some liquidy concealers
this guy this is a multitasker here
because I was able to use this as kind
of like face powder you know use it as
an under eye setting type tool but also
I had the contour there and I tried at
least I got it on there as eyeshadow as
well blush really looks good I haven't
reached for this in a long time but this
is soft sable from covergirl and another
sort of strategy when you're doing
really light makeup I think is to go
with the lip that shows up a little bit
more so this baywatch shade from
colour-pop this is a matte shade and
it's a little bit deeper you know a
little richer color and I think that
brings instantly more life to the face
now something I purposely skipped I
didn't even pull one for this video is
an eyeliner because I think that's a
little too tedious and I've always said
this but when you're really hurrying
with your makeup I truly think eyeliner
can be skipped at least for me like if I
can curl my lashes did I even curl the
one side I think I did if I can have the
time to just get the lashes curled in
the mascara on that's enough
like impact there for me so I hope you
guys enjoyed this it was really fun I
was tweeting the other day how I was
thinking up like video ideas things I
hadn't seen before and so many of you
kind of came at me with these sort of
challenge type videos so if you like
these challenges whether they're a time
challenge or a price challenge or
something like that I think those are
really fun so if you've got unique ideas
for those keep them coming because this
was fun for me sorry I get as I mumbled
my way through this process but like I
said I mean when you're going for speed
you just can't communication is not a
priority so I hope you guys have a great
day thank you so much for your time for
your 5 minutes of time for specific you
and I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
