joining me today I'm excited to bring
you a really just best of the best type
video today because there have been so
many new things coming out at the
drugstore I feel like I have tried so so
many of them and I wanted to give you
just you know boiled down to five best
things that I really think are worth
trying I wanted to keep it brief keep it
quick and easy and just hopefully spare
you some of the trial and error if
you've been really curious about some of
these things
I love the new Maybelline fit me blushes
they have reformulated some things here
I've tried a few and I would say my
favorite ones remain the shades called
wine and also the one called nude wine
is the one that I'm wearing in this
video and it's just a really pretty rosy
flush on the cheek and I said this is
like Snow White's blush so even if
you've got light skin this is that
pretty rosy color that just brings a lot
of life to the face and then nude has I
think a bit more sheen to it it's just a
really soft natural color I feel like
it's very neutral and works alongside
pretty much any lip color I might choose
except I'm not sure exactly how new this
product is to the drugstore but it's
definitely new to me I saw it in my
Walmart's new Milani display they just
got Milani and I had had a product
previously called prep set and go and it
was just a translucent matte setting
powder and now I saw prep set and glow
and this is an illuminating transparent
powder they say I feel like it is about
75% just regular matte powder 25% glowy
powder the glow is so soft and settled
here to the point where this is a
product I can use with a fluffy powder
brush and just brush it all over my skin
is a light very natural-looking setting
powder because it doesn't have that
dryness that some others might have this
time of year I'm using a few more BB
creams and those can be sometimes a bit
more tacky and moisturizing on the skin
so you might just want a little light
dusting of powder over the top to sort
of smooth everything out and this looks
so natural in that way but I find I can
concentrate it a little bit more with a
smaller brush and this is what I'm
wearing just to give a very very soft
glow on top of the cheeks today and it
is so soft like I said this is mostly
Matt powder but it's just got that
little bit of blow mixed in and I don't
mean glow by way of shimmer or anything
like that it's just the finest softest
glow next things I think is still great
but I don't really use it for its
intended purpose it's the wet-and-wild
ultimate brow highlighter and I think
this is actually the best thing for the
lower inner rim best little brightener
for the waterline I just love it so much
it transfers on super super easily it's
so much better than a lot of the skinny
pencils that I have it's kind of like
the Milani shadow eyes and almond cream
which can hardly be found anymore this
is that type of tone and I just love how
it kind of widens out the whites of my
eyes makes me look more wide awake I
even like just popping this around my
inner corner even though it's a matte
pencil it provides a lot of brightness
just around the inner corner and you
could certainly use it to better define
your brows you know use it right
underneath the highest point of your
brow that's kind of what they meant for
this product to do but it really is nice
on the waterline next new product I
think it's such an essential is this new
L'Oreal voluminous lash
I just love this mascara it's so great
for just full fluffy lashes I know I
love it because I feel comfortable with
this being like the only thing that I
wear on my eyes if I could only like
grab for one item to put on my eyes no
liner no shadow you know it would be
this mascara because what it's doing for
my lashes that aren't especially long or
full naturally it does a great job of
holding the curl though that's one of
the biggest things for me because if my
lashes just straighten out then you
can't even see it they could be the
fullest longest most wonderful looking
things but if the curl is not keeping
them kind of upright you're not going to
see that so this does seem to hold the
curl throughout the day for me I just
don't like putting it on my lower lashes
because that's where I have seen smudges
so I would go back to my like covergirl
clump pressure water-resistant
if I really wanted to have something on
those lower lashes but this on the upper
lashes this is totally what I want to be
using and yes it does remind me of the
brush style of Too Faced better than sex
but it is holding the curl a lot better
than that product did final product
rounding out this top 5 would be these
super stay matte
from Maybelline oh my gosh I'm so glad
to find like a liquid lipstick product
from the drugstore that I think totally
performs how I want it to I've talked
and talked about the bareMinerals Jen
nude line of those liquid lipsticks I
think are super comfortable they just
don't feel drying at all they glide on
like velvet they just feel super
comfortable but they can tend to
transfer off just a little bit and
that's something you know I'm willing to
go with because I think they still we're
pretty evenly even despite that fact
these super stay matte inks though from
Maybelline they really do not transfer
off they are as thin as can be and yet
they don't feel drying either they're
really interesting really great
I guess innovation to come to the
drugstore the two shades I have our
lover that's one I've been wearing
throughout the video and also pioneer
they're really brilliant red they have a
nice pointed applicator that allows you
to get very precise as you put it on
super thin feeling as you apply it and
there's no need to try to build up the
product because it's still very opaque
and right after you put it on you know
you're going to notice a hint of
tackiness on your lips and you might
continue to notice that honestly for
let's say about the first 20 minutes
that you've got it on your lips like as
you press them together you might feel
like a little something's on there but
right it out just let it go because it's
going to feel more just one with your
lips as the day goes on and it really
does a good job of hanging in there even
through eating through drinking the red
has been a really good example for me to
check that because there's more contrast
with my natural lip color and even
through most of the day like the wear
down was kind of on the innermost part
of the lip and I think if you wanted to
go ahead and reapply these they are so
thin you could do that and just like
kind of patch the area that might have
worn off a little bit I gotta give huge
props to this shade because there is
less contrast with my natural lips and I
can hardly tell this is wearing down at
all this may be a great shade to go for
because it's just a little closer to the
natural lip color my one critique on
this line would be that there aren't as
many nude or natural tones as I would
like to see but I do think it's an
exceptional formula and if you kind of
hated on liquid lipsticks for a while
for feeling thick for feeling like too
much product these I got to say are not
like that they feel very comfortable
and they're super long wearing and they
totally passed the kids test they did
not transfer off on to your baby I got
one bonus mention for you here and this
may not be something absolutely
everyone's interested in but I just
wanted to talk about it if you are a big
like lightweight foundation BB cream
tinted moisturizer type person here in
the summer months
the infallible pro glow from L'Oreal I
think is a really nice pairing with that
a lightweight concealer to go along with
your lightweight foundations or BB
creams this is really nice on the under
eye area because it boosts up the
coverage some but it doesn't look like
you know a whole other world of
concealer compared to the lightweight
stuff all over your face it just kind of
meshes in obviously we're not looking at
the coverage here of something like
Tarte shaped tape but at the same time
it looks more natural on the skin in
circumstances where maybe all over your
face you're seeing a little bit more of
your skin through this is just going to
be that perfect lightweight concealer
pairing and I wear this in the shade
classic ivory so guys those are my 5
technically 6 new drugstore products top
picks course there are many other
drugstore products that I think are
worth trying but I tried to focus in on
some of the things that I thought were a
little bit newer releases so happy
shopping thank you so much for watching
and I will see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
