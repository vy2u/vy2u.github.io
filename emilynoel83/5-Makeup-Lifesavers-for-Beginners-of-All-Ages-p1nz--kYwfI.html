tuning in I'm so happy to have you here
for this video these are the kinds of
beginner makeup tips that I really wish
I would have had when I started with
makeup all of the things I'm going to
mention are things that would have taken
the way I was initially doing something
and made it so much easier and so much
better as far as the end result goes I
think these are tips that will translate
to absolutely any age as well I think we
automatically think that a makeup
beginner is someone in their teens but I
have heard from so many people who watch
my channel who are just starting with
makeup who are in their 30s 40s 50s 60s
you name it and I really think these
tips techniques and kind of habits to
think about I think they will translate
across all ages and if you're an old pro
and you're watching this and you're
thinking with some of these tips dang I
already knew that give yourself a pat on
the back and carry on because these are
again the things I wish I would have
known
starting out with makeup and if you guys
are interested in some sort of an
updated makeup starter kit video that is
very product focused let me know if
you're interested but now 5 general tips
things I want to focus on and using a
foundation buffing brush this would have
helped me so much in my early days
applying foundations and I'm
particularly talking about liquid
foundations this brush that I'm holding
is from Target it's the up and up
complexion brush it's super soft it
cleans up really well and it applies the
foundation so evenly and beautifully on
the skin and you'll see me using this
with the it cosmetics CC plus product
but I mean think of any liquidy
consistency that you might be using this
brush really helps it buff into the skin
and if you want over areas where you
need more coverage let's say for me
that's my under eye area a patting
motion with this brush works really well
also and it's also helpful for concealer
as well you know I've applied a little
Mac Pro Longwear and then you can stick
with this same brush and just dab over
the concealer you will be so surprised
by how much coverage your concealer has
if we want to start throwing around the
word flawless I think that's going to
depend on what foundation you choose to
use but I mean it really does give you a
nice finish using a brush like this and
just
makes the whole blending process so much
easier number two tip you've got to use
some sort of shadow primer or base you
can buy all of the shadows in the world
you can buy out the drugstore but
they're not going to look as nice on
your lids or lasts as long if you don't
put something on there first and there
were so many years where I don't even
think a lot of bases or primers were on
the market like when I was starting out
so it's no wonder I got so frustrated
with eye shadows for years but now there
are plenty of things out there one
really affordable one that I think is
one of the best is from Milani it's just
called the eye shadow primer as you can
see it's a much fluff product I've
nearly used it up I think it's very
comparable to the effector banditti a
primer potion gives me but you want to
apply this all over the lid into the
crease up to the brow bone and if you
want if you know you're going to be
doing some shadow under the eye you can
even dab it down there as well but this
slightly tacky but not too thick product
is going to take even lesser pigmented
shadows and make them really stand out
on your lids number three tip please
seek out smaller eyeshadow brushes if
you're struggling with eyeshadow
application if you're watching other
people in videos and you're feeling like
they're turning out a flawless look and
then you pick up those same brushes and
those same eyeshadows and it looks like
it's a big muddy mess on your lids use
smaller brushes so you have control that
is the key word once I started doing
this I feel like my makeup world
completely changed the first smaller
applicator that I think you need to pay
attention to is the sponge tip there is
no reason why you can't use a sponge tip
in fact it will pack shadow on your lid
just as well as any flat eyeshadow brush
out there if not better
I remember reading in one of my Kevyn
Aucoin makeup books and it times to use
sponge tips if they were good enough for
him they're good enough for me and
throughout this little section of the
video I'm using on purpose an eyeshadow
quad that's not super pigmented it's the
autumn copper's expert where quad from
Maybelline and I very easily can build
up color on my lids with a sponge tip I
also do think a smallish flat brush is
essential to have especially for your
darker shades and
that you kind of want to go beyond your
lid space with I think it's good to then
put down the sponge tip and grab a brush
and this small shadow brush from Sonia
Kashuk such a must have I've had it for
years it's really great for precise
placement if you've got small eyes or
again if you feel like you just can't
control these larger brushes and get
your shadows placed where you want them
use this Pat your shadow into your
crease or into your outer corner you'll
be so impressed with the outcome also a
smaller sized crease brush this one from
Sigma is called the domed utility e34
this is really great and so much smaller
compared to say an e 40 brush this can
easily wedge into your crease place that
shadow exactly where you want it and
don't worry so much at this point in
time about blending it out but placing
it exactly where you need it a small
brush is great for this another brush
that I have been using since seriously
the start of my channel this is going
back to like 2008 I still remember this
thing I still have the exact same brush
I can't believe how many years I've been
talking about this but if you can find
the essence of beauty fine crease brush
duo this is one of the two in that duo
this is the smaller of the two and this
is another really great way to build
that outer V up with ease it's like
you're basically saying okay I want that
V here and here okay done and then you
want your bare fluffy brush there is a
place for this in your collection for
several years I think in my makeup life
I did not use like a bear blending brush
I just didn't know what to make of
brushes this size or some bear and go
over the border of your look and really
buff out that edge of your shadow
because your smaller brushes have helped
you place it this will help you blend it
so you just buff back and forth back and
forth back and forth and this will be
responsible for giving you that more
finished professional effect to your
makeup number four a tip pertaining to
false eyelashes some point in time or
another everyone is a beginner with
false lashes everybody has a first time
using them and usually that's not a
success I know it wasn't for me the
first like I don't know dozen times
probably here's something I wish I would
have had
when I was starting out this little
gizmo this is called the false lash
applicator it's from BH Cosmetics was
just a few dollars and this makes the
lash application so easy and right now
you know I'm pretty comfortable using my
fingers to apply false lashes but when I
was starting out I really think this
would have seriously made the process a
breeze so first off you know you're
applying your glue I do think using a
glue with the wand applicator like
Revlon precision lash glue is essential
it really helps you control the amount
of glue going on the band and for a lot
more specific lash tips I do have a
video from a couple years back called
false eyelashes 101 I still do all the
things I talked about in that video I
still refer people to that all the time
so in-depth false lashes application but
this tool this is something I've come
across since then you grab the lash in
the center of the band with this if
you've got Shakey's fingers it's nice
because you can squeeze the crap out of
this tool and the lashes stay still you
can easily see where you're placing the
lashes on your lash line I like to put
it right on my liner very very close to
my lashes you can press down your ends
and then use the opposite edge of the
tool to kind of tamp it down and make
sure all of that lash band is in contact
with all of your lash line because
that's sometimes the part of this
process that gets people because you
think okay I've done it I've done it
I've got the lashes on my lash line and
then you start messing around with your
finger and before you know it you've
pulled the dang thing off because your
finger has stuck to the glue this is
really good about not sticking to the
glue tip number five I think a really
helpful thing for your lips is to
pretreat your lips before you ever put
any actual product on them any lipstick
products I mean when you sit down to do
your makeup put a lip balm on like right
alongside your moisturizer that you put
on your face I think of this as pre
softening my lips and getting them ready
throughout my whole makeup process it's
like they're cooking they're getting
ready for the product that I will
ultimately put on there
so whatever balm you like maybe it's
straight-up Vaseline maybe it's an EOS
lip balm maybe it's one of these Nivea
lip balms I really like these put that
on there go through your whole makeup
routine and then when it comes time for
lips and you're thinking but Emily I
want to use one of those great new matte
lip
accent isn't that bomb gonna mess with
the finish here's what you do just blot
the bomb off you will still have taken
advantage of all that moisture you might
not have to do that if you're just
wearing a gloss or if you're wearing a
creamy lipstick but if you're wearing
something matte you get rid of any shine
and then go about your business I use
one of these NYX liquid suede in the
shade soft spoken today but your lips
will look so much better for having done
this they will appear more plump
they will feel better under you know any
sort of matte lip color or really any
lip color you put on exfoliating your
lips several times a week the elf lip
exfoliator I mean just run this over
your lips that can really help with the
softness and getting them nice and
smooth but you can't really expect any
of these new matte products that are
coming out to look good on gnarly dry
crusty cracky nasty lips and those my
friends are my 5 makeup lifesavers for
beginners I hope these were useful I
hope you can work some of these things
into your routine and hopefully it will
make life easier it will just make your
whole make up experience a little more
pleasant because that's what it should
be you know when you sit down to do your
makeup it should be fun it is time that
you're giving to yourself you're
spending on yourself it shouldn't be
filled with frustration or feeling like
I don't know what I'm doing but
hopefully some of these tips will help
you out as well so thank you guys so
