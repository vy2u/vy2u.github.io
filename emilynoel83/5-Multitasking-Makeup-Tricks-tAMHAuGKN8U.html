would take a little break from the
reviews to do something kind of focusing
on the multitasking uses of different
makeup products sometimes we're all
about the new new new you don't actually
realize how productive or how useful
things that we already have might be
I've redone part of my makeup storage to
make it easier for me to access
different rediscovered products kind of
on a rotating basis and I'll probably do
a video on that as well but for now I
thought I would just share some useful
tips and tricks and just ways to get a
little extra use out of some products
you might already have sitting around in
your collection so the first thing that
I have found to be a great multitasker
is this brush from it cosmetics and it's
called the heavenly luxe number 5 no tub
dual eyeshadow brush and I actually have
several of these because anytime I've
ordered like an it cosmetics palette
from QVC it comes with this exact brush
it's kind of a fluffy side on one end
and a smaller like smudgy brush on the
other and it's not that it can't work
for the eyes I mean it can be a great
blending brush for the eyes or a smudge
brush but I really don't need like three
or four different ones for my eyes so
when one of these most recently came
with my naturally pretty Romantics
palette I thought you know what I bet
this could be a great concealer brush
because it just is so dense and soft and
it really works well like I was using
today this new concealer I'm trying out
from Rimmel called wake me up and I just
dab that on my under eye area and just
anywhere else I wanted to use it on the
face and then I just used this brush to
tap it in buff it in and it really works
well and I love the smaller end too for
getting right up under the under eye
like right up to your lower lash line it
does a great job blending the concealer
out there so I just thought this was
really handy for that and I didn't know
if any of you all you know had bought a
lot of their trios or palettes and you
have quite a few of these brushes
hanging around it's a really nice
quality brush for more than just
eyeshadow how many of you have a primer
on hand that's one of those kind of
slippery primers it's usually they
contain silicone you know they have a
really silky smooth feel to them when
you put them on the skin these are
primers like Smashbox
finish also this one from Maybelline
called baby skin a small amount of a
really silky smooth primer like this can
really help other cream face products
glide on much more easily I'm so excited
about this tip because I actually have a
cream blush on him that I was struggling
with a little bit if you saw my review
on this on the Express channel you kind
of know what I'm talking about it's the
Rimmel stay blush in the shade sunkissed
cherry and I actually found this to be
kind of the consistency of it was not
very easily blendable with your fingers
and it was almost like it needed to be
thinned out and smoothed out just a
little bit and that is exactly what this
kind of a product will do so I just use
a small amount of this on my hand and
then squeeze out whatever your cream or
liquid blush highlight you name it
product might be that you want to blend
in with it and then just blend it in and
it applies really easily with fingertips
I mean I love my ELF small stipple brush
because I think that makes the
application of any cream product a lot
easier but this is really no brainer I
mean it was very easy to blend this in
on my cheeks with my fingertips and
because it went on so nice and smooth
and because I didn't use too much of
this product it really didn't interfere
with the foundation and powder and stuff
that I had underneath I've also tried
mixing this in with products that
sometimes set really quickly on the skin
like the tints from benefit like about
lollitint here and there's Benetton
cha-cha tan all those different ones you
could also blend a little bit of that
kind of a product in with something like
this and find that it blends out a
little more smoothly alright it's not
exactly rocket science to realize that
beautiful highly shimmery eyeshadows
could potentially make beautiful
shimmery highlights on the skin but
these are just too beautiful not to tell
you about and I know this is a pretty
popular palette from ELF it's the Prizm
eyeshadow palette in the shade natural
and I may have talked about this
somewhat recently I can't remember when
but it's a great palette of neutrals
they are all shimmery but what I was
starting to realize was how gorgeous
like this side of the palette is as
highlighters they are seriously so
pretty and I think part of what really
makes them gorgeous highlights in my
eyes
is that they don't contain glitter I
think flex is glitter it's almost like
telling the world hey I just put
highlight on it's right here can you see
the glitter the way I see it I'm all for
glow but I just like it to come off in a
little less obvious way and I just think
these lightest shades in here are
amazing and they're not exact dupes for
different highlights from Becca but they
do have some very similar finishes and
you know they're slightly off in color
so I'm not gonna say that they're dupes
but this lightest one does remind me
quite a bit of moonstone this one is a
little bit similar to rose gold and this
one is a little bit close to topaz so
today I just used my little highlighting
brush from my complexion set from up and
up and I use the lightest one and I just
thought it gave a brilliant looking
highlight so if you've got this sitting
around and you like using it as
eyeshadow definitely try it as highlight
as well and don't you know it goes both
ways
so you could use your highlight its eye
shadow I always like trying this with
different mosaic style blushes
highlights bronzers you name it trying
them out is eyeshadows for a quick look
usually ends up being a very natural
look and something I can pull off in no
time and I have actually really been
enjoying this L'Oreal True Match powder
glow illuminator and I have it in the
shade what is it rose
it says rose and neutral undertone on it
the way you cease on the eyes actually I
just dip into that lightest shade and
apply it all over the lid and then I
used that deeper rosy shade that's up
top and I just put that in the crease
just blend it out it's not gonna be a
drastic looking crease shade but it's
just gonna be a little bit of contrast
there and it's still very brightening
this whole look is super bright and then
I just go into one of the lighter shades
whichever one doesn't really matter up
under the brow and the end result like I
said a very brightened look it's a look
that I actually love pairing like I did
today with a really deep lip you can
even glam it up with some false lashes
and I know I've got like a zillion
eyeshadow palettes I don't need to be
going to a highlight in order to you
know dig up some eyeshadow but the fact
of the matter is there are a lot of days
that I'm in a hurry
and
was actually the way I discovered this
as eyeshadow and I do really like it I
think it gives just the lightest kind of
pinky rosy look to the eyes but it
really brightens them up the last thing
I know this is a product I've raved
about before but I think I found like
yet another use for it and it's the
Milani brow and I highlighters my
favorite one is the one in matte cream
and luminous lift so it's got a matte
creamy side to one end and then the
other one is a little bit shimmery I
don't use the shimmery side as much but
I could see that being a really nice way
to like go right around the tear duct of
your eye area or even use it as like a
shimmery base for a shadow a standard
way to use this in a way I've used this
a lot is to use the one end I use the
matte side like up under my brow and it
really cleans up just under the brow
area also just kind of lightens and lips
that area up a bit but that end is also
really great on the waterline you can
just apply it right in here and see how
brightened and widened and just more
wide-awake that makes the whole eye area
look when you do something like that and
I have a shade from Milani called almond
cream and it's one of their really
long-lasting shadow eyes Stix that I use
a lot in that way but this actually
lasts a really long time too but yet
another way you can use this is to clean
up around your lips let's say you're
sporting a really bold lip color like
this and you just want the cleanest line
possible around it you can just take
this pencil and kind of you know draw a
few little lines around the outside of
your lip you can also kind of take it
right up around the Cupid's bow area and
it's a way to get sort of a matte
highlight there and then I pulled in
that it cosmetics brush that I was using
for concealer earlier and just blend
that out I kind of like to blend away
from the lips a little bit kind of going
back between both sides of the brush and
you'll find you get a really clean
looking line around your bold lip colors
so 5 little multitasking makeup tricks
ways to take products you might already
have and make them go a little further I
hope you try these tricks and let me
know how they go or let me know what
your favorite makeup multitaskers are in
the comments section below I would love
to hear about them so thank you guys see
