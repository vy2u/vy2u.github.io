being here yes I am in my painted makeup
room I've got so many things I want to
show you in here that have changed
around just the way my desk is a lot of
other little details in the room have
changed and of course the paint color
gone is the pink I've brought in kind of
this neutral cream shades from Valspar
got it at Lowe's it's called cream in
your coffee or cream in my coffee it's a
very popular shade they sell but I was
just looking for something that would be
brighter in this room when I'm shooting
so early in the morning and don't have a
lot of light coming in or sometimes no
light coming in and also something color
wise that just wouldn't interfere so
much with my camera and my shot so I
know I'm not in a studio I'm here in my
house I'm not trying to turn it into a
studio but I am trying to make it the
best environment for these videos that
it can be so I'm really going to have a
lot of trial and error going on with my
lighting that I've set up here the way
I'm positioned in the room different
backgrounds that I want to have
different stuff in the background so
bear with me here I will be sharing a
lot more about the changes that I've
made but it's been such a busy weekend
I've just recently gotten a root canal
so it kind of hurts to open my mouth
very wide and talk also we had the
meet-and-greet at Macy's which went
wonderfully well absolutely amazed by
the turnout by how far some of you came
it was so wonderful meeting you guys
giving you a hug learning more about you
though thank you so much for coming I
realize it may not have been a
convenient time and place for everyone
and other people wanted to come and
couldn't come but I just appreciate you
taking an interest so so much but the
video that I felt like I had to sit down
and get my act together and shoot right
now was the video about the Sephora sale
the vib sale vib Rouge I'm going to put
all the code info in the description box
so you know what you can type in to save
15% if you're vib Rouge or vib and then
I believe it's 10% for Beauty insiders
but definitely something worth taking
advantage of you can save a substantial
amount and it's hard to really save when
you buy stuff at Sephora a lot of times
so often when we do videos and we're
talking about favorites and things that
we love it seems like there's always
that little asterisk like well only for
those who have dry skin or only for
those who love a neutral eyeshadow
palette or only for blah blah blah you
know the list goes on and in this video
I thought it'd be really fun to give you
just five solid works for any one picks
I think I really see all of these things
I'm going to be talking about working
for absolutely anyone any walk of life
you know any makeup look that you desire
these products could work into it and be
really great and some of these things I
know you've heard me talk about before
so they may not be too surprising but
I'm going to jump right in first thing
are the busy art theory palettes I know
the brand is very much become associated
with their $80 you know larger palettes
and those are great really they are I
think what is a really really great
value and also a great thing to try if
you have not tried anything from this
line before are the theory palettes and
I have one of them here in mink and it's
gorgeous okay it's got three matte three
shimmer most of the times their palettes
they're larger ones are either all matte
or all shimmer so this gives you a nice
little sampling and I just really love
the shades that are in this particular
one because the mats are so so basic I'm
wearing just these three mats on my eyes
today because I knew you know I wasn't
going to go all out on the eyes because
I was going to do a really bright lip so
I kept it very basic but then you've got
these shiny shades that are just
gorgeous over here as well the finishes
the texture they are so great to work
with such great pigmentation they've
recently come out with some new shades
actually in this little palette format
and when I heard they were coming out
with those I actually got on the
pre-order list for Muse beauty and I
didn't realize that if and when they
were going to be coming to Sephora
otherwise there probably would have
bought them you know under this sale but
I ordered the new blush palettes and the
new eyeshadow palettes in this format so
I will do much more on that after I get
them and get a chance to play with them
for a while and really tell you what I
think but for right now I mean this is
the one that I have I
it's really amazing and I believe it's
like $45 so it's a great place to start
with this brand see if you like it see
if it's something you might want to
pursue you know in other palate another
cool thing is that the pans do
magnetized in and out so if you want to
stick them in a larger palette you can
do that so that's cool when I think
about this palette it's like for
whatever reason I end up wearing it for
really big occasions like when I went
and saw Carrie Underwood at the Grand
Ole Opry I was wearing this for my
meet-up last weekend I was wearing this
like and just so many everyday days in
between so it's really great side note I
have fallen even deeper in love with
busy art and just their whole brand
after watching the video I believe it
was her channel is Stephanie Nicole and
she did a great interview with them and
it wasn't like hyping up a product it
was just a very real very in-depth look
at this brand just the way they
manufacture their creative process I
just thought it was so so fascinating
I'll link to that video below because it
just really I don't know maybe want to
dive headfirst into all their products
okay item number two on my list that I
think is a no-fail must-have that
everyone must try are the Besame
lipsticks this is an incredible brand I
have done a couple of videos already
pretty much exclusively on Besame
products so I will also link to those
below if you want some more details more
in-depth info seeing more of them on my
lips and whatnot in a nutshell the
concept behind this brand is that they
do vintage like replica products and
their lipsticks are all associated with
a certain year and there is a certain
inspiration behind the shade the finish
they do a lot of work to make a really
authentic actual replica Shay based on
some vintage you know lipstick samples
that they have found and I think that's
so so cool the quality is impeccable and
they smell like real vanilla the tubes
are absolutely stunning and this is the
way the lipsticks are shaped if you want
to apply them straight from the tube you
can actually have some precision with
that but I love doing these with the lip
brush
like to brush on like one coat blot it
off brush on another coat and I may or
may not want that one off as well and
the staying power is just extreme I
would associate this brand mainly with
Reds there are quite a few outstanding
Reds in this line and then some things
that might kind of veer off from that a
little bit but when I was thinking about
you know what works for everybody not
everybody may think they want a red
lipstick that deep down in my heart I
think everyone needs a red lipstick so I
have three options or just real quick
the one that I think is the most
wearable is red velvet I have this in a
mini size but this is a little bit
deeper it's not quite as shouting from
the rooftops is what I've got on my face
right now
and red velvet is very very soft and
creamy and beautiful and yes it will
last a long time do that double blot
technique and you'll have great staying
power with that if you do want something
that's a real statement old Hollywood
red that's what I've got on here it's
red hot red Marilyn Monroe's signature
type color I think that's just a
gorgeous bright classic red and then
another option here that I love so much
is tango red and this one has a lot more
orange in it and I think of this color
as being a little bit more of say a
trendy shade for this season just
because a lot of people like to work in
the more oranjee corals but there's red
velvet see quite a bit deeper here's the
shade I'm wearing right in the center
red hot red and then tango red whether
or not it's picking up on camera that
one has the most orangie warmth to it
but it's a formula that you absolutely
cannot argue with its intensity that is
just as bold as can be they feel great
on the lips so I would just highly
recommend picking up a Besame lipstick
number three Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I have gotten on the
train with this product in the past few
months and I just think it's outstanding
I like this so much because it can be
worn in so many different capacities and
seems so lightweight yet in some crazy
magical way I swear it adds coverage
even when I use it in its lightest form
so if you want to bake with this this is
an ideal product to do that with I find
the shade of this to be just a little
bit lighter than
my skin tone though it does kind of act
as a brightener it improves the staying
power of my makeup but then I can just
put it on very lightly with the lightest
little brush and just to use it to sort
of take the texture of a concealer that
might be a little bit too sticky and
just smooth it out and it can do that
wonderfully well with very minimal
product and there are a lot of powders
that can change the texture of something
on your skin you know even the cheapest
powder can do that but what must be
different about this powder it's so fine
it doesn't leave that additional texture
on the skin I know I've raved and raved
about the dietary hyaluronic hydra
powder that's a great thing for giving
like the ultimate smoothness on the skin
but this on top of everything for
whatever reason seems to add a tinge
more coverage to the under eye area when
you're using it there and then by all
means you can use this lightly all over
the face also if you only use this big
old thing on the under eye area I mean I
think you'd have it for a really long
time but this can be your all over face
you know set the foundation powder or it
can be just your last little mattifying
step all over the skin I think this is
so good I would really recommend it to
any age number four on my list is from
Beauty Blender and they've got a kit
called all about face and basically it
is a four piece set that comes with the
solid cleanser a mini solid cleanser I
believe a full-size Beauty Blender a
Beauty Blender blusher and a micro mini
and I think this would be such a great
way to experiment with these if you've
never tried them or if you have tried
them and just want to have some backups
on hand I think that's great as well I
don't have that particular kit but I do
own every element of that kids that have
bought individually and I think the
value is spectacular there are many
great blending sponges out there I mean
I'm raved about Real Techniques and
different ones one from NYX I think is
awesome so a regular Beauty Blender is
great as well I love that they've also
paired that with two other totally great
things to try this is the Beauty Blender
blusher by the way I've used all these
today so they are totally like saturated
they're at their fullest point but this
is great for a cream contour a cream
blush some people may even prefer this
size for concealer or larger you know
areas right here on top of the cheekbone
the micro mini I will stand behind
this is one of the gentlest ways to
blend out your under-eye concealer if
you're very very paranoid about that
fragile skin getting pulled around with
different brushes or your fingers use
this I squared is the most like fragile
little way to deal with that under-eye
area and still blend out your concealer
and still maintain some coverage because
this is so lightweight I do find these
sponges to be durable they clean up well
I use my solid cleanser to clean all my
sponges and I think it does a really
fantastic job so when I saw that that
kit was out there I thought oh my gosh
what a great sampler set what a great
way to see if you like these and not
spend an arm and a leg on each one
individually and then the last thing
that I would recommend
Arbeit lipsticks I think vite really has
the cream lipstick formula down pat in
terms of a luxurious really really
creamy comfortable lipstick their
amuse-bouche formula is awesome how is
it different from Besame well Besame is
like I said very focused shade wise and
they're going to have a lot of reds and
not a lot in the you know maybe more
trendy shades or the nude sight is going
to have you covered more in that way
also with the Besame lipsticks with a
lot of those especially if you do the
blot technique and even just applying a
lot of them as is they verge on a matte
or nearly matte appearance on the lips
they just don't have a lot of shine to
them and they can feel a little thicker
as a result of that is from by are going
to have more shine they're going to just
feel like there's more moisture on the
lipstick as you rub your lips together
after you apply one of these it's going
to feel on borderline like balmy if
you're interested in maybe a little
wider shade range you're not so serious
about the reds and you really like that
ultra moisturizing feel you might be
interested and I like their little duo's
that they've got I have been especially
impressed with one that I got recently
and these are minis by the way this one
is rhubarb and Sissel rhubarb you know
we're talking about a great wearable
kind of mulberry there I think that
could be anybody's like workday
beautiful lipstick and then it comes
with a little bit more of a trendy color
and sizzle which is like this grayish
mauve and I like them both
then they've got another duo you can
choose from as well but I think that's a
great way to sample what bite has to
offer so if you are shopping this sale
and you were trying to get some ideas of
what some good purchases might be there
you go those are my five things that I
think are totally no-fail products
things that I think anybody would enjoy
in their collection get a lot of use out
of be so impressed with quality wise yes
what more can I say
they're awesome thank you guys so much
for your time definitely look for more
updates on the Beauty room and a little
bit of a tour video I will probably put
that together soon and I will see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
