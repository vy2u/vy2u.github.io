this video here I'm going to explain
five products that I regret buying so if
you're having kind of an angry day this
is going to be sort of like a rant
videos so you're gonna enjoy this I
don't know sometimes it's just fun to
like show you the other side of makeup
products I don't really like because so
often you get top favorites and
recommendations and stuff but I mean
that information doesn't always do you
so much good is knowing what to
absolutely stay away from as well and of
course this is just my perspective so if
you have these products and you like you
totally love them you know don't be
insulted by what I'm saying it's just
basically that it didn't work for me it
may work for you guys so I'm not saying
by all means don't try it but it just
didn't work for me so anyway um let's
get started the first product that I
regret buying is the hard candy
ginormous lash volumizing mascara it
comes in this really cool tube I love
all their packaging by the way because
it's just very intricate it's got these
neat little designs there on it and I
mean it's just it's just neat this is a
nice big tube I just kind of thought oh
wow and a little picture look at this
little gals lash here you know that
looks awesome you know I would love for
my eyelashes to look like that and you
take it out and you've got a rubber
brush mascara it's sort of long like
lash blast but yet it's not quite as fat
the little bristles are a little bit
shorter and they've become practically
like non-existent out towards this end
and what the problem is for me is that
the formula of this mascara is just so
wet I feel like I put it on in my lashes
just kind of team up they make like five
teams and all I see is like five lashes
but it's like they've all clumped you
know you've had that happen before where
it's like the mascara just instead of
making you look like oh you've got a
zillion thick lashes you've got like
five eyelashes on there and so I just
thought for the claims that's made to
really plump and thicken your eyelashes
I was like it didn't do that at all and
I wasn't really willing to you know try
this repeatedly to see if
would like it once it got a little dryer
or something but I did keep it around
just in case I did one of these videos
and that's another thing they're gonna
be products that I have thrown away over
time that I probably really didn't like
but I kind of forgot you know so like
I'm doing this video and there's
probably other things that I would have
included if I had them on hand but I
only wanted to talk about things that
could show you but anyway this mascara
just do not dig it at all you know I
need something that's going to really
really make my lashes look big and this
did not do it next product I regret
buying is the NYC concealer in green
it's one of those little like lipstick
tube concealers it's called cover stick
it's green in color and I know Green is
supposed to counteract redness some
people swear by this kind of thing you
know some people think I mean this is
their go-to concealer for you know
getting rid of red blotches on their
face but I have like a little redness
around my nose and I felt like when I
used it it just did not blend at all
like even putting foundation over it and
kind of blending out that way like it
just still looked green you know it did
not cover up what it was supposed to
cover just look like a little green
blotch so it's like we know what's the
lesser of two evils would you rather
have a red blotch or a green blotches
but like I said this works for some
people and maybe it's the quality of the
product as well I'm not sure somebody
had suggested when they heard I wasn't
happy with this they said use it as a
green eyeshadow base I haven't tried
that yet but I may but I just really
that did not work for me at all as a
concealer there okay here's a product
that I did a big review on and I was not
happy with it at all if you've watched
my videos for a long time
chances are you've seen this one it's my
review on the Revlon Colorstay mineral
foundation and I know this is a little
weird because I like so many Colorstay
products
I like the mineral lip glaze I like the
foundation I like the powder the
eyeshadow the eyeliner all that stuff
but this thing just was awful
for me um first off what's up with this
this is tiny
seriously can't put your foundation on a
bet and it's scratchy too scratchy and
small very weird
why wouldn't I mean just give me a
little container and let me use my own
brush you know and and this it's like
you you're supposed to swirl it in here
and then put it on and this little tub
is what holds the foundation I didn't
really like the finish that much of the
foundation or the staying power so it's
just all around from the application to
just the way the whole product is put
together to the way the product actually
works I was just not happy with it at
all so I mean it's kind of rare that
happens with a lot of Colorstay stuff
but yeah the colors say mineral
foundation guys there are so many really
good mineral foundations out there and
that just does not compare next thing is
another face product and it's from ELF
and it's the little elf pressed powders
that they have for a dollar it's not the
studio stuff it's just the $1 powders
this is called clarifying pressed powder
comes with a little puff and that's like
downright orange I mean it's it I don't
know if it's showing up like that on
your screen but this looks like the
exact shade of a peach Crayola crayon
and my skin does not look like that and
it's got obvious like filler in there
like I don't know how close I can get it
or how well we can make that show up but
do you see like the little particles and
that it's like it's not just a pure
shadow and that is not really shimmer
either it's just like little filler
ingredients I don't know maybe if you're
having it like to let a little kid play
with this product that might be cool but
once again I just it did not work for me
skin tone wise and just coverage wise
there's nothing really about this that I
love there's no mirror on it either I
mean that's one of my big things with
compacts I need to have that mirror so I
can keep it in my purse and I can
and myself but yeah that just did not do
it for me and now the ultimate like
super bizarre thing that I bought I
don't know why I thought this would work
but I bought it quite a while ago on
cherry culture and I think I was saving
it for the video like this and it's from
a musee it looks like I'm used but
somebody told me it was em you say yeah
but they're like these little 50-cent
mood lipsticks yes this is the mood
lipstick if you have never seen one
before it apparently has vitamin C in it
but anyway it looks like this it looks
like a total like toy product but you
put this on and I also have a yellow one
yeah it was that bad I bought not one
but two not having any clue about these
this looks an orange and this one looks
like purple they both show will show up
on your lips as bright bright pink like
an intense deep pink and it like stings
your lips it won't come off
like it really really stays on there to
the point where it's like you really
regret putting it on so not only do I
regret buying these but I regret ever
putting it on because it was just like I
don't know maybe my mood was so bad when
I put these on that it turned like a
really resistant color that did not want
to come off my lips because it knew I
was angry I don't know I'm probably
reading way too far into that but I do
not like these mood lipsticks would--but
so while I'm not trying to push my
opinions too much on you with the rest
of the stuff I would say do not buy
these okay all right that's a hope for
my products that I regret buying I mean
I'm sure there's more out there
somewhere but this these are just the
five that I really thought you needed to
know about so thanks for watching this
video guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
