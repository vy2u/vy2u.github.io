hello to the viewers or readers from the
Ladies Home Journal blog gloss daily
this blog was recently relaunched and
I'm one of the contributors to that and
so I'm really excited to be doing that
and this is one of those posts that's
going to be featured on the blog so hi
to any new viewers I hope you enjoy this
video it's all about five really simple
strategies to revamp your makeup routine
first thing I want to talk about is the
way we do concealer and let's say you're
just applying it on and then blending it
in with your fingers it always seems to
be a fine line between actually blending
it into your skin and sometimes removing
a lot of the product and then what
happens you go back and apply more more
and more products say under the eye area
does not look so attractive so you want
to use the minimal amount of product
possible but still get a great blend so
here's what I did I'm using for today
the covergirl and Olay concealer balm
it's a really nice texture nice coverage
and then I'm using my Sigma P 80 brush
and it's got kind of a flat top there
it's nice and small and it's very soft
and dense and I use that to actually
blend in the concealer around my eyes
and I love it because it gives just the
lightest amount of pressure possible and
so it blends the product in but it still
keeps the coverage there sometimes it's
tough with your fingers to you know
apply too much pressure or it's kind of
inconsistent and you don't always get
the perfect coverage feel like I always
get the perfect coverage with this tool
next up common makeup problem is
highlighter on your face I feel like a
lot of times we see these shimmery
highlights and I know I always think
that's a magnet for pores that's a
magnet for fine lines I've been finding
several that don't pack in too much
shimmer and they give your face light
without looking like a disco ball so one
that is great is the wet and wild color
icon bronzer it's a line of bronzers but
this is the lightest one and the shade
is reserve your cabana perfect shade for
highlighting through the eye area you
can get up on top of your cheekbone down
your nose middle
of your forehead right above your upper
lip you're going to find so many ways to
use this and it's going to brighten the
face but not attract more attention to
those little problem spots you might
have so love how this doesn't create any
sort of white cast on the skin or make
you look ghostly it's really very user
friendly and you get a lot of product
here on the topic of brightening a very
small area on the face that I think you
should brighten up because it makes a
big big impact is your waterline if you
choose not to line it with say a black
eyeliner maybe you're not going for a
smoky look and you just want to look
wide-awake it's an area that can
sometimes develop a little bit of
redness especially if you're tired so
there are some nice liners that you can
put in your waterline and brighten them
up a little bit
one is Tarte emphasized that's the one
I've been using for a while but recently
I discovered a lower-cost alternative
which is always great and this is the
Rimmel scandaleyes liner in nude and so
basically just run it right in your
waterline it takes no time at all and it
totally neutralizes any redness that
might be if you've got an early morning
I think that's a perfect fix for tired
eyes also on the eyes a product I've
been loving lately is a lash primer I
feel like it's something I can use with
multiple different mascaras even
mascaras I turned out to not like too
much but it can give me added length and
added thickness to my eyelashes so a
really great one is the Tarte multiply
I've been using this a lot it looks kind
of strange because it is totally white
but I like to just coat my lashes with
this I curl them first then I put on a
coat of this just make sure all your
lashes have sort of that white coating
on them I let it dry and then I apply
black mascara as usual I notice added
length added thickness it's just like a
great boost to any mascara and if you're
looking for more of a two-in-one effect
plus something that's lower cost
I love L'Oreal double extend mascara
I've used this for years but it has your
primer on one end and your black mascara
on the other finally a little trick for
lips this is so easy I just had to share
it I've been doing it for years and that
is really highlighting the center of
your lower lip it gives you the instant
look of fullness no
uncomfortable plumber's required it's
very easy so like for example today I'm
using my Revlon lip butter in pink
truffle as my base color so I just put
that all over my lips just like a
lipstick as usual and then you want to
grab any kind of gloss that really has a
reflective quality to it something
that's definitely lighter than the lip
color you have on the one that works
with pretty much any lip color even the
light light nude ones is this Revlon
Super Lustrous lip gloss and foiled it
really captures the light it just takes
a little just put it on the center of
your lower lip and you will see fullness
and it just really brightens up the face
too so there you go guys just 5 little
tricks or changes ways you can revamp
your makeup routine that they're
extremely quick very easy to feel like
they can really step up your overall
makeup look so thank you so much for
watching again to all the viewers coming
from the Ladies Home Journal vlog gloss
daily and I'll see you again next time
