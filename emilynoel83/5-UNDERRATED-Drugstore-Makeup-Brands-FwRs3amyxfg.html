well today I wanted to talk about one of
my favorite aspects of makeup and that
is the sort of underrated products in
this case some brands as a whole that I
think are kind of underrated or maybe in
some cases it's brands that haven't
always been so great but they're kind of
on the rise and I think their brands to
watch out for I remember way way back
when I started doing YouTube at first
and I remembered there not being a ton
of content out there about drugstore
products yes there was a time when that
was the case and so though I saw that as
kind of a void that I wanted to fill and
I loved that to this day and even now
after all these years and you know
millions of other youtubers I still
think there are some drugstore brands
out there that are somewhat under the
radar so I just thought I would
highlight some of those brands in this
video and mention some of the reasons
why I think they're underrated it's not
like I'm obsessed with every product
from all of these lines I feel like
every brand has hits and misses but
these are some lines where I really
think they've got some good things going
for them and some things worth checking
out first brand I want to mention is
Mark and that is a brand under you know
avons umbrella and I really don't hear a
lot about this line I know at least I
think it was a couple years back I did a
video mentioning a lot of different mark
products and reviewing them and they
really do have some great quality things
it's not a brand you're going to you
know run right into your drugstore and
get you can buy them online through
Yvonne's website they do have some great
products including some new products
that I am really enjoying including the
lip product I'm wearing today I love
this soft red super shiny product and it
actually leaves kind of a subtle stain
behind and it's called the gloss
gorgeous stay on lip stain and this
shade is called lolly and I have several
of the other shades in this and I think
they're really great they have like that
brush tip applicator so you can really
get precise as you put them on but
they're kind of like a thick gloss I
mean they feel pretty heavy-duty when
you put them on thick from a sticky
perspective but like actually kind of
nourishing onto the lips so I really
like that also they've got these lip
butters the packaging is gorgeous it's
pink with the silvery writing on them
and they're called all butter now
this one's called pop-tart it's just
beautiful bright magenta pink with a
great scent it reminds me of nerds like
you just opened a box of nerds and gave
it a whiff it's like very intensely
fruity but this is a super-duper
pigmented color you can see here in this
swatch so I would like to try it more of
those another cool thing from this line
are the touch and glow compacts and I
have one before that was more like all
bronzy and you couldn't see this one has
some bronze and also some pink tones and
you might look at that and think well
what is that is that a bronzer is it a
blush is a highlight and frankly I think
it's whatever you want it to be I think
this wears really nicely is just an
all-over glowy product like I've got it
you know on my cheeks I think you can
focus in on different areas and get a
little different kind of look but what's
cool these actually squish down almost
rinds me slightly of the color pop
products in that at a light touch it
feels a little bit powdery but then you
press down you're like nope that's
definitely a cream in there another
underrated drugstore makeup brand that I
want to talk about is hard candy and I
do think there are maybe some products
from this line that have gotten a little
bit hyped up but on the whole I don't
hear a ton about them this line does
have so many products I think I've run
into a lot of both hits and misses but
the things that I like I really really
like from hard candy and some of these
are products that I haven't heard
mentioned a lot on YouTube for example
this palette here this matte eyeshadow
palette it's the top 10 trendsetters
eyeshadow collection and the shade is
birthday suit I think I remember talking
about this in a whole like just before
bill was born I did a hard candy haul
and this is a really nice quality matte
palette I am wearing that on my eyes
today love the way they blend they're
nicely pigmented you know for a long
time I've talked about kind of a
shortage of matte palettes from the
drugstore but this one is really worth
looking into for a long time I've
enjoyed their baked products I'm the
baked bronzer / highlight and tiki is
great they've got some nice baked
blushes as well lamo flage foundation a
newer product that I think gives really
surprisingly good coverage but it's kind
of thin and lightweight really glides
across the skin so smoothly and evenly
so I've been super impressed by that oh
my gosh I almost forgot the fierce
effects eyeshadows these are sold and do
and they're like dupes for the
infallible shadows from l'oréal those
sell for I think like around $8 apiece
in most drug stores where I'm at here in
the little two packs you get a couple of
them for I think around five or six
dollars so it's a really great deal
they're very you know creamy smooth
pigmented exact same packaging style
this is the duo and lost-and-found it's
a pink and a purple and then I also have
one that I really like that's kind of an
olive green and a gold that's probably
my favorite one and lastly gotta mention
from hard candy the plumping serum
lipsticks these are so good I do have a
four of you on these and I will link
below to any like all out reviews I have
on any of the products I'm mentioning
but these lipsticks are so creamy
they're soft they're hydrating now they
don't do a lot of plumping that's kind
of the weird thing they don't do the
plumping on me I don't really see that
but they do smooth out the lips
beautifully they have a great I'm just
kind of creamy smooth soft finish a cold
I utilize just like my newest lipstick
obsession I was wearing this in a recent
video it's like very cool like pinky
almost a little bit of lilac in it type
of shade and I think it's gorgeous
another brand that I consider to be
pretty underrated and it's kind of odd
that it is because it's one of the major
lines that shows up and pretty much
every drugstore you go to and its almay
and I'm not just saying that because
Carrie Underwood's their spokesperson
and I have kind of a Carrie Underwood
obsession it doesn't have any bearing on
my decision to include this line and I
have tried some major dud products from
almay over the years but the things that
I like from this brand I really really
like they've got two of in my opinion
the best drugstore mascaras in their
line in the get up and grow formula
that's really great it's a great really
super thick and full brush I also love
the one coat nourishing triple effect
it's one of the driest formula mascaras
that works really well if you've got
sparse lashes it seems to really grab
each and every one so if you've watched
my videos for a while and you may have
remembered me talking about this smart
shade blush this is the shade called
coral a beautiful peachy blush if you're
a peachy blush lover I'm wearing that
too
like I said I've got that Marc product
that's giving me the glow on top of it
it's a gorgeous peach blush I've been
meaning to try the pink one in this line
but this one I definitely love and Alma
is one of those brands that hasn't
rolled out a ton of different lip
products but the things that they do
have I think they've done rather well I
have a specific review on the Express
channel on these new butter kiss
lipsticks these probably rival the
Breville on lip butters I think I like
them as much if not more in terms of the
way these feel on the lips there's a
little added thickness they feel like a
little more hydrating product the ones I
happen to be holding right now I've got
nude light which actually has a little
more color to it than you might expect a
little bit of a rosy tone they're very
media they're all divided up into like
light light/medium medium skin tone
families and then berry light as well
that's a gorgeous pink the liquid lip
balms are nice I really only like the
more vivid shades though like this one
this is called apple a day I think these
are a good product for those who like
shine on their lips but hate the feel of
a standard lip gloss these are really
comfortable now I mentioned at the start
you know there are brands I think that
kind of reinvent themselves and maybe
it's a brand that you thought if they're
not really worth trying they're too
cheap they're too whatever in their
earlier days and I think they've made a
lot of improvements and the line I'm
talking about specifically in that way
is NYC New York color they have really
come a long way in their eyes shadows
their lip products certain face products
I think they've always had some pretty
impressive bronzers NYC sunny bronzer is
great the color wheel bronzer which is
what I'm wearing today is a contour
slash bronzer this is awesome they do
not have a great color selection in
terms of their face products but I do
love the smooth skin bebe radiance
powder I have it in the shade naturally
beige if that works for you if you've
tried this and this is a color match
this is a beautifully textured and crazy
cheap face powder really has like a
creaminess to it I'm very impressed with
that the eyeshadows from this line at
one point in time I remember tossing
these out thinking they are unusable and
I don't think that about a lot of
products but they have gotten so much
better over time the individualized
compacts like there was a time when
these creams
these first came out these creams that
they put in here were so dry they
literally just fell out of the pan like
I don't know what happened and the
shadows were so chalky how they're a lot
better and this is the Midtown mauve set
that I think you would like if you like
the rosy burgundy looks anytime I'm
wearing this bronzed in Brooklyn trio in
a video I get a ton of questions about
it it's got brown a beautiful bronze and
a nice creamy shade and I have loved
also this city proof I base this is like
a solid version of an eye primer and I
have been using this all the time like I
reviewed it already on the Express
channel but I love using this because I
think it's so quick and easy for a quick
base I was in some crazy hot humidity
and this past weekend for an outdoor
graduation and I used this and my eye
shadow did not go anywhere for lip
products a couple things you might want
to check out are the expert last
lipsticks these are really pigmented to
try to get a close look at the finish
because some of them are straight-up
creamy and they're just glorious and I
think there are others that have some
shimmer I'm not a big frosty lipstick
person myself but if you are you might
like those but this shade for example is
called air kiss and it's a beautiful hot
pink and my fifth and final underrated
drugstore makeup brand that I'm going to
mention in this video is up and up for
the brushes from Target that is
basically a store brand line and these
brushes are so great I mean they're
quickly becoming one of my favorite
brands for brushes and they're so
inexpensive and I just love the
accessibility there's something to be
said for being able to just waltz into a
Target store and find some great brushes
I've talked about this buffing
foundation brush it's awesome it's
seriously so great for blending out on
liquid foundations their blush brush my
current favorite blush brush just really
Pat's on just the right amount of color
love the shape love the cut and these
are so crazy soft as well they've got a
nice little concealer brush duo here
they're great for padding and product
around the eyes small areas around the
nose and more recently I decided to try
out their I brush duo because I realized
everything that I tried from this line
has been a face brush but I love these
eye brushes as well in that brand it's
definitely not underrated
in terms of what's coming from my
channel because I talk about those
brushes all the time I think they're
kind of at the tip of the iceberg in
terms of getting recognized and noticed
by the masses but I think those are
really great brushes so those are in my
opinion five of the best underrated
drugstore makeup brands and just some of
the products that I would recommend from
each line and as I was thinking about
doing this video I thought you know
drugstore brands have really grown over
time in terms of getting talked about a
lot on YouTube I mean elf gets a lot of
buzz these days NYX wet and wild for
their eyeshadows and then your Biggie's
like L'Oreal Revlon Maybelline I think
get talked about a whole bunch just
because they're so massive they're
everywhere and they put out a lot of
products it was on the cusp of
mentioning Jordana in this video but
they have put out recently quite a few
new things that I haven't gotten to play
with just yet so I thought I'll wait on
that and see how many hits and misses
are among that group of things and some
things that I think are brands to watch
some brands that I personally want to
dive into a little more and you know
maybe if I do this video again some of
these brands might get mentioned but
prestige Palladio or Palladio I know
there are some hidden gems in those
lines that I've tried but I kind of want
to try more from those brands to be able
to get a better feel for what's going on
but you know me I live for the diamond
in the rough a drugstore undiscovered
underrated makeup product so I hope you
enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed
making it let me know what you think are
the most underrated drugstore makeup
brands I would love to hear in the
comments section and thank you so much
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
