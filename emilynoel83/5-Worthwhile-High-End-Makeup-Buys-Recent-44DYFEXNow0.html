joining me for this video and this is
going to kind of spotlight some recent
purchases that I have made that have
really worked out for me they are all
high-end items and I've actually had
some high-end duds recently as well so
if you guys are interested I could also
do that side of things so again these
are all things that I've purchased
myself they have not been sent to me by
the companies I think it's interesting
to hear things from that perspective too
because it's like these are things that
I was interested in enough to pursue to
buy them and then they ended up working
out for me actually so I feel very
strongly about these things I've had
really good experiences with them I
would really recommend them and there
are other things that I bought and tried
recently that I've liked or I've thought
you know it works well enough for me or
might work well enough for this specific
person with this specific skin type and
whatever that's this little hair doing
out there just kind of um but these are
things that I actually think are a
little more Universal and being able to
work for so many people so let's just
jump in already and talk about them
first thing that I think I'm just loving
so much is this ah Nastasia shadow
couture world traveler palette and
pretty on the outside but even prettier
on the inside I really love what's
happening here with this color selection
because I feel like they packed in some
really like quality neutrals especially
if you like the warmer neutrals there's
a lot of that in here and then just some
really fun pops of color as well and
there pops of color that really show up
now I remember when the amrezy palette
came out and I got that one like just at
the tail end I think when it was on sale
and there's a shade in there that I
loved called Morocco and lo and behold
Morocco is in this one too so it's a
very pretty terracotta color I love
fudge this nice matte brown for my look
today I'm wearing as you're all over the
lid so that's a really pretty like royal
blue adds kind of a satiny finish
I put fudge in the deepest part of my
crease which blended surprisingly well
on you know blue is kind of a hard shade
to sometimes blend out and make it
workable but putting fudge right in the
crease and then blending up above that
with a blend of soft peach and Morocco
both shades or mags are awesome to mix
because you can get
just the amount of softness you want
like if you want Morocco's show up in a
very subtle way just mix soft peach with
it pink champagne can look downright
like wet it's one of those kind of
metallic colors that just looks like
there is moisture on the skin so that's
really pretty going around the inner
corner and then I have a little bit of
fudge in Morocco again these two shades
just smudged on the bottom but there are
so many like very directions you could
go with this palette because then you
look at this awesome like kind of
yellowish I don't know it makes me think
of a little bit of that greenish color
that I love in the Too Faced romantic
eye palette it's that kind of metallic
and pistachio green you've got this
great matte black in here noir which is
not playing around that is super black
so I just think the pigmentation is
really great in this palette the variety
of finishes is really fun to work with
and I have also loved the brushes that
come with these I actually keep out the
one that came in the amrezy palette it's
another double-ended brush and I like
them because they're not oversized both
fat brush and the one that comes here in
this palette are very manageable you
know even if you've got small eyes this
is kind of a hybrid between a smudgy
brush slash smaller crease brush so
that's nice and then you've got this
perfect blending brush here so I think
fabulous value for what you're getting
really fun shades I'm so happy with that
palette and to be honest with you I had
a hunch I was gonna really enjoy that
palette before I even got it this next
thing is also an eyeshadow palette but
it was more of a surprise it's the ombre
Rouge palette from Becca and I know
there was an ombre I think it was called
ombre nude that has been out for a while
now with that I just didn't really feel
like I needed it but with this one two
shades in particular really spoke to me
when I saw this on line one was this
really nice it looks so basic but I mean
on the eyes blend it out sheared out it
looks great it's kind of like a soft
little bit warmish Brown really solid
Brown as my sister Pope would say a good
honest Brown and then this nice deep I
thought it was a burgundy shade it's
actually described as a dark plum I
think on the website but this is one of
those shades that can look just really
deep and dark if you pack it on
but if you want to wear it in a more
sheared out manner you will see more of
that dark berry plummy type tone come
out a bit more so I love that everything
in here is matte with the exception of
this shade here which is really
interesting this is so like I don't know
how to describe I was wearing this on my
lid recently and that's why I chose to
wear the Anastacio palette today because
I was wearing this one in a recent video
so I'll be able to pop up you know what
I was doing with it but this little
second color here it's so confusing
because you look at it in the palette
you think oh it's just like a light pink
but really um when it's not hitting the
light see how much more of a deeper like
mauve tone it takes on but then when it
catches the light you know there is some
light pink there and the reason why it's
doing that is because it does have that
little bit of a sheen it's a very
interesting shade I really like it as
the all over the lid shade with this
palette it's very brightening really I
love the way it plays alongside these
other three this color right here in the
crease it's like you've got your warm
and your cool
natural crease shade options here and I
even like to use both of them maybe put
that in the crease blend that lightly
above put that darken the outer corner
or smudge it out for a smoky eye and
then this shade this is like my skin
blender type color it does not swatch
like on my hand very intense but
seriously like buffs out these other
shades back into my skin tone so
flawlessly so I really like that it's
like the most natural highlight shade
zone with darker skin that maybe more of
a pop of highlight you know but for me
it just really I like the way it meshes
right back into my skin tone eyeshadow
wheelhouse really I'm loving warm Browns
mixed in with burgundy plum type colors
and that's exactly what this palette
does so I'm loving that this next thing
not as recent of a purchase compared to
the other things I'm talking about in
this video but I think that's a good
thing because it's a foundation so I
definitely have had some more experience
with this and able to tell you with
certainty that it hasn't had any like
negative effects on my skin or cause
breakouts or anything like that and it
is my Mac Pro Longwear nourishing
waterproof foundation I wear this in the
shade NC 30 whenever I
have this on like if I'm on snapchat on
a random day you know I feel like I get
asked what foundation was that that you
had on this is an oil-free foundation it
is crazy long wearing for me yet it
doesn't dry me out and I was a fan of
the original Pro Longwear but you had to
work more quickly to blend it in didn't
look quite as natural on the skin just a
little bit heavier feel this one manages
to feel lightweight not over drying just
like a perfect skin balance type texture
for me it's described on the web site as
being medium to full coverage and I
completely agree with that
I do think it's buildable as well you
can add just a little bit more and you
will see increased coverage but not a
really increased heaviness in the
appearance I mean this has just been a
really great foundation for me and I
feel like in the summertime you know
heat humidity it's been able to stand up
to those factors for me very well I know
I recently reviewed the Born This Way
Foundation from Too Faced over on the
Express channel and I mean I think
staying power is probably what sets this
one apart from that that one on my skin
I have normal skin
I do enjoy the Born This Way Foundation
because I think it has a really pretty
finish this has a nice finish too and I
like that it's matte but again something
about it doesn't feel as heavy on my
skin as traditional pro longwear or you
know my Estee Lauder Double Wear even if
you like a matte foundation and coverage
is more your priority I would steer you
a little bit more toward Estee Lauder
Double Wear as I think that goes a
little further than this foundation in
that regard but they're about equal for
me in terms of staying power great
longevity throughout the day still
looking fresh at day's end that's what
I'm talking about love this while we're
talking Mac and I have a lipstick that I
got very recently that I am so pleased
with and it's probably a lipstick a lot
of you have or a lot of people have been
interested in getting these days because
I know there's that massive Kylie Jenner
popularity with the world lip liner I
actually own that lip liner to it I
don't own that many Mac products but
I've gotten were like a long long time
ago and I do like it but what I wasn't
aware of was that there is a world
lipstick it's a matte finish lipstick
and looks like this it's kind of a deep
dusty rose
website described it dirty rose but this
product did remind me that Mac does
matte lipsticks really well and he'd
really annunciate on this one I wasn't
questioning the color payoff at all but
just you know the where the the comfort
level on the lips I do think this feels
nice and creamy going on the color
transfers really nicely glides on nicely
and I don't feel like it's skipping
across my lips as I apply it let's just
feel nice while I'm wearing it you know
they don't feel overly dried out and I
know everybody and their brother is
coming out with a matte liquid lipstick
these days but then Mac's over there
putting out matte lipstick since the
beginning so I like the formula number
one I can really enjoy a shade but if
the formula sucks I'm not going to want
to wear it so that's definitely a point
in this products favor and then I really
enjoy the color also I've actually been
doing a few other things this morning
been drinking some coffee I feel like
the color is slightly worn down at this
point and I actually love it right here
at this state there aren't a lot of lip
products where I'm like oh I like it
equally as much as when it's freshly
full-on applied and when it's had a
little chance to wear down and I think
this really looks good under both
circumstances probably because it
reminds me of like my own lip color but
deeper this shade is also fun to mix in
with other colors in my last video I was
wearing this with my Too Faced melted
nude and it just kind of lightened it up
a little bit and I liked that effects
but I want to show you like if you put
it on and wear it you know thick full-on
color that's what it looks like so this
is a little bit deeper than where it's
at right now on my lips which is just I
don't know maybe 30 40 % worn down just
a little more lightness happening on my
lips at this stage and you could get
there immediately if you just wanted to
apply this and then give it a quick blot
onto a Kleenex and I just like this
softened up state of this color the best
finally my number 5 worthwhile high-end
makeup purchase is my Too Faced beach
bunny and to demonstrate this in my lazy
day makeup because this product went in
like five different directions this was
my bronzer contour blush highlight and
eyeshadow and you'll see why here cuz
it's got these various strips of color
in it
anytime you see a product like this you
know it at least has the potential to be
a little more versatile than just one
all over the face color and I won't go
too in depth here because I feel like
that video really um described and
demonstrated this product best these
shades have a little glow to them but
they're not too much the most shimmery
strip would be the golden one and that
will definitely add a little glow to
your skin it will definitely show up and
pop if you want to wear that on your
eyes but you've got deeper shades on the
outside that really aren't all that
shimmery and those can be great to
deepen an eyeshadow look but this is
really designed to be a bronzer so I
like it as an all-over just warm up the
skintone I'm wearing that today a little
bit down in here a little bit around the
hairline a little bit on the decollete
love it so very worthwhile product there
as well that I think would work for a
lot of people so those are my five that
I wanted to share with you again it's
kind of like a whole because these are
all somewhat recent purchases and just
things that are versatile that a lot of
different people would like and things
that I definitely really liked and I
just thought they were deserving a
specific mention in this video so hope
you guys are having a great day and I
will talk to you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
