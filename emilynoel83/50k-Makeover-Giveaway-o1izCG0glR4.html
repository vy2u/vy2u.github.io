tuning in for this video and really
thank you so much for being a subscriber
to my youtube channel beauty broadcast
because it has earned more than 50,000
subscribers more than 50,000 people have
said I want to be regularly updated when
you know new videos come out and that
sort of thing and I just think that's
fantastic I think it's amazing
phenomenal and I really just have you
guys to thank for that because it's
really your ideas your feedback and
input and requests and things like that
that keep giving me new material new
ideas and and makes me continually want
to put out a new video as often as I
possibly can so thank you so much for
your contributions I think this channel
is really a reflection of what and you
all have told me you want to see and the
help that you think you need or the
advice you think you want on various
makeup related things so thank you thank
you so much i really i really really do
appreciate that you guys would take the
time to watch these videos that i put
together here in my little makeup area
of my room in my apartment so thank you
so very much and in part a small way i'm
going to try to thank you guys is by
doing this fun contest which i'm calling
it my 50k makeover giveaway and this was
suggested to me by someone on my
Facebook fan page and they said why
don't you do a personalized makeover for
one of your subscribers and instantly I
mean a light bulb just went on and I
thought that that is it that's what I
have to do I love this concept so
basically you need to be a subscriber so
make sure that you are if you take part
in this and to enter here's what you
need to do it's really not too
complicated but I'm going to go through
everything that you need to know I mean
the email beauty broadcast contest at
gmail.com that's a specific special
email address i've set up just for this
contest please don't email my other
address just go to this one this is
where it will count as an entry okay so
email that include your youtube username
in the email and title it's you know
like a 50k makeover giveaway and
basically what i need
for you to give me is a short sort of
description on either why you think you
deserve a makeover or you know maybe
it's not that you necessarily need to
make over maybe you watch my channel and
you're quite comfortable with makeup and
you just like trying new things maybe
you'd like to see what I would do if I
could give you a makeover or maybe you
just like say really want to try a super
dramatic look or maybe you want me to
give you a news anchor thank you forgot
I don't know you know just tell me what
you want and and what kind of look
you're looking to achieve what your
goals are could you also tell me what
your skin type is if you have any sort
of problem skin issues what sorts of
colors do you usually wear and I just
kind of want to know as much information
as you can tell me about you and about
what your makeup habits are are you kind
of stuck in a makeup rut are you a mom
that's at home that you know really
wants to spice things up and try a
completely different makeup look than
what you're doing the other thing that's
really going to help me help me with
this is if you send me some pictures I
want no more than three photos so
between one and three photos at least
one of them without makeup on so you
might give me one with a bare face and
then maybe one of just your typical
makeup look so I kind of have something
to go off of that would be really
helpful I asked for no more than three
because I just don't want the inbox to
fill up too much I hope I hope lots of
people submit their pictures that's what
I'm going for um but the entry deadline
so the last day that I will be accepting
your emails on this for this as an entry
to this contest will be april fifth
that's a monday that's this coming
Monday and yeah don't email me more than
once also it's just it's not gonna like
you're going to score any extra points
or something by emailing me multiple
times so yeah basically that's it I want
an email I want a description about what
what's your skin like what's your what's
your normal makeup routine like and
where do you want to go from here what's
the look you're going for and I'm going
to then create a tutorial based on what
you've told me what your goals are i'm
going to pick 1 i'm a pic it at random i
mean i'm not exactly sure what the
criteria is i'm going to use because i
really don't know what
kind of response i'm going to get on
this and i may do more than one or i may
do one you know it's right at the onset
and then i may save some a few that i'm
going to do down the line but here's the
awesome second part of the prize not
only are you going to get a tutorial
that's live in public for everyone to
see from me that's all about you and
your makeup needs and i'm going to
basically yes i am going to be doing the
tutorial on my face but i'm going to
show you step-by-step what I think you
should do for your makeup and then I'm
also going to go out and get you all of
the same items that I used in that video
and I'm going to send them to you so
you've got all the stuff you know
readily at your fingertips then that you
can use to do the tutorial on yourself
so I'm hopefully supplying you with not
only the skills and ideas for from the
tutorial but also the actual items that
make up that you can use so thank you
thank you so much to all the subscribers
out there I really value all of you so
much and thanks to all who not only you
know subscribe here but you're on
Facebook Twitter all those things
corresponding with me letting me know
what you want out of this channel and I
hope I hope you can participate in this
like I said you don't have to be someone
that just I mean maybe you don't know
much amount makeup and that'd be great
this would be a great opportunity for
you to get a really you know possibly a
neat look out of the deal but maybe
you're really skilled with makeup but
you're just curious to see what I might
do or you want to try a totally
different look just let me know like i
said this isn't this isn't hair this is
just all about makeup i don't know i
might give some hair tips as well like i
said it kind of depends on what I see
out of this but thank you again so much
thanks for tuning in for this video and
I hope to hear from you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
