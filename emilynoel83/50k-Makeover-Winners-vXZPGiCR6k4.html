me for this video I am so so excited to
tell you who won my 50k makeover
giveaway and basically the way this
whole thing worked if you're just now
tuning in just now found out about my
videos I reached 50,000 subscribers not
too long ago and I wanted to do a really
special contest where I could help
people develop certain makeup looks
through doing a tutorial that is
customized for them and then I will send
them on go out and buy the products that
used and send them to them and that's
kind of like their prize package really
allowing them to easily duplicate the
look that I sort of designed for them so
I'll obviously be in the tutorials doing
the look on myself but it will be
totally with them in mind with their
needs their skin care needs their makeup
needs and things like that taking into
consideration so this was given to me as
an idea by someone on my beauty
broadcast Facebook page I am so grateful
because I think this is a great idea i
had hundreds and hundreds of entries I
read every single email and I opened up
every single picture that was sent to me
and I didn't delete any of them because
i really think that i'm going to use
these as inspiration for future
tutorials so you know while these may be
the winners you know of this contest i
still may use you know pull certain
people out and and sort of use them as
to get some ideas for where I want to go
with a particular tutorial because I was
so touched by some of the difference
stories a lot of you shared a lot about
yourselves you know the reasons why some
of you wanted makeovers isn't just to
you know look great but it was really
about a confidence factor as well and I
just thought I mean I just felt like I I
was so inspired as I read through these
emails i kept telling tyler like oh my
gosh this is amazing i want to help so
many of you like I really if I could do
this for everyone I would but I was only
going to initially pick one winner
before I got all these entries in and I
was able to narrow it down to three
winners so I'm really glad that I'm
going to be doing this I hope you enjoy
the tutorials that will be coming in the
coming weeks
for now this video is just kind of an
announcement of the winners i'm going to
show you their pictures and sort of talk
about you know what I think would be
good looks for them some good ideas for
where I want to go and maybe in the
comments section you can share your own
thoughts if you if something strikes you
about these individuals that you think
would be really good they all kind of
have unique stories and a little
different skincare and makeup needs for
each one her name is Kirsten and her
youtube name is ki are six seven eight
and what's interesting about Kirsten
story is her husband is a marine who has
overseas in Afghanistan and he is going
to be coming home soon within the next
few months I guess and so Kirsten wants
a really great look to WoW him as soon
as he gets home so how romantic and you
know fun is that so I thought you know
this is gonna be a really fun look for
me to create because I'll get to kind of
have her story in my head and you know
think okay she wants something to really
kind of keep her own look but really
look hot I guess when she when she sees
her husband for the first time in a long
time so she says she's a makeup novice
but she has been learning she says she
typically does a natural look but she
wants to spice it up for this her skin
is normal but is breakout prone so
that's gonna be something I keep in mind
she usually has fair skin she says she
does live in Hawaii so she deals with
sometimes some freckles and things like
that so let's take a look at some of her
pictures and talk about what we wanted
here's a look at Kirsten this is her no
makeup look which I think she still
looks great and she's got let that light
hair fair skin thing going on she says
you know her skin can be a little
sensitive at times I'm really thinking I
want to do something to really get her
skin glowing you know in this picture I
think it's coming out a little washed
out since I am shooting my computer
screen here but as I look at these
pictures I feel like she's got great
skin I think she's got a great palate to
work with for her makeup look but I
really want to kind of build on that and
give it a nice glow so I'm going to be
using some products may be some
highlighters some contouring some
lush some things to really make the face
look radiant I think that's that look
she's going for something really healthy
and nice and I can tell he's a little
more tan in this picture I want to
definitely do kind of a smoky eye I
think this is a real special occasion
type look so I want the eyes to really
pop I think she can work with her eye
shape and really make them appear even
larger than they look now and just just
a really kind of wide awake lifted look
to the face I think it's going to be
really fun to make this look and I made
with a lot of these tutorials do them
like a two-in-one look so i might do
something more subtle something she can
use for on a day to day basis since I
know she's still kind of getting used to
using a lot of makeup and then you know
I'll give her something that can be a
little more dramatic for that special we
have Sarah Beth her youtube name is
loves Edward 19 and she is 13 year years
old and what's interesting about
sarabeth's story is that she has been
homeschooled all her life and starting I
guess this coming fall she will be going
to high school she'll be starting high
school so she'll be going to a regular
school for the first time in her life so
I think that's going to be quite an
experience for her she's also going to
be entering school a year younger than
most of the other people in her class I
guess so um I think she really wants to
build her confidence up and really get a
look that's going to look you know nice
and fresh and polished and you know she
I think she still wants to look her age
but have something that just really
gives her that extra boost because i
know i would need a lot of confidence
you know entering school right at more
traditional school setting for the very
first time you know i could use all the
confidence i could get so i'm excited to
do this look for her um I think she
wants maybe a little more mature look
she does have combination skin so we're
looking at a look for her that's going
to be long wearing that's going to get
her through the school day quick to do
in the mornings and yeah really give her
that added boost that she hears
sarabeth's no makeup look I can tell
she's got some blonde hair going on
maybe with even a little bit of a
reddish hue to it
and I can tell she's got really round
eyes she has a really youthful look to
her face and I think that I can play off
of that keep her natural look but really
give her something that she's gonna feel
confident with for school here she is
with her hair down and here's one with
her hair out of her face with makeup on
she's just got a really a really cute
look and I think I can play off of that
for a everyday look I want to give her
something natural enough that she feels
like she can wear to school and not look
overdone something that's quick and easy
i had a lot of high school age students
submitting pictures for this contest and
i know that they're all kind of going
for something that will make them look
polish before they head out the door but
still make them look really great i
think i'm going to stick with some
neutral color options but if i do a
two-in-one look here i might make one of
it incorporates a little more color
winner is jessica and her youtube name
is Jessa Jessa kina 16 and she's 24
years old and she's a grad student and
she says she likes experimenting with
color and so she's been working with her
makeup for a little while now but she
has a wedding coming up in June so I
have had so many of you the entered this
contest actually did want a wedding look
either you were a bridesmaid or you were
going to a wedding this summer or it was
your wedding and so for Jessica she was
one of the several who do have a wedding
this summer she says she was kind of a
tomboy growing up and she started using
makeup a few years ago so overall it's
still kind of new to her she has normal
skin sometimes oily and she's looking
for that great wedding day look or maybe
a look she could use on her honeymoon so
I'm really excited to give her something
that perhaps you know a look that to a
point could be good for her schooling
you know she's probably eventually going
to be getting out of graduate school and
getting into the working world so you
know you're thinking of those sorts of
techniques but also of course the the
primary focus here is something great
for the wedding so I'm thinking a nice
two in one look here for her something
that is going to give her that great
look for the day of the wedding and then
you know some fun possible you know
other side to that is something fun a
little more colorful maybe for a
honeymoon I don't know I'm really really
excited to do this look for Jessica
because you know your wedding day you
can have so many pictures you really
want it to be a look at last and you
want to really look your best so I'm
really pumped to do this look for Jess
here is Jessica and here she is actually
in her wedding dress I hope her fiance
isn't watching this but and this isn't
her without any makeup on you can see
she's got a little deeper skin tone a
little kind of that tan look maybe sort
of an all of the complexion going on
here but I'm just really excited to do a
wedding look I got a lot of requests for
people wanting wedding looks so I think
this is going to fit a lot of needs and
with this tutorial here but she looks
gorgeous in her dress and I think it's
going to be fun to sort of play up her
exotic features she sort of has an
exotic look to her and I think that's
going to be really fun to play with for
this tutorial she looks a little
different in this picture from the other
one here I think she has a little bit of
makeup on um something I really want to
concentrate on for her wedding look is
really really long wearing makeup you
know if you're going to be getting ready
for a wedding you want that look to
pretty much be locked in for the entire
day so if you're looking for long
wearing strategies I think Jessica's
will definitely be a look that you want
to turn in for tune in for I think
helping with maybe some under-eye
circles things like that will be
something she'll be interested in I
think our complexion just sort of lends
itself to maybe needing a little
correction in that area as does my own
and I think she looked great with kind
of a berry toned lip something to really
just bring out that beautiful skin tone
that she has and she mentioned she
doesn't mind experimenting with color on
her eyes so I think maybe this will be a
wedding look where I give her a little
bit of color or maybe if it's a
two-in-one look I give her the option of
using some more color for her wedding
there you go everyone thank you again so
much to everyone who took the time to
send me an email and enter this contest
like I said I really wish I could do
this
for everyone if I had the time and the
means to do it but I think that these
three that I've chosen are fairly
representative of some of the different
people that entered the reasons you
entered you know special occasion looks
or fun but then I've got you know sort
of an everyday look in here as well I
really encourage you to watch these
videos as they come out these different
tutorials I do for these girls because I
think that they can totally apply to
everyone in one way or another so I'm
really really excited if you didn't win
this time around keep in mind i'm always
doing tutorials so there's hopefully
always something that you can learn from
them and once again I am I was
absolutely touched by your entries your
willingness to tell me about yourselves
and I really feel like I got to know a
lot of my subscribers and I think that
was his side of this contest that I
didn't really think about going into it
but I'm really glad I did this so can't
wait to get going on the tutorials and
pass them on to you thanks so much for
tuning in and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
