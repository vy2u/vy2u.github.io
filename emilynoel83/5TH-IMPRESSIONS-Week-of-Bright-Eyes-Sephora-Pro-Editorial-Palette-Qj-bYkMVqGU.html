welcome to a very wild and colorful week
here on my channel here's what I'm doing
I'm gonna be taking one palette it's a
very colorful palette and I'm gonna be
using only this palette for my eyeshadow
looks all week so you're gonna be
getting five kind of rapid-fire looks
all colorful all bright I will let you
know up front the goal this week for me
personally is not to be perfect but it's
to have fun number one and number two
get out of my comfort zone a little bit
try some different colors just play
around try them out see how it goes and
I hope to encourage those of you who
never really reach for a bright
eyeshadow palette if you could try this
as well with something that's been
lurking in your collection for a while
that you've always felt like it's a
little too much for me you know it's
just fun to play and I feel like we're
on the cusp of a season here with spring
coming up where you might reach for more
color and a little more brightness in
your looks so with this palette I think
it's gonna be a lot of fun what I was
originally thinking about doing was
actually doing a different bright
palette every day but then I thought I
might come away from that and you all
might come away from that feeling a
little bit unfulfilled like you know we
just scratched the surface of several
different bright palettes and you know
that's cool for different looks but what
do you really come away with so here I
thought this could offer a lot of
different looks and I would totally 100%
be open to doing this again with any
eyeshadow palette that you're interested
in you know seeing how versatile it is
and what different things you can get
out of it so thank you guys in advance
so much for watching I hope you like the
looks I hope you like at least one of
the looks yeah thanks for hanging out
with me
okay guys hopping in today one I used my
Tarte shaped tape eye primer all over
the lids and I used the green the
emerald green with a little shimmer all
over the lid just packing it on my
entire lid space with a flat brush and
then I also just use that same brush to
concentrate some of that color in my
crease as well and just pull that upward
ever so slightly this color is very
buildable and I find it can look
anywhere from like a light mint green to
a much deeper emerald and then I used
the matte dark teal beside it and I put
some of that on the outer part of the
lid I worked a little bit of that up
into the crease as well just to add
little bit of dimension to this look and
then up under the brow I decided to
layer a couple of highlight shades I
first used the shimmery light gold and I
thought that might play nicely alongside
the green but ultimately I wanted even
more brightness so I put a little bit of
the matte white right on top of it and
we're gonna be sprinkling in some pink
accents with this look so I used the
pink sort of iridescent highlight shade
up top and I padded that right on the
center of my lid and it was kind of hard
at first for this shade to start to come
through on top of that green but using a
combination of my finger and also a
brush I felt like I could really
concentrate the color in there and
that's not a technique I often go for I
also decided to Pat some of that shade
all around my inner corner next I took a
black liquid liner my Jordana color envy
and black envy a matte black liner all
the way across the upper lash line I
winged it out a little bit and then I
used my Marc Jacobs pencil liner in the
shade blacker really nice intense black
on my lower inner rim and once that was
done I used the black in the palette the
black shadow with an angled brush just
to sort of blend outward from my lower
lash line with a little bit of shadow
there and under the wing as well and
then boom we're going into hot pink
we're taking a smudger brush and just
running this all along the lower lash
line and this is definitely not
something I would usually do but I do
love the pairing of pink and green just
in general I just like to see that
pairing out in the world and I think
it's fun in this lip too and then around
the inner corner I played up that pastel
pink even more kind of overlapping with
the hot pink on the lower lash line
finished off the look with mascara top
and bottom as well as some Ardell
whispies false lashes and the finished
look you know it's fun it's definitely
something totally different for me
I truly love the color combo pairing I
might even like it better if I had done
more pink on the lid and like green
across the lower lash line
I don't know that'd be a fun twist on it
too but we're just playing around we're
just getting our feet wet with this
palette as far as what else I have on my
cheeks I'm wearing my bare minerals Jen
nude blush this is a mini size by the
way that I got from a little Ulta duo
and it's called pink me up my highlight
is from makeup forever it's the pro
light fusion in
zero-one this does have a little bit of
a pinky sheen to it and then on my lips
I went so basic and standard like
alongside this wild eye this is from
L'Oreal it's their new color riche shine
formula in burnished blush I have a
feeling it's only gonna get crazier as
the week goes on thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you tomorrow
day to everybody I decided to take a
kind of yellowy orange in the palette
and use that right there in my crease
get that all nicely blended out and then
I thought I'd bump up the warmth even
more by taking the red that's a couple
shades in and I patted that on the outer
part of my lid and I also kind of gently
work that up into the crease and I
blended with the first crease brush that
I use so everything's now becoming this
nice reddish orange warm tone then I
decided to take the shimmery copper
shade at the bottom of the palette and
this is kind of a unique texture you do
need to take like a bit of a stroke with
it across the lid like a little bit of a
pulling motion because that's what helps
these sort of loose pigments hang
together a bit better I decided to try
to kind of highlight my inner corner and
I first went to the very very light kind
of flaky shimmer in this palette and I
just had trouble controlling that so I
ended up mixing in some of the matte
white which is a complete Rockstar white
shade and kind of the combination of
them both actually seemed to function to
give me that nice inner corner
brightness that I was looking for I
actually decided to intensify my outer
corner with a purpley shade in this
palette as if it wasn't vibrant enough I
decided to use that shade to actually
pull the shape of my shadow more outward
really bringing it almost out to the tip
of my eyebrow area and then blend over
that to kind of soften it up as a soft
highlight under the brow I used the
light golden shade from the top row I
went across my upper lash line with
black liquid liner Jordana color Envy
and black Envy and I did a fairly
substantial wing and then I chose to
actually go under that with a double
wing make it kind of parallel to your
top line and a little bit thinner and
yeah there's just a fun easy twist on
your black liquid liner I used an actual
true white liner in my lower inner rim
today I used the aqua excel from Make Up
For Ever in EM 16 and then I took
another purple shade but I feel is there
really
true matte purple in this palette and I
took that on the lower lash line
underneath the lower wing and just all
throughout that area my end look I'm
feeling like you know go Clemson any
Clemson the house that's what it kind of
turned out to look like truly love the
look think it's so fun I did mascara on
my top and bottom lashes and I used some
gorgeous lashes that my friend Kristen
shared with me they are from SC ito this
is the beautiful little box they come in
it says al2o3 BFF but they're so thick
and lovely and I didn't even trim them I
probably could have looking back because
I'm kind of fueling them a little bit in
the inner corner but these are like for
sure a special occasion lash they're so
thick and thick throughout the entire
like lash line I love them so much Thank
You Kristen on my cheeks I'm wearing my
hourglass blush in diffused heat for a
little bit of highlight I'm wearing
color pops fanny pack and then on my
lips I'm wearing another one of my life
on the dancefloor lipsticks from makeup
revolution this shade is called
invite-only so I first put that all over
my lips i defined the lips a little bit
more with a slightly deeper lip liner
this is mastermind for the l'oreal um
color riche matte lip liner collection
and then for that little pop of shine
that little extra magic that's happening
there on the lower lip I'm wearing angel
tears from Too Faced just the gloss for
this look so yeah super fun thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you tomorrow okay friends day three for
this look I went to the shimmery blue in
this palette well I had some shimmer I
guess maybe it would be best described
just like a satiny finish when worn all
over the lid because I didn't notice a
whole lot of shimmer coming out of this
and I patted it all over the lid and
also slightly into my crease as well
because this is really where I wanted
the depth in my crease to come from for
this look I wanted it to be just kind of
like one bold color focus I also took
some of the matte blue that's right
beside that and I patted some of that on
like the outer part of my lid just to
sort of change the finish a little bit
but both shades really have a similar
intensity and tone to them then I
thought it would be fun to kind of
transition out of this blue with one of
these coppery shadows at the bottom of
the palette so I use that very lightly
just around the border of the look I
thought it complimented the blue really
well and just gave a nice little bit of
neutral to this look
and once I got that all nicely sheared
out I used the white just really lightly
as and under the brow highlight then
thinking about how I was gonna do my
liner for this look I thought I'd do
something a little different by using an
angled brush with the black and I
basically just kind of created my wing
just out of really soft eye shadow and I
thought that was a cool way to go about
it on my lower lashline I did use my wet
and wild ultimate brow highlight and my
lower inner rim and then I used some of
the matte blue and just kind of
connected that up with the black and due
to that overlap I end up with just the
soft bit of navy blue on the lower lash
line but primarily I wanted this to be
just and above the eye simple pop of
color so I finished the look with
mascara top and bottom and some lashes
these are very similar to the red cherry
number 43 style and I'm so happy with
this really because I think it is kind
of wearable color like you have that
peekaboo type pop that effect is really
created so much with the lashes because
looking straight ahead you don't see all
that much color and then I look down
it's like vanjor so I like that and I
think you could do this kind of
technique with so many of the different
color pops in this palette whether it's
the purple or the red or the green this
is just a little more simplified
approach to what can be a very
intimidating Palace so as far as what
else is on my face for blush I have this
pure four in one blush book that I got
recently and so I'm wearing some of the
shade cult passionate huge blush pans
there and then on top of that I'm
busting back into my Becca Chrissy
Teigen palette and I've got sort of a
combo of the two highlight shades for a
little glow there cuz I thought those
would play really nicely with the
coppery color emerging from my eye look
then on my lips I'm wearing the L'Oreal
color riche matte in mastermind very
creamy liner filled in the entire lips
with that and then I topped it all off
with the Urban Decay hi-fi shine gloss
brand new gloss to me and this is in the
shade dirty talk and this has a lot of
like kind of coppery shimmer
I think this pairs beautifully with the
blue eye and I'm excited to play with
another look tomorrow welcome to day 4
after I prime my lids I worked in some
of the matte purple into my crease is my
Sigma e25 brush just windshield wiper
motions back and forth building that
color
just a little bit and then I took the
bright orange e coral and I just wanted
that ever so lightly just hardly any
product on the brush going over the
border of that purple because I just
really love the look of that fade of
those two shades one into the next and
then for a little soft highlight under
the brow pick up a little bit of the
matte white next we're gonna build up a
really fun pastel lid so I'm starting
with a flat brush and the matte white
shade which is a real powerhouse white
in this palette and then I'm going back
to that purple that we originally put in
the crease and I'm going to start
patting that on the outer part of the
lid slightly working inward overlapping
with the white creating this pretty like
slight pastel lilac effect then I
decided to add a little extra depth than
interest with the dark teal so I just
patted that on the very very outermost
part of the lid working just kind of
inward a little bit on top of that
purple just a speck of this shade I
think is really subtle and pretty and I
used a white liner from Make Up For Ever
on my lower waterline inner rim area I
kind of encircled the tear duct with the
matte white and then I took the purple
that has just a little more pink in it
and I started to lay that down basically
on the center part of the lower lash
line then continued outward with that
dark teal shade very lightly just for
some very soft definition on the lower
lash line but then I just curled my
lashes I left this a liner list look and
I use my cosmetic superhero mascara
that's on the top covergirl clump
crusher on the bottom and I am so
pleased with this look I think there are
so many directions you could go in this
palette by taking the white and then
overlapping one of the more intense
shades and getting this whole gradient
of like pastel going on there I love
that now on my lips I wanted a slightly
purple lips so what I did I used my
essence soft contouring lipliner and
going steady which is just a nice deep
kind of ma V berry and then I blended
very lightly on top of that this L'Oreal
infallible paints in lilac lust and this
is a very like full-on lilac color so I
just really lightly blended that across
and created a bit more of a purple vibe
to the lip and then I topped things off
with my angel tears from Too Faced to
give it added shine just an even more
soft and pearlescent quality and my
cheek color again this was just handy
today I used my Chrissy Teigen palette
palette with Becca that has that blush
in there and you
know what my eye look is reminding me of
so much is it not this palette right
here it's not that crazy like I've got
this kind of bluish thing happening
there the pinky purple that's crazy okay
thank you guys so much for watching and
day five will be next
so after priming my lids I patted the
white around my innermost corner and
then I layered on some of the matte teal
shade and this really added a bit of a
pastel effect to this color even more
than it already has just on its own and
so I patted that on a good chunk of the
lid there and then I brought in the
matte like true royal blue and I
overlapped a little bit of that aqua
shade and you might find that you need
to go back and forth sometimes with this
look to build up you know the first
shade that you put on so you don't lose
it too much I added just a dab of the
dark teal also to my outermost edge of
my lid that does go a little bit rich or
a little more intense than the true blue
then using a small brush I use the dark
shimmery plum and I started blending
that just kind of buffing it in little
circular motions into the outer corner
of my eye
bringing it outward some bringing it
upward a little bit because we're going
to kind of play off of plum and fade in
some purple above this whole blue green
thing we've got going so then I took a
small detail brush this is my Sigma e30
6 I went into the bright purple and I
just sort of sheerly buffed that out
around the edge and I thought that gave
a really pretty effect and the addition
of what extra color to this look I used
a little bit of the white as a highlight
right under the brow and then on my
lower lash line I kind of went dark to
light down there using the dark plum
going into the blue and into the light
teal really it's not a super hard look
to execute you just have to make sure
you're maintaining the intensity of
those certain shades when you're working
in so many different ones all at once so
I did a black liquid liner across the
upper lash line and then I popped on
some lashes these are from kiss I'm not
sure exactly what style I think they're
one of those new blowout lashes or
whatever they call them but it's a
really fun look I love that little bit
of what pink enos that's just peeking up
above the eye
my lip color today I'm wearing the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte gloss and
forbiddon kiss I thought it might be fun
to pair something deeper with this eye
for my blush and highlight I'm wearing
colors from the urban decay back top
palette I've got this as a blush blended
in a little bit of this as well and
that's my highlight shade thank you so
much for watching this series I hope you
enjoyed this look and the whole series
of looks and well I realize not every
look is going to be everyone's cup of
tea I mean these are bright eyeshadow
looks the goal for me here this week was
to learn more about this palette have
fun and be a little bit creative not
that you can't be creative with neutral
shadows because you totally can it
doesn't matter what color you're using
you can be exercising creativity even
with very basic looks on a daily basis
but I wanted to get out of my own
comfort zone and that's definitely what
happened this week and I actually
learned about some new color pairings
that I really like I feel like going
into the spring season I'm not gonna be
as scared about integrating certain
colors into my looks and yeah I just
feel like now's the time I really wanted
to do this as far as this palette goes
the Sephora Pro editorial palette
there's a lot of great things happening
in here I really love the quality of the
mattes there are some fantastic shimmers
although there are a couple that are a
little bit frustrating there's a kind of
a flaky white up here and I noticed the
same quality about this sort of
champagne rose gold down at the bottom
they're just a little tricky to build up
I think they'd probably work better if
you wet your brush or you applied them
directly on top of a really tacky primer
but I think if you are makeup artist and
you're looking for a real splash of
color in your kit this definitely
provides that I think it was really
strong with Reds and warmth here
I love the true blues I really enjoyed
that pop of blue on the lid that I did
one day this week but one thing to be
aware of is with the Purple's I got a
lot of use out of these this week but I
find that they really end up looking
like a very pinky purple when you share
them out so if you're hoping that this
really fills a purple need for you it's
not so much in the true purple sense so
you might like supplement this palette
was something like the visi art
amethyst palette perhaps because that
has like a really nice rich plum it has
some more true purpley shades whereas
these kind of veer on the side of
pink but I like that well being a bright
palette you know it wasn't just 100%
matte 100% bright they gave like some
coppers and golds down here some really
I think interesting ways to accent
different looks the white in here is
outstanding that matte white like really
allows you to take any of those shades
and turn them more of a pastel and
there's also a very nice quality black
as well it has a little bit of shimmer
but honestly I feel like it works and
applies like a matte and there's a huge
mirror in here too um I do have the
other two Sephora pro palettes there's a
warm one and there's a cool one and if
you like this sort of idea of testing a
shadow palette for a week I would be
happy to do this again with something
and also just look at other bright
palettes that I have large ones small
ones can I get five different looks out
of them in a week that would be fun to
do as well cuz I really like this kind
of thing and by the way if you're
looking for like more versatility in any
eyeshadow palette you have a great
person to check out is Kristin games she
does something called for looks one
palette and it's a great way to just get
a little inspiration for what you can do
with just one eyeshadow palette and Ike
sometimes you know a palette just makes
a brief appearance on YouTube and maybe
you see a person do one look with it and
then it's gone so yeah this was fun
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
