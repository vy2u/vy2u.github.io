me for this video on today I'm going to
talk about something that was kind of
inspired by a segment I just caught the
tail end of today from on The Today Show
and they were talking about fast fashion
fixes I think and so it just kind of
popped into my head hey how about fast
Beauty fixes and wouldn't it be cool if
they were all from the drugstore so I
have six to talk about today it's about
half makeup related half other
miscellaneous those kind of quick
solutions to makeup related problems or
just thinks it can help you get ready
faster in the morning so first off I'm
going to talk about the spin pins from
goody these are so great i have a whole
video telling you how to use these a
little tutorial demonstrating it but
basically these little bobby pins one of
these does the work of like 20 regular
bobby pins so it's ideal for creating a
bun so if you wanted to gather all your
hair up and then kind of pull it into a
bun down here twist the pins and you
have a cute little side bun in no time
no extra tools are required I mean you
might want to use some hairspray or
something but they're super quick and
easy and I think a bun is a really
finished look anyway like when you get
your hair in a bun you can look very
sleek very professional so this can work
in a lot of settings whether it's a
wedding a party or you know if you're
just really short on time you have to
get ready for your day so the spin pins
are awesome I found mine at walmart so
but I think you can get these online as
well so keep an eye out for that next
thing is for your teeth and i've been
using a whitening product for probably
the past several weeks and it's the arm
and hammer whitening booster found this
product and i think it may have been
walgreens or something but basically
this is just a whitening gel and you can
put it on your toothbrush right along
with your toothpaste so that's why this
is so fast because you can do it in the
same step that you brush your teeth you
just have to open it up squeeze it on
and brush your teeth as usual that's
what it says there on the directions so
i feel like i've gotten good results
from this it's been a long time since
i've used white strips I love the crest
whitestrips advanced seal I feel like
those go on and they don't move around
your mouth at all they stay in place
they work really well but chances are
you're not going to use those constantly
and you do maybe want something in
between times just to maintain your
teeths whiteness couple of toothpaste I
like are like the crest vivid white and
I like the crest with scope outlast
toothpaste but so that's like the
toothpaste i'm using now and then this
is what i put on with it and you can use
it twice a day and i feel like i've
gotten good results so that's another
quick beauty fix there another one is if
you want to look tan and maybe you
haven't been tanning in the sun which is
a good thing or you maybe haven't been
doing any sunless tanning either so
maybe an event comes up all of a sudden
and you want that glow but oh my gosh
how do i get you know just a little more
color on my body in my face well there's
a product that can do both of those and
it's the l'oreal sublime bronze one day
tinted gel for a natural sunkissed look
it's again for face and body I think I
featured this in like a shopping list
ideas video or a hole or something but
this is really great and even if you
have been tanning in some way shape or
form and you just want to boost it up a
little bit this Tintagel goes on really
easily you see where you put it and it
washes off at the end of the day it
washes off when you take a shower so um
if you make a mistake you can easily
correct it but really it's very
foolproof very quick you can put it on
under your makeup if you just want to
give your face sort of a bronzy glow put
it on let it dry it dries quickly which
is really cool um so I just think and
it's an instant tan it says not self
tanning so don't think of this as a self
tanner think of this as a body bronzer
that's going to stay on throughout the
day until you wash it off so very cool
they're very quick fix where that's
concerned making up for you know I don't
know how many days of tanning just in a
nice little bottle like that next I have
three makeup related things the first is
something I always keep in my makeup bag
for work and it is the Revlon makeup
eraser pin and this you'll find I think
kind of ride along with the eyeliners at
the drugstore but what you have here is
kind of like it looks like a
marker but out from this tip you get
sort of a I make up remover basically
that's what this pin is holding and so
if you've got any smudges under your eye
you can just kind of run this along and
get rid of them I do recommend having a
q-tip with you so because this does tend
to leave behind just a little bit of
moisture so keep q-tips in your purse in
your makeup bag or whatever but this is
a great way to not have to carry a
bottle of eye makeup remover and
sometimes just cleaning up that part of
your look can really refresh your whole
face it makes you look tired when
sometimes that liner drags down a little
bit and with sweat and you know all
kinds of things in the summer I think
that's pretty important this time of
year next thing is from physicians
formula and it is the shimmer strips I
have it in Waikiki strip which is the PG
glow bronzer I've used this a lot of
times and basically what you have here
are five different colors and one why is
this a quick fix well it's always
quicker when you can use one product
instead of a bunch of products it also
saves you space in your makeup bag or
your travel kit or whatever but you can
just go to this as your face highlight
you can use these different shades as I
shadows which I've done on numerous
occasions and you also have sort of from
a highlight on the light end to a
bronzer on the darker in so you have
multiple functions with this product and
it's just very quick to use you can
brush a brush all the way through them
or use on different sides of this so I
think it's just a great thing it's
inexpensive and readily available to
people at your local drugstore last
thing is from covergirl and it is the
outlast lipstain the one I have on right
now is this one it's 420 I have
multiples of these because I really like
them this one um it's not quite as pink
as it's appearing on camera it's a
little more like a mob it's a little
more muted color but why is this a quick
fix it's so quick because you can draw
this on your lips you don't need a lip
liner this can be your lip liner I don't
have lip liner on right now I just drew
this on its long wearing as you can see
it's not super shiny unless
wanted to top it off with a lip gloss
but one step and you can be done with
this and you know you it'll last you
through a meal you know you may it's not
going to take you necessarily through an
entire day especially if you've got
things on your mouth if you're taking in
any oils or products like that they have
a salad dressing or something like that
those things can tend to break down a
long wearing lip product even if it
claims to be long wearing but this still
works pretty well I'm pretty impressed
with these pins they're very quick and
very easy so those are my six fast
Beauty fixes I hope you enjoyed them and
I really hope that you will post your
beauty fixes underneath this anything
fast preferably things that are
affordable I know everybody loves that
so post in the comments section I'd be
eager to hear what you all come up with
so thanks for watching guys and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
