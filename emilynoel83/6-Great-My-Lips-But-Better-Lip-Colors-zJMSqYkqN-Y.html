been meaning to do for quite some time
now on my channel and it's all about
those lip products that I think are my
lips but better and I've rounded up six
total three are more of like a lip stick
and three are glosses I guess there's
seven one more little bonus type thing
that I think is everyone's lips but
better but that's really the thing
because we don't all have the same
colored lips naturally some people have
naturally really really pigmented lips
my beautiful college roommate Beth Beth
if you're watching hi I had the greatest
like cherry stained looking lips like a
lot of natural pretty rosy type pigment
to them my lips on the other hand are I
think pretty dull looking without
anything on them they're kind of like a
neutrally sort of mathtype color on
their own or not too bad but if I want
to enhance that natural color I want to
go for some products that you know
aren't taking me too far to the pink
side or too much to the dark side of lip
products but something that just really
takes that natural tone and kicks it up
a notch I love all of these formulas
that I'm going to be talking about so
yay for that I thought a really neutral
option something that goes a little bit
more toward the pink side and then
something that goes just a little bit
deeper
almost berry ish with my selection and I
find that all of these shades really
remind me of my natural lip color but
just you know they're not all identical
a little different take with each one
again I've got three they're more like a
lipstick and three with a gloss type
texture let's get started the first one
is a new thing from L'Oreal I've been
wearing this quite a bit lately like
this has definitely been my most recent
go-to lip product the l'oreal glossy
balm it's a jumbo lip pencil and the
shade is lovely mocha totally totally my
lips but better I mean I thought it from
the first swipe that I put on my lips I
thought really reminds me of my natural
lip color but like a little more depth I
love the amount of shine that this
product gives and it just feels super
comfortable on this is
not a staining type of lip product so
you don't have to worry about it kind of
changing colors or doing anything weird
on your lips like for the long haul of
the day even once the shine wears off
the staying power isn't half bad I think
is just totally my lips but better now a
lipstick that I've really enjoyed over
the past year year and a half reminds me
of my natural lip tone but it's a little
more on the pinky side one of the tart
glamazon lipsticks and the shade is
inspired I love this I know I've talked
about this maybe Instagram this these
lipsticks really feel velvety smooth on
your lips they're not some of the most
shiny in fact I think some of these kind
of come off with a little bit of a matte
finish as you wear them throughout the
day you're comfortable and I love how
this is just a very natural type of pink
and it reminds me of my lips but just a
little more pink and my final lipstick
type product that I think really plays
off the deeper tones that I sometimes
notice in my lips is the maybelline
color whisper and the shade is made it
moth this is not one of the first color
whispers I've tried in fact it's
probably one of the more recent ones
that I've picked up but I'm so glad I
did because it's totally my lips but a
little bit more berry to them these are
super comfortable I've really enjoyed a
lot of these color whispers that I have
and I think that the deeper you get or
the brighter you get in their spectrum
of colors the better these perform some
of the really really light ones I think
come off pretty sheer but this is just a
great great mix of a beautiful texture
plus really great color I love that on
my lips so those are the lipsticks and
now for the glosses you can kind of see
that they each follow a little bit of
the tone of each of those lipsticks so
I'm not saying you would have to layer
these glosses to get a good look as you
see them on my lips you'll see that they
can totally stand alone you know but if
you were looking for some pairings I
think these would go along well with
what I've talked about also first one is
the NYX butter gloss in tiramisu and
this is what I am wearing or what I've
been wearing throughout the whole video
as I've just been sitting here and this
is probably one of my favorite NYX
butter glosses it looks so natural on my
lips takes my natural
tone really neutralizes it you know what
I mean just like this L'Oreal glossy
bomb I was talking about it's not about
making my lips nude because my lips
aren't naturally nude but these are two
very neutral type tones on my lips and I
just think they work really great for
any occasion
another blots that I love and it really
reminds me of the texture of the butter
glosses if you like that um it's the
L'Oreal color riche gloss in rich pink
this is a great layering gloss over any
slightly pinky toned lip product you
might have I think it looks so finished
if you stay away from the bright kind of
bubblegum pinks and you just want
something that looks really natural
gloss wise this is a great one to pick
up so there's that you can see in
comparison to the tiramisu you know
might have just a little more depth on
it still gives me that little bit of a
pink vibe that I might be after and
looks very natural on my lips
finally a gloss that I think always is
my lips but like a little more glammed
up there is some shimmer in this one and
this is the only product I've mentioned
so far that has any sort of shimmer
because let's face it our lips naturally
don't continue sort of reflective
farticles you know what I mean so it's
not always gonna be the most natural
looking thing about this always catches
the light and looks gorgeous I've used
this on several brides in the past
it comes off just so beautifully in
pictures takes anyone's skin tone and I
feel like makes it look a little more
radiant that I even say the name yet
it's your color first lip gloss from
Revlon and rose pearl total total
must-have have tried some of the lighter
glosses from this line and I feel like
they're very sheer I haven't liked all
of them but this texture it is kind of
different it's a little thicker
definitely very opaque on the lips so
love it last little thing I do feel I
must give a shout out to is the classic
Dr Pepper lip smacker did I mention this
in my iconic drugstore makeup products
video is the lip smacker that gives your
lips just the most beautiful rosy flush
I mean you might think yeah yeah lip
smackers what are they good for but your
lips shine it always makes my lips look
I think younger more rosy looking so
love that I don't think anybody can go
wrong with that no matter what your
natural lip color is hopefully that
gives you a little bit of insight into
some really great natural looking lip
products things that for my lips I
believe are my lips but better and like
I said depending on your natural lip
color it might be a little bit different
be a little bit lighter than some of
these shades are a little dark I'd say
just look at what you're working with
and then dig through your collection yes
dig and you'll figure it out that's my
advice on this so thank you so much for
watching guys and I'll see you again
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
