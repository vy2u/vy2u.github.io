minute makeup challenge stuff except
this is a six minute challenge I came to
that number because I did actually sort
of practice this look and I came to the
conclusion that yes I I need the one
more minute for this because it had been
requested that after I did my last five
minute video that I try something that's
a little more dramatic like more of a
night out or I thought of this is kind
of a fall type makeup look a little bit
deeper tones and just a little bit more
dramatic overall so I'm gonna try it
I've only had like two sips of coffee so
far this morning it's like a quarter
after six make that three sips of coffee
that's gonna make all the difference but
I do have a theory you know with this
fast makeup why do you do this well
number one I think it's good to have a
go-to routine when you have to do things
quickly I know now more than ever in my
life what it feels like to need to rush
through a makeup look with a couple
little kids and just you know busy life
it doesn't matter if you have kids or
not anybody out there can have a full
plate schedule wise and you've just got
to get it done but I don't think it's
the actual makeup application like
actively putting it on that takes a long
time for people I think it's the act of
choosing stuff deciding what you're
gonna do
having you know a drawer full of things
and thinking okay how am I going to go
out it and it slows you down when you're
just picking through things so if you
have a go-to look when it has to be
quick and you keep that look in a basket
or a little makeup bag keep it super
handy whenever your makeup has to be
like done in a flash so you don't even
have to think about it that's I think
what you need to do so I practice this
look and I've got some things that I
think will be my products that can get
me done in a flash here aka six minutes
for a night out look I'll go there it's
not going to be false lashes though not
getting that dramatic but if you had a
couple extra minutes I think you could
definitely squeeze that and it just
depends on what you like and how much
time you have but got the timer set here
for six minutes
all the products where I can reach them
I think on my marks get set go
okay hourglass vanish foundation stick
the shade is nude start swiping this on
no certain pattern although I do like a
curlicue on my forehead major key there
yeah not really but I'm using the
Sephora Mini Pro flawless airbrush and
just buffing this in my thought on the
whole six minutes the way it kind of
worked out when I practiced it was like
that I would take about three minutes on
face and then that would leave me three
minutes on eyes and lips so we'll see if
it pans out that way this morning but I
think it really is important to take the
time to really see your foundation going
on get that all blended in watch your
phone screen go to black while you're
relying on your counter there okay but
yeah I will have all the products I use
listed below in case I forget to talk
about something out of sheer stress okay
blending it down the neck I think we're
all blended in there really nice
coverage foundation stick now tart shape
tape yep we are not compromising
coverage at all here couple dots around
the nose a couple dots under the eye why
did I put one dot right under my nose I
don't even know okay same brush and I
just kind of like the way this spreads
out I also like a flat foundation brush
with this particular concealer but I'm
just gonna dab it all in and if I need
to go in with my finger a little bit I
will but I think that gives really
complete coverage to that area same
thing on the other side ah such nice
coverage on this concealer it's really
unmatched okay is everything good
everything good cuz I'm about to bring
in powder okay yes
Milani prep set and glow I love this
powder why am i I'm holding the
foundation stick between my knees there
this powder I love for a little
lightweight setting doesn't look heavy
doesn't take away glow doesn't make you
look super mad like it just I don't know
it's in a good place so dabbing that all
around and then we're gonna jump into
this palette here the Carli bybel BH
Cosmetics deluxe edition and oops
dropped a brush I'm gonna go into this
little bit bronzer looking shade just a
dab of this I went a little overboard
with this the other day when I tried it
but this palette is gonna multitask like
crazy for us right now
a little bit of that around the hairline
whoops little bit of it like kind of not
super duper contouring but a little
lower on the cheeks then this color
right up here blush I know it's an
eyeshadow but it's a very blushy looking
eyeshadow kind of going over that three
minutes for face idea there's also a lot
of glow in this eyeshadow so you want to
keep the highlighter kind of light like
not too much oh yeah that's the brush
okay I'm gonna go right here
very light right on top of the cheek
whoo okay feel the rush this is the elf
brow lift neutral Brown can't spend
forever on this just got to get it done
whoa hey now slow down slow down a
little dogie okay um it's not the my
best brow and it's two minutes okay
Milani eyeshadow primer I Mama's getting
nervous
all right get that primer on there
that's an important step I think not to
skip now going into the pallet I'm gonna
take this Mabi stuff here what does it
call oh yeah I shadow
get that in there deeper shade also
working that in this is gonna be simple
we're just hitting the crease a little
bit of deep color and then we're gonna
slap something bright and shiny on the
lid mmm brush this shade right here see
I didn't have to talk the last time I
tried this it's okay get in there going
to curl the side don't pull out your
lashes important advice I almost did
that the last time I did a challenge
where I lash paradise that's right
I think even with this look I can skip
the liner and still get impact we kind
of like you know brought the shadow out
to make it a little more you know almost
like a wing or something makes it a
little more dramatic 30 seconds I'm
feeling okay about this yellow all right
get that on there we can go back if
there's a few more seconds at the end I
gotta get this lip on infallible Pro
matte gloss what the heck is a matte
gloss well it's a hoodie pretty cool
product actually okay
all right there goes the timer
there's Homer stop this is the look that
I have all right I will say this I did
when I was practicing I did a couple
more things than this on my eyes and I
thought it made it just a little more
dramatic than this although let's just
let's just look and appreciate for a
second like this happened this just
happened in six minutes
full-coverage face for sure
we used one talent for all like face
color stuff from bronzer blush highlight
eyeshadow and what I did with the
eyeshadow this very kind of look which
this palette lends itself to very well
I'm gonna go give you just one more
little thought here and as I was trying
to say which I don't know if it was
coherent at all well I was doing my
tutorial what I wanted to do in lieu of
eyeliner was to take like one of these
two deeper shades and you kind of bring
it up as if you're making an eyeliner
ish shape out here in your outer corner
you know I mean like we're gonna point
it out toward the the outer part of our
brow there and if you just have a couple
extra seconds to do that like it really
amps the look up it makes it look a
little bit more dramatic and it's kind
of like you're winging with eyeshadow
instead of eyeliner which I think the
eyeshadow can be a bit more forgiving if
you're in a hurry I never want to be in
a time crunch and have to do eyeliner
even as comfortable as I am with liquid
liner like it's just not good news you
know it's not a good thing so anyway
really working that like outer corner of
the shadow and the only other thing that
I wanted to do was to smudge a little
bit of that Brown also on the lower lash
line because I think that makes it it
defines the eye more it makes it seem a
little bit more dramatic and it's no big
deal like it doesn't really take much
time but when you're literally timing
yourself to six minutes you know you
might you might miss it and then if you
can add like a little extra mass
Scarah here like I didn't spend hardly
any time on these lashes and this is my
brand new tube of the l'oreal lash
paradise the mystic black which they
claim to be like the blackest pigments
ever or something like that I don't know
I I'm not really noticing a profound
difference between this and just the
regular lash paradise honestly but yeah
when you're putting together your own
like quick go-to makeup look I think you
just got to think like what's the
priority for me so if you're thinking
maybe I don't care so much about the
full coverage on the face you could take
away some time by just slapping on a BB
cream real quick and a little bit of
blush or something and then move along
for me I really wanted to see the skin
get like fully covered here and then
have just that little bit of berry eye
and the lip I should talk about this
just briefly here infallible Pro matte
gloss I don't know what the heck this is
I had one I think I'd been sent this
random shade here in statement nude and
it's kind of like as you can see a
deeper dusty roads kind of nude and I
just hadn't really used it or played
with it and then I'm thinking what is a
matte gloss anyway that makes no sense
if it's either matter it's glossy right
well whatever it is it's a beautiful
texture it is matte on the lips but it's
softer l'oreal and out now makes some
matte liquid lipsticks there in the
frosted tube but the same size and shape
and these like do dry down a little bit
more they're a little heavier feeling on
the lips this gives you the matte look
not as much staying power as the other
but super duper comfortable and I really
do like that shade a lot statement nude
so guys thank you for requesting this
look I hope you enjoyed it I hope you
weren't too stressed out watching me do
this cuz I was definitely stressed doing
it you have another timed challenge you
want to throw at me let me know because
I'm down for it I will try I will try to
create a look that I think is is quick
or using certain products that can
actually execute what you're asking me
to do but thank you again so much for
watching and I will see you guys next
time
