love you so I'm really excited to show
it to you I don't know about you but I
have never had a video like this before
and we will have some fun
a scent that reminds me of I can't quite
I can't quite I I mean I feel like it's
not like why did I just do that I wanted
to let you know what I the one I in yeah
I know it's not and he was he does that
you know basically this is like
making me look like some kind of
alligator or something like open this
for the first time like duh-duh-duh
they're rich they're really creamy
legitimate pieces of glitter these are
tropical grab a big big kabuki brush and
just go crazy so now we're going to take
this mesh doughnut looking thing and put

for a lot of things to choose from my
movies are where I already have
moisturizer I'm not gonna say anything
we didn't review or don't guess any
techniques before
here's my finished Webster's dictionary
defines napping as a short sleep or aka
sleep
so really napping has some great
benefits for a lot of people and we just
kind of want to discuss that look at me
I rarely nabbed frequent napping I can't
call myself a frequent nap or however I
call myself an occasional mapper these
visual fellers enabled me to floss at
least 17 times a day which I feel has
really improved my dental hygiene
Senna's videos of you mostly your
girlfriend and implies there's something
like this but Navasota like that's but
napping or you know nothing like this we
don't want this movie were like this is
it and let's just get like a lot more
just shenanigans going on just interpret
that - anagen Madigan's could be defined
as and that's really just kind of open
interpretations and Bibles and it's in
Supreme Court a signal for
interpretation
we don't make bloopers everything is
completely wholeheartedly we don't like
blueberries I make babies no that's our
punchline at maps shenanigans tomfoolery
