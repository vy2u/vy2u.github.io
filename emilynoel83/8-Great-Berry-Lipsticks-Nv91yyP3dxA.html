tuning in for this video looks like we
all survived the review athon on Sunday
thank you so much for the feedback on
that I kind of put out a little note I
guess it's called on the Beauty
broadcast Facebook page they got some
really good feedback on sort of the
frequency in which you like your videos
you know like how often you like them in
a big chunk or you like them just day by
day and just subject matter and things
like that so thank you to everyone that
took the time to go there and comment
and just comment and watch the videos I
really appreciate that
so on my Facebook page I got a request
from someone wanting to see my top
favorite berry colored lipsticks because
I think you guys have heard me talk
about berry colored stuff quite a bit so
far this season and something I think is
so great about it is it looks good in
any season on pretty much any skin tone
too so I mean while I think berry colors
sometimes we maybe associate those
deeper lip colors with wintertime I
think they can be so flattering on tans
skin in the summer you know it can
really make your skin and your face pop
and but if you have fair skin like my
sister has really fair skin and she
looks gorgeous in like a deeper berry
colored lip and so you know I can tell
that it really spans you know
complexions and and stuff like that and
I also think it looks great in any
season as well so I was that
specifically about lipsticks so that's
all I'm going to focus on right here I
do have a lot of berry colored glosses
that I like but I'm gonna share the
lipsticks now and by the way this isn't
like all I wear I switch it up a la go
from nude to berry to red and if you're
kind of confused about what I mean by
berry I'm not talking like that bright
fire-engine red and I'm also not talking
about like Barbie pink or or light baby
pink these are those juicy kind of berry
colors that can be a little deeper some
hid a little more towards red and some
are more like have the purpley blueish
undertones so first one I'm going to
mention is the one that I have
and this is the one that is closest to
red but I thought I would include it in
this anyway pad this is from rimmel and
it's a moisture renew lipstick so those
come in this pretty purple packaging and
the shade is called cherry licious so
that's what it looks like and you can
see you know you might think oh it's
going to be when I first you know opened
it up and looked at it I thought this is
going to be bright red but it really was
more of a berry color so kind of swatch
it there a little bit for you you can
see it's got a I mean it's got a little
bit of shimmer to it so this isn't just
a totally creamy lipstick it has some
shimmer kind of a light berry tone
another one that has some shimmer but
not quite the sparkle like this one
actually has some little sparkle to it
this love it next one is just kind of
you know has a really subtle shimmer to
where you couldn't really see any
sparkle but it has just a slightly
metallic finish and it's from wet and
wild the shade is moody mauve and it's
the one eye
I just think it helps to see it with the
cap just so you can recognize it but
super cheap found in the drugstore this
is what the color looks like and this is
a swatch it that you can see it has a
little more pink and as I hold it up
there it just has a little more of a
metallic feel but this has more like a
sparkle to it the Rimmel one okay next
one is talked about this several times
from Mac it's the amplified lipstick in
craving and I've talked about this I
think I've saw a couple people say you
know they like it but they feel like
they need to tone it down with something
personally I love wearing this just as
it's it's a creamy lipstick there's no
real sparkle or anything to it but I
mean it's just great rich pigmented
color this is the lipstick right here
and there is the swatch you can see it
doesn't have all that metallic quality
but does it does have a ton of color
there so that is from Mac it's called
craving the next one I'm going to show
you is I think you're going to find it's
kind of close to that as a drugstore
alternative and it is from Maybelline
it's the color sensational and party
pink
so let's swatch that up
and I think you'll see that they're
pretty similar party pink might have a
little more of that traditional pink
tone to it you can see right there and
the craving is maybe has a slight bit
more red but they're pretty close and
they are similar in texture because
party pink has no shimmer or sparkle and
it's just a creamy lipstick it comes off
kind of glossy on the lips both of those
feel pretty moisturizing when you put
them on next one is a little bit deeper
it's very interesting I haven't found
like a duplicate shade for this in a
less expensive brand yet it's from
two-faced and look at the cute packaging
this is supposed to smell or have like a
champagne essence or something it's it's
the lipstick and celebrity meltdown and
it does kind of have just a different
little scent there let me swatch that
for you this is kind of like a plum and
it has a gorgeous gold undertone it's
right up here this is what the lipstick
looks like and so it's kind of hard to
tell like it looks so different in
different lights but you can see it on
there and it does have a definite pretty
gold undertone that looks great with tan
skin and it can come off a little bit
deeper or a little bit brighter you know
just depending on how you look at it but
it's got a great Sheen there and that is
from Too Faced next one is one that oh I
love this so much and you're going to be
able to tell when I lift the cap off
this is the Rimmel lasting finish
lipstick in metallic seduction so the
other line in that brand was the
moisture renew it looked like this and
the purple tube this is the lasting
finish it's in like a really dark color
tube this is metallic seduction and I've
used it so much there's not much left on
here but that's that shade it has a
pretty shimmer to it it's it's deep it's
very concentrated but it's it's don't be
too scared of that one because it really
looks pretty and you can put it on sheer
you can put it on your finger and kind
of dot it on you have
like this nice stain berry lip it's got
a gorgeous shimmer it catches the light
so it's deep but yet it kind of I don't
know it just makes your skin kind of
glow and pop I love it another great one
cheap one from the drugstore NYC and
garnet only complaint with this is that
the caps on these I hate how they are
because they pop off so easily I've had
this like this is kind of a rough
looking lipstick here because I've had
the cap pop off and so many times but
again it's cold garnet and it reminds me
of metallic seduction as well you can
see they're really similar metallic
seduction just has more sparkle in it
this one's just a little more like kind
of slightly metallic but so there's a
couple of options there and then the
last one I want to show you is comes off
like a very deep plum it's one of the
Revlon Colorstay lipsticks and the shade
is fabulous fig this was something my
friend Kaylee um wore quite a bit on the
air she's a news she's a weather person
right now in Birmingham so hi Kaylee if
you're watching this is a pretty gosh I
didn't select that very good it's creamy
it's deep it doesn't have a lot of pink
tones to it it's like it comes off kind
of like a deep plum it's not super duper
shiny either but I think you're gonna be
surprised like it's just it looks good
on the lips and it gives you a really
polished kind of glamorous look when you
wear it so hopefully I gave you some
ideas between all those of some of my
favorite lipsticks and berry tones again
I think you can wear them all seasons
and I think they look great on various
skin tones as well if you're looking for
something that you could put on your
lips that's really gonna make your face
glow I mean sometimes nudes work like
that and sometimes they don't and new a
new lip doesn't necessarily work for
everyone but I feel like in that within
this range you may be able to find
something that works for you so thanks
to those who requested this video and
thanks again for everyone who takes the
time to watch these videos have
wonderful day and thanks for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
