is gonna be a very different kind of
video I'm so excited this is something
I've actually been challenged to do for
months and I'm finally getting around to
it when David was here he's a makeup
artist by the way we were doing a little
periscope session and he like publicly
called me out on the fact that I have
not yet done this 88 palette bingo idea
that he has and then many of you who are
watching we're like yeah do it so here's
what this is all about you guys remember
the 88 color palettes that were really
popular like I remember when I started
YouTube I was getting a bunch of them
from Coastal Scents or I'm sure there
are other brands who are putting out
similar styles of palettes and it's been
a long long time since I've picked one
of those up and use them and so David
thought this would be a fun way to kind
of force yourself into a random
assortment of colors you're gonna end up
picking five random shades for the
letters VI ng oh you're just gonna have
two sets of numbers for however many
shades you have across in your palette
and how many shades down in my case for
this palette it's 11 across and eight
down and then draw out a number from
each bag for the letters be ing O so
you'll have five random shades that you
need to work into a look and according
to David's rules I can pull in anything
else that I want any additional shadows
any vases mascaras lashes liners you
name it but you do have to work in these
five shades into your look that end up
getting chosen I am going to be using my
prism palette it's kind of similar I
think to the original 88 palette from
Coastal Scents this is from Coastal
Scents by the way and I went ahead and
numbered my shades 11 across and 8 down
with little labels there you wouldn't
have to do that but I just thought it
would keep me from counting each time
again you could do this concept with any
palette no matter the size just go by
how many shades you have across and how
many should jet down put them into
separate bags and those are your numbers
so I have a lovely assistant joining me
this morning he just recently woke up I
was gonna wait till he was ready for
work but momma's got other things to do
you what is need to bowl and a helper
for this task
I just thought you know what the heck
it'll make it fun and you all know that
my colors have been chosen by so what
else I have a witness I just have eleven
numbers in one bag in this bag and eight
shades in my other bag
so butts gonna pull out one number from
each and that'll tell me what my first
shade is 4/7 we're working with a nice
teal 3/3
okay so them three and seven five five
and eight one one oh we're working with
black hey that's good alright but your
work here is done my friend thank you
happy to help
thank you for your help maybe you'll
have to come back and see how I did with
the shake each other so there's B I n G
oh I thought it might be wise to just
swatch out the shed it was first to see
what I'm working with how pigmented
things are like what the finishes are so
this pink shade is pretty strong and it
does have shimmer these two very pastel
and just matte on that blue and mint
green and then this coppery shade does
have shimmer but kind of flaky and then
I've got a matte black I thought I was
gonna sit here and map out like an
entire plan for this look but honestly
I'm not really sure where this is going
so first off I know I'm gonna prime my
lids this is the NYX proof it eye primer
so it just pop that on
who knows I mean this may be a real
disaster this look may not be attractive
at all don't be surprised I'm gonna use
this NYX jumbo pencil as a base it's in
the shade cottage cheese so it's just
like a light shimmery white shade I'm
going to take that around my inner
corner and up onto the lid some when I
reference what shades I'm picking up I'm
just gonna use what's here on my hand to
show you so I don't have to pull the
palette up every time but I'm gonna use
the mint green okay pick it up with this
little inner corner brush and since it
is just so light I mean it seems like
it's barely green I'm gonna take that
around the inner corner I would love to
see like if you guys try this I would
love to see how your looks turned out
it's just it's a fun challenge you just
can't take yourself too seriously what
you're doing this though doesn't have to
be perfect doesn't even have to end up
pretty that's the fun of it I think
naturally next I'm going to go into the
blue and that's just it like a light
pastel again this is a matte blue ooh
that had more pop than I was expecting
pull that up onto the lid I'm gonna stop
there for a second before I get too
crazy on the lids because whatever I do
in the crease might end up covering it a
bit but I'm gonna go into this coppery
shade here it does have some shimmer but
I think it could still be decent in the
crease I'm just gonna pop that into my
crease honestly that's a pretty crease
color for this look I think
pulling a little bit more blue once
again I don't want to lose that color
and now I do have a liner that very
closely matches this shade right here
this kind of pinkish purple and it's
ring color pop and it's in the shade
called piggy bank so I'm gonna use that
but I'm also going to use I think a
black liner in my waterline here I think
kind of anchoring the look with a little
bit of black here in the waterline I
don't know if I want to throw around the
word wearable for this look but I don't
know it might kind of give it a smoky
thigh I'm gonna pull that downward into
my lash line really get it in between
the lashes
oh hey bub these are the colors that's
we think different for ghost or smudge
that liner a bit here then I'm gonna
take this kind of like very purple liner
and that's gonna go like all throughout
on the skin on my lower lash line
and I'm gonna smudge the crap out of it
then I'm going to go into our purple and
our purplish pink and I'm going to top
off that liner and hopefully add even
more brightness as they do this yeah
that really really pops down I'm doing a
pretty thick lower lash line as you can
see
I'm pretty proud of that lower lashline
to be honest with you you'll recall we
are also working with a black so I'm
going to pull that in with my Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush
thank goodness black is in this look and
this is going to go in my outer corner
I'm tempted to really go huge on the
outer V but I don't know I the color is
so bright in this look I kind of want to
contain it just a little bit like just
as far as the shape goes I want to add
more copper for sure right in here I was
just thinking would this not be a super
fun party game if you own a bunch of 88
palettes or like your friends do have
them come over and then I could like get
on periscope and do live number calling
so then you're looking at whatever
palette you have and you end up you know
having those shades to work with
wouldn't that be fun yeah I tell you I'm
not hating the way that transition a
crease areas looking hmm but here's what
I'm thinking I kind of want the purple
to like maybe come right around here
like see how much I can blend that into
the copper maybe I don't know I need
something small so I'm using this little
key 36 from Sigma I'm just gonna kind of
pull up from the lower lash line
it's like these shades are a nice little
cocoon for the mint green and blue now
my five colors really didn't include
much of a highlight so I'm pulling in my
Naked basics palette I think I'm just
gonna use this shade right here just for
a light highlight under the brow but
other than that you know we didn't
really pull in a bunch of other shadows
we could have you know that would have
been fine but
it was also kind of challenging to try
to mainly stick to the five that were
chosen and I'm going to do some liquid
liner I'm using my Physicians Formula I
booster pin just a small way small way
curl the lashes
all right friends end result with the
lashes I mean honestly I didn't know
where I was going with this look when I
started and I think we ended with a
pretty kick-ass eye look if I do say so
myself I mean this these colors are so
random and it was really fun to be
challenged to put them together in some
way that made a little bit of sense and
I already had my foundation done when I
started the look so I just left my lip
and cheek to be added on and as tempted
as I was to go really nude on the lip I
kind of wanted to play off of this
coppery shade that's sheared out up here
I wanted to pull that into the mix and
kind of make some harmony with that
color on the face so I used this sheer
kind of quarterly gloss it's the buxom
lip gloss in Taylor on the lips and then
I used my peach perfection covergirl
instant cheekbones on my cheeks if you
do this please like tweet me or
Instagram your pictures let's do hashtag
palette bingo and I think this would be
so so fun to get inspiration from each
other's looks and David thank you for
the idea thank you to everybody who peer
pressured me to do this because I'm
really glad I did it and for an
inspirational David quote that he left
me with during our periscope session
more is the new less thank you guys I
will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
