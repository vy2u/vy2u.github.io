using the coastal scents 88 shimmer
palette I honestly thought maybe
somebody might come to my house and hunt
me down if I didn't do another tutorial
using this palette but that's great
because i love using this and so do you
guys i've turned out some of my favorite
tutorials with this palette and this one
is really fun and kind of different it's
kind of a purple and gold look purple on
the lid fading up to golds and pastel y
ellos it's fun to do it's somewhat
natural yet kind of totally different so
if you want to look that maybe you
haven't tried before just check out this
tutorial also if you've looked at any of
my tutorials and maybe you've got ahead
and tried to look yourself and you've
taken a picture or you plan to do that
in the future make sure you take a
picture and email it to me email it to
beauty broadcast at hotmail com because
what i'm doing i have a special blog
entry that i'm going to continue create
a special page for it and i'm going to
post your own looks that you've done
after watching one of these tutorials
just so just tell me what tutorial it's
fashioned after and i will include it
there for everyone else to see and you
don't use the same products i did or
even tell me what products you use but
just kind of show me that picture and i
think it might inspire other people to
go ahead and see that these tutorials
really are doable and try them for
themselves so anyway guys if you want to
see how I did this fun purple and gold
look keep watching alright guys first
step I want to use some kind of a creamy
base to really grab the first color i
put on my eyes so i'm going to use my
NYX jumbo eye shadow pencil and cottage
cheese is just kind of a pearly white
shade so I'm just going to you know just
draw that on my lid and it is so creamy
don't overuse this I always say that
with any you know I base or cream shadow
you don't want to use too much a little
can do exactly what you want it to
though which is just grab onto the
shadow and help it stay longer so then
I'm going to grab my 88 shimmer palette
here so
tada and I'm going to go for the purple
shade that is right there at the bottom
in the purple row so there's the black
and then there's that purple shade of
course I mean I I know there were a lot
of people out there that use the 88
shimmer palette and so that's why I'm
kind of being specific here but any
comparable shade will do so I'm going to
dip my low cornell i shadow brush into
that it's actually a paintbrush i have
deemed it an eyeshadow brush for me
though it's the three-eighths sighs and
I'm just going to dip that into the
purple shade and kind of pack it on the
brush and then I'm just going to apply
that all over my eyelid so just use kind
of a patting motion at first sometimes
these ultra shimmery shades or really
any shape for that matter can tend to
have a little bit of Fallout so you know
you can do that blending back and forth
motion but sort of wait till you've got
it mostly on there so you know it's kind
of stuck so I'm going for that all over
the lid you can see it's really vivid
and shows up well but I also part of
this look is kind of stretching that up
just a little bit into the crease so you
can just flip your brush over and kind
of act like you're pointing it in right
in your crease and just go like that and
just kind of stretch the color up by
that I mean don't add any additional to
your brush but just kind of blend it
upward so that purple part was really
easy and so is the next step I'm going
to find a golden e shade in this palette
and if you um basically the reason why I
did that was because I have kind of a
bronzy look all over the rest of my face
and so I thought it would be pretty to
use a shade that I really don't normally
use with purple which is gold those were
my old like school basketball colors I
cheered not basketball but anyway off
topic I'm going for this gold shade it
would be one two three four up it's the
one that looks most like metallic gold
there in the palette and I just thought
you know let's kind of keep that golden
a bronze theme if you didn't want that
that you could by all means use like a
silvery shade here and kind totally
change where this look is going so I'm
going to use my essence of beauty crease
brush it's the bigger of the two that
come in the 2-pack at CVS and just get
some of that gold on your brush and then
some interesting things are going to
happen i'm going to go over the border
remember when we stretch the purple
shade up to the crease just go right on
top of that with this golden you get a
really neat just warm effect it almost
looks peachy it's just really
interesting and we're not going we're
not making any distinct shape we're just
following the shape of our I really and
just kind of stretching that up there
then I'm going to take a much fluffier
brush which will give us a more diffused
application and I'm going to go to the
shade that is directly above that gold
that we use it's more of a going towards
pastel yellow than gold and that's the
shade we're going to blend on up to our
eyebrow it's kind of a highlight shade
so just I'm going to get some of that on
my Sephora rounded crease brush careful
to tap off the excess and just kind of
you know it's it's just kind of that
that deeper gold shade just blending
right up into a pretty yellow ok so once
that's a blended to your satisfaction
we're going to switch gears a little bit
go for a smaller crease brush this is
the smaller essence of beauty crease
brush and we're going for a little bit
of black in this look we're really not
using a lot but just a little I'm using
the one that's down there in the corner
and it once again I want to stress you
know if you don't have this palette just
similar shades will do you can achieve
the look with probably a number of other
products so just want to make sure
that's clear but get a little bit of
that on your smallish crease brush and
what we're going to do is darken up this
area right here we're going to stick
though strictly to the outer half we
really want to keep this nice thing
we've got going here kind of uninor up
so what I'm going to do is just kind of
start right here I couldn't even call it
the outer half I would call it may be
the outer fourth if that of my idol aya
crease there and this is just going to
help us have a little more contrast as
we continue to you know work with lashes
and things like that it's just going to
give us that nice deepened effect right
here so once again control yourself
don't let yourself go all the way into
the crease just keep it kind of partial
like that and you can see it's not
perfectly blended into that right now
but like I said if I if I took this
brush now and just went swiping Swiper
swiping all over it would really kind of
mess up the look so I'm going to really
lightly keep it kind of confined to the
outer outer borders and just really
lightly tap over that darker shade
that's going to defuse it a little bit
but not mess up the look you know what I
mean all right we're going to take a
break from the shadow for a little bit
and we're going to do some liner I'm
going to grab my Revlon Colorstay liquid
I pin in blackest black I really prefer
the regular Revlon Colorstay liquid
liner but I'm running low on mine so I
have gone to this which is it really it
works pretty pretty well it's just it
doesn't have quite the intensity you can
you can get that kind of intensity but
you might have to be a little more
careful when using this to go over it to
make sure it's as black as you want it
so
it's maybe a little slower go than I
usually do but that's okay you guys are
patient notice I'm kind of using the
side of this a little pen like
applicator because I feel like I don't
know I feel like I'm getting some fresh
juice out of the side of this thing it
sounded weird I'm winging it out not a
lot I really didn't noob too much with
that on the other side but just kind of
enough we're just following the shape of
the look so we got a little outer V with
the shadow so we'll do a little bit of a
winged look with the liner that's kind
of a rule of thumb if you're kind of
wondering when does it look good to do
that I think it looks good when you're
when you're doing the outer V and you do
the winged liner as well that kind of
follows that shape and then you can go
back and sort of reshape your shadow to
fit that line even better so little
thought there then I'm going to take my
new liner I'm testing out it's the aimer
eyeliner in black but it had a special
like I think I say the packaging sorry
it's son it's just all my eyeliner but
it says last up to 16 hours won't smudge
so that's the same claim Revlon
Colorstay gives so I'm kind of like
comparing them in the process of doing
that right now but anyway just blend it
up with the outer edge there one down
onto your natural lash line and this is
where you want to keep it really soft
like I'm just kind of dotting it in
between my eyelashes right here I'm
really not doing anything
much because I'm going to be topping it
off with shadow and I just kind of want
a deep purple look there so I'm going
over that with purple in a second oh
then go ahead and line your waterline
I'm going for sort of a fade down effect
on the lower lash line here so that's
why I kind of like that keeping a kind
of intense right in there and then it
kind of you'll notice this site kind of
fades out with the purple so that's the
thought process there so I'm going to go
back to the palette go back to the
purple shade that you used all over your
lid only this time use a liner brush and
I'm just going right on top of the liner
that I put down not on my waterline but
on my natural lash line go ahead and
curl your eyelashes and I'm going to
apply when I'm done a coat of the
covergirl super thick lash mascara which
is super cheap but really underrated I
think this is a pretty darn good mascara
I'm going to apply just a little bit to
my lower lashes a couple coats to my top
lashes then I'm going to apply some
false eyelashes on top of that the ones
i am wearing are the denny pixies so
they kind of have this look to them
they're kind of like in little pieces
together and they're not super long so
they're they're longer on the outside
but not so much on the inside so I'm
going to go ahead and get that all
together and then show you the finished
ok everyone here is the finished look
using purples and golds and really
warming up the typical purple look and
what I really noticed about this
especially since we've got these false
eyelashes on that are kind of dramatic
you know it's sort of one of those
peekaboo I looks where you know head-on
you may not even notice that the purple
is really there but once you close your
eyes you can see it and it's really
pretty so that's kind of what makes this
a look that's wearable for daytime but
would really be fun you know with a cute
outfit or something
you're going out at night or whatever so
get the lips kind of neutral but yet
kind of following our golden a bronze
theme throughout our face and i'm using
the Coastal Scents max in sheer tan so
that's just one of my favorite shades
there if you've seen my video on the
smacks you may recognize that elsewhere
on my face kind of a nice thing to keep
in mind for this to keep it sort of dewy
i used my Sonia Kashuk um duo with the
golden cream bronzer and also this
pretty blush shade so I use the bronzer
kind of like to contour my cheeks and
the blush right on the apples of my
cheeks and then I set that blush with my
Milani minerals blush in my tie and um i
just kind of went over my whole face
with my wet and wild mega glow in
starlight bronze who just dusted it all
over so really easy look but really fun
and different so thank you guys so much
for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
