birthday 25 years old Wow quarter
century so he is I'm actually making
cupcakes for him right now as we speak
the apartment smells like awesome
cupcakes so but he's also offered to do
a special they actually he didn't offer
idea but he agreed to cooperate with me
on a video today which is kind of a
different video than just talking about
something I got or you know whatever
this is going to be about a guy's
perspective on different makeup looks
we're shaking it up and I tore out
several pictures out of magazines and
Tyler hasn't seen these yet so I'm gonna
show them to him and he's just gonna
give me his initial reaction and just
kind of you know it may be something
that I have a lot of female viewers so
maybe the kind of thing that you wonder
about like what do you know what does
the guy think about that so Tyler
doesn't speak for everyone speaks only
for himself but let's get started okay
first I'll show you guys this is the
first picture keep looking at and kind
of see what some of the characteristics
are we've got bright red lips and really
like clearly there's makeup on the rest
of it what do you think about what do
you think about red wood because that's
kind of something that I think a lot of
women think is maybe a little risky you
know I think on that look it works a
little better because everything else is
more subtle and I think if you had a
whole bunch of color and then you threw
the red lips on it might look a little
extreme yeah and I don't know if you
guys can see on camera there but like
her you can see her freckles are kind of
show
everything else is really downplayed
yeah real natural works do you think not
too much how about this one I'll show
you guys first the gorgeous Charlize
Theron and she is very golden and look
she's got just a be just a really doing
look I had mentioned a dewy look in my
talking about foundation video not too
long ago and a few people said what
exactly does that mean and this is an
example you see how the face is just
really glowy looks like there's kind of
like some moisture there or something
what do you what do you think about this
is a really can skin seems like it
matches everything there's like one kind
of a blonde do you think this is pretty
pretty do you think she's too tan yeah
and she looks like she's probably in
some very golden e lighting as well but
what do you think as far as the makeup
goes it's really it really matches with
the whole that might be one of those
things that looks good in like a fashion
okay but you think she I mean attractive
yeah I think it's beautiful personally
but yeah it just really works for her
because she's got the whole blonde hair
thing going and the tan skin whatnot
okay here is a look that it's kind of
that outdoorsy sort of
really I'm the makeup is like it's there
but it's all pretty natural this is what
I imagine a lot of people probably do
with their makeup it's kind of that I
don't know if this term is probably way
overused but girl-next-door sort of look
nothing's too dramatic she's got the
eyelashes clearly emphasized that and
some light lip gloss maybe but it's
pretty natural might not know exactly
what's going on but she looks good
see I would think that guys this might
be the type of look a lot of guys would
gravitate toward because it's not too
over-the-top but yet she looks finished
demeanors kind of casual the hair it's
not really glued into one set style it's
just kind of all right that was picture
number three all right if you're number
four we've seen a couple light looks all
the looks at me kind of fresh looking so
far this one a little bit darker just a
little bit we've got dark hair I think
I'm holding it so you can kind of see
what's going on there with her face
basically we've got a really deep smoky
eye the hair is kind of getting in the
face a little bit but the the lip is
very light and I have been I mean from
what I've read in magazines and in
different places
I've heard that men gravitate toward a
dark smoky eye and the lips
I mean having lighter lips puts more
emphasis on the eyes what do you think
about that yeah I like the hair
and make the eyes like pullian or the
eyes are done that's where you look goes
when you first see that I think I like
it'll look too I mean I think her hair
is had that kind of gorgeous shine to it
the rest of the makeups really bears
Haley's being a pretty positive reviewer
so far okay this next one this is you
guys probably know who this is this is
Carrie Underwood and she has this wasn't
a photo shoot I think it was an Elle
magazine not too long ago and she's just
got a really different look for her
typical look again a very dark
smoldering eye but yet kind of a wet
head you think I think this is something
that is more for a magazine photo shoot
than for anything else because I think
if you walk by her on the street what is
falling on her head she got wet like
that yeah yeah it's definitely a
high-fashion kinda like I mean even the
whole outfit I mean gosh she wears
Blazers that are you know absolutely
nothing under him I mean very high
fashion but dark eyes all right we got a
few more left here all right this is one
that I think I predict is gonna go over
huge with if I have any male viewers out
there I think you're gonna see this
picture and really like it you know
beautiful
Tyra Banks obviously gorgeous person
nice face but you know kind of big hair
couple other
look the model or the actress or
whoever's been photographed has been
kind of you know yeah so this one's kind
of I mean she's kind of approachable
much brighter the hair is just kind of
maybe has it looks like it's got big fan
pointed up at her maybe but volume in
the hair pretty makeup look what do you
I mean what do you like about that okay
you're getting kind of a bright eye I
think you really can't go wrong
I mean Tyra has had a flawless face I
mean she really this looks shows off but
hey you know I've got kind of a smoky
eye and and you know pink lips or
whatever but the face just looks
absolutely not this was an airbrushed or
anything but it she just has a really
flawless okay there's that one last one
is probably the most natural of the
whole bunch you can see this girl has
got a look that is next to no makeup the
hair is really just kind of there I mean
it's not it's not you can see it's kind
of you know lectured style whatsoever I
mean what do you think mmm kind of
wha-wha she's not a not pretty person
she's a model sue but yeah compared to
some of the other pictures were at least
they'll hit the lips or the eyes or
something was emphasized it all those
things like there's not much in yeah and
not to mention with the hair cutting
across one eye entirely don't even know
leave it to Tyler to bring in the new
perspective there okay so we're gonna
pick a favorite here your Tyler's gonna
pick his favorite you got natural we've
got a red lip so we've got the golden
Charlize Theron we've got the outdoors
the kind of laid-back girl the deep dark
eyes when dark hair Carrie Underwood
post showers and Tyra okay okay let's
show that what's showing the top three
all right that was a quick decision
included Tyra also our kind of outdoorsy
laid-back makeup girl and then then kind
of our dark smoky eye and nude lips lady
let's eliminate one oh this is so like
real go into the room and he like first
impression here why did you let I don't
know it's tough decision I had to go
with my gut
yeah you went with your gut okay all
right so these two pictures are speaking
to you I'm gonna go with this one the
dark eye okay explain your rationale
people will need to know I don't know I
just I kind of was liking that the dark
face okay maybe it's pulling you in just
a little bit more than I it's a little
more emphasized so for those out there
that do the I mean you generally kind of
like one thing emphasized and I don't
know what I like I just do know we all
kind of do that sometimes
yes yeah all right well I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
happy birthday to Tyler and thank you so
much for taking time out of your
birthday to do this I guess he maybe
owes me a little bit something the
cupcakes
