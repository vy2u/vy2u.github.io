talking about the aspect of color
correcting in makeup that has been
something I've been doing for years and
it's definitely been my most useful
trick in getting rid of under-eye
discoloration and any sort of dark spots
dark patches on the skin so if you're
looking to get rid of any problem like
that you have come to the right place
because we're going to be talking about
all kinds of formulas shades just every
format possible of this peachy type of
corrective product whether you're
dealing with a little bit of
discoloration or a lot of discoloration
I think there will be a product today
that I mentioned that may be just right
for you I'm also going to mention a
couple of corrector type palettes as
well for me my biggest problem area is
on my face tend to be wanting to lighten
up any under-eye discoloration so it can
look anywhere on my skin tone it can go
anywhere from being a little bit bluish
or purple to just kind of dull looking
you know so I noticed that right on the
inner part like sides of my nose
sometimes it can stretch down in this
area a bit as well so that's a very good
place for me to use a peachy corrector
also um a couple years ago when I was
pregnant with Belle I had melasma
big-time and it came it surfaced on me
right on the tops of my cheeks and I
know my mom told me she had that during
her pregnancy so it can be kind of a
genetic thing I do have a video talking
much more about that but it looks just
like you know dark patches of skin some
people get it on the upper lip or
elsewhere on their face and after quite
a bit of trial and error I realized that
outside of just the fullest coverage
foundation I could possibly reach for in
terms of a concealing product the peachy
tone correctors really work best for the
melasma type spot we're also if you're
dealing with age spots sunspots any kind
of concentrated darkness on the face
that's a very hard thing to cover up
might be saying well what's the
advantage of these peachy correctors
over just a skin tone concealer that
I've been using for years and I'm not
saying you won't run into a skin tone
concealer that has amazing coverage and
can absolutely do the job for you but in
my experience with
lot of concealers they would lighten my
problems up whether it be the under-eye
melasma sunspots you name it
it would make it appear lighter but I
could still see it so it basically just
altered the tone a little bit and then
when I would bring in the right shade of
a peachy corrector it would really like
camouflage the problem and I just think
that's a very valuable trick to have in
your makeup toolbox and anything else
general I can get out of the way before
I jump into the products in terms of the
sequence of application I will usually
apply a foundation first and then I go
in with my concealer because I kind of
assess at that point okay how much did
my foundation cover up and then I may be
able to use more or less correct or
depending on the day or you know
whatever the problem might be but if
you're not type who likes to even wear
foundation and let's say the only issue
on your skin is some dark under-eye or
the only issue with some sunspots you
could by all means just start tackling
those straight away with a corrector and
you know just go about your business you
don't need to pair foundation with these
for them to work two factors that I
think will affect the coverage you get
out of a corrector would be the
consistency so you'll find some come in
a liquid forms some come in a thicker
cream form I find that the liquids
always tend to be more sheer than the
creams I mean when you think of the
concept of laying it on thick in your
head in order to cover something up
going with a thicker consistency is
going to lay it on thicker and just give
you an easier job coverage wise compared
to a thinner consistency also the tone
of the product so you'll find PG
correctors can be anywhere from like a
light pastel peach almost a little bit
close to pink or you know they can be
really really deep some of them very
bold and orange e and that can be better
for a darker skin tone so you really
want to have an awareness of what is
your skin tone and that will help you
understand how light or dark to go with
your peachy corrector and I'll be
pointing that out as we go but talking
about a few liquids first I have a
couple of these in like a click up pin
form I've also got some you know a doe
foot applicator type style here and I
would say the lightest one that I have
and so it performs much more like a
brightener it's less corrective more
just overall practically like a
highlighting pin and it's the Maybelline
Dream Lumi in the shade radiant and it
does have just that a little bit of a
light peach little towards pink tone so
I wanted to mention in this video if you
barely got any discoloration or you're
of a light skin tone and you just want
added brightness this could be a good
thing to use the consistency is thin
it's going to be you know pretty light
in terms of coverage now I wanted to try
this Mac prep and prime highlighter in
the shade bright forecast and they have
these in several different tones and
this would be the most peachy it's got a
little more yellow in it compared to the
last one I mentioned and again I feel
like it's a lighter coverage product
it's more for brightening if you were to
put this over really dark under-eye
discoloration or a really dark spot you
would notice it being lightened but not
necessarily erased and that doesn't make
these bad products it just makes them I
think more suited to the person who has
barely-there discoloration and a lighter
skin tone then we've got a product like
this Urban Decay Naked skin they've put
out various color correcting products
and this is the one called peach it's
not too yellow it's not too pink and
it's definitely got the best coverage
out of these liquidy products that I've
mentioned also when you apply this if
you're not one who likes to mess with
any sort of setting powder on top of
your concealer you just like to be kind
of a one and done type situation this
might be a good one to use because it
doesn't leave your skin feeling
especially tacky or dewy now that being
said it doesn't really offer a lot of
moisture to your skin as well
I think light to medium skin tones would
benefit most from this shade and while
the coverage is better than those last
couple I mentioned I still don't think
it goes quite as far as some of the
creamy consistencies that come in little
pots that I'll be referencing coming up
for me personally the darkness of my
circles isn't always exactly the same
some days it's worse than others today
it wasn't too terribly bad and I did use
a couple of these liquids just to show
you what the finished effect looks like
so I've got the urban decay under this
eye and for a lightish discoloration you
know this covered it pretty well I
thought and then I used the Mac prep and
prime over here which is a little more
sheer and I feel like I can still see
just a little bit more of the circle
area peeking through on this eye so if
you noticed any difference there you're
right I used two different products and
I just wanted to do that to demonstrate
to you the fact that those are different
coverage levels now as we get into the
creams I do have one that I want to
mention that's in a stick format and
it's from Smashbox it's the one called
look less tired light and I think they
have a deeper tone of a peachy concealer
as well this is a pretty oranjee peach
it's less like salmony than that naked
skin concealer is and it can do a pretty
good job it's nice because it's not too
light so I don't feel like it simply you
know lightens the discoloration you get
a little bit fuller coverage with this
consistency of a product which is just
like a cream formed into a pencil as far
as the tone goes I think skin tones that
are just a little deeper than me might
benefit from this even more because
whenever I use this well I do feel it's
correcting it's also just a little on
the dark side but I do think when you
get into tones that lack that little bit
of pinky salmon color you lose some
brightening that could happen there for
me the most effective way to conceal a
dark spot or let's say my darkest level
of under-eye discoloration is to use a
product called benefit erase paste I've
tried a lot of correctors you're seeing
me talk about many different kinds this
color
is definitely where it's at for me and
this is then the shade number two medium
and for my skin tone it just is the
perfect amount of pink and peach and the
consistency that allows for a lot of
nice coverage also you got to think
about where on my face am i applying
this if it's mainly you know to the
under eye is that an area where you're
getting dry are you starting to notice
signs of aging skin their skin that just
looks kind of dehydrated and fine lines
etc you may want to reach for one of
these creamier concealers that I'll be
talking about because they give a little
something back to that area if you're a
fan of the baking methods so if you like
to apply a concealer it's maybe a little
more a mole
and then set it with a whole lot of
powder and this would be a good
concealer that would really respond to
that just because this earase paste
feels like the exact right tone for my
skin tone you may be a little bit
different skin tone for me you may have
tried this and it just didn't do exactly
what you hoped it would and so that
might mean you want to experiment with
some other kinds a more recent find that
I actually really like the consistency
of it's not quite as creamy as erased
paste like it doesn't seem quite as
emollient as that product but it's still
easy to use it's definitely not drying
and it's the Fiona Styles full cover
perfect finished concealer in the peach
corrector shade it's a hint more yellow
than the erase paste but it definitely
does a good job of correcting and it's
something I feel like I can kind of
bounce back and forth with if you felt
like the erase paste was too creamy for
you this might be one to check out
packaging on this stuff is really cool
from that line by the way another option
that I talked about for years that is
incredibly close to erase paste in tone
but considerably less creamy and a
little less creamy than the Fiona Styles
option still nice and it's the pixie
correction concentrate in the shade
brightening peach a definite perk to the
pixie product is it's going to be a
little bit lower price than these other
ones that I've mentioned you're
sacrificing a little bit of the
creaminess there but it's still really
nice to work with I must say it's a
great option another product that I've
talked about for many years that's
really in my sweet spot of the peachy
pink salmon just right in there on the
color tone is my Bobbi Brown corrector
in disc um the reason why I tend to
recommend benefit erase paste over this
one is just the value this is like the
third one of these that I've had you hit
pan so quickly
there's just way more product in here
but the consistency of this is nice it's
really almost as rich and creamy as a
race paste if you're a hardcore like
Bobbi Brown fan like to use a lot of
products in that line the corrector in
bisque is definitely a good corrector to
use if you're this kind of medium skin
tone that I and like to medium skin now
I know if pearl really coined the whole
like salmon concealer thing for her
brand she's really known for pushing
this concept and I have her
salmon concealer here in the shade fair
- light what's cool about the way she
does it is you're getting two tones here
so you've got one that's a little deeper
one that can kind of help you customize
the level of brightness and I like the
pigment in these products I think
they're easy enough to blend out but
they are and you can probably just tell
by the way the lights hitting it these
have always felt just a little bit
greasy to me and I do think it's a fine
line between something that you feel
like is offering some moisture back to
your skin and something that is just
oily feeling so I've always kind of felt
like if Eve pearl dialed it back a
little bit on the oiliness these could
have even better coverage than they do
so they're not my top pick but I
definitely wanted to give that a mention
as far as a little bit deeper tone
something that works for more medium to
tan skin and it cosmetics makes
something called bye-bye under-eye
corrector and I had picked this up in
the shade medium but this is deeper a
little bit deeper than benefit erase
paste and last summer I found myself
reaching for this even more than my
array space just because my skin tone is
darkened a little bit and it needed a
little bit deeper corrector and this did
a great job it's nice and creamy not
quite as creamy as this but creamy
enough for sure now you might have
noticed recently that Becca has put out
a line of color correctors this is the
one that's labeled peach and it's
downright pretty Orange E and they have
one even deeper than that labeled papaya
it looks pretty darn red so if you are
of a rich tan deep skin tone you may be
wanting to look into color correction
that's going to be absolutely very
pigmented like this on my skin tone this
peach shade is too much for me I know
that because when I blend it over the
problem I'm still seeing the problem
area I'm seeing this product color on my
skin whereas those lighter tones of
peach really mask the problem but I want
you to know that if you're a deeper skin
tone you're still dealing with spots and
darkness that you want to cover there
are some options out there for you as
well last thing to mention here are a
couple of color correcting palettes that
I've tried one that I didn't like so
much one that I did like quite a bit
first up from makeup revolution they
have this thing called the ultra base
corrector palette problem for me is that
I feel like this is just a palette full
of brightener
everything is so so light I don't feel
like I actually get correction on my
skin but they are a very thin kind of on
the greasy side as far as the
consistency goes so that's kind of a
problem for me but I think the biggest
issue here is that none of these tones
really go deep enough to actually color
correct a dark circle now if the use of
creams on your skin in more ways beyond
just concealing and color correcting is
of interest to you you may want to look
into this palette from Tarte it's called
the wipeout color correcting palette
I've actually really enjoyed this I
think they've got a fabulous formula in
here that's very creamy I mean you just
put your finger in it it feels rich it's
got a nice level of coverage to it you
got two tones of concealer down here I
find one to have a hair more pink and
one is a bit more yellowy but they are
very very close one thing that you can
do to adjust those tones is work in more
or less of this shade right up here if
you're a very dark skin tone you might
use a lot of this orange shade to
correct under eyes or for me I might add
just a little bit of that to one of
these there's also a green in here some
people use this to correct redness I'm
not a huge fan of that but I also don't
have a lot of experience with it either
redness has never been my biggest
problem and any amount of it that I've
had has been able to be easily tackled
by even just a rinky-dink type concealer
that is here for you you've got the
yellow like I said that can add even
more brightness or like a highlighted
effect if you wanted to and then you've
got a nice cream contour in here as well
that I think is a super workable tone
there's a big mirror even with
everything I've tried my Holy Grail
remains to be the array space just
because I love the amount of moisture in
this product the amount of coverage it
has the tone for the way my skin is most
months out of the year seems to be
pretty perfect for eradicating the
under-eye circles or a dark spot this
was also able to tackle much bigger
problems on my skin like the melasma I
was talking about just a quick note
about application on these and you can
use your fingers to apply them I think
fingers really do help the product melt
into the skin also a dampened Beauty
Blender can kind of shear out the
product just a little bit but it's good
about picking up some
says and I think giving you the lightest
feel possible even with some of those
very creamy concealers over the years
I've experimented with a lot of brushes
as well this is my Sigma P 80 and you
know that's a nice kind of not too small
not too large size for getting right in
this area lately my current favorite way
of going about it that I think gives me
the best texture on the under eye area
let's say is to apply the product to the
skin you can easily do that just with
your fingers dab over it with a Beauty
Blender whether it be the micro mini or
whatever size you prefer the micro mini
really hits the area easily and then
maybe I'm just goofy but I swear this is
doing something I blot over it just one
more time with my fingers because I
think it somehow just makes it look even
more natural even more melted into the
skin and then with a lot of the creamy
ones that I mentioned I would dust a
little bit of a powder on top of that to
set it I know that's a personal
preference type thing for me I feel like
I do get an even more perfected look
when this whole area is modified I
experiment with a lot of different
setting powders you can just go to any
random pressed powder you may have that
you really like the by Terry hyaluronic
hydra powder is a great but expensive
powder but it's really nice for you know
the under eye area because it does not
give you the look of dryness whatsoever
it also is just extremely weightless and
then one that I've been experimenting
with it's kind of been my latest thing
that I'm trying out is this L'Oreal
Hydra perfect powder which is you know
intended to be an all-over face powder
but I've been sort of targeting it on
the under eye area lately just to see
what kind of effect I can get there
definitely Modifieds and it is
lightweight but that could be a whole
other topic for a whole separate video
so thank you guys for watching this one
I hope it helped and I will see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
