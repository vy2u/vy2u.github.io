I'm going to be talking about a little
under-eye baking kit
I saw this on altas website $18 for
piece set and I thought you know if this
works this could be a really easy like
one-stop grab it and go baking solution
for everyone I wanted to test this out
for you it's not my first time using it
in this video I have been playing around
with it I just wanted to give it a fair
shot sometimes the first time you use
something you can learn a way to use it
a bit differently the next time you
understand the products a little bit
more learn about things you might change
so hopefully those insights help in this
video but I promise I will get to a room
tour soon let's face it's going to be at
least one trip to Hobby Lobby before we
get everything all squared away because
not only has the paint color changed
that the whole configuration of my room
has changed I've opened up some space
and I may be looking at you know another
little furniture piece here or there and
I've got a few boxes sitting around that
I need to organize back into my
collections so I will be doing the room
tour I'm just not ready to do it yet but
as far as this baking kit goes like I
said it was $18 I thought if it works
really well I think that's a steal the
four pieces that you're getting are a
sponge like a Beauty Blender sponge but
it's a little smaller than a Beauty
Blender a full-coverage concealer they
say loose setting powder and then also a
brush so I'm going to go ahead and cut
to the demo I'm starting with foundation
so you can really see how my skin is
starting and it's a pretty light
foundation and then I'm going through
all these steps okay guys I don't even
want to talk about what time it is all
I'm gonna say is it's not even 5:00 it's
not close and it's a long story but you
know what I'm kind of excited about I
tried one of those OneTouch lattes and
it's quite good yes since I really want
to focus on the coverage level and
everything of the baking kit the
foundation that I'm going to use is
pretty light well I'd say it's like a
medium coverage foundation I'm using the
Neutrogena hydro boost so I have this in
the shade buff and I've use this quite a
bit I actually do enjoy this foundation
if you like the
what's the other one from Neutrogena
little jar a little healthy skin if you
like healthy skin I don't know I see a
lot of similarities between this one and
that one as far as the overall finished
look this one just feels a little
thicker in consistency and I do think it
might offer a little more moisture to
the skin hence the name hydro boost it's
got hyaluronic acid in it
I like the concealer that goes with this
as well actually so I just kind of smear
that all over and I'm going to blend
that out with my sponge real quick
all right dark circles still got em
still got them okay so I want to make
sure I'm going exactly by the directions
on this kit it said soak the blending
sponge in water and squeeze out excess
so I did that and the sponge is nice and
soft I really like the size I like the
shape you know it's good then it says
apply under eye concealer under the eyes
and blend out gently by tapping product
into the skin with the damp blending
sponge
so this says uLTA Beauty full coverage
under-eye concealer I assume this is
sold in their line regularly and what I
was looking at this when I first bought
it I thought man it's kind of like a
light peachy concealer but this kit only
comes in one shade so that definitely
obviously that limits things you know
for the whole crowd of people who could
potentially use something like this so
that's not good
times when I'm experimenting with face
products I feel like the first time I
use it I use too much well actually
yesterday when I was playing around with
this kit I kind of came away thinking
maybe I didn't use enough of this
concealer so I'm adding a little bit
extra today and then as I said I'm going
to use this sponge to blend it out the
consistency of the concealer it's not
super sick it feels a lot like the
consistency of what you might get out of
a like doe foot applicator concealer
format maybe just a little bit stickier
than that
that is pretty brightening although this
stage is a game I can still see you know
when I turn my head I can still see some
shadows there
despite using a damp sponge to blend as
I already kind of feel like this
concealer is grabbing it a little bit of
the texture on my under eye area like
it's just it's not making anything look
really better on me right now but for
coverage sake I'm debating maybe
applying just a little bit more just to
see if I can get it to cover better just
a tiny bit
I'm definitely debating the fact that
this is being called a full-coverage
concealer then it says using the damp
blending sponge apply a thick layer of
setting powder directly under under the
eyes allowed it set for five to ten
minutes so this is what they give you it
just says uLTA Beauty setting powder so
I'll shake that up a bit very light in
tone looks very similar to like my Laura
Mercier loose setting powder but a
little more dry feeling unto the touch
and dip into that and we bake
I'm going to make sure I really bake
bake with this stuff because sometimes I
just I don't do a lot of powder there I
don't know I guess you could say I
usually microwave my under-eye area but
here I want to legit bake this a baking
cake take awhile a shake now I was up so
early this morning
normally cupcakes like always making the
rounds right after I get up you know ask
them for food and stuff like that today
she was just laying there like like this
can't be right
this is not even right I'm not I'm not
even going to ask for food right now but
Eve has been sleeping through the night
really well seeing with the past couple
weeks here has been pretty dang good
but we experiment it last night was
putting her to bed a little earlier and
she woke up quite a bit earlier and then
it kind of got to be the point of no
return where I'm like if I lay down for
bed now then I definitely won't make it
up in time to get a whole video shot
before the whole gangs up so you got to
use a moment right he's the opportunity
this powder is so hard to get out of
that container I'm baking my nose too
even though I didn't put concealer on my
nose or my chin or anything I'm just by
instinct putting powder over those areas
too okay we're going to bake that as
they say for 5 to 10 minutes it has been
about seven minutes I've gone ahead and
done my eyebrows this is the little
brush that they give you with this kit
actually a pretty decent brush like I
could see myself using this for
highlighting maybe or in a pinch like a
little blush brush but it's really soft
and pretty dense and they say brush away
excess setting powder with the fluffy
brush so I'm going to go ahead and do
that and we'll see what we are left with
is the under eye area Matt yes but it
looks thick it looks thick and pretty
textured right now how close I feel like
I look a lot older than I really am and
on top of that I don't think this whole
system really improves the under eyes
servile situation that much like here's
what I'm accustomed to
after I bake like let's say with the
laura mercier loose powder I look up
close at myself and I sense smoothness
like that's the endgame with this you
want to be totally smooth flawless
looking fewer lines fewer indications of
texture and also the under eye circles
should be totally covered like if you're
going to use a concealer that says full
coverage and then you're going to put a
buttload of powder on top of it you want
those circles gone right interesting
thing is the first time I did this I
definitely used a lot less concealer and
I thought you know maybe I just need to
use more concealer and then the circles
will be covered up today I used more it
didn't really cover them up that much
better whether I use a little concealer
or a lot of concealer it still looks
equally like dry and textured and I
think a lot of that's the fault of this
powder it's so-so like dry and chalky
obviously a lot of loose powders are
going to feel dry right you know they're
a dry product but some of them when you
even just rub them between your fingers
you feel them on the skin they just feel
richer they don't feel like they're
totally like zapping your skin of all
the moisture this feels like it just
sucked all moisture and life out of the
under eye area and I applied a pretty
rich eye cream under all this so here I
am back was my finished look I've
obviously done my blush and everything
and my eyes and lips a couple ways I
think that you can sort of salvage a bad
fake job would be to apply some
highlight and also some setting spray
those are two ways to like bring a
little radiance back to your skin with
just brightening your skin color wise
but also helping out the texture with
some sort of setting spray I love the
hard-candy sheer envy primer mist but
still I mean I look up close at this and
I think this was freshly applied makeup
you know it shouldn't look this
Hevy it shouldn't look this Creasy at
this stage in the game and I know as the
day goes on if today is anything like
yesterday was it's going to look worse
and worse with where because my
under-eye area is already kind of dry so
you go ahead and zap all the moisture
from it in this step and it doesn't go
on to look too much better as the day
rolls on
so I would say this kid is a definite
miss for me and that's too bad you know
I was really hoping that it would work I
tried it with the best of intentions but
the concealer is just not full coverage
enough I shouldn't be still seeing so
much darkness underneath and then the
powder is just so dry if you've ever
used powders that really claim to
control oil that's kind of what this
feels like and that's very very drying
up on the under eye area best parts of
this kit probably the sponge and perhaps
the brush I am still just so impressed
with my Laura Mercier waist powder I
know it's more pricey than the entire
cost of this kit but it truly works and
it is hard to find powders that don't
look so dry and powdery and I find it
works over really any concealer I want
to use if I want to use tart shaped tape
if I want to use my own stop to a
concealer benefit erase paste fill in
the blanks you know it still manages to
look really nice and smooth even if I
bake and apply a lot of the powder I'd
love to know in the comments section if
there are any other like cheap setting
powders or cheaper concealers that you'd
like to see me try I'm still open to
testing new things and seeing if I can
come up with a really low cost awesome
alternative so thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you next
time
