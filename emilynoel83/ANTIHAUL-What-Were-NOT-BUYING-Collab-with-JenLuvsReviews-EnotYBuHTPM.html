this has been such a fun morning here so
far we've already done one video this is
Jen from Jen loves reviews I mean we
have done bingo with eye shadows it was
so fun it stretched us to our limits I
feel creatively yes so we did these
looks so little tease there go check it
out on Jen's channel if you're not
subscribed to Jen a lot of you probably
are who watch my videos reviews amazing
content honest feedback a makeup loving
person in this community who really
cares about informing people the right
way so thank you we love you Jen thank
you I love you I love you so much and
this is one of those dream come true
kind of moments for me you know and I
said this on my channel as well as I
just I've been watching Emily for years
like I know a lot of you probably have
been watching her for years and years
and years so if you want to come here
and film videos with her is amazing and
I will tell you the Emily ucn videos
that you love is the same Emily that you
meet a person I mean she's an amazing
person and I'm incredibly humble
incredibly humble and I think that if
you met her and you were sitting where
I'm sitting you would love her just as
much as you love her from your own so I
just wanted to there that you are
subscribed to the right person I mean
just absolutely amazing person so well
you are super kind we said last night
we're just gonna have a Jen and Emily
lovefest I know I love her just totally
the real deal and we had a great time
having dinner last night and just kind
of getting to chat about everything it
was so much fun and in this video this
was Jen's idea to do an anti haul you've
never seen one here on my channel
there's been my reason why and I told
Jen about this last night like I haven't
done anti hauls because I feel like
sometimes it's so much assumptions about
a product and it's like how much
information do I really come away with
when you know the person hasn't tried
the product obviously but there's some
real life-like aspect to this because
this is the thought process we all go
through when we decide whether or not to
get something we're going on what we
have right absolutely and I think
Kimberly Clark who was the one that kind
of got this all going I
think that she had the intention of
anti-consumerism and then we don't need
everything there's so much makeup coming
out every single week and you you can't
buy everything so being picky and
choosey about what you're going to buy
and why you aren't going to buy
something I think is something too you
know that I personally find very
interesting
yeah and if you you know hear us talk
about something like look up some
reviews like look up the full the full
scoop on some of these things if you're
intrigued enough to do so but it'll be I
think fun to hear Jen's take I don't
know what she's gonna talk about she
doesn't know what I'm gonna talk about
and maybe some of these things will be
something that one or the other of us
have tried or love or would recommend
and you know you know we can try to sway
one another a little bit you get in the
comments section give us the info if you
know about some of these products yeah
we want to know sounds like a plan you
can kick it done - no total on my
channel but I think the first thing that
is an entire collection that I'm
personally not going to purchase even
though I love this person of lauda
Haggerty she collaborated with Smashbox
on a collection and it's small rose gold
gorgeousness but I feel like and maybe
I'm just wrong here on this I thought
the price point is way higher than what
the typical Smashbox products are and I
would imagine it Out's because it is the
collaboration with flauta the packaging
is incredible looking and it's very
broad as she does the drippy lips with
the with the you know it's all metallic
and then gorgeous and the packaging is
very true to her and who she is
so I get it but on the whole I just feel
like I don't want to invest the money in
it and I think that's where it's an anti
haul for me here's my question to you
because from a reviewers stand what do
you feel like you have to get the whole
collection like if you're thinking about
reviewing it do you feel like you have
the need to get everything or like if
you just talked about one thing it would
leave people kind of hanging in
you know I mean I feel like with with
reviews if I was gonna do a collection I
wouldn't need at least three things from
the collection I feel like in order to
review it on the channel but just to try
it as a consumer I was really interested
it because I think Vlad is amazing so I
wouldn't be opposed to ordering just one
product but at the same time like in
order to do an actual review I think I
would need at least three I feel like
sometimes pressure to have everything
and I mean there was a time when I
remember doing reviews on let's say a
lip product I had one or maybe two you
know that I would get from the drugstore
and I felt like I was able to provide
good info based on that but now I think
with PR some people are getting the PR
some people are having everything and
then it's like okay if I want to rival
that amount of information I need to
have everything - and what if I didn't
get it in a package so yeah I think it
just you have to kind of go by how
interested and I truly in this yes and
kind of be guided by that because to buy
that whole collection I mean that's a
lot of stuff individual thing is quite a
bit so are you ready for my first
manatee for your first one okay here's
my first one it's the lash stash to go
set from Sephora
you might be thinking hmmm why that
alright it's a set of mini mascaras five
minis high-end brands and I think this
is what I've realized over a few years
using makeup I think the little mascaras
are a totally different experience from
the full sizes it's a big brush in a
small tube and I have felt I've had
drastically different experiences with
the full size of a same mascara that's a
really good point and as a reviewer we
need to have a genuine experience of the
full size I feel like a lot because I
think a lot of people some of the minis
you don't have access to a mini except
for in a set they don't see on the minis
so if we have an experience with a mini
and we pass it information to you and
you buy a full-size and it's different
and I think maybe not every mascara has
that that drastic you know situation but
then there are some mascaras where they
size their minis so squatty and the
brush like for example there's a bobbi
brown one and
the brush is quite frankly gigantic and
then it's like it's just not gonna be
the same experience and if you want to
use that for maybe a couple weeks and
think you can you know form some
opinions after that time I really don't
think it's anywhere close to the same
experience you're gonna have with the
full-sized tube yeah and I think that's
an interesting point that I never
thought of was that the the way the
product collects around the brush in a
small packaging is going to be different
than the way it collects around the
brush and a larger packaging because
it's not like it's a complete liquid in
there you know if you feel it when you
spin a mascara wand inside of a tube you
can feel the space right so that lack of
space is going to impact I never thought
of it like that the end the whole brush
is passing through like in a full-size
you know potentially several a couple
inches maybe of space to pull through
and then when the brush is really
basically nearly the same length as the
tube its living in I don't feel like
it's an accurate representation okay
that's particular to us as reviewers
where somebody that isn't reviewing
makeup and wants to have a year's worth
of mascara could potentially get that
with this kit you know I so I feel like
there isn't definite market for this
type of product because if you can
stretch one mascara for three months and
you can stretch one of those minis you
know which I have in the past stretched
a mini for three months and then you
could potentially have a lot of mascara
for a very low cost and you do get a
full-size mascara of whichever one you
choose that you like at no cost you get
a voucher in there next up I have the
whole Too Faced natural collection that
just came out I decided I'm just not
getting anything from that line and the
big reason why is I feel like it's great
for someone that is starting off in
makeup or has a you know nine-to-five
where they just need natural looks all
of the time but for me personally I feel
like I don't need any of that in my life
like I have the original Too Faced
natural love palette or the was it the
true love or the natural eye the natural
eyes palette I do have a natural love as
well the the big one is a big one I have
that one but it just felt like I just it
wasn't anything that would mean it even
though I was tempted by the lipsticks
because I feel like two-faced lipsticks
are so underrated I feel like nobody
really talks about them they lack REM
line and you and the new ones that came
from the peach line I actually really
really liked those yeah so I I thought
about maybe getting some of the
lipsticks that I was like do I really
need another lipstick like I've got so
many and I probably won't reveal over
the channel so I just decided to pass on
the whole collection well you know I
think it's those eyeshadow palettes the
natural I like they they switched up
like a shaitan yes and then the mattes
was changed in my opinion not for the
better
cuz I reviewed those and I I just really
was into the original natural matte and
right and I just was not jiving with
some of the ways they switched it up but
the face palette what do you think about
that they smell it what do you think I
think it's really cute really well do
you own it Taylor II grow okay alright
it's definitely cute I have to say I
love the print in it I mean the print is
absolutely gorgeous in it lace friends
throughout the whole collection what's
kind of snow it's got like a light it's
it's not like the chocolate exactly all
the more stuff it doesn't smell like any
of the other products it's got almost
like a roll to it yeah it's beautiful to
me it's 100% wearable although it's it's
kind of that convenience factor of okay
it's all in one palette that's handy
although if we're if you're taking a
really hard look at it you might have
you know your pinky tone highlight or
that color of blush on its own or
blondes are sort of like that so and I'm
curious how this would work on multiple
skin tones when this pink is very very
bright so love it yeah love it fresh
right that's your fresh as a daisy pink
there you go it's really really pale
like maybe this might be too like they'd
have to be really really light with it
yeah yeah you'd have to be kind of light
all of these blushes they call this like
a bronze bronze unveil this tropic like
it's hot but it's actually to me
like a really dusty bronze pink mix wash
right and they're all you'd have to be
kind of light handed yeah and then for
deeper skin tones I feel like these
would get just lost most likely let us
know yeah I don't know you guys know
like maybe this one might give a nice
color because it's got that like a mall
B tone to it I can see that my being
Knight might be nice but I don't know if
you have a deeper skin tone I would love
to know how this works on you if you've
enjoyed it
one thing that I think they did right in
changing up like they're sort of palette
style this is durable seaming it's like
sqz I mean doesn't that feel solid -
you've done it doc oh and hey I'm not
popping up super easily either and I
didn't realize on the packaging that it
almost looks like the words are floating
oh that's a that's a good observation
like if you kind of lay it flat you see
sort of a clear layer that's a shadow on
on the white behind the light actually
goes through and leaves a shadow cool
detail really neat in conclusion Jin's
thinking about you know I like it more
now than I did because I saw it in
person I will give it that here's my
next thing it's the Natasha - no no
tropic eye shadow pal that's on my list
- okay what's good it's on Sephora's
website it's a hundred and twenty nine
dollars so I think I mean you want to do
your research on this maybe if you're
thinking about it watch some people who
have reviewed it tried it everything to
me here's just my reasoning in a
nutshell I think there's pretty colors
in here just to look at the palette it's
appealing but I think I need something
to anchor the palette in it in terms of
a dark matte because there's a seemingly
a lot of shimmer even in the dark shades
here dark Mets are a bright shimmery
shadows best friend it's not because I'm
saying oh I really wish I could create a
dark smoky eye out of that it's just you
sometimes needs a little bit of darkness
to pull in to layer up and to make those
bright shades shine and look their most
profound now Natasha - Nona can do
whatever she wants obviously that's my
reasoning and in choosing tonight
right and I think that maybe that might
be better for like a makeup artist who
already has a kit and already has that
you know that one dark brown over on the
side and I think that maybe I'm not sure
if this is the same as busy art but that
she kind of targeted toward makeup
artists at first so that might have been
the logic of why like maybe she's not
going to complete palette route but my
logic was is that I actually swatched it
in store last week and I was not super
impressed especially the the when I took
the name purple and I just watched like
the bottom row because of course that
one looks the most interesting to me
like that's the most different that's
why I would buy it and it's just it
seemed like it seemed a little chalky
like just from watching it in the store
I was very surprised because I do like
Natasha to known as shadows it wasn't
$129 for me but I didn't try it on the
eyes of course I didn't actually you
know use it so I can't judge it feel
completely but at that point after doing
those quick swatches I decided that it
was something I was just gonna pass on
but yeah I think the color selection
like you were saying I think that that
matte Brown would have been really nice
there's a couple of shades in there this
is one thing that drives me nuts about
palettes is that they sometimes will put
shades that are very similar just a tone
up or a tone down like and why why like
is on the eyes they're not gonna look
that much different exactly the it's
this year out to some extent even when
you do pack it on you know it's gonna
look a little less than what what you
look at in the palette and so some of
that stuff I thought well maybe if I saw
it in person those look more those look
different yeah but you probably came
away thinking it was yeah but I think
like yeah exactly so compact component
as you know maybe replacing one of those
mid-tone creamy shades with a dark matte
Brown would have really brought the
palette together I think that would have
been good
in conclusion Jen and I are gonna start
up a business where we just get sent all
the potential palettes in the world and
we just know about it yeah exactly and
there's actually a tornado called makeup
struggles it needs to make me even more
videos that's what she does is she
redesigns palettes so she couldn't she
gives on her opinion it's a really fun
idea alright so my next thing
is the maybelline lemonade craze
eyeshadow palettes I almost put that on
my list I mean I feel like with this I
when I heard Maybelline was coming out
with a lemonade palette I was so excited
I was like that is gonna be so cool I
like Lin and I saw it and it was like
wah wah wah like what it really is this
lemonade
I say lemonade to me it says lemonade in
one very small way to yeah it's very
small I mean I guess they've got a
little pink lemon in there there's that
one shade in there that lemon craze
shame that makes me go oh that's kind of
interesting and then maybe mixing it
with the strawberry lemonade shade but
other than that like I just it's not
wowing me the way that I hope that it
how much are they charging for this are
charging 1319 $13.99 we've got eight
twelve colors a lot of base it like I
mean if you if you kind of cover up that
one pretty yellowy shape there's a lot
of basics in there I mean I was I'm just
not sure I feel like ultimately I might
get it for review purposes but in terms
of of genuine like like I've been a lot
more interested in and I think there
should have been a little bit more of a
like a citrusy pop in this absolutely
just a little more they'd have thrown
like a limeade in there alive and a fun
you know a cherry limeade yeah I'm
curious cuz Dominique Cosmetics is
coming out with a lemonade palette and I
really hope she knocks it out of the
work I do I'm looking forward to it
interesting you'll see what happens with
that here's one Jen from the Ulta
website and it's from cover FX and it's
the gold bar highlighting palette I
almost put that on my list too here's
the thing highlighting palettes they're
everywhere and they all kind of look
like this they do and I'm sure like $39
it probably feels great it probably
looks good like it probably makes your
cheeks shiny and nice but so do so many
things and I just feel like it's kind of
odd that it's coming into the game at
this point because there's been so many
things kind of formatted this way and
just that's my thought and I feel like
cover effects
do better you know they put out some
really unique products some really
creative products yesterday I'm not up
to what cover FX can do as far as the
shade selection I feel like there's so
much more creativity than that and
that's kind of like oh okay
but again may be good for somebody
that's just wanting to try a highlighter
palette maybe has never bought a
highlighter palette maybe that would be
good for them for me it's it's I just
kind of glaze over it I mean and that
was what I was kind of trying to as I
was thinking through what am I going to
talk about here I thought what are the
things that when I see it on a website I
just kind of like honestly don't even
stop and so that was one of those things
right so yeah another one this actually
kind of reminds me of something I
already owned which is why I definitely
would be on my no this is the laura
geller southampton classic face palette
and it reminds me a lot of the lorac
mint palette that i got years ago I have
is exactly what that is Jerry very
similar and I already own that so this
being so similar would be a no I'm also
not the biggest fan of Laura Geller's
press products I feel like she's great
baked products from big highlighters our
baked eyeshadows like I feel like those
are her strong point I don't feel like
the press formula is my favorite so that
one would be a no for me for those two
reasons basically so funny you bring up
that mint fell because that was a while
back it was but I see I look at that and
now that's what I see weakness I really
remember that one so yeah good point
good point okay wet and wild midnight
mermaid box gosh yes okay mermaids
yes I am in support of mermaids I'm not
anti mermaid however I just this is an
example of something where if you look
at what they've put out here on ulties
website it looks pretty all together
it's a thing that if you set it up on
your table it will look nice on display
but I'm not in reality probably going to
be picking out that emerald green liquid
cat suit for my lips and going about my
day like it's just not going to feel
right to me and they've got several
eyeliners several liquid eye shadow
and then a highlighting bar they call it
and it's gonna cost close to $30 and
maybe a color scheme that some people
are like yes finally
absolutely but for me I'm not I think
that some people that's just their thing
is these you know really bright um
unusual put quotes around that colors
for let's greens and yes Richard no
actually I did breakdown and I did get
the highlighting bar that's in there I
do own that and I've tried it and I
liked it with the right look but it's
got that thing that doesn't quite look
natural about it so why I wondered man
it looks cream and then yeah I mean it's
definitely not cream it's got like an
iridescent shift to it where it
definitely sits on the skin it doesn't
blend into the skin as much as I would
like and it's I don't know it just it
stands out like the rest of the
collection it's very appropriately put
in that collection and that isn't as me
like you were saying about he was not as
me as I would yeah you know it's not for
Eddie it looks like just a cool-looking
assortment of things like too you know
yeah I play with and whatever but I just
day to day wear is there any of those
pieces gonna become like essentials to
me fun for here or there but not for
like everyday life okay I've got one
that I'm kind of on the fence about I
just got it it's anti haul for now but
I'm kind of on the fence the BH
Cosmetics at the weekend festival 20
color palette because I've seen some
gorgeous looks created with this do I
want it do I not on it
I ordered it you'll have to tell me how
you like it and maybe that'll push me
over the edge for because I do like the
colors I do and and some of the looks
I've seen are just incredible with this
and I think it would be fun to play with
I think that you know that again that
bottom row that's really drawing me in
you know the mustardy yellow and and the
lime-green
and then tearing that with maybe the
pink in the purple or yeah and yeah I'm
using a measurement like you were saying
about that Brown anchoring it this is
brown is they've given you a magic right
and that's like yeah and they've done
that and I think that that is gonna be
key and creating these beautiful looks
and you've got that white or you could
even lay that white down all over your
lid to make it so right why doesn't my
work you know I just think that this
there's I can think of infinite number
no I mean because in finis forever so of
course I can't think of ever been an
amount of things because eventually we'd
have to stop thinking but you know
there's just so many choices you know
and and especially if I had a smaller
collection this is something I feel like
I would just play with every day for a
month and never do the same look twice
it's it's an experimental palette you
know like it's giving you so much but
you're not paying a lot for it so if you
turn out to neglect you know the bottom
row and be like turns out that's not my
thing
you don't feel immense guilt right
absolutely I mean because it's $18 so
even if you're using six of the shadows
eight of the shadows out of the twenty
you're still getting that's you know
that's if you're using nine of the
shadows it's two dollars a shadow
breaking down the price program now I
don't know this is supposed to be an
anti haul and the more I think about it
the more I think I might want to I think
when I wait for Emily's okay I'll get it
go I don't know what you know
actually here's something that I'm kind
of on the fence about I would like to
hear your take the Kim kardashian-west
k'kaw beauty concealer kit like I'm just
I'm just gonna go put it on the floor
here let me know in the comments section
like what do you think I feel like I
don't need either of the applicators and
I think for the price of the kit would
just like that like I think is like $80
for the kit yeah and I don't want every
piece of it but I kind of wanna I'm
intrigued I kind of want to know how
good it is and I think everybody's got
different under eyes different levels of
darkness different texture and so I
don't always feel like I can just go by
everyone's review and write and feel
like I've got it figured out you know I
mean I just based on the price point and
I just decided that it was gonna be a
note for me on that one I just kind of
let it go I did get to know for me your
you would make a great
emember you know me no um but I did buy
the morio palette so I'm working on
reviewing that and I've only used it
twice at this point so I don't have a
review for it yet but it is coming to
the channel but but I decided that was
the the piece that was the most
intriguing to me from her collection
okay and I decided I wanted to choose
like I mean at that price point and from
basically what I from what I've heard
from different reviews that it may not
live up to the price point I kind of was
like okay which one am I gonna invest in
which one am I gonna invest my time in
so I chose the palette and that was why
I chose not that one it wasn't because I
thought it looked bad or I thought it's
something I couldn't use it was just one
or the other and I chose the itoilet
I'm leaning toward no on it I could be
swayed and if there's a lot of interest
maybe in the comments section this one
the fence the new fancy beauty products
the body lava oh yeah and the fairy
Crockett I thought I didn't include
those things are not any of these are I
watch Jackie I know
and she if you don't know Jackie she's
amazing but I watch a review of it and I
was thinking that looks gorgeous on
Jackie but where in the world do I need
to wear glitter start all over my
hotties like where where do I going I'm
going to the bus stop to pick up my kids
from the bus stop I am going out to
dinner with my husband which maybe it
might look good but can I just use a
highlighter that I already own and
whatever the texture that highlighter
may be it can be used on the butt like
you can assess powders and look do we
you know dewy glowing wonderfulness
absolutely those things yeah I mean I
think if I if I was in my like early 20s
and I lived at the beach and I was
constantly you know walking around with
you know with like a deeper skin like I
feel like it looks beautiful on on tan
to deeper skin I think that body glow
really is shown off and I feel like if
that was me I'd be all about it it would
be mine I would get it but being a much
lighter and not going out in the Sun and
not having these Beach experiences all
the time and just the occasional date
night I don't think it's worth it for me
and my life and my life you think about
the atmosphere you're taking that
product is exactly and yeah probably not
you know that's what I'm saying for me
so yeah it just it's it doesn't fit me
enough to invest in it what else was I
gonna talk about I'm kind of running out
of yeah me too I'm learning I think time
but I do have something that I I feel
like it's been online for a while I feel
like I've looked at it for some time and
continually not gotten it and it's the
storybook cosmetics and all of their
fancy shaped brushes in particular I've
pulled up the what's in a name Rose
brushes $55 they're gonna give you four
brushes and a bag and they look dense
they they look cute but I just how do
you functionally hold that and put on
your makeup that's going to no it's a
really skinny and then it's fat at the
top I'm wondering if you own these how
do you hold it in order to functionally
put it on mm-hmm that's what I'm
wondering like would you have to hold it
at the bulb part in order to like buff
it because I feel like the skinny part
it would I feel like is especially
people with arthritis in their hands
really struggle but it's a small it's a
small thing to grip and they're cute
right but some things like that like
I've been sent for example the mermaid
brushes from Kmart I have those okay and
they're cute but I feel the same like
I've got my Old Faithful brushes I got
just my certain core brushes and it's
very hard for me to move away from my
core brushes and welcome new brushes in
and be like I'm gonna put this in the
rotation I mean really I need to get
better about that because there are
things I'd like to try and stuff it when
it's that important look or that
important Night Out you just want to use
the safe brushes you need the brushes to
come through for you yeah yeah bottom
slightly absolutely I'm not sure I trust
these brushes yeah I mean for me it's
you're all about the grip of it and am I
gonna be able to comfortably and
functionally hold it because if I can't
comfortably hold the brush then I'm not
gonna be able to get the look that I
want and you're gonna drop the brush and
I'm gonna drop the brush and then it's
gonna break and you know my mermaid wing
is gonna fall off and it's not the
mermaids have wings but not the wing you
know Brian thank you yeah I'm anti hold
not anti hold but I even mentally
mentally anti hold them for okay well
the last one that I had on here was the
Kat Von D I am divine palette and you
know there are some definitely
interesting shades in here and the
reason why I kind of decided against
this one was because of reviews that I
saw for it there's a channel his name is
Navy and he swatched them and he talked
about the textures and really there were
only a couple of them that I felt stood
out as something I wanted to own and if
those were sold in singles I would
totally get the singles and especially
after we did die shadow bingo over on my
channel and Emily used some of the Kat
Von D singles and they were gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous she's got them on
now so that even convinced me more that
if these came out in singles I'd be all
about it like the greens and the blues
definitely it's a pretty spectrum it is
but I feel like there's so much more
tendency toward copper and yes I'm
thankful she tried to do something
different and she's good at it I don't
think that the majority of these I think
this would be something I would reach
for as a palette this was such a good
idea to do this was all Jen's idea and
then it was
also her idea to do the bingo which on
her channel that was you you want to
adopt this idea and do this with
yourself or with friends at home like
it's really cool and I am so grateful to
her for coming here and I'm not gonna
cry
I'm sorry um but she she took an
interest in me and and wanting to do
this and I value her so much and she is
a person who you need to find if you
haven't found her yet you need to watch
her videos support her channel she puts
her heart and soul clearly into what she
does and I I just feel really honored
that you wanted to be here and do this
no thank you with Emily Noel 83 and
having her tell me that is the biggest
honor I mean really and truly I mean
she's been an icon on in the beauty
space since the beginning and you know
she's my idol she's who I've looked up
to since the beginning of my channel so
I mean this has been an incredible
experience and thank you so much for
inviting me into your home and allowing
me to come over and play with you
because we've just we've just had a big
play date is what I see is bad and it's
just been a blast it's been so much fun
we've been just let loose in the makeup
room to do whatever we wanted to do and
this is kind of person you're like you'd
like to just have her as your neighbor
