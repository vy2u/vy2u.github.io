this video I hope you're all doing well
this is gonna be a requested video based
on an idea someone gave me asking what
my favorite accessories are favorite
ways to accessorize and I thought this
is great because it's really relevant to
me in my day to day life I am a news
anchor and I feel like at least with
jewelry anyway like I can switch things
up and sort of make my wardrobe look
different you know week after week then
maybe it really is I'm gonna have some
shoes hats purses jewelry everything
like that in this video flea it can help
you kind of spice up your outfits in a
lot of different ways sort of extend
your wardrobe without spending you know
the full cost that it might to buy a
totally new outfit so first off I'm
going to talk about jewelry and one of
my favorite things to do is basically to
wear a pair of big earrings like this
these are kind of gold tone I know
you've probably seen anywhere I'm in a
lot of videos I got these from Claire's
I get a lot of my jewelry from Claire's
and what I will do and this is sort of
like just kind of a personal thing with
my job but you know if I'm wearing a big
pair of ear rings I don't go ahead and
do the necklace just because I feel like
when you're on camera like on TV it's
like you don't want to be overwhelmed by
looking at too many things you don't
want to distract from you know the
message you're trying to deliver so if I
do wear some big earrings I kind of cool
it on on the necklace or just were a
very small necklace or maybe I'll pair
these with a big bracelet which I'll get
to that in a minute but love earrings
like these or you know these kind of
like a matte silver tone I'm also loving
sort of a trend right now so I'm not
sure how long this will last but again
it's from Claire's so it's not really
expensive but I love the feather
earrings these are so cool I got these
from Claire's just recently and excuse
my horrible nail polish I still haven't
redone them from since getting back from
vacation so you
but anyway these kind of are like a
peacock feather style they would look
something like this and even if you've
got long hair you know they kind of peek
through and people are like what is that
so I love the feather earrings and
they're so lightweight one thing I hate
is a big heavy ear ring like so these
you know stuff like this I make sure
it's really light and so I love those
feathers I also got these from Claire's
and these have a cute little like polka
dot feather on there as well and a
little sparkly doodad they're Imogen big
bracelets I love big cuff bracelets or
maybe even watches and these are a
couple of my favorites when I got from
Cato it's like a women's clothing store
and they sell a lot of accessories and I
just thought it was kind of a cute you
know a little cuff bracelet there and of
course you know it's cheap and it was
also adjustable this one came from
Claire's I love this one for that sort
of you know almost stainless steel or
deeper kind of look and it just slides
on so easy and gives you you know
something more going on here and so if
you're doing you say the big earrings
skipping the necklace you got a nice big
bracelet it work all works out let's say
I'm not doing big earrings and maybe I
want the attention to be on a necklace I
think it's great to have a couple of
chunky kind of statement necklaces and I
believe each of these came again from
guess where Claire's and this one is the
nice kind of chunky turquoise look I
wear this on the news a lot and I will
wear it sometimes maybe like the last
time I wore it I think I actually had a
coral top on and I paired it with this
so you know you can mix colors or take
it just with a black or a brown top and
something that's so neutral and really
give it a nice pop and so you can make
the chunky necklace the focus maybe
don't go with this big of earrings but I
love a big necklace like that the sort
of look like kind of rocks and stuff I
mean I love this I'm pretty sure this
was a Claire's I yeah Claire's as well
terms accessorizing your hair I know you
guys have seen it in some of my videos
but I love the little flowers like
little flowers on a bobby pin and I'm
still planning to make some by the way
you know I have I bought some fake
flowers and I was gonna hot glue some of
these together but this is what one
looks like that I got from
I'm not sure if it was clear this was
possibly forever 21 but you can find
these in a lot of places it's just a
little flower on a bobby pin there and
so you've got like that kind of style
others you know maybe the flowers a
little bigger and it has this sort of a
barrette clip and you can use this check
out my bad hair day hair tutorial it's
the kind of thing I did now only maybe
you just add the flour in there or you
can use it as a great way to accessorize
a low bun or you know just be creative
any way you want to do notice I'm
holding up a black one and a white one
and if you're concerned about looking a
little too like headed to the tropics
and that kind of thing you know it's fun
to use colors and if it works for you by
all means but on a day to day basis if
you want to wear some flowers you know
having some neutral colors like this
it's a fun way to add you know a little
something extra to your look it comes to
purses when I was on vacation something
I loved was you know I took my big bag I
have a big pink bag and I didn't always
want to carry that everywhere I went you
know maybe we're just trying out to get
something to eat or you know just going
wherever and I just wanted enough to
keep like my money in it and some lip
gloss and that's about I took with me as
I packed you know a couple different
clutches and you know these are not
gonna be as expensive it's like a full
size bag is gonna be in most cases
depending on brand obviously but I mean
this but each of these actually came
with makeup sets that I have this one
came from Pixie with Target and this
came with the tart set and I just
thought it was really cute and you can
get these in some fun colors and then
they can pop you know with every
different outfit you have to be dressy
or it can be way casual so I think
clutches and fun colors are a good way
to go so a fan of hats I know you don't
maybe see me in hats in a lot of my
videos but one of my favorites is my
little bald cap
st. Louis Cardinals boo and it has the
you know pink stitching and pink
embroidery on it and what I think is
nice about that is this is I mean I
think a ball cap is seen as like a
masculine detail in a look but when you
do have something with pink in it you
know you kind of get that feminine side
in there you don't have to but it's just
I lie another hat that I'm loving is one
that I picked up from Walmart and I
think this is such a cute hat
and I got this just recently and it's
fantastic for you know you're gonna be
outside you're going to some sort of
festival or Fair and you want to look
stylish you don't want to worry about
your hair and you want to kind of shave
yourself from the Sun I'll just show you
how this looks here because I think I
think it's kind of cute people may not
be comfortable with wearing a hat this
size but I think it's actually pretty
pretty neutral like you know it's not
gonna stick out like being oh look at
that obnoxious hat but it is going to
like I said most importantly shade your
skin from the Sun I know I got more Sun
than I wanted when I was on vacation and
it was nice but I didn't want to you
know get sunburnt and stuff like that so
this is a nice little hat to have in
fact I think I like the Hat so much I'm
just gonna leave it on for the rest of
this video but there's not much left
talking about shoes something great to
have this is a great basic in your
wardrobe I'm sure I'm not the first
person you're hearing this from but a
neutral skin tone pair of heels these
are from guests and I got them from TJ
Maxx at a great discount they are super
high of course but they also have the
ankle strap which makes me feel a little
more comfortable but go they go with
anything so I've got this super high
pair and then I wear these as well that
I got from just from shoe carnival they
work under so many different
circumstances today I wore a pair
similar to these with you know the
skinny jeans I have on and they could
look good with a skirt or whatever those
are my sort of style slash accessory
tips these are just some of my favorite
things I know a lot of them are actually
kind of relevant to summertime and won't
come you know the dead of winter maybe
we can do this again but work in some
other stuff but um but I think a lot of
this is is pretty much you know season
to season it can work for you so thank
you so much for taking the time to watch
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
