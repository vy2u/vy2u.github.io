real quick because I have a video that
has just kind of jumped up the list in
my video to-do list because I am so
excited about these products I love a
great low cost drugstore under-the-radar
kind of find and this stuff already won
me over months back and now they've come
out with more what I'm talking about are
the up and up brushes from Target now
they used to be in this kind of black
handle style and I have several couple
of eye brushes from that sort of line
and also this round foundation brush and
I'm pretty sure they still have this
brush in there new silver handle
packaging but just to give you a quick
little back story earlier in the summer
I reviewed the complexion brush set
great little set particularly for this
angled brush which is awesome for
contouring and this little setting brush
great for the under eye just a great
little size and then there's like a
concealer brush and a flat foundation
brush check out my full review on my
other channel for more details on that
but I love just the quality the softness
of these brushes then they have a blush
brush I use this all the time I love
this shape style it's just perfect for
laying down your blush or even your
highlight on top of your blush it's
awesome whoever targets got designing
this stuff and figuring out these
brushes needs some kind of raise because
they've made soft brushes that don't
shed on me and they're really low cost
and then most recently in it Target this
is what I found
they've got a buffing type brush for
your foundation or really you know a
number of different uses if you want and
then a couple of these full concealer
brushes that totally remind me of the
ones that I know and love from Sigma but
these newest few precious that I found
they're just awesome this complexion
brush
I mean it's so soft so dense it puts on
your foundation like so silky smooth I
can't even describe how great this feels
not knock in the Sigma round top kabuki
the f82 but this is kind of the
performance I wanted this one to have
because this one for foundation anyway I
feel like it's so tightly packed it's
not my favorite for buffing out this has
a little more spread to the bristles a
little more looseness going on in there
it just works Haga Singh Lee well I love
it you'll see it applied here with my
Rimmel lasting finish foundation just
kind of DAB that all over then just go
around with this brush buffing it in and
it just does such a beautiful job
I mean it's the thing I want to reach
for when I'm putting on liquidy
foundation it's really kind of similar
to the effect I get from the Real
Techniques buffing brush only somehow
and I can't believe I'm really saying
this it feels even softer on the face
and this is a really soft brush anybody
who's tried Real Techniques brushes
knows those are some soft great quality
brushes but this just oh it's like a
little bunny tail I don't know and then
I could also see this being great for
like a cream contour you know synthetic
bristles just really nice for that
transfer of cream and liquid products
and then this concealer duo one as you
can see is a little bit domed you know
it doesn't come to a real point point
but it's a little more tapered up and
then this other is more flat cut a very
very slight angle and the way I use
these I dabbed on my Bobbi Brown
corrector and bisque on the under eye
area and then I just used that more flat
brush to go over that gives me a very
similar effect to the Sigma P 80 you
know maintaining the coverage of
concealer but still making it look
blended out and these two can be used so
interchangeably I used a little
concealer around the nose and I went for
the one that was a little more tapered
up to get into that you know a little
side of the nose crevice I also use my
little Maybelline instant age rewind
brightener and did that kind of tops of
the cheekbones center of the face and I
found myself just bouncing back and
forth between the two of these to help
blend that out or pull in this
complexion brush for a really quick step
and dab that over your concealer
anything you're applying over you know
larger portions of the face this is so
great for buffing it out so I think you
will love love love this complexion
brush particularly if you are a liquid
foundation user it blends it in
amazingly and then these concealer
brushes if you've been wanting that kind
of effect from the sigma precision
sigmax brushes these two different cuts
i think give you a lot of versatility
and I just can't even explain how soft
they aren't and I haven't really dug
into the eye brushes yet that is
something I want to explore a little
more I'm just looking up the prices here
on my phone this one the complexion
brush is six ninety
and the duo the concealer duo is $5.99
so yeah I just wanted to pass that along
to you also as far as my look goes today
I am wearing this high voltage lipstick
in Hollywood love this red and my little
headband up here you guys know I love
the little top not red gingham great for
spring it's from love factory New York
that's where I've gotten several of
Belle's headbands from and she actually
has a little magic one in this style so
thank you guys for watching I will talk
to y'all later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
