biggest projects I feel like I've taken
on since I started my youtube channel
and that is finding dupes that means
low-cost drugstore alternatives to all
of my Mac eyeshadows
I have 16 Mac shadows I didn't really
start even building my collection of
those shadows until I don't know I'd
been on YouTube for a while and I just
kind of slowly started to get some and I
always felt like when I would go to the
Mac counter because these cost $14.50
for one eyeshadow I would always try to
find those shadows that were not like
anything that I already had you know
that's kind of what's made this whole
experience finding dupes even more
difficult because I've tried to pick the
unique shadows in the matte collection
and though I'm trying to dig through and
figure out you know what matches what
what works what doesn't and it's taken
me so long I mean I've been working on
this for probably since early May I've
been trying to figure out Mac dupes and
there have been several shades that have
really held me up over time you guys
love these dupe videos this is really
where my collection helps me out
big-time because you know it is giving
me lots of options to look through and
find those shades that really pair up
and one tip as well just as you watch
this video and if you're trying to find
dupes in your own collection don't only
go by what the products look like just
side by side in the packaging because
they might look a little different but
you actually have to swatch them to see
just how similar similar or different
they might be I really tried to come up
with exact dupes and I mean things that
are identical we're going to be some
drugstore palettes so I'm going to
recommend and there's going to be like
one Mac dupe in there or in some cases
there's going to be three Mac dupes in
there let's get started the first one
I'm going to be talking about are
actually three this is one of the ones I
was most excited about because it's
three Mac shadows and three colors in
the drugstore palette as well so the max
shadows that I've found dupes for are
shroom this is a light kind of pearly
white shade um cork which is a satin
shade
and it's just kind of like a medium kind
of a cool brown I feel and then the
other one is Naked Lunch which is a
shimmery shade that has kind of a hint
of the Duke that I found for those it's
actually this wet-and-wild palette and
it's called walking on eggshells and you
can see these two side-by-side um
walking on eggshells has that light
shimmery pearly shade that medium kind
of brownish color and then another light
shade that has that hint of pink and
when these are swatch they do look
extremely similar as well I find that I
enjoy the texture of the wet and wild
shadows I think it's better than then
Mac and in all these swatches I didn't
use a primer I wanted you to see how
they actually performed without having
to use some certain primer so yeah what
you see is what you get in terms of
these shadows and I was just really
impressed with wet and wild my next set
of dupes is amazingly another set of
three they are dupes for a nylon which
from Mac is kind of think of the texture
of shroom only with a slight slight hint
of a more golden each other one that I
am talking about is satin taupe right
there and that's a classic that a lot of
people talk about in their matte
collections but that's going to be your
mix of like grey Brown and metallic all
rolled into one and then the other one
is night divine this is a really
shimmery gray that has the slightest
hint I believe a teeny teeny bit of blue
in it so I went through a lot of shadows
lots and lots to find what I thought
worked for each of these shades because
they each have their own little nuance
that makes it sort of unique but in the
NYX rock-and-roll palette this is where
I feel like I found a dupe for each and
every one of these so nylon you know
this shade that's the first in this
palette is really buttery feeling it has
a really nice texture that's very
similar to nylon and then satin taupe as
well in the center here that nice
neutral and the one that was probably
the most bizarre that I found like you
know it's that deep charcoal metallic
gray with a hint of blue right down to
the smallest detail I feel like this
shade is right on the money here from
Nicks so that palette if you get that
palette called rock and roll you're
getting three Mac dupes in there now to
a max shade that is probably one of my
all-time favorite colors because it is
so beautiful and it's called cranberry
and a way I like to use this shade is to
do you say got a dark shade in your
crease a black or a gray or a brown or
something like that and then you want to
warm up the look and you apply a little
bit of cranberry kind of right up here
as you know the color fades up you just
use it real lightly with a fluffy crease
brush and your look has instant warmth
and it's just such a pretty pretty way
to use it so anyway that's cranberry and
there's another shade that you can use
just along the same lines and it is from
NYX and it is a shade called rust so
there's that color and I mean these two
are so so dead-on dupes for one another
and I believe with a lot of the NYX
shadows even though I'm showing it to
you here in a trio I think you can also
find a lot of these individually as well
next shadow I want to talk about is
called twinks and this is one of the
more recent Mac shades that I've picked
up and I must say I like it a lot it's
got a little more richness to it than
say satin taupe does a little more Brown
it's still very shimmery and all that
but this is more like a shade that could
go in the crease or just kind of all
over it's a really pretty color and
there's a shade an individual shade from
NYX that I think is pretty good match
for that actually and it's called
volcano it's got those same brownish
qualities it's highly shimmery really
goes on with just that same amount of
pigmentation like the Mac does next up
we're going to talk about Mac carbon
matte black is what this is so this has
no sparkle to it whatsoever I don't know
how many youtubers I've seen talk about
you know if you want your deepest
darkest black you've got to get matte
carbon well guys I'm sorry to burst
bubbles here but there is a shade for
wet'n wild that is even deeper black and
it makes my max watch look like it's not
that black and it's from the wet and
wild blue had me at hello palette and it
is the matte matte black that's in there
I don't know if there are matte blacks
in any other wet and wild palettes um
but this this is the one that I have and
I swatch these and I thought oh my gosh
the texture is just amazing it goes on
so much more easily with so much less
effort to build up the black color and I
mean I still like matte carbon but this
is the better black and I have a lot of
other individual drugstore black shadows
that I could have said okay here's your
dupe for matte carbon but if I actually
found something that was better that's
the one I'm going to show you so even
though this comes in a palette of eight
colors that's the best black I have this
rat is right up there with cranberry I
think in being an all time Mac favorite
color and it is called beauty marked so
I'm not knocking Mac because they do
have some great shades and this is one
of those unique colors that you look at
and you can see it just kind of feel
like I'm got a new either but this is
this is so gorgeous I mean it's it's
deep it's dark but as you can see it has
the little bit of plum and a sparkle and
okay where am I going to find a dupe for
that it's right here in the petal pusher
palette from wet-and-wild right here
it's a shade labeled crease and this is
pigmented and rich and like I said I
love that buttery texture that I feel
like some of these wet-and-wild powders
head'll and easily and if you can get a
dupe I mean you're getting eight other
shades here as well if for a much less
than you're paying for this color right
here and I really enjoy this palette and
I use this palette quite often next I
want to show you a shade called tracks
from Mac and this shade looks absolutely
stunning in the packaging because as it
catches the light it's like a purpley
lavender with a lot of gold undertone
going on there and I must say it's more
pretty to look at in the packaging than
it actually turns out to be in the
swatch so just keep that in mind this
isn't like one of those shades that I'm
so in awe Oh
but I did find a shade that's pretty
similar to it and it's one of the Milani
baked eyeshadows in fusion and this is
interesting because it in its in a
different format this is one of those
examples of a shade that looks different
from the Mac and the packaging because
this is lavender sort of marbled with
gold but when they are swatched they do
look a lot alike
next is a matte shade from Mac I feel
like a lot of times we hear people say
Mac and Mac and it's hard to get them
it's easy to get them confused but this
shade is called blackberry and I really
like this shade this is very a very rich
matte Shanter a lot of digging around
and I found a shade that is a dupe for
this and it's from elf it's one dollar
guys and it's in the duo called berry
mix and it's the deeper shade of the two
obviously and it's a lot it's a lot like
the Mac the Mac I feel like is a bit
richer it comes off with just a little
more pigmentation but they are so
similar in color that you could build
this up this elf one with a primer
builds up to be pretty much the same
thing as Mac I think Mac's star violet
is beautiful metallic it's got purpley
pink tones to it it's so so pretty I
mean if you pack this on your lid or you
use this to kind of blend out a deeper
shade in the crease it's so pretty
but there is something you can spend
less on and it is the duo from hard
candy baked eyeshadow in secret
rendezvous and it is the deeper shade of
the two and these swatch to be pretty
much twin sisters I want another joyed
this duo actually quite a bit the
lighter shade is wonderful so I'm happy
that when I am recommending a shade that
comes from a duo or a palette I really
like the palette as well and I would
recommend picking it up this is one of
the first Mac shades I ever purchased
and it's called sketch and this has been
sort of a difficult shade to find a dupe
for because okay it's got it's not
totally matte but it's not super
shimmery either and while it looks like
kind of a plum it has a certain amount
of Brown to it a brownish plum is what
this is it's very deep it's a nice
contour rounding around trying to find
the best shade I could and it comes from
a covergirl palette it's the eye
brightening shadows that they've made
for different eye colors this is the one
for greens it's called vivid greens so
for green eyes and this shade right here
at the end and it really really is a
dead-on match if not a little more on
this is a little more soft the covergirl
one is a little more blendable now we're
getting to the shades that were the
ultimate most difficult shades to find
dupes for and you might be surprised
because these colors aren't like the
most
you wouldn't think they're the most
unusual shades ever but like I said
there are a lot of little details a lot
of little nuances when you're swatching
and trying to find dupes that can make
it so hard on a shade that I have from
Mac here is a matte color called
hand-written
it's a nice deep brown but when you
start looking through your Browns you'll
find that some are cooler some are
warmer some might have a little bit of
pearly you know pearlescent shimmer to
it some might be a little lighter darker
there are so many Browns that are made
in the world of eyeshadows so finding
this one was so hard and this held me up
on making this video so you can blame
that eyeshadow if you want to if there's
a shade in the revlon colorstay
quad here and coffee bean and it would
be that deepest darkest shade down there
it's as close as I could get guys I mean
if I'm looking for a dupe for
hand-written when I run out of this or I
don't feel like using it anymore this
will be the one I will go to for that
similar look and finally the ultimate
troublemaker of the whole bunch number
16 this is a shade from Matt called wood
winked this is really popular and this
is actually more unique than it looks
because when you swatch this shade this
is very metallic but it's not brassy
there are so many Gold's in my
collection that I felt like I would
swatch them side by
with wood winked and think it's - it
looks like you know some sort of brass
fixture on your door or something like
that you know it just was too brassy it
had too much orange in it
this didn't doesn't have a lot of orange
tone to it it is a it is a soft golden
color that has a lot of just neutral
qualities to it and so swatching
swatching swatching my buns off and then
finally I came to butternut this is a
quad from elf and that color right there
in the corner is actually SuperDuper
similar and it just kills me because
I'll try everything I've gotten then I
come to my one dollar elf quad and what
do you know there it is there's the dupe
color there so I'm satisfied with that
it takes a lot to get me satisfied with
these dupes because I held off on making
this video so long because I wanted them
to be as close as they could be for you
and I know I could have opened up a
Coastal Scents palette and probably
found to do it more easily because
you've got such a range and such a you
know those tiny variations I'm talking
about in colors can be found in those
palettes but if you only want one or two
shades one of those palettes could be
more expensive than a matte than a Mac
shadow you know what I mean one of those
palettes might be twenty dollars and if
you're just going for one then you know
you lose that bargain aspect I guess is
what I'm saying here so I wanted to show
you what you could pick up from the
drugstore or order from a you know
drugstore discount type website to get
shades that you don't have to spend
$14.50 for I got to say it's it's almost
makes you a little bit like oh my gosh I
really spent that now that I'm finding
some shades that are even better than
the Mac you know what I mean so it kind
of makes you regret your purchase but
anyways thanks again for watching have a
great day and I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
