all about spring fashion I found a few
cute little outfits here and there and I
thought I'd just try them on for you and
compiled them into a video I'm here in
my bathroom I've rigged up some kind of
mirror situation so you can actually see
what I have on I need to work on that I
know it's kind of hard to gauge in a
video like someone's height I am 5 feet
tall so hopefully that gives you an
indication with some of these dresses
and pants like maybe how they would work
for you because you're seeing them on a
shorter person here so keep that in mind
all right so this is my first outfit
this is a high-low dress from forever 21
I totally got this idea from Lola
Maurice Evans channel did an outfit of
the day in this dress and I just thought
it was the cutest thing and I thought
I'd be able to wear it you know more
casual or I mean you could throw a
little jean jacket over this and make it
really casual or dress it up a little
bit I know the dress you could kind of
probably see-through it to the back of
the room it's kind of cheer on the top
layer but right in here it does have
sort of a lining to it so that's nice it
came with this little belt it's dark
brown and gold and the leopard and it
doesn't really get to a black leopard
print but it's like really dark brown
and tan it's a little bit gathered right
in here typical tank top type wide
sleeves here so you don't have to worry
about a special bra that's oh it's good
I'm wearing this with some wedges these
are from Target they're just dark brown
and sort of cork colors are wearing it
with this bracelet just something to
play off of the golds and the brown and
also if you can see them here some gold
earrings as well as for a frame of
reference here I have this in a size
medium I as I said I'm pretty short but
I'm kind of curvy here and here so this
size really did work well for me I
ordered it online and without the heels
if I wear a learn fly
you can see the dress isn't dragging the
ground but it is pretty much all the way
down there so I think I'll like wearing
this with a little bit of a heel most of
the time okay another high-low dress
this is another forever 21 item it's a
little shorter all around so a little
shorter in the front shorter in the back
it's quite a bit more fitted than the
other one I had on and it kind of has a
t-shirt type feel but I just chose to
throw on this brown belt here and it
kind of coordinates with my brown shoes
same wedges I had on before else to keep
in mind with this dress and it's really
hard to show but there is kind of an
open circle here in the back so
depending on how your prize' fitting you
you may have a little strap showing
there so you might have to adjust that a
bit but this is a really super
comfortable dress and here's a look at -
the belt and the shoes it's like the
other one is a size medium hot pants a
little more casual outfit Here I am
wearing the little top that I had on in
my last video my favorites video it's
kind of pale yellow and it has these
cute little studs up on the sleeve I got
this from forever 21 I know a lot of
forever21 stuff going on these pants are
pretty cute they're actually from
Walmart for ten dollars these do have
little like back pocket details seams
down the side a seam right here that
might make you think oh there's a button
but there's not it's actually just a
stretchy waistband these are just really
stretchy like use but thicker there's a
really nice thickness to them and they
actually are sold as an ankle pant but
you know with my height they're a little
bit longer they fit just almost like a
traditional you know skinny jean Mike's
wearing this with an old pair of
flip-flops that have a little bit of a
wedge to them I got these in size medium
and I
we got two other colors and these I got
the really royal blue and black just
because I thought you know I get a lot
of use out of the black probably but
this is just a really comfy outfit for
maybe running around getting some
groceries our oh you obviously wouldn't
have to pair these two colors together
but I've always loved pink and yellow
together like I like wearing yellow in
my pink room so this is kind of like the
exact color of my pink makeup room okay
this last outfit is kind of just
something fun gonna go to the bar and
watch a baseball game eat some wings and
have a Bud Light I don't see the same
sandals I just had on just a simple kind
of brown strap nothing too fancy or too
formal this is a skirt I've had for a
while it came from Aeropostale I think
it's shirt I love it it's like a vintage
Cardinals t-shirt not truly vintage
though I got it from Old Navy and I just
thought it was really cute instead of
being you know that bright fire into in
red it's just kind of more of a muted
like faded peachy color and I'm guessing
maybe Old Navy carries just the regional
teams you know wherever your Old Navy
store is so for example my store had
Cardinals and a couple other teams we
don't really need to talk about on here
it actually comes down really long on me
so I folded part of it up there just to
bring it to a length that I thought
works more for my really short torso
here but yeah I kind of see this is just
you know hanging out with the guys kind
of outfit not really pregnant press
anybody but still look cute do you love
the transformation my hair took in this
video good lord
I'm just trying to keep it out of my
face so you can see some of the tops
that I had on more easily but I hope you
liked this video it was kind of fun to
do fun way to show you some of the new
things that I've gotten recently in a
little more visual than just trying to
hold them up but right of the camera
like I usually
and just like with shopping your stash
makeup-wise I think every season you
know give your closet a look and see how
maybe you compare some different items
that you haven't worn in a while it's
something you really know you're not
gonna wear give it away
plenty of organizations out there that
can use you know your old clothes from
Goodwill Salvation Army shelters in your
area so keep that in mind too so thanks
again for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
