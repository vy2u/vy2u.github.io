in for this video this has been a much
requested video about nails specifically
the glue on nails that I wear so often
I'll get asked you know are those
acrylic nails do you get those done in a
salon and the answer is no I have never
ever gotten my nails done that way I've
always used these when I'm not just you
know feeling like actually painting my
nails I use these blue on nails which
are actually very easy to use very
inexpensive you know a box of these on
average will run you you know maybe five
dollars on average a little more a
little less depending on what brand you
get even my friends will ask me you know
where did you get your nails done I'm
like in my house on my couch you know
because I did it myself
I'm not dealing with quite the damage
that the acrylic nails will give you but
I'm getting the very same look of that
really you know nice polished you know
professional clean neat looking nail you
know you some people talk about well
that's still damaging because you're
still putting glue on your nail but at
the same time you know if you are
removing these in the right way if
you're doing it gently and just really
taking care as you do that process
you're really not going to leave your
nails in poor condition I feel like my
nails are still strong even after I take
these off and I've used them you know
quite a few you know I guess box is
worth in a row quite a few applications
and I still feel like my nails have not
lost much of any strength through this
process so I will show you at the end of
this video how to take them off but
first I want to talk about some of the
best brands of these so when you're
looking at that wall of nails in your
drugstore or at you know Walmart
Walgreens wherever it may be what is
actually a good nail to use for that now
many of these nails are designed to stay
on for about seven days so you can put
them on they'll be good for a week and
many of these brands advise you not to
wear them past the seven days so keep
that in mind if you're you know kind of
planning and you know what events or
what sorts of things that are going on
in your life that you want to have nice
nails for you
kind of plan around that I can probably
count the amount of times on one hand
that these nails have come off
prematurely and I feel like you know
some things you want to keep in mind
which I will go through when I talk
about application are the size of the
nails the better they fit your nail the
less you have to kind of stretch that
nail out to actually fit on top of your
natural nail the better it's going to
stay on there the longer it's going to
last it's going to be very unlikely to
pop off and for that seal that the glue
is formed to start to break because the
nail if it wants if it's too narrow and
curved like that and then you try to
squash it down on a wider nail it's
going to be more likely to want to pop
off and that glue is going to lose its
bond so hopefully that makes sense there
you really need to pay attention to the
fit and think about the size of your
hand when I go through some of these
different brands of nails it's going to
start to make sense to you okay if I
have smaller hands I might want this or
if I want shorter or longer nails this
or that so let's just go ahead and get
started and I'll tell you about some of
the different brands that I liked no
need to ask me at the end of this which
brand stayed on the best because I have
had a good experience with all of these
they all had really good staying power
for me so that's why I picked them I yes
even though I'm telling you about five
different brands here you know I've
still tried others that did not work as
well as these so keep that in mind and
if first off if you have small fingers
and small nails I would highly recommend
the Broadway real life Petit's and so
these are an extra short nail here you
can see by the models hand they're you
know they're very natural-looking but
what makes these very easy to apply as
well is these nails have kind of a tab
there so when you go to put them on and
you've got glue on your finger you go to
place that nail on and you don't have to
touch your finger at all or get glue on
your hands and this breaks off
completely clean to where you've got a
nice finished nail there and you can
just toss the little tip and the
real-life petites are some of the
shortest nails that I have use you can
see the white part there is very very
short
so you're really going to if you're not
a person who is used to wearing fake
nails at all and you're not going to
really have much of an adjustment that
you have to go through to make these
work in smaller hands smaller fingers
and nails the Broadway real life petits
are a very good choice especially if you
like a very very short nail next I have
a suggestion for those who maybe like a
little bit longer nail and these are a
medium length whereas the other ones I
talked about were a petite length these
are medium and this is from kiss and
it's called custom-fit and you get a lot
of different sizes here and all the
brands that I'm talking about you're
going to get anywhere from 36 to 24
nails this is on the high end of that
you're going to get 36 nails and 20
sizes here so if you have difficult to
fit nails and this specifically
recommends for flat nails so if you find
that you've used nails like this in the
past and you've really had to kind of
stretch that nail his head to you know
really be flexible and kind of stretch
itself a little bit to fully cover the
surface of your nail and then you may
want to try these out
it says perfect for her to fit nails you
get a lot of different sizes there's
also a little moon where the cuticle is
I don't know if that's showing up but
right there at the bottom you can see
this little bitty arch right right there
and that's called the cuticle moon and
you can see the length is a little bit
longer and I can show you what some of
those other ones look like that remain
in my box here so a little bit longer
nail um I have the feeling you could
probably get these in a shorter length
too but if you feel like you have kind
of a wide nail area or a flat nail area
these might be a good thing to try
they're very natural-looking too and
there's nothing strange about the color
or just the overall appearance it's
still just kind of a classic French
manicured look now if you're not such a
big fan of the French manicure if you
don't necessarily love the high contrast
that you know going from white to you
know that kind of nude pinkish peach
color if you want something that's going
to look a little more
unnatural consider this other Broadway
option called nude French deceptions and
these are really neat because the nail
is not quite so um you know stark white
on the tip um what I have is says the
most natural moon and it's a softer
white tip so what I have here I've worn
these before and I had a lot of
questions about it because they are kind
of unique but you can see see how the
white tip there is much more subtle so
if that's something you want to try
maybe you always do nails like this and
you just want something that's going to
appear a little bit different a little
more natural perhaps try this these are
in a short length so they're not quite
as short as those petits that I showed
but they're still very much in you know
a short easy to wear length and again
they just look a little more natural now
sometimes maybe you've got a prom or
some big event to go to and you want to
jazz up your nails a little bit make
them look a little more fun probably my
favorite brand of nails that really does
have cute designs on them are the Revlon
runway collection not only do they stay
on well and you have a variety of sizes
you get 24 nails in there but there are
some really cute patterns on them this
one that I have for example is sequence
and you can see that they've just got
that really cute little on you know
silvery border there on it just super
cute finally I'm going to tell you about
a just a go to brand one of my favorites
again I've liked all the ones that I've
talked about but if you're looking for
classic really super durable nails on
the nailin so natural chip proof are
really really good and what I have is
this short length square shape it says
three times longer wear more comfort
more natural you get 24 nails and 12
sizes and they look really good I mean
they're really natural they're very easy
to manage length and they really don't
chip off not too long not too short I
think they really wear very well and I'm
going to show you how to put these on so
when you get your nails I'm using my
nailing so natural
nails is an example here you're going to
get a tray of nails this one contains 24
some of them are obviously on my other
hand right now but you also get a small
glue to use you get a file that you're
going to want to use to file your nails
down before you apply them and then you
also get a little a tool that you can
use to either clean out under your nails
or push your cuticles back so what
you'll notice on this hand is that I was
able to apply these nails without really
any gap between my nail and my
surrounding cuticle area so the nail is
on there and you're not seeing any of my
natural nail there it's a very good fit
and I was able to find a good fit for
all five of my nails on this hand and
the same as you know what I was able to
find for this hand as well first thing
you're going to want to do is actually
give your nail a little bit of a file
here if you need to sometimes if you're
going with some of these really short
nails and you may want to basically get
the nail just trim down a bit so go
ahead and do that if you need to next I
would go ahead and apply maybe a lotion
to my nails I like the Vaseline
intensive care healthy hands and nail
cream and so just apply a little bit of
that and this is going to really help
you push your cuticles back the reason
why you want to push your cuticle back
is because the further back you can you
can put your nail the longer it's going
to last it's not going to show as much
when the nail grows out so I'm going to
use this little tool and you can see
it's got kind of a flat side there and
now since I've put that lotion on there
my cuticle is very easily just pushing
back a little bit for me next I want to
find a nail that best fits this finger
so you know it may take a little trial
and error but before I ever glue it on
I'm just going to sit it on there and
I'm looking for a nail that's not having
to stretch or really you know expand it
all to fit the nail you want it to just
naturally sit on there without having to
really change its form the more it has
to change its form the more likely it's
going to pop off prematurely so I think
I've found one that's going to work here
so then I'm going to take my glue and
apply that glue all over my finger
you may notice instructions on the Box
tell you to put it on the finger and the
artificial nail but I kind of feel like
that way I end with end up with too much
glue and it's really seeping out along
the edges so I'm just going to apply it
directly on to my natural nail and if
you're in a good lighting situation
you're going to be able to tell when
you've gotten the entire nail covered
get that glue all the way from the
bottom all the way to the tip of your
nail and you don't have a whole lot of
time to work with this because soon that
glue is going to dry it doesn't take
long next you could use a pair of
tweezers if you wanted to just to get
your placement right but once you place
this nail on really push it down first
so you want to go down like that and
then press it at the tip okay so you're
really anchoring that nail right in next
to the to the cuticle and then pressing
it down and I'm holding it very firmly
right there on top of the nail you don't
really want to want to press on either
side here near the side cuticle because
then you're likely going to smush out
some glue so press right on top of the
nail it may even help if you can press
your finger down on some kind of surface
that's near you and kind of press on top
of it that way or just like I said use a
finger that is drive it has no glue on
it press right on top so now I'm going
to go ahead and repeat this process on
the rest of my nails here and I'll join
you when I'm done okay guys so here we
are with the finished product you can
see the nails are now on there on all 10
of my nails they feel very secure they
also are just completely the right fit
don't try to make a nail work that does
not want to fit your nail and if you've
tried I mean there's enough sizes in
these kits that I think most you know
are going to fit your nails however if
you have you know wider nails or more
petite nails pay attention to some of
the recommendations I gave earlier also
with these little nail glues these are
nice to keep with you in your purse I
have not had issues with these like
coming undone and spew
all over your bag that would be a
nightmare but um it doesn't hurt to keep
this with you just in case you know you
do slam your hand you know as you're
shutting your car door and a nail comes
off or something like that so if you do
want to be able to repair it very
quickly you can do that if you just keep
the glue with you now probably the
second most asked question regarding
nails other than how you put them on is
how you take them off so here's a look
at some video of me taking off the nails
that I used before this set here now
when it comes to taking off your nail
some many of the packages on the back
will give you some directions for that
specific kind of nail however I've tried
a lot of different kinds and across the
board the general recommendation is to
soak your nails in an acetone nail
polish remover and it will allow the
artificial nail to basically dissolve it
will soften and you can kind of peel it
right off so like what I have here is a
Sally Hansen vitamin E and aloe quick
off and moisturizing nail polish remover
and it does have acetone however I do
run into some scenarios where the nail
is just like clearly it's not you know
that heavily glued on like towards the
end of say you know your week your 7
days that you've worn them they're about
ready to come off and like in that case
with this one it's just like a matter of
just kind of popping it off like
sometimes they do come off just that
easy and then you might still have a
little glue residue and at that point
you know you may want to give your use
your nail polish remover give it a soak
and really clean off the nail ok guys I
hope that thoroughly explains for you
you know how to use these glue-on nails
it's an inexpensive way to get a really
polished look it's something that you
can do fairly quickly I mean I've gotten
to the point where probably in about you
know 15 to 20 minutes I can get these on
and you know that takes into account
looking for the nails that fit best and
you know finding this the right match
for your nails you may run into some
sets where the nails are actually
numbered so like if a number 3 fit your
ring finger on your left hand you may be
able to find that same one
put on your right hand and that may sort
of speed up the process a little bit not
every nail comes that way but hopefully
from this video you've gotten ideas of
some good brands how to put them on and
how to take them off so thanks so much
for tuning in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
