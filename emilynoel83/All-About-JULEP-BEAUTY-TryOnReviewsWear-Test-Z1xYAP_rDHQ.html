what I want to do in this video is
really just dig in to a new brand that's
kind of unfamiliar to me overall and it
is julep beauty
now julep definitely got some attention
from me and the Emily awards in the lips
video where I was talking about liquid
lipsticks matte liquid lips and they had
this great litmus that I had tried I
bought that whole vault of different
shades the colors really appealed to me
the formula the application I just felt
like this brand was doing so many things
right with a very I think difficult to
nail and difficult to perfect type of
product so when I come to this
realization like oh my goodness I really
enjoy this I remember looking at julep
on altas website realizing oh my gosh
they've got tons of different things
that I just never really explored and
some time after the Oprah video I think
it was on Instagram julep had reached
out to me and said we'd like to you know
send you a few products could you give
us your address I thought that was
really cool of them I'm like okay
wonderful thank you so much and let me
tell you what they sent was like a a
large shoe box sized box just 100% full
of makeup products no filler no like
random PR goodies it was just 100% full
like as full as the Box could hold of
their makeup and a note saying yeah
we're so excited here you left our lip
full and can't wait to see the looks you
whip up with these and I thought that's
really a makeup mailing done right in my
eyes because it's just about the makeup
so thank you to look for reaching out to
me thank you for your generous package I
have had so much fun playing with some
of these different things and I must say
there's a good chunk of what was sent
that is skincare related that I haven't
even tried yet
and there are quite a few different
things like skin oils and cleansers and
different things that I think I'll
really be interested in using but I'm
gonna probably dive into that in a
separate video and you guys know it
might be a while because I really like
to use skincare products over a period
of time to understand how they're gonna
work with my skin before I come to you
and declare that it's great or not great
or whatever but I have been playing with
these makeup products on and off for a
couple weeks so I thought this would be
a great place to just kind of discuss
with you guys and you could tell me in
the
section what things you love and enjoy
from this brand because like I said I
feel like kind of a newbie here the lip
mooses definitely drew me in to the line
and now I'm here for whatever else they
want to show me and let me tell you this
when you try a really outstanding lip
product from a certain brand it seems
like they almost always have some other
really good lip things - I've noticed
this from like high-end brands drugstore
brands I think of Neutrogena for example
they make several different really
amazing lip products just a little tease
here juleps got some other good lip
stuff too so I've already got foundation
on today I'm wearing my Fenty Beauty Pro
filter in what is it one ninety just
wanted to get some more use out of this
foundation it's not necessarily like my
tip top favorite but it does a pretty
decent job for me so I want to get some
use out of that and then juleps sent
these cushion complexion five and one
skin Perfector with tumeric like pins
their little clique up pins and all the
packaging is sort of this gunmetal e
silver look which i think is very luxe
seeming very nice you can see the color
you're getting through a little window
on the side and then when you take the
cap off you've got this sort of cushiony
tip that's very very soft and flexible
and you're going to click the product up
a few times it's kind of like a smaller
more pinpointed version of the
Maybelline age rewind concealer zits
kind of like that comes in a boatload of
different shades and I'm using one forty
buff so they're definitely several
lighter than this and tons deeper than
this too it says it's going to conceal
correct illuminate blur and brighten
with this effortless and multi tasking
stick and they claim that it's buildable
so I'm going to definitely work this in
around my under eye area
I think the fenty foundation was pretty
perfect to use underneath this because
it gives me sort of a medium coverage
here it doesn't completely eliminate all
my flaws so we'll be able to see sort of
what this pin is doing so I put this on
any areas where I kind of want to
brighten up here and then I'm just gonna
use a flat foundation brush to blend
this out and what I've noticed about
this product is well I think it is nice
coverage I feel like it's a little bit
drying like I think there's a texture
that could some concealers can go into
where yes they're lightweight but they
are simultaneously also a little bit
drying on the skin like if they just
contained a little more moisture they
would look a little more fresh because
see I feel like that was pretty good
coverage on the under I've still got a
little dark circle peeking through there
and granted this is not a corrector this
is more of just a skin tone concealer so
I'm not really shocked by that but
overall coverage on my skin is pretty
good but after blending it in and I've
noticed this after on top of all sorts
of different foundations that I've used
I just I see more texture I've used much
less of this product and still had the
same kind of take away and they say it's
buildable and I feel like I need even a
little bit more right in here so I'm
going to add a hair more
I feel like the product really has
potential and for some people who have
like very little texture to the under
eye it might be just fine but for me I'm
starting to notice a little bit more
there now they've got a powder they've
got an insta filler invisible finishing
powder so let's pop this open it's got a
magnetic closure I do love those I've
always kind of been of the mindset that
invisible or translucent powders aren't
truly invisible they do deposit some
amount of color on the skin and no my
under eye doesn't need to be like
majorly powdered right now but I just
want to show you for effect like what
this does it adds some added like
modification to the face which can come
off as a bit more of a perfected look
you know but it's not gonna add like any
additional coverage to my face and it's
another one of those products where I'm
kind of coming away feeling like yes
it's fine but you know even LA Colors
has recently put out something that's
very much along these lines and works in
a very similar manner now they've got a
bronzer in this square compact called so
radiant diamond powder bronzer and I
have it in medium tan so this is the
shade we're looking at it looks like a
very appropriate shade here when it's
not totally in the light you can see the
shade coming out of it a little bit more
but yeah there is some gentle sheen to
this and it's very very natural-looking
it's very I guess appropriate realistic
might be a good word to describe it I'm
gonna use my ELF complexion brush with
this and just pick up some of this
product and put it up here where the Sun
might hit and sometimes bronzers are
really tricky for me to use on camera
because in person I feel like it's
showing more but my lighting sometimes
washes out the effect ever so slightly
but what I love so much about this
bronzer is how it's perfectly walking
the line between you know being a good
just standard bronzer and having just
enough realistic sheen to where you put
it on your skin and it just looks right
and I'm gonna even put a little bit
right in here like I'm trying contouring
just up a little bit higher than usual
like a little closer to where I would
apply blush and I feel like it's
complementing my face shapes so well so
I'll apply a little bit of that in that
kind of
zone but it's just it's hard to describe
this is just a very gentle very good
bronzer it reminds me just a little bit
of like a two-faced son bunny type thing
you know that bronzer has some Sheen and
that's probably even more glowy than
this bronzer this is just a really
subtle nice realistic pretty skin
bronzer I'm gonna dust a little bit of
this where the Sun might naturally hit
you can see it there just on top of the
cheeks like isn't that healthy and nice
looking okay we're bronzed up and now we
have some sticks they sent some of these
jumbo and we're talking jumbo sticks
they are cream to powder blush sticks so
many things that are sometimes described
as cream to powder just simply aren't
and I do think these definitely follow
that texture where they feel creamy as
you're touching the stick there's a
creaminess to them and then as they
transfer on to skin and blend out into
the skin they feel a bit more dry and
they're easy to blend out you can most
definitely get the job done with your
fingers or you could pull in a brush if
you want to but it's not necessary the
thing to know about them though at least
every shade that I've been sent there's
a lot of shimmer in here so if you're a
matte blush lover you got to kind of
watch out for these I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch out the shades for you again
the packaging is that sort of gunmetal
look super big stick here this is peony
pink so as you'll see in comparison to
the others this is sort of a cool pink
and definitely some shimmer golden guava
is much warmer and has kind of a golden
shimmer throughout that shade so you can
see that's much more peachy desert Rose
is so pretty this kind of warm rich
dusty rosy bronzed loving that kind of
shade right now and then they also sent
a moonlit sand and this seems more like
a highlight kind of reminds me of the
look perhaps of a Becca opal you know
it's got that little bit of pink a
little bit of beige happening there but
just looking at them very closely
they all have shimmer but this peachy
one here which one was that the golden
guava that one has some actual
identifiable micro bits of glitter in it
so that's gonna definitely show as this
product shears out across the skin the
others maybe I would describe is a
little bit more mitts
Halleck in finnish hillary i want to use
and i've played with all of these my
favorite one the one that i enjoy the
look of on the skin the most is this
desert roads i like it on the outer part
here of the apple of the cheek and it
blends out so easily i almost think i
could pop this on my skin and my
three-year-old would be able to blend
this out with her fingers there's a
future video idea right you guys have
asked for her to pick out my makeup and
i think that is gonna be a really fun
video to do but it's so pretty so easy
doesn't leave any kind of funky like
residue texture on the skin so pretty
pretty cheeks okay so the things i've
liked best so far the bronzer and this
particular blush stick in desert rose
maybe I should show you a little bit of
the moonlit sand just so you can see
what a highlighter tight shade in this
format might be see how I don't know if
it's picking up on camera but it's got a
little depth to it it's not like a
straight up light pearl it's got a
little pink a little beige but it most
certainly does give off some glue easy
to apply like the other the formula
seems 100% consistent throughout all the
sticks okay so there's that and then
I've got this highlighter powder it says
glow highlighting powder in champagne
this just kind of looks like butter it's
got that lightest golden tone to it when
you look at really closely you can pick
up on just some any bddd tiny flecks of
shimmer I'll put a little bit of this
just right on the top of my cheek so you
can see what it's doing
I think this looks best when I take the
extra effort to kind of buff it into the
skin this is the weird thing with
highlights some of them you'll like just
lay across your skin with practically
just one or two strokes of the brush and
it seems to look just perfect and then
there are others where they just need a
little more like buffing into the skin
for whatever reason and it makes them
look a little bit more just I don't know
one with the skin and this is kind of
one of those but I'm not blown away like
it's nice it's fine it's making my skin
look kind of healthy and good but it's
not like breaking open the highlighter
landscape for me and making me see
things in a whole new way as any
American Idol judge has ever said it's
just okay for me you guys I know this
isn't julep but I found the Mario
Badescu facial spray with aloe chamomile
and lavender last night at Ulta and I
just have to try it
mmm oh that's that's soothing that's
nice do I like that better than the
cucumber though gosh it's so different
it's so dramatically different I think
I'm really gonna enjoy that I don't know
that it's topping the cucumber aloe
green tea but it's it's up there it's
really nice okay juleps got a brow
product it says don't leave your brows
at home all-in-one brow powder and brush
so it's this little guy here and
basically you just take one end off and
you've got an angled brush that's very
stiff yet soft and then you take off the
other end you twist this part off and
this is holding the powder in there a
dark powder I'm using the cool brown and
I would say that is definitely my right
shade but you just stick your little
brush on here pick up some of that
powder and I think you guys probably
know my stance on just strictly using a
brow powder and your brows it can give
you like the ultimate softest really
easiest fill-in it's not gonna be your
optimal method in terms of staying power
because as you can see I'm mixing this
into my brow hair and powder just
doesn't cling to hair necessarily all
that well and it's kind of hard to know
like when you're dipping your brush down
into
thing like I'm very used to dipping my
brush into a flat pan of powder where I
can totally see what I'm picking up and
I can see how the brush is responding to
the powder like is it really cutting
into it have I picked up a whole bunch
have I picked up not enough here I'm
kind of dipping into a little no-man's
land of powder and I'm not really sure
what I'm getting like you definitely
don't want to overload the brows so I'm
just very gently dipping in and just
getting the job done here but I guess
the cool thing they've done is that they
found a way to combine the application
method and the powder into like one
little stick and not leave you with two
separate pieces that you're always
searching for through your stash you
know so I can respect that and a way to
make this cling in even better to your
brow hairs themselves would be to take a
wax pencil on estancia make some wet and
wild Milani just run a little bit of
that through and then some of this
powder here's something that will take
care of at least the hold at the end of
everything and this is their iconic brow
setting gel so just a clear gel take out
the brush it's tight tiny little brush
why do I always think tiny brushes are
so cute it's kind of comparable to the
size of the little brush on benefits
gimme brow you know so I like that it's
small because that makes me think okay
it's not gonna probably over goop me too
much here and the hole that this
provides is really nice like I don't
have any complaints about this product I
personally don't feel like I need to
spend a high-end price tag on a brow gel
as long as Nick's control-freak is on
the market like that stuff it's a clear
gel you put it on the brush is not
overloaded it holds your brows in place
like none other like you don't need to
spend a lot on clear brow gel next up
we're gonna do a little eye look here
we've got an abundance of shadow sticks
and these are called eyeshadow 101 cream
to powder eye shadow sticks so I've got
like champagne pearl taupe bronze warm
gold and plum and all of those words are
followed by the word shimmer on this
shit's I've got a couple of powder
shadow duo's that I want to work with as
well so I was thinking maybe I could use
one or two of these is kind of a base
for the look and show you how they go on
so let's just pull out pearl shimmer
here it is indeed quite pearly it's kind
of like frosty shimmery but I'm not
seeing any glitter and I'm just gonna go
ahead and apply this straight to the eye
I know from experience that these do set
so they're kind of like the Mallee
shadow sticks and that they set to this
long wearing state and like if you were
to swatch a bunch of them on your hand
you could rub across them and you
wouldn't pull them away anytime soon you
know and this shade is really pretty for
brightening around the inner corner what
I've noticed with some of the other
shades like mid-tone type colors is that
they kind of seem to go on my eyes a
little bit sheer like let's go in with a
little bit of this warm gold shimmer I
don't know I'm just it is a soft shade
just by nature of this color I don't
know it just seems extra sheer to me I'm
gonna try one of the darker ones this
plums shimmer here and apply just a
little bit of this here on the outsides
and I'm trying to apply them in the very
no-fuss way that I think they're
intended which is just like blending it
out with my fingers they call this eye
shadow 101 it doesn't feel like a pure
cream to powder quite as much as the
cheek sticks did like you feel like
there's a bit more moisture in these but
they do eventually set no doubt about it
like even the plum I don't know what it
is I'm picking up on just a little
Sheerness with that here's one shade I
haven't used yet the taupe shimmer I'm
gonna use this under the eye soft smokey
liner may be a potential sweet spot for
this kind of product because I know it
has the staying power ability yeah this
shade makes a nice little smokey liner
that I think it just kind of depends on
what you want to use these for I thought
the lightest color what was that called
the pearl shimmer went on super nicely
around the inner corner I'm liking this
taupe on the lower lash line but in the
times that I've used these all over the
lid I haven't been wowed now we're gonna
go in with some of these powder shadows
which I really freaking love like do
they have a palette do they have a big
palette if they do let me know because
I'm into the formula very much this
one's called Rosie and vaycay and this
one is called Fifth Avenue and Broadway
this one is a matte
to shimmer and then this one is a
combination of two minutes I'm gonna go
to this one first and get a little bit
of this Mavi color in my crease when you
dip your brush into this it does
definitely kick up some powder kind of
like a low rock sort of reminds me of
like an honest hacia type texture as
well not a problem for me just pointing
that out this shade in the crease I
think is gorgeous it's so pretty then I
want to put some of this shade on for
you this kind of like mix of bronze and
champagne
supersoft super pretty like high-impact
shimmery shadows definitely like
high-quality
what-you-see-is-what-you-get shimmery
shade not holding back it's just really
nice and what do you do with this shade
you know for some skin tones that might
even be a super soft crease color for me
I feel like it's a little bit more
transition he like just around the edges
kind of thing
now I'm gonna go back to this deepest
color which is just a very rich
chocolate brown and I'm gonna use my
flat brush with this get a little on tap
off the excess and we'll just use this
to accentuate our outer corner and if
you're wondering well did that shimmery
shade just show up like that because she
was topping off the shadow sticks no
it's not really about the shadow sticks
because those were pretty much to the
point of dry down so they weren't having
this super creamy texture that was
giving the powder something to really
cling to they weren't so much doing that
so the powder is legit good quality so
there's just my very simple soft and
easy look they're super wearable duos
but it's definitely the kind of thing
that's making me think like do they have
a pallet I would like to see a pallet
next up we've got a plethora of
eyeliners pencil Liars here that are
called when pencil met Jill long-lasting
eyeliners they are the type of liner
that sets for you I'm holding up you
know a variety of very sensible shades
here I mean I guess you'd call these you
know nothing's insanely bright but
they're very wearable very easy tones
they have a blackest black they've got
an olivey green I think they are pretty
true to the color you're seeing here
right on the tips they have a couple of
shades of black one is blackest black
and one is soft black soft black is kind
of like a matte charcoal gray I would
say I'm gonna use the blackest black
across my upper lash line super easy
transfer there onto the lid I'm going
over to textures of product you know the
shimmery sticks topped with shimmery
eyeshadow and it's just as black as it
needs to be that being said these are
brand new so I don't I'm not able to
speak from a place of like oh I've had
these on my hands for three months now
and they're just as creamy as when I
bought them I can't say that but right
out of the gate these are super easy to
put on I think I'm gonna try the rich
Brown in the lower inner rim and I'm
gonna be perfectly honest with you guys
I have worn these like two to three
times in my lower inner rim already and
I did not remember to keep super close
track of how that wore so that's gonna
have to be a little bit of a to be
continued
thing like I was wearing it yesterday
and I did touch it up a little bit at
the end of the day but I didn't do like
a big you know analysis so I'll try to
remember to do that today
putting that in my lower inner rim and
giving it just a light smudge in between
the lashes too I'm trying to be a little
gentler with my lower lash line not tug
too much on it and that is a very very
dark rich Brown by the way now we're
gonna play with some mascara here this
is called with a twist
very cute tube love the design this says
lash boosting bamboo mascara you've got
this brush very short rubber bristles
little bit tapered toward the tip
there's a little twisty tip when I start
to twist that it takes the brush and can
you see it scrunching down like the
overall length of the brush just went
from about here down to here definitely
gonna want to curl my lashes before I
get into this what I've noticed is when
I use it in its fully lengthened out way
the bristles are a little more spaced
out and I notice a bit more product
depositing into my lashes as you might
expect and then when I put the bristles
closer together and it takes me a little
bit longer to build things up because I
don't think as much product as being
allowed to get on there but what I kind
of like to do the other day is I used it
all lengthened out and so I'm gonna go
in for a fresh amount of product here
and just use it in its longest state get
it on the lashes and then for my next
coat I'll use it more scrunched up and
it'll kind of like I don't know pick
through the lashes a little bit it's
actually a pretty darn dry formula and
while I am seeing you know some okay
length here I feel like it's more about
the thickening and like the volumizing
giving you the look of more lashes than
it is about overall length and I haven't
yet used it on the lower lashes so I
will try that today
so now it's shortened the brush and I'm
going back at it I kind of prefer the
size of the brush a little bit better
when it's when it is scrunched in but I
don't think it allows quite as much
product to hit the lashes that's the
only thing there's my finished look with
it what do you think I'm in kind of a
middle-of-the-road place with it it does
an okay job of holding the curl I think
I could just use a little more length
the concept of changing the actual
length of the brush is neat but not like
absolutely essential I'm going to go
ahead and do this I now oh not the fault
of the mascara completely operator error
there
alright gel so now that eyes are
complete let's just wrap up here the
brow product decent brow powder an
innovative way to package brow powder
just using it on its own I think you got
to throw in something that allows it to
cling better like a wax first would help
the gel good but not essential got my
holy grail from NYX we're happy the
shadow sticks nice enough I could kind
of take or leave those as well I do
really like the way that pearly one
looks around the inner corner also the
mascara I'm not really jumping out of my
chair over that but I'm loving the
texture of their powder eyeshadows and I
think they've got really good pencil
liners too again I'll report back on how
it does in the waterline but they're
just soft and easy to apply as can be
now more lip stuff the matte lip mousse
I'm not gonna address that in this video
because I tried on like every shade in
the Oprah's Favorite Things video so
I'll link to that below so you can get
the full lowdown on those but I love
them a couple of new things to me that
they sent are they're ultra hydrating
lip glosses these are in the shades all
the fields and work so I'll go ahead and
try on both of those for you and then
these it's balm lip crayons so let's try
on all the fields here the applicator is
nice I really like that I like how the
product seems to apply straight from the
tip but it's also got that kind of
pinched in design very very similar to
the lip mousses and it gets such a smart
design because it allows you to apply
and then spread the product in just the
perfect way I told you sometimes when
you sniff out a great lip product from a
certain brand there may be more where
that came from and this is such a nice
gloss like ultra hydrating yeah it feels
hydrating it's clinging in place without
feeling annoying feeling a good amount
of thickness but not sticky thickness
and this shade this all the feels color
this is sheer you know this is
definitely letting my natural lip color
show through so be aware of that but the
texture of this is outstanding the
delivery method is great the only
difference really in this little
applicator is that instead of being a
full like ball at the end like the
lit mooses are this has just a tiny bit
of an angle but it's so fast and easy
and nice so let's take off this shade
and try on the next work is a little bit
darker color so I'll show you the fact
that this shows up a bit more opaque
yeah this is definitely the shiny sister
to the matte lip mousse actually they're
those these products probably aren't
even in the same family they're their
cousins that's what they are yeah they
share some tendencies with the overall
construction but formula wise they are
vastly different isn't this pretty I'm
so excited I discovered another great
gloss let's compare this to like my
current favorite frontrunner type lip
gloss which would be the anastacio
glosses a little more thickness here
with these perhaps an even better like
cling more of an actual feeling of
moisturization with these so I'm
definitely I'm diggin they're really
nice then we've got these little sticks
called its balm lip crayons and I've got
the shade here called vintage mauve
cream and they have a little core and I
didn't keep the outer box which probably
said what that core is exactly doing
it's probably like a vitamin ear cocoa
butter they've no doubt packed that core
with some sort of extra moisturizing
ingredient and then you've got all the
pigment and color around the outside but
these these are a pleasure to put on oh
and they smell so good
I feel like it's super subtle vanilla
how nice is that shade my lips feel like
pillows right now mmm so comfy so good
not slipping and sliding falling off the
lips greasy just a nice balmy cling I've
only got three more so just let me try
them on for you okay I've got dusty
orchid shimmer
doesn't really look all that shimmery on
the lips but definitely more pink than
the mauve that I just had on then we've
got fuchsia berry cream you're
definitely gonna want to apply these
with a mirror
don't let balm in the name fool you like
these are serious very pretty bold pink
and just mmm ultra comfortable and then
we have Brandywine cream
this is an interesting shade it's kind
of like a mix between like soft red and
rust super nice it's kind of like
messing with me I'm looking at myself in
the screen here and I'm thinking gosh
that looks kind of dramatic but yet I
feel like I'm wearing the most
comfortable rich product now I don't
consider those fresh sugar lip balms to
be like a slippery bum but this is even
less slippery than that like there's a
little dryness here and I think that's
what helps the staying power because
I've been playing with these and the
staying power is pretty good hi she
didn't tell me I had foundation in my
hair back here seriously guys true
believer in the brands lip products like
feeling all that stuff and on top of all
this this brand I mean the first thing I
knew about this brand making was nails
stuff so I've got a few like nail polish
and maybe nail treatment type things as
well that I have not yet used so that
stuff and the skincare is the to be
continued on this video but as far as
the makeup goes I feel like I've
uncovered some good new stuff the
bronzer the eyeshadows the eyeliner the
lip products oh and the cream blush
stick as well especially the desert rose
thank you guys for your time if you
would like to see this kind of video
where we really just sink our teeth into
a new and maybe somewhat unfamiliar
brand let me know like if you've kept up
with my channel for some time you know
maybe a brand that you just haven't seen
me talk about enough tell me what you'd
like to see because I really enjoy this
so thank you guys for your time I'll see
you later bye okay it's 3:30 p.m. and
this look has already been on for
between nine and ten hours because it
was very early when I was doing my
makeup today and I'm happy with the wear
of the eye shadow I've been unknowingly
like resting my hand on my face like
I've been editing some today I've just
been doing those unthinking things where
you've got your hand on your face and
you're just leaning on it and then you
know that can't affect staying power but
I can still see my bronzer my cheek
color my eye shadow my lower inner rim
liner is definitely wearing a little bit
it's actually hanging on in my outer
corner here but I'm noticing a little
smudge just under the eye from that
jumbo stick so that might be the kind of
thing you want to set just a little bit
with some powder shadow the lip color
has not been touched up once and that
color sort of stained my lips somewhat
which is sort of surprising
after this much time has passed I look
at myself and I think yeah this is still
acceptable and if I were to go out and
do something at this point I'd touch up
the lip color maybe recur the eyelashes
and perhaps a little bit of powder but
even that's not too bad and I think I'd
be good to go so that's my little
wrap-up here here thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
