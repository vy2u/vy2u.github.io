got I've got the new pallets from wet
and wild yes I just found these
yesterday in my Walgreens store and so
I've got them in a couple of these I
haven't even opened yet petal pusher is
like some Maroons and sorry major Claire
Maroons and purples blue had me at hello
is sort of some navies and teals and
then the one I'm using in this tutorial
is called comfort zone and we're going
to be using a lot of these olive shades
there on that side of the pallet so I've
gotten just recently gotten some
requests people saying can we get a
really hot but all drugstore eye
tutorial from you and I said sure
because I love using the drugstore
products so we're going to go through
and use some of the deeper smoky shades
in this palette and also some of those
you know more pronounced green colors to
get this look that could be worn every
day or at night you know whatever you
want to do so if you want to see how I
do it keep on watching alright first
step you're gonna prime your lids I used
my Palladio herbal eyeshadow primer and
then I'm gonna go to my palette from wet
&amp;amp; wild it's called comfort zone and
we're mainly going to be using this side
here that's full of great olive green
colors and I'm going to start off by
using this shade that says eyelid on it
and it's the most I guess kind of like a
spring green type color and so I'm just
gonna load that up on sort of a flat
shadow brush and then just kind of look
down that will make it easy to kind of
get your whole lid coated there and just
apply that all over next I'm kind of
wiping off that brush and I'm going to
the shade that's just below it and it's
so pretty it's labeled crease and it's
just got such a pretty sparkle talking
about this side right here and it's just
really really great to it to achieve the
smoky effect we have so I'm gonna get a
little bit of that on there and
something that I've noticed with these
color icon shadows from wet and wild is
sometimes you get a little more on your
brush than you want you don't realize it
so to avoid any fallout you might get it
on your brush and
tap it you know just kind of tap it on
your hand a little bit or something and
it removes some of the excess product
not exactly a bad issue to be having
with the drugstore eyeshadows but I mean
it just makes it a little easier to
control on your eye so as you can see
I'm just getting that all over the outer
part in with that same shade on my brush
I'm flipping the brush over and just
using that to kind of get that shade all
over my crease just like that so I'm
just kind of tapping and gently pulling
up and the last little step if you want
to work in sort of an outer V you can
use that same brush as you can see I'm
taking it and I'm using this kind of
emotion right out from the corner of my
eye and just angling it up a little bit
so we've kind of got the shadow going in
the general pattern we want here it is
all blended out here it is when you
first put it on once there is a shade
called brow bone and it's right up here
at the top and I'm gonna get that
falling down on me a lot I think but
this is sort of kind of light shimmery
with a little hint of some olive to it
as well so I'm going to get some of that
on a fluffier brush here I'm using my
Sigma SS 224 these are the old labelled
brushes there but I'm just going over
the border of the darkest shade that we
put down so just back and forth back and
forth and you're gonna see that this
just functions to really not only buff
out the darker shade but you get a
really seamless blend by topping it with
something as you do that then there's an
even lighter shade kind of a creamy
shade right here it says brow bone on
the other side of this palette and it's
just got a little shimmer to it and I'm
going to get some of that on the tip of
my brush there and I'm going to apply it
right here I find that brightening this
part of the eye area just under like the
inner I don't know maybe third of your
brow really gives you a nice pop of
color and so that kind of differentiates
that we've got all this darkness
sweeping out here but a little light
right in here real
while we're thinking about that light
shade I'm going to take a small detail
brush and just take that right around
this inner corner then I'm going to use
this brush that I just love from Sonia
Kashuk and it is this kind of smudger
brush it's kind of short and it's not
quite as precise as say an angled liner
brush going back to the shade labeled
crease getting a little bit of that
right on the tip remember you may want
to tap this on your hand real quickly
first because this is going to be kind
of our lower liner shade actually so I'm
just gonna start working that right down
here only go about half way in because
we're going to work in the lighter green
but when you're on the outer corner just
kind of use this brush to help you blend
that in with the rest of your shadow
look and remember for a less precise
blend instead of using it this way
rotate that brush and go like that and
you'll get an even even more of a smudge
on your shadow lean that brush off and
we're going to the shade labeled eyelid
right there pick up some of that shade
and we're going to kind of cover the
inner portion with that and you can kind
of overlap it's just all sort of smudged
out I'm just thinking of keeping it
lighter towards the inside continuing
with all drugstore products in this look
I'm going to be using my covergirl
perfect point plus liner in black onyx
and I'm gonna put this on my waterline
so ever so gently you may just want to
tug down just slightly to get it so it's
accessible and you're not drawing on
your eyeball I'm just gonna use that
same eyeliner all across my upper lash
line I'm not winging this out I feel
that the shadow has kind of taken care
of that for us so I'm just gonna I tend
to feel comfortable just starting in the
center and trying to get very close to
my lash line I'm just going to go out to
that side then kind of work from that
inner corner and sort of meet where you
started I'm kind of keeping it thinner
right on the inside here and letting it
get a little thicker towards the outside
now you can use this smudge tip that
you've got on the end of that liner if
you want to or using this
I'm going back to this crease shade that
I think is just every time I look at I'm
like wow that's unique that's not
something you see in the drugstore very
often got a little bit of that shade
again on my Sonia Kashuk brush I'm just
kind of dotting it basically right over
that liner and what that does I think it
really gets a seamless effect from your
lashes you know sometimes it's hard to
get liners right there in your lash line
so sometimes going over it all with a
dark shadow like this really gets it you
know to where it's right up close to the
lash line and looking really soft next
step I'm going to curl my eyelashes with
my ELF eyelash curler and then I'm going
to use my Almay one coat nourishing
mascara triple effect I've always loved
this mascara I actually just recently
purchased because I had run out but this
is the brush that has like longer
bristles on one end for length and
shorter bristles on the other for volume
so I'm going to put that on and I'll
join you with the finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
from my drugstore Olive eye tutorial
using one of these new pallets from wet
and wild they come out with three new
color icon palettes and so I was really
excited to jump in with this Olive look
and I also applied that Almay mascara on
the upper and I just went ahead and use
the same one on the lower lashes because
I haven't had issues with this smudging
yet so let's hope that holds true on the
lower lashes as well on my lips I'm
using my Rimmel lasting finish lipstick
in airy-fairy so that's a light pink
with a golden undertone and then over
the top of that I'm using my ELF hyper
shine lip gloss in fairy so that is kind
of a light light pearly pink I'm kind of
like if you wore it alone it would
almost come off clear but it has that
slight shimmer to it so I put that over
the top and I also keep track of what
I'm using I usually have like a little
pad of paper like this around my make up
area and that's how I keep track of like
all the different things I've used I
don't think anybody I don't know if
anybody else could read that but just to
give you a little rundown of what I have
on the rest of my face since as I said
it is all drugstore and I'll have this
listed on my dailybooth page too but I
use the covergirl nature luxe foundation
which I am really liking I think it's
got pretty good coverage and it smooths
on so easily and I use my hard candy
glamoflauge concealer I used my
Maybelline fit me a pressed powder my
hard candy so baked bronzer in heat
waves that's kind of a little bit
shimmery the elf contouring blush and
bronzer to kind of give me some contour
around the cheeks and then the blush and
that I just went ahead and used and
that's kind of like peachy golden pink
look and I used my elf or not my ELF my
Physicians Formula happy booster this is
the translucent powder use that for a
little bit of a highlight so I hope you
enjoyed this look it is super easy but
yet a little more dramatic maybe than
just everyday looks that don't do a
whole lot of outer V so keep in mind all
of is just one of those great color
families that you can use on a
day-to-day basis
instead of going with grays and browns
so really really enjoying this palette
so far thank you so much for watching
and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
