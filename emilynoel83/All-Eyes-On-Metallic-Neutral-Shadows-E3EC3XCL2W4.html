come to me just really naturally like
I'm just going about my business doing
my makeup and I just feel compelled to
tell you about something and that's kind
of what this video is all about I was
doing my makeup last weekend and I was
thinking about what I shadow am I gonna
use and with the outfit I was wearing
like I didn't really want to do anything
colorful so I was thinking how do I make
this look special how do I still make
this pop and it seemed kind of
interesting and I was started using one
of my shadows that was neutral but it
had kind of a metallic finish and I'm
like this is the way to go you want to
make kind of a pretty effect with your
eyeshadow but yet you want to stay in
the neutral color range what you can
really make your eyes pop make it
interesting and fun is to just go for
the metallic finish ones that I feel
like when you swatch them has a shine to
it almost and so I've got some great
neutral favorites to tell you about that
are like that and of course you could go
colorful too but when I'm talking my
whole point with this video is it's you
know a way to take neutral shadow and
kind of kick it up a notch basically so
we're sticking with neutrals and
high-end and drugstore favorites
I've got powder shadows cream shadows
and just a couple of palettes I want to
point you to if you're wanting like even
more color or shade options start out
talking about the ones from hard candy
and if you keep up with Beauty broadcast
net my blog I recently blogged about
these and swatch the ones I have and
I've just got a growing obsession with
these any time I go back to Walmart I'm
like scanning this section of picking up
another one but these are really great
these are baked these are the
kaleidoscope I believe they're called
baked eyeshadow do some nice neutral
combos and I just really like the way
they're put together you've got one
shade that's you know deeper that can be
your crease color or smudged under the
eye and then one that can be you know on
your lid I've got to give credit to the
person who kind of helped me rediscover
these I was watching when a Lola Maurice
Evans videos her name's Jessica she's
awesome one of my favorite youtubers and
she was using this duo in peace in one
of her recent tutorials and
I thought I've got some of those I need
to pull those out again and play with
them some more so this one's great I'm
wearing this one today actually with
this kind of in the inner corner and
some of this in the crease and I also
combined this duo in rush hour so these
are both really super pretty options
this one's more your classic you know
champagne and Brown neutral this one's
kind of like a rose gold and an even
darker Brown so I sort of blended these
two throughout my crease and I really
like the effect there this is high
maintenance and this one's great it's
like kind of a light silvery color and
then the other shade is kind of like a
deep taupe with just a hint of Plum it's
very interesting I like that shade alone
also we're you know baked shadows if
you've got any other baked shadows in
your collection laura geller Milani
these you can wear them wet and they
will look even more like shine another
nice one that I like from the drugstore
I just kind of like this whole line of
shadows but it's the Rimmel glam eyes
and this one's called backstage and this
is a really great metallic taupe color
kind of like one-step eye shadow if you
really just want a quick look put like
one pretty metallic kind of mid-tone
shade like this all over your lid and
it's it pops it's pretty Maybelline eye
studio and caffeine rush love this love
this for girls who love kind of the cool
taupe colors on their eye I mean think
of like this type of shade just kind of
worked into a pallet with some
comparable colors the shade right up at
the top actually does have some sort of
sparkly glitter in it but the rest are
totally that metallic finish they're so
pigmented they're so great I also love
the eye studio shadows that are in this
kind of a format here I think they're
just really good quality and they are
comparable in texture and finish to the
Lancome color design palettes from NYX
and this is the trio in golden rust and
walnut bronze this is more of the warm
side of metallic so this this is totally
gold you know really golden color
this you know may not you may not
consider this so much neutral but I love
warming up a look with kind of a
cranberry type color and you can kind of
blend it up in this area right on up on
your brow bone and it looks gorgeous and
then you've got kind of a classic kind
of medium brown shade there we've talked
about topes and warm colors and golden e
shades but for a smoky silver eyed
charcoal type I really like don't steal
my thunder from wet and wild the silver
here is the most metallic the black is a
little bit more of our charcoal it's
kind of more shimmery and then the
pearly shade here is a nice highlight so
it's kind of a variety of finishes in
one but this is by far the most metallic
the silver shade which makes it all kind
of work together they're not all equally
metallic but that's really nice for kind
of a smoky look now for cream eyeshadows
I'm really critical cream eyeshadow
you'll get seeing more and more products
coming out now that can last on their
own and so that's the way all these are
that I'm going to talk about and first
is of course the color tattoo and bag to
the bronze
this is from Maybelline and this is a
wonderful metallic bronzy color some of
this just with your finger on your eye
on each eye kind of blend it up through
the crease and you're done so it's
really nice and this is extremely long
wearing so essence has a cream eyeshadow
this is the stay all day long lasting
eyeshadow I have it in glammy goes to
and this is a really nice look how
reflective that is it's like don't look
right at it
but it's it's kind of a golden e shade
is how this comes off in a swatch or on
your eye and one word of advice for when
you're blending out a cream shadow like
get some on your finger and if you're
feeling like you're having trouble
blending it kind of warm it up between
another finger and then go to put it on
your eyes that go on a little bit easier
finally kind of the gold standard for me
in terms of these long wearing shadows I
don't know if I've done a video about
long lasting cream shadows without
mentioning how great the Mallee ever
color shadow sticks are because these
have been these are just my ideal
they're my ideal for staying power they
are my
ideal for packaging and just the quality
of the colors are beautiful these are in
stick form so you just draw them right
on there not too wide of a stick so you
maintain even as you use them you know
you maintain sort of a a tip going on
there if you know what I mean it doesn't
get too flat on you but one that I love
is champagne and you might think oh well
that's kind of a light color to be
metallic but light colors can be great
metallic shades too and this one I'm
actually wearing that around the inner
corner of my eye for that brightness
there and I love it and then another one
that I used is sort of a base to this
look with the hard candy shadows is
bronze and this is absolutely the
epitome of gorgeous rose gold kind of
gave it a very warm tone by using this
as a base but these can absolutely be
worn on their own just like the color
tattoo and the stay all day a couple of
palettes that I just want to point out
to you that I think have really great
selections of metallic shades first off
the Naked palette the original naked I
mean there are some nice metallics in
The Naked 2 but I think my favorite
because this is all about my favorites
is this one I think there are a lot that
gives you a really nice shiny look on
side cards one of them half-baked Smaug
can even give you sort of a metallic
look as well so I mean there are just
different ones that have that great
shine to the Coastal Scents does have a
whole palette dedicated to metallic
shadows and it's going to give you some
colors as well a lot of colors actually
you can see tons of warm you know pinks
and purples and plums and then you've
got a lot of neutrals as well so if
you're really into this and you want to
just have the full gamut of shades that
are do have that metallic shine
definitely check out the metal mania
palette from Coastal Scents I kind of
had set this aside for a while pulling
it out now since I've my obsession has
been rekindled I guess with with
metallic colors but it really is a
pretty look on your lips sometimes when
you've got that little bit lighter pop
of something on your eyelid or something
a little bit shiny or interesting it can
almost make your lashes stand out a
little bit more on top of it
if you are dealing with a lot of
wrinkles or a lot of wrinkly areas
around your eye be very careful with the
metallic shadows I wouldn't even really
suggest using them you know out in here
if you're dealing with a lot of heavy
wrinkles I just think it can be a little
bit too much it can actually accentuate
those areas but if you're fairly smooth
this can be a nice way to go and like I
said it's just about taking neutral
shadows and kicking it up a notch thanks
so much for watching have a great day
and let me know what your favorites are
as well bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
