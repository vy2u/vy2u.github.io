think it has been a really great season
for American Idol but I didn't make this
video just to talk about that actually
something I've noticed while I've been
watching the show is the the females the
singers just have had the most amazing
make up throughout this season you know
when they're hitting that high note and
their eyes are closed I feel like they
have the most gorgeous glittery shimmery
reflective thing going on on their
eyelids their eye makeup is just
beautiful and so with this video I sort
of wanted to duplicate some things I've
seen this season I've actually seen a
lot of neutral shadow looks but they've
been very high shimmer lots of sparkle
lots of lashes the skin is flawless and
the lips are just kind of shiny and
natural-looking so I wanted to try my
hand at my American Idol look as I said
you may not have the voice for American
Idol but you can still look the part
we're starting from scratch with this
one I'm using my foundation from Revlon
it's Revlon Photoready gives you kind of
a nice luminous look to the skin then
i'm using my revlon photoready concealer
as well under the eyes any other
imperfections and just blend it out with
your fingers then to top that off i'm
using my bare minerals summer bisque
this really mattifies the under eye area
makes it look totally flawless and then
to add to that look i'm going to be
using my multi tasker powder from Milani
it's just going to even out the entire
complexion and I love the way that comes
off then I'm going to use my Laura
Geller Bronson Brighton i'm using a
really fluffy brush and just blending
this all over my face in circular
motions you can also use this to contour
as well then I love this baked blush
from Milani the shade is Dolce pink so
you can just use a smaller brush to
blend that all over the apples of your
cheeks
first step I am going to use a really
shimmery metallic sort of creamy eye
pencils ones from malli it's a never
colored shadow stick in the shade is
bronze and this is great because we're
looking for really dense shimmer on the
always recommend padding over a shadow
stick like that with your finger so that
way you don't get too much product on
you can kind of circle the tear duct and
then take it all the way under is what
I'm going to use my glitter cream
palette from NYX this is sweet chocolate
browns and as you can see there are some
really really sparkly shades and thence
a couple of more fine glitters I'm going
to be using the one there at the end
it's kind of a like topi pink shade and
I just kind of get some on my finger and
I'm going to Pat this all over my lid
and this is really the key to getting
this this look you know American Idol
style in my book is the fact that we're
really layering on the sparkle here
we're really making the lids almost
shine at a glance I'm going to take a
really light a matte highlight shade
this is brulee from wet and wild just
the color icon single just take a fluffy
brush and kind of get this going all the
way up under your brand I'm going to use
my L'Oreal hip metallic shadow duo this
is an electrified so what we have here
is a sort of metallic plum and then a
super high shine kind of silver gray
shade so going with the purple first
take a flat eyeshadow brush pick up some
of the product on there and we just want
to deepen up the outer part of the eye
with that so I'm just taking my brush
little patting motions and remember we
want the majority of the lid to be
highly shimmery and sparkly so just keep
this on the outer part and then you can
kind of flip your brush over and work
that ever so slightly into the crease a
little bits going to go a long way with
this product because it is so rich and
pigmented then I'm going to take this
brush from Sigma it's my SS 217 and it's
nice because it's a little larger you
know the
and then some of the crease brushes I
have and so it can blend out really
nicely but you still do have some
control with it so this is bear at the
moment and I'm just using that to run it
right over that darker shade and really
mix it in with the other I'm going
to take my little smudger brush from
Sonia Kashuk one of the all-time great
brushes in my opinion because it's a
little less precise than like an angled
liner brush and I'm just taking that
deep plum shade again and going just
under my lash line and then I'm going to
take my Coastal Scents mini detail brush
right here great for around the tear
duct you can also use a q-tip if you
don't have this brush and we're going to
go to that super shimmery color right
there just going to kind of DAB this
around the tear duct next up I'm using a
black liquid liner this is Revlon
Colorstay just going to go all the way
across my upper lash line go from the
absolute inner corner all the way to the
outer corner and i'm using my Malley
ever color automatic waterproof eyeliner
in onyx this is a really rich black
shade and this particular product wears
a long time on the water lime and a curl
my lashes I'm going to apply some
voluminous carbon black on my upper
lashes and some maybelline lash
discovery on my lower lashes use some
false eyelashes these are the ardell
wispies they look like this they're very
full very lush and so I'll put those on
and join you with the finished look
alright so here is the finished look on
the eyes and the face and also want to
tell you about what's on my lips I put
on my L'Oreal lipstick and fairest nude
so this is a great nude that borders on
just a hint of pink so I love that color
just all over the lips and it feels
almost like a lip balm on there actually
and then what I did just to deepen up
the color a little bit was I used my NYX
lip liner in mahogany that's a pair I've
been liking to use a lot lately so gave
myself a little definition there and
then for my gloss I usenix in Cosmo and
if you get a really good look at that
you can see that it's very shimmery very
glossy as well so I just feel like I
kind of went for the look that I feel
like I've been seeing a lot this season
and in seasons past on Idol I hope you
enjoyed it I hope you enjoyed this
season a vile as much as i did a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
