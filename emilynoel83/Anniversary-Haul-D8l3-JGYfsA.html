having a great week we're on a new week
already it seems like that weekend just
flew by but I had a really fun time for
me and Tyler it was our four year
wedding anniversary so we went to st.
Louis we had a blast we did some
shopping and so the result of that
shopping is this hull so on some more
high-end items that you know I generally
kind of saved for those special
occasions such as this so I allowed
myself to splurge a little bit so i
thought i would show you what i have and
this may be material for future reviews
tutorials and kind of some comparisons
you know is this stuff all that it's
cracked up to be one thing I'm going to
show you at the end of this video is
something that I know it's gotten a lot
of hype on YouTube and I'm very excited
to sort of compare that to some things
that I currently own and see if it's
really as good as people say it is so
let's start off I went to Mac and ulta
so i'll start off with what I first got
from the mac store um I got a really
cool lip gloss or it's a lip glass it's
from the dare to wear collection and
this shade is called dare to dare and
this is a pink lip gloss and I have it
on right now and i have it on fairly
lightly if you put this on more
concentrated what really starts to show
up is the blue glitter that's in this
there was a shade that the girl that was
helping me out she had on like a
purplish shade with the blue glitter and
so it was even more vivid and bright but
i thought this might be a little more
wearable but still really fun so yeah
it's really cool it smells kind of like
um just slightly sweet kind of like a
baked vanilla cake I don't know but if I
do a swatch here on my hand and make it
a little more concentrated than it is on
my lips I think you'll really see how
reflective this is and how you can
really like it hits the light is like
BAM but there is definitely some blue
glitter in that and it's I mean I like
the texture it's not overly sticky or
anything like that but I think it's just
really pretty and unique and that tends
to be what I go for when I'm
king for a high-end items you know I
don't want it to be something that I
could just pick up at the drugstore I
want to be something special so I felt
like that was money well spent on that
product I also got a blush this would be
my first regular mac blush I have a
cream blush already but I got this blush
and Dolly mix and it is a sheer tone
shimmer blush so even though it looks
really intense here in the packaging
it's kind of like a bright pink and it
does have some shimmer um it comes off
more sheer like I have it on my cheeks
today and I thought it just gave a
really fresh look and it's not what
you'd expect like you can really get a
decent amount on your brush put it on
your cheeks that's like wow that's not
overwhelming you know it just kind of
gives a pink shimmery glow so um kind of
helps if I hold it back here it's almost
like it can kinda reminds me my walls a
little bit in here but I'm really pretty
blush so I'm happy with that and i also
got two eyeshadows so i'm up in my total
a little bit on these eyeshadows but i
got two shades i got blackberry which is
a matte shade and it's kind of like a
matte um it's it's sort of like a topi
purpley grey so it definitely has some
purple in it but it's not vivid bold
purple it's kind of like got a little
bit of understated gray tones to it so I
really enjoy that I wore it kind of all
over my lid and I thought it gave a nice
smoky look when paired with a deeper
plum shade so I'm enjoying that shade so
far actually its shape you don't really
see a whole lot sorry if this shot
really isn't doing it justice but it is
it like a think purpley gray taupe and
it's really pretty i enjoy that shape
and i really liked it when I paired it
with beauty marked which is a velvet
shade and it's just like stunning this
is kind of one of those rockstar shades
you know you see it and it really
catches your eye when it's sitting there
among all the other shadows and it gives
off a really nice smoke
look but as you can see it's like a dark
shadow it appears to be kind of like
plumbing but it has a pretty kind of
purply plum toned shimmer in that within
the shade so there's what it looks like
if you were to wear it really
concentrated you would get that sort of
a look if you wore it more um more or
less like as a crease shade you're going
to get to see that warm sparkle but it's
going to be a little more of just like a
smoky color so I like that I'm going to
get tons of good out of that and I think
it will be something fun to interchange
with like sketch or carbon or one of
those deeper shades that I use in my
crease so um happy so far with all that
something I got from AG that I haven't
used yet is the brush cleanser I've
heard this recommended and I'm really
kind of starting to run low on what I
mixed up from the Encore recipe if you
go two encores channel he gives a brush
cleanser recipe and I like using and I
actually have some right here this is
all I have left of it right now but it's
in a spray bottle and I was looking for
something else that could kind of
supplement that and handle like just
those quick cleanings because recently
i've learned i really like using just
baby shampoo to deep clean the brushes
in the water but i thought this might be
something nice just to kind of sanitize
them a little more frequently and just
something that could maybe do the job so
i'll see if i like the way this works
you know just as well as the encore
stuff i'm not sure but i thought was
worth trying and you get quite a bit of
product there it's son how much do you
get seven point nine point nine fluid
ounces so i thought that was worth
trying and that's what I got it mac and
went to ulta picked up just this cheap
lip gloss from brand called essence
which I'd never tried before it's the
xxxl shine and the shade is glamour to
go and it's just in one of those really
nice one once I probably have far too
many other my collection but it's kind
of a shimmery nude it's really pretty it
smells very nice and it has decent stay
power so it's pretty happy about that
little bi um it's what shiny right there
so a nice kind of like middle of the lip
highlight shade so enjoying that so far
and just a really cheap brand like but
99 for that I also got a couple of sets
of false eyelashes from NYX which I am
hugely happy about really like these I
got number 119 gorgeous which I've used
these both and i have yet not clean them
off yet i usually will take like a q-tip
and some eye makeup remover and kind of
you know get the product off of there
but gorgeous is um kind of like a really
full like it looks better without like
my investor that's gone over the top of
it but it's really full it's really
actually kind of nice and natural
looking but you can see that it's very
lush and i just think a very good
classic um false eyelash look and then I
got Nirvana which is kind of interesting
because this has like that crisscrossed
look with the lashes I mean it doesn't
really show up when you put them on but
the crisscrossing kind of makes them
look really thick down closer to your
lash line so if I can pull these out and
show you I've got it like one of my
q-tips and they're already but you can
see how those are kind of crisscrossed
like I said I need to clean these off
get I'm ready to go but um yeah
definitely happy with these I like the
way they fit my I never tried the next
fall so used before and I think they're
really great and i also got one of these
sponges it's called the super blender
and it reminds me a lot I guess of that
beauty blender can you tell me if you're
familiar with the Beauty Blender if that
is anything like that it says the
ultimate cosmetic accessory the super
blender is perfect for contouring and
blending in tight areas simply dot
foundation on your face gently blend and
so it's going to be a little different
than your typical sponge and I only this
only cost me like a couple of dollars at
Ulta and I thought if I liked it you
know it might be an alternative to that
beauty blender which I know it
a little more expensive so yeah we'll
see how I like that and finally drumroll
I got the urban decay naked palette
which I've heard a lot about this and I
saw it in person I really wasn't
convinced by a lot of what I saw on
videos and then I saw it in person and I
saw some of the shades and thought this
is something you could really get a lot
of good out of and I also love that it
comes with a liner because I've been
eager to try the 24-7 glide on eye
pencil and what's cool about this is
that you get two shades in here you get
the black which is zero and the brown
which is called whiskey so you get to
try sample both shades there which I
like and then you get all these shades
yay you get 2 4 6 8 10 12 colors in here
and they're all really pretty i'm
thinking this is something i'm probably
going to need to blog about and show you
some swatches of all of these because
it's not really the ideal scenario here
lighting wise for me but you get a nice
range of you know some really light
shimmery shades to some neutral shades
and browns and golds taupe shimmery
topes some sort of light almost barry
looking shades just a little bit of plum
and purple in those two and then these
two which remind me a whole lot of those
colors from hourglass that I had done a
tutorial on kind of a bluish silver and
a sparkly black blue so those are going
to be really nice contour shades as you
can see I've kind of had my brush in
almost all of these and tried out some
different looks really loving the way
they blend love the texture I like the
sparkle that some of them have and then
I like that others are just kind of Matt
so hopefully this is giving kind of good
look of what they look like um but just
some stunning shades here and I I just
love how soft and blendable they are so
I'm going to definitely need to do some
tutorials with this show you how it
works
and what I'm sort of thinking about now
is ok how does some of these shades
compared to less expensive shades that I
already have because that's something
that at least I haven't already seen on
YouTube is you know is this palette can
you come up with some of these unique
shades in less expensive formats so
because I think this thing cost about
forty bucks a Tulsa it was completely
out of stock at Sephora so this is yeah
an in-demand palette right now so anyway
guys thank you so much for tuning in for
this video I hope you enjoyed this hull
and let me know if you have any input on
the stuff that I have and what you think
about it too but I've got to tell you
I've got a couple of videos coming up
that I am just itching to make I thought
I needed to do this whole first but I
got also while I was in st. Louis a
couple of really cool storage things one
is allowing me to store my mascaras in a
way that I am so excited about and the
other is where I'm putting my mac
eyeshadows which you know I don't have a
lot of but I think this is a storage
idea that will work for anyone that
wants to kind of pair up their eye
shadows in two different looks okay like
different sets threes and fours and
fives I am so pumped about this so I'm
going to make that video I will show it
to you soon but for now have a great day
and thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
