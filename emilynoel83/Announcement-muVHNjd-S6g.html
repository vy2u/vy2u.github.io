you know about something new that I am
working on it is a new channel here on
YouTube you know I've got this channel
which is beauty broadcast or emilynoel83
I've got my blog channel and now I am
starting up a third channel it's called
beauty broadcast Express you can get to
it at youtube.com slash beauty broadcast
X and basically what this is going to be
is a channel for purely reviews nothing
but reviews one product at a time and
they're gonna be just like quick three
to four minutes there's going to be a
new one coming out five days a week so
monday through friday baby there's gonna
be something new to see on that channel
first I was kind of like you know should
I do this it's gonna be a lot of work is
it worth setting up you know an entirely
different channel just for the reviews
but really I thought you know since
everything's gonna be you know that
quick kind of video it's gonna follow
the same format I thought yeah I think
it works and i think you know to have
something new also every day of the week
in addition to what's going on already
on this channel I thought it would just
be a nice companion because you know
sometimes I might mention a product in a
favorites video or in a tutorial and
you're like man I'd like to know more
about that that can be the place you can
go for expanded information on some of
these things and some things maybe I've
never talked about on here I really just
think it's going to be a great resource
for anyone who wants any type of beauty
review whether it's makeup skincare here
I really want to cover everything all
different price ranges you know I'm also
going to tell you you know if it's a bad
product a good product we're going to
experience all kinds of different things
I'm sure and in case you're wondering
nothing's going to change about my
beauty broadcast channel or my blog or
my vlog channel you know all that
stuff's gonna stay consistent and the
way it's been all along this is just
going to be in addition and I feel like
on this channel you know I do a lot of
videos where I'm maybe lumping together
some products are talking about top 10s
or I'm doing tutorials or one of my many
different series I've got underway
see some reviews on this channel that
channel though is going to be those
really quick daily concise reviews on
just one product at a time I hope you'll
subscribe even if not every product is
something you're interested in I think
being subscribed will at least let you
know every day you know what the new
thing is that i'm talking about so i
just want to give a quick shout out to
Lanie she created brand new banners for
all of my channels this one on beauty
broadcast also my vlog channel and my
new channel beauty broadcast express I
was able to tell her exactly what I
wanted and they turned out even better
than I expected so I was so pleased
thank you so much laning if you want to
check out some of her work she's got a
tumblr site with examples also got a
great YouTube channel that I recommend
you look at two so I'll have links to
that information below I just feel like
reviews are so important and they're
really the heart of what I do here on
YouTube and have been doing for years so
thank you so much for supporting me over
at beauty broadcast Express I'll see you
there five days a week with new videos
and of course back here as well thank
you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
