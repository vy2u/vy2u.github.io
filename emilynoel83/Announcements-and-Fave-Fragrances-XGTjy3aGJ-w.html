wonderful day so far um I'm really
excited to do this video because I have
some very good news to share with you
guys um as you may or may not know I
work at a TV station and I'm currently
anchoring the Saturday newscasts there's
two of them and then I record three or
four days out of the week and I have
been promoted I'm gonna get to be the
morning anchor so I'm so very excited
about that it's going to change my
schedule around a lot but I will get my
weekends back and it's just I really
wanted to get into anchoring more
because that's part of what I enjoy you
know actually feeling like I've kind of
in touch with people like you know
telling them the news and just having
fun with it because our morning show is
like an hour and a half long and it's a
lot lighter there's a lot more fun to it
you know different segments interviews
and things like that so I'm super super
excited about that so um I wanted to
tell you guys and I had already posted
it on my blog because I was just able to
do that real quick um and I'll have the
link over on the side here but it is um
it's it's a good place to check if you
want to know what's going on with me or
um just I mean other things that I don't
always have time to post on YouTube I'll
post on there um I've got some cool
beauty books that I like that you might
want to check out I've got a survey on
there about some of my favorite products
so if you want to look that up that'd be
awesome I'd love to have your input on
it it's not like the flashiest thing
right now but it it will be updated um
quite often so check that out and also I
don't know if you guys have heard about
this thing called Twitter but it's this
website where you can like keep updates
going about what you're doing and you
can it's called following people you can
like um a lot of TV stay
have these and they update like breaking
news and stuff like that I thought it'd
be cool to get my own and I could share
what I'm doing throughout the day or
kind of use it in the new sense as well
with my job and also you know just
whatever is going on because um I
thought it was really fun I asked some
of my family members to get that because
I think it's just kind of a neat thing
and it's really really easy to use it's
twitter.com and um you can look me up
there and you can also find me on there
through my blog because it's posted on
my blog too on the side so alright now
that all that's over with I can get to
what I actually was going to do this
video for as some people have asked what
my favorite fragrances are and it never
never occurred to me to do a video on
this but it's gonna be super easy so um
although as far as reviewing them I'm
not really gonna do that I'm just gonna
tell you what I use because it's just
gonna be really hard to describe what
something smells like but um I will show
you what I'm using and it'll just be
kind of a fun video like that um but one
fragrance that I really really like is
this does anybody know what this is this
is the Hilary Duff perfume it's called
with love and I got this for Christmas
and I'm about out of it but it smells so
good it's kind of a little bit of a
slightly stronger scent than what I
usually wore and it's not all that
fruity so it's a little different but
it's it's so it just kind of sweet it
has a little bit of us by sea hint to it
I told you it was gonna be hard for me
to describe but um that's one that I use
and then it um it also came with like a
lotion to an a shower gel so that's a
good thing to do if you want your
fragrance to last longer
you can always layer it if you have a
coordinating low
or something like that I always hear
that tip from people and there's a few
others that I like because I was given
by my sisters-in-law they gave me this
set of like the mini Victoria's Secret
um perfumes and they're all like awesome
I really like them all but my very
favorite one and I've been using them
like on and off now um it's very sexy
isn't this cute isn't it adorable how
small it is but this is I love the smell
of this I love it I just I mean I can't
I'm not even going to describe it but if
you've ever smelled it you can go you're
Victoria's Secret store and like test
these too so but I like that one and I
like a super model by Victoria's Secret
it's a little bit lighter scent than the
very sexy it's like I don't know I
really don't know but it's I like that
one and then um this one's gonna blow
your mind how cute it is it is what's it
called sexy little things look how cute
it's got a little bow on it and
everything
don't you just love mini stuff I love
miniature stuff but I definitely this is
my favorite of the Victoria Secret ones
and then this is what I had been using
pretty much all the time and then I have
a body splash that I really like it is
from Calgon and I don't know if you can
see it's the Brazilian beauty in
passionfruit and Brazil nut and it's
just a really unique scent it's fruity
it's really light it's good for summer I
have a lotion that comes with it
it's nice to like I said be able to
layer it and it lasts longer and stuff
like that so anyway those are my
favorite cents if you wanted to know and
feel free to post your own if you got
things you really like posting a comment
we can talk about it but I am just glad
you guys wanted to tell you about my
good news and I hope you are just as
excited as I am because it's a really
big step for me it is gonna change my
schedule around a lot I think I'm gonna
have to be in there at like the show
starts at 5:30 a.m. I'm probably gonna
have to be there like 3:30 in the
morning or maybe even three so you back
that up to get ready do my hair and
makeup and everything like that I'm
gonna have to get up pretty early to get
there fortunately it's not a long drive
for me to the station but it's just
gonna be a lot of fun like if you've
ever watched morning newscast as opposed
to evening you can tell a big difference
just the tone of it is lighter and it's
just really fun so anyway thank you guys
for watching and I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
