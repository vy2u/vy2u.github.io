dollar store Beauty adventure I did this
first a couple years ago and lots of
people enjoy them basically what I do is
I go to the store look around look for
some of those generic products see
actually how well they perform you know
we test them out in this video I'm not
sure what we're going to find because
last time there were quite a few
you know Dollar General brand items that
compared to a certain name-brand but in
a while since I've really scoured the
dollar store so I think we're going to
go back and see if we can find any new
things and let you know how it goes all
right we have arrived here at the lovely
Dollar General and we're going to take a
look inside and see what we find
all right so I'm going to be testing out
the slush puppy slush bars just kidding
I know those are good as far as the
beauty stuff I actually ran into quite a
few new things that I hadn't seen there
before just got home it's so hot outside
I feel like I'm melting hell a little
bit but I wanted to give you a closer
look at the items LA Colors stuff we'll
try that out the lashes and and adhesive
as well with a wand so that might be a
nice comparison to the Revlon we'll try
the eye roller hop in the shower try out
this body wash got the lip balm of quite
well first begin by taking the makeup
off or trying to anyway with these
makeup removing towelettes cupcake says
I will try out the cat treats you bought
me that is all
so these makeup removing facial
towelettes are comparable to the
Neutrogena kind there are 25 in the
packet here and the last time I used
some generics from Dollar General it was
in that last video and they were the
ponds kind and they did not perform too
well in getting all my makeup all these
claimed to dissolve all traces of makeup
including waterproof mascaras so it
doesn't feel too terribly moist has sort
of a fresh scent to it actually kind of
a strong scent but I'm just gonna get
started taking off the makeup
little scared just going on my eye with
this because I can just sense that
there's so much fragrance in these but I
am not feeling any irritation right now
it looks like a lot of the products
coming off to really test how much this
took off I am oh doesn't look pretty I
am going to wash my face with an equate
towelette here that you moisten with
water and those really seem to get rid
of everything on my face all the time
and so we're going to just go over my
face with one of these and see if it
picks up anything extra we've got
there's a little bit of eye makeup that
that still came off on this one but
really um maybe a little bit of face
makeup but not those things considered
and the fact that it didn't take off
absolutely everything it did need a
little extra help I would give these
like a B+ I've tried the actual
Neutrogena kind these seem to perform
very much the same way the the brand
name does so I think these are pretty
good so now we're gonna hop in the
shower or I'm gonna hop in the shower
not take the camera with me and try out
the vanilla body butter wash and this
says compared to soft soap body butter
mega moisture body wash says it's going
to hydrate skin leave skin feeling
smooth and silky so we will see if
that's the cake just out of the shower
and I gotta say I really like this stuff
I got a little whiff of the scent when I
was in the store and I thought it just
had a really nice light soft smell I'm
kind of a typical vanilla scent that you
would expect one of those body washes
that kind of has a really thick creamy
feel but yet it's still able to lather
up and I've not put any lotion on yet
since getting out of the shower and I
still feel like my skin doesn't feel
like squeaky clean dry you know what I
done just for a good general body wash
it's not going to completely strip your
skin but still get you clean I think
this is grace enriched with mango
that's the kind of butter that's in here
enjoyed it I'll keep using it and I'll
give it a name stop moving into the
skincare stuff I'm going to try this DG
body rejuvenating eye roller I actually
have the Olay version of this which is
the Olay Regenerist anti-aging eye
roller and believe it or not this
actually contains more products this
contains 0.3 fluid ounces and the Olay
is point two fluid ounces which was kind
of surprising totally different like
packaging format here with the Olay it
had kind of a clicker at the bottom and
then the little beads here where product
comes up through and then you can roll
it around on your eye this one it's more
of a squeeze tube which I think I like
even better and you just squeeze it
product will come up and you can roll
that and it says anti-aging enhances
elasticity deep puffs and illuminate and
while it does feel pretty cooling it's
for best results apply in the morning
and as needed I bet if you left this in
your refrigerator it would really give
you a cooling sensation but I like it
you just squeeze it you can see a little
product coming up there and then it just
rolls right under it seems to have
absorbed fairly quickly into the skin
but still feels moisturized to be
performing and feeling just like the OL
a kind does but as far as any anti-aging
benefits I'd have to use it a little bit
longer before I gave it any kind of
grade also about the beeswax lip balm
this is to be compared to Burt's Bees
it's 100% natural and I gotta say it's
going on my lips much more smoothly than
the Burt's Bees kind did I always felt
like Burt's Bees was just a little bit
dry maybe it was the tube I had or
something but I didn't feel like it just
was gliding on with ease even from when
I first picked it up but this has that
same minty feel kind of a tingle if you
like a minty lip balm you might really
like this real basic I mean it's not
giving you any color of course or
anything like it I got this like near
the the cough drops area not near the
beauty stuff it actually says DG health
on it but again it's a beeswax lip balm
I have no complaints it feels really
smooth I don't think it feels real
you see or anything and I feel like it's
even smoother than the original Burt's
Bees so pay for that all my foundation
powder bronzer and all that stuff on but
I'm going to try this LA Colors blush in
blushing pink and it came with this
little brush which unfortunately is no
good and I didn't think it was gonna be
I mean it's just tiny and it's cut
really blunt and it's just not soft at
all and just I'm not going to go there
but this blush I thought wow if that
color turns out to be pigmented I think
that'd be really pretty plus it's not
overly shimmery it just looks kind of
like a satin finish so to swatch it on
my finger it looks about like that so
not too bad a little more sheer than I
was hoping for but let's see how it
looks on the cheeks I'm just going to
grab a blush brush here fix some up kind
of go on the outer part of the apple of
my cheek it's kind of pretty actually
it's definitely not one of those blushes
like sleek or the balm or something
where you barely tap into it I mean I'm
kind of like swirling my brush in it and
then applying really hard to open
actually I had to like pry that top part
open with my tweezers and then the
bottom part it's kind of strange it's
got an eyeshadow applicator in there and
a little mirror so this is kind of an
average to above-average blush I give
this c-plus I think it gave pretty color
it's something I may continue to use now
and then maybe d-pod it out this thing
just so I don't have to mess with this
compact every single tiny about like a
comparable price range the elf studio
blushes which I love are $3 and I think
they're quite a bit better quality than
this so that's why I give this kind of
an average rating he's jumbo eye pencils
from LA Colors I have them in the green
shade and this taupe the green is called
summer love the taupe is called
sandcastle here are my swatches and the
green one actually has glitter in it the
taupey color is more like just a
metallic pearly finish aren't the kind
of like jumbo pencils that set to a
completely long wearing finish like
maybelline color tattoo or the Mallee
shadow stain
the Milani ones that I've talked about
they're more like I think the NYX jumbo
pencil is in staying power but they
don't go on quite as smooth it's not
like this was hard to apply but it's
just a little more dry in consistency
but I am going to take this taupe one
and just use it um across my eyelid just
so you can see you know what it looks
like on the eye I feel like I've got a
press kind of hard here on my eyelid
which I don't love doing in order to get
that color on there it's not not super
pigmented or bold and these swatches
have had a chance to sit on my hand and
you can see they just don't get to that
long wearing really like set state so
for these I'm given these a deed and
there are just so many drugstore
long-wear cream shadow products on the
market these days and they did have more
colors they look like they had some
pretty colors but I can tell by the
texture of both of these that they're a
little bit dry and yet they don't have
amazing stain now the eyeshadows they
had lots of different trios and these
were new to me I hadn't seen these
before 3 color eyeshadow palettes from
LA Colors they were all a dollar and
this one is called Magnolia I really was
attracted to the purple and the coral in
this palette there's a look at those
they all kind of have a pearlescent
finish to them a little bit powdery I
could just tell as I put my finger in
them but color intensity wise it's
really not too bad so I think I'll go
ahead and do a quick look with these
shado was really I thought nice and easy
to blend I was kind of fun to see how
the coral and the purple shades
interacted a little bit
I thought the purple looked really
pretty and soft kind of just with a
fluffy brush there in the outer corner I
also did the purple under the lower lash
line and I smudged it over some black
liner and it even made that purple a
little more intense so I like this and I
would go back and probably try some of
the other shades that they offered I
think you get a nice amount of product
in here it was just a buck now keep in
mind as I was looking over most of the
shade selection they all had kind of
this shimmery finish to I don't think
there may be quite as strong as like my
wet and wild eyeshadows in terms of
pigmentation or I think of the
Maybelline eye studio as being some you
know really shimmery shades that pack a
big punch but they're not bad and I
think if you ran into a trio of these
that you know where colors you were
really looking for like these are really
fun I would give this a B+ I think it's
above average the shadows do have a you
know some Sheerness to them but they can
be built up and they're pretty easy to
use we have left here to do is to put
our lashes on and I picked up two sets I
got the Broadway eyes 100% human hair
lashes in flirty which this style kind
of reminds me of the kiss zero threes I
think so kind of a lengthening lash but
it's got like varying lengths of the
lashes themselves so some are longer
some will give you the look of more
thickness and then I got dreamy which is
more of a it looks like a shorter lash
maybe a little more dense all around and
these were a buck fifty I'm gonna go
with this style because I don't feel
like I usually wear lashes that are that
thick and schland is pretty flexible it
still reminds me quite a bit of like say
the salon perfect style the glue I have
here it says black odor free
latex-free waterproof Broadway eyes glue
and so this is the strip eyelash
adhesive says 24-hour flexible hold and
you take it out and it's got it's not a
brush tip it's like a hard plastic tip
and so all they had was black just going
to get this on my lash band holding on
to the center of the lash gonna place it
right on my eyeliner there and I'm going
to attach the outer corner now the
benefit of the black glue is that pretty
much you know it gets invisible to the
eye immediately appearance-wise I have
no problems with these I feel like they
add thickness they're not super long
this may be exactly what someone's
looking for who wants you know kind of a
natural lash but something that's you
know not too crazy long they feel really
lightweight on my eyes the glue was
pretty easy to manage we'll check back
in a little bit later and see how well
the lashes and the whole eye looks take
hey guys it's an early evening time now
so I thought I'd check back in and
actually I've had some issues with the
lashes not so much the lashes I think
but actually the glue not an hour into
wearing them I noticed that they were
actually coming loose not on the ends
they actually right in the middle and so
I don't know what the deal was I felt
like I had them evenly coated with glue
and so I took them off we glued them put
them back on and I'm having a similar
issue on let's see this size it's held
up pretty well but this eye still is
coming a little bit undone so I don't
think it's the lashes fault the lashes
seem really similar to a lot of things
I've used but this glue is not really
something I think I can trust I really
wanted this to work because the price
comparison to the Revlon precision lash
glue I mean this is would be a good deal
but if it doesn't work it doesn't work
so I give this a let's see an hour into
wearing then they started to come up I
give this a
I love that it has the wand I think
there's a good concept going on here but
it just doesn't work well and then as
far as the lashes go a problem with
these I would give these in a a - maybe
just because there were only two styles
it would be awesome if they had a bunch
of different false lash styles there in
the store but the shadow held up fine I
feel like there's been no creasing no
fading all throughout the course of the
afternoon thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I'm glad you
were interested to see another one again
if you want to see the first one I did
it was a couple years ago and I'll link
to that below in the info box but these
are really fun for thinking about maybe
other stores I could do this at that
carry just a lot of store brand products
yes some suggestions and things you're
interested in um definitely shoot your
ideas my way thanks again for watching
I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
