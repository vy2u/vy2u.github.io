this video this is going to be a review
of a hair product that I've started
trying recently that I really like but
first I want to make a quick
announcement about my blog I know it's
probably been a while since I've
mentioned this in any of my YouTube
posts but the address is WWE TV :
slash slash you broadcast dot blog
spot.com and I'll put a link to that in
the description box but I'm I've kind of
revamped it a little bit and I'm
updating it a lot more and putting some
new features in it so I hope you guys
will check that out actually the most
recent thing that I've put in there is
some details about the people that I
really like to watch on YouTube not all
of them because I couldn't possibly put
them all on there but some of the people
that I like to regularly check out their
videos so if you want to know who I'm
watching check my blog and it'll be the
sort of thing that sometimes I'll be
expanding on the videos I do other times
it'll be something totally different
like that so I hope you get the chance
to check that out as well and you know
joining you can get like get it so if
you have like your own Google home page
where you can get the little different
categories to pop up like you can get an
RSS feed of it so every time I have a
new post it comes up so that's kind of
cool
so I hope you get the chance to check it
out if you have some spare time and the
product that I want to review today is
the is by Aussie and it's called the 3
minute miracle and it's called a
Reconstructor it's really like kind of a
deep conditioning treatment and I was
just kind of in this in the drugstore
last weekend I think it was and I was
looking for something that could sort of
revitalize hair that gets really dry in
the winter time and you're outside a lot
and it just seems like the life kind of
gets sucked out of your hair so I wanted
something that I could do that wouldn't
be super time consuming but would be
easy to just do in the shower and maybe
do it once a week they actually say this
is something you could use
every day if you really wanted to use
the - your conditioner but I'll describe
I'll give you the description and then
the way it works right off of the bottle
here like it says called 3 minute
miracle it's the original one I think
they had one that says like deep deep
cleaning or something like that but I
just went with the original because I
didn't I did I don't know I feel like I
was already kind of taking going out on
a limb with this since I nobody had
really recommended it to me yet
it says it's the original miracle unique
formula you've loved for years accented
with Australian bull mint in just three
minutes you'll be saying bye-bye to dry
hair and hello gorgeous
mix-and-match with other great Aussie
products blah blah blah and then it says
directions says what conditioner through
clean wet hair so like I what I did I
shampooed at first I wasn't just in the
shower and leave it on for one two three
minutes so do something else do your
body wash or whatever and then rinse
with warm water for extra shine soul
with a cool water rinse use daily or as
often as needed I think this is the type
of thing I'm probably going to do once a
week when I have a little extra time and
I got out of the shower first off it
smells wonderful it's I like the smell
of a lot of the different Aussie
products so I kind of was looking for
something that I would enjoy the smell
of so I kind of trusted that this would
be good in that way and so I just put it
on and it does take a little while to
rinse it out because you want to kind of
give it a nice complete rinse you don't
want you know things building up in your
hair so you do need to take the time to
get it all rinsed out and everything but
once you do I did go ahead and do do
like a cold water rinse on it - like
they recommend it for the added shine so
but after I styled my hair after I blow
dried it and I felt it I was like wow
this my hair has not felt this soft for
since I don't know when so it really was
surprising to me how effective it was at
really making my hair feel soft and
strong and that's really an important
thing for those of us that have long
hair
you want your hair to really feel you
know strong all the way through and it
just I don't know what it did but I felt
like it really pumped some life back
into my hair it was easy to use like I
said you know if you've got an extra
couple minutes in the shower that's all
it takes to use it it was very
inexpensive I would say it was between
three and four dollars just got at
Walmart but it's just so so easy and I'm
just really pleased with the end result
and my hair went on to be easy to style
like I went ahead and blow-dried it and
then I styled it with is use my curling
iron and you know did what I do to my
hair and it worked fine there it wasn't
like too slippery I don't know if you
guys have ever like used conditioning
things on your hair and then you start
to style it and it's just really flyaway
and slippery and stuff this was still
easy for me to work with it just had a
great great shine and I just really
liked what it does for me so it's
something I'm going to keep using and I
just thought I'd have to tell people
about it because I think you guys what
do you guys would like it as well so
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
