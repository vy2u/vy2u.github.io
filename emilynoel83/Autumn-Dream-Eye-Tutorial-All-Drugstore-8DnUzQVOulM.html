fun full eye tutorial and it's using a
great little quad here from Maybelline
it's called autumn dream and it is
limited edition I found it in a special
display in the drugstore that had this
and a couple other quads and some other
Maybelline products for fall but as you
can see it's got a lot of great jewel
tones in it and I just want to put out
there that if you don't have this
particular quad as long as you can round
up a purple a pretty like Jade green and
navy and just any nice sparkly shimmery
shade you can pull off this it's really
fun because when your eyes are open
you're seeing most of the purple right
you're seeing it like under the eye and
in a more faded out way above the eye
but then when you look down you've got
that peekaboo effect of this pretty
green in there so I hope you like the
look it's using a bunch of drugstore
products so let's get started I'm gonna
start off by applying my ELF eyelid
primer this is just the one dollar one I
talked about in my best in beauty video
but it really works just as well as
anything else I have using my autumn
dream quad I'm going to go to this
shimmery shade it's really really shiny
and I'm just gonna dab that right around
my innermost corner here and then I'm
gonna bring a little bit more of that up
onto the inner part of my lid I'm going
to this pretty green color kind of a
jade green really nice is going to apply
this on the lid and you can see I'm
overlapping some of that champagne color
and that's just basically lightening the
green up a little bit so it's going to
be lighter on the inner most part and
then deepen up toward the outside and
I'm also working this green upward into
my crease a little bit and then I'm
going into the green with a fluffy brush
and I'm just going to use that to again
get a little more of this greenish color
in there
and get a nice soft blend on it then I'm
gonna go back to my little flat brush
and go into this Navy and I'm gonna Pat
that just right here on the outer part
of my lid to deepen things up there then
I'm going to start working in the purple
and I'm using this ether t-6 from Sigma
it's a really small wispy blending brush
you can use a larger one as well I just
love the control that this size gives me
so I'm going to go into that purple and
with this I'm just gonna start taking
that shade right above the green that's
in the crease and no real fancy
techniques here I'm just applying very
light pressure and blending this all
around the crease area if you want you
no more purple to show just keep adding
on a little bit more I always like to
start a little bit light so I don't
overdo it and then work up to the
intensity that I want and then I'm gonna
just use a bear brush to make sure the
edges of that are as soft as possible
and then I'm going to take just a touch
of this sparkly white shade again where
you first place your brush is where
there's going to be the most
concentration of color so I'm going
right under the highest point of the
arch of my brow and then I'm just going
to lightly blend to either side I'm
gonna bring in some black liner this is
my Jordana 12-hour made to last liner in
black point draw all the way across I'm
also gonna use this liner on my lower
inner rim as well now you see how the
purple here has a lot more color
intensity on the lower lash line and
then it's much more diffused up above
the eye to give this even more punch I'm
using a purple liner underneath and so
this is again from Jordana it's the 12
hour made to last in purple fix time
aiming to get right in between the
lashes here so we're the most intensity
the black is right there on the inner
rim this is just kind of fading out from
that a little bit using my smudge brush
and going into this purple and I am just
topping off that liner and then we can
just see that purple start to come
through and then I'm taking a little bit
of the Navy
just right here on the outermost part
kind of connecting up to my black liner
on the upper lash line then I'm just
gonna curl my lashes then I'm applying
some covergirl remarkable mascara this
is kind of one of the old school masts
carrots from cover girls line it's
called washable waterproof which is an
interesting concept and I think it holds
the curl nicely this is a little bit
more dramatic look so I'm applying a bit
more to the lower lashes than I might
normally use I'm using my salon perfect
demi whispies lashes these are slightly
flared out and longer toward the outside
so that's what's gonna give us this nice
little swept up look and I say this
every time but I have a full tutorial on
how to use false lashes if you want you
know a really in-depth detailed
step-by-step approach to this but here
I'm just getting my glue on the lash
band make sure the center is placed
where I want it and then set down the
outer corner and my inner corner on my
cheeks I'm using this ayane blush it's a
matte kind of pinky mauve blush and the
shade name is Miss bliss and I got that
from Fred super dollar and I love the
blushes from this line it's great and
then on my lips I'm using my flirt big
squeeze moisturizing lip gloss and the
shade is berry hug I did do a full
review on this gloss on beauty broadcast
Express if you want to see that I can
apply it with more full color I've got
it on kind of sheer right now to go
along with this eye look thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
soon in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
