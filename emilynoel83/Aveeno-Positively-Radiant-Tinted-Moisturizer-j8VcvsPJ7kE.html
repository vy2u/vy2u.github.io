do a review for you today on the Aveeno
positively radiant
tinted moisturizer I had mentioned doing
a face demo with me putting this on but
I wouldn't be able to really get to that
till this weekend and I've got some
other things planned for that I am
traveling I've got some other videos
planned and stuff like that so I'm just
going to go ahead and do it now for you
but yeah this is a tinted moisturizer
you can find it in your drugstore Aveeno
is known to be a brand that is really
skin friendly I think it's good for
sensitive skin I have had eczema issues
on my face and ever since I've been
using the Aveeno products I it's like
they have not come back to the level
that they were at and I really don't
deal with them at all I had like a some
dryness basically what eczema is I mean
I have a whole video about it but like
it will sometimes show up in like patchy
dry areas where the skin may or may not
even flake off a little bit and so
severe dryness in certain places and so
I've been using day and night and Aveeno
moisturizer the ultra calming and that
works really well for me and so I felt
like this was a brand I could trust when
I got the Aveeno positively radiant
tinted moisturizer and a lot of people
have been talking about it so when I
found it I found it in my let's see
where I found this one at an Ulta but
they also have them at Target and other
drugstores it's somewhat new but I think
it is pretty much coming out everywhere
Aveeno is sold anyway just to kind of
describe the product for you it is an
SPF 30 and mooster Iser it does have
that tint of color my shade is medium
there's two color options medium and
light to medium but as you will find
like when I put the medium out on my
hand I think you'll notice like oh that
doesn't really look like your skin but
it really does like sheer out and blend
out but yet it still has coverage it's
really interesting but it's oil-free it
says
and it claims to even tone and texture
with natural looking coverage it says
with clinically proven total soy complex
and natural light reflecting minerals so
you're getting 2.5 fluid ounces in this
you're getting a little less like I mean
I think it was four ounces that was in
the ultra calming and this is also a
little more expensive it's going to run
you I think somewhere in the ballpark of
maybe thirteen to fifteen dollars prices
vary by location obviously and the
different deals you can come up with at
different stores but it's a little
pricey for a drugstore product so I
understand why a lot of you really
wanted to hear a review on it before you
checked it out um I have been using this
on and off for let me see probably three
or three or four weeks now I think and I
don't wear it everyday like for example
I did the news today so I put on my full
face of foundation and all that but
what's interesting about this particular
product is if you're having good skin if
you don't have a lot of issues to cover
up if you don't have a lot of blemishes
if you don't have a lot of severely
uneven skin tone I'm talking like you
know major blotchiness and stuff like
that this is going to actually give you
a surprising amount of coverage so
talking about the coverage I want to go
ahead and show you it has this little
pump feature so you can pump it right
out and this is what the medium looks
like now you start to rub it in and
you're like okay maybe that looks a
little bit light or whatever but you
keep just I I encourage you to use your
hands with this product not a tool or a
brush of any kind rub it all the way in
and you get a this kind of glow that is
coming off of it like it's a pretty
radiant look on your face and I used it
if you're looking for kind of an example
of what I look like with this on and I
just had some bronzer and blush on along
with it
check out the game-day tutorial the
Tennessee one um it was it was decent
coverage things I noticed it covering up
on my face I noticed a slight decrease
in dark circles I noticed
some coverage to the lighter freckles
that I had and I didn't like completely
mask them and I have you know it's
summertime so like some of them get a
little deeper if I'm out in the Sun more
but I did notice some coverage there and
I noticed an overall evening of my skin
and the thing that you know cannot be
denied is that it gives you a definite
kind of glean to your skin without
having Sparkle and shimmer if you've
taken a really close look at say Revlon
Photoready foundation you can see these
tiny tiny sparkles and shimmers in that
this is it's undetectable in here but
yet it's it does give you a glow on your
skin and I think about dry skin and
normal skin which is probably the
category I've been coming into um
and I think it really gives you a
healthy glow it keeps your skin from
seeming you know dry flaky that sort of
thing but if you had really oily skin I
sometimes wonder could this make you
look oily er than you actually are
because of the glow that it gives off
again it's not like an unmanageable
thing it's not awful or I think it looks
lovely
but if you already kind of tended to
always look oily would this make you
look worse and so what I would recommend
like if I were going to use this and
just put this all over my face
I would definitely still want to maybe
put a little powder on my t-zone just to
ensure that you know as the day goes on
I don't get you know too oily but if you
have naturally oily skin I would say
that's less of an option and more of a
thing maybe you need to do with this
product just because of the glow it's
going to give your skin but it's really
pretty and not all the Aveeno products
have that we're keep in mind this is the
positively radiant tinted moisturizer
and I'm assuming there's a regular
positively radiant that's not tinted I'm
assuming it does that similar sort of
glow because the ultra calming does not
have any of that in there it's also a
fantastic moisturizer but um yeah it
really it does a good job blending the
only thing is is you're going to have to
kind of think about skin tone wise I
wonder also about the deeper skin tones
um I think it kind of stinks that
there's no offering really for that
because there's medium and then there's
the light one and I think that you know
if you have very very deep skin you
probably wouldn't want to pick up medium
because I think it might be too light
although it does a good job of blending
in my skin is medium so I think that
works um but anyway this is a good
quality product and I will continue to
use it and the other drugstore tinted
moisturizer that I like is covergirl
smoothers and that does not give near
the coverage this does which interests
me because this is not like a makeup
brand Aveeno is you know body care skin
care that kind of thing and it managed
to actually give me really good coverage
it's a great foundation substitute is
what I would call it on a day when you
want a little less you want the glow I
mean if you're a high school student and
you're rushing through getting ready for
work I mean oh my goodness what a great
thing to throw on and get those two in
one kind of steps going on with some
coverage and some moisturizer and I mean
if you use this and then you had some
other areas you needed to conceal on top
of it I think that's a great option and
also think about also using a little
powder on top of it as well all good
options
it does look natural it looks glowing
it's and it's just a fantastic product
and like I said please maybe take a
closer look at the way my face looks in
the Tennessee gameday tutorial because
that's an example of this plus some
concealer plus a little bronzer and
blush maybe what you might tend to do if
you put this on and you can see about
how much coverage that gives so thank
you so much for watching this review I
hope I got to everything although I'm
sure there may be some questions I don't
answer oh the scent it just has kind of
a fresh scent it doesn't smell like
sunscreen E or anything like that but
there is a slight scent to it it's not
entirely unscented so keep in mind there
is a bit of a scent there I'm just
looking on the back to see if there's
anything else that I need to touch on
but yeah I'm really happy with this and
I'm going to continue to use it so if
you do have questions again comment
below and maybe even others the
use this product can share their
experience as well thanks again guys for
tuning in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
