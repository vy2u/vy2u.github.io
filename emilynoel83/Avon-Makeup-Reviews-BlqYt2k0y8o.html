here with my review on a bunch of
different Avon products I know I've been
talking saying I've got some Avon
reviews coming and finally the video is
here I've got so many different things
to talk about including that new crazy
paintbrush style mascara so I'm going to
touch on my reviews on everything in
this video for Avon and then I almost
threw in the mark stuff as well and like
know this video is going to be way too
long if I do that so in a separate video
I'll do the mark step that's majority of
what I have to talk about in this video
is stuff that I've just ordered from my
local Avon lady actually my first order
was just online and then I found the
local person who sells Avon in my area a
few things were sent as PR samples to me
so I'll go through the stuff kind of
quickly and then at the end sort of wrap
up what my major hits and misses were
but my first thing that I'm going to
tell you about is the Avon magics
cashmere advanced liquid foundation so I
have this in natural beige which is a
very very accurate shade match for me
this has broad-spectrum SPF 15 I am
wearing it today I would say this is
definitely a medium coverage foundation
but you can build it up a little bit it
I really like that you know the squeeze
two plastic format I think that's very
travel friendly and very sanitary as
well you know you just squeeze out what
you need and you're good um as far as
the finish on the skin I would compare
it to the L'Oreal visible lift
foundation if you've ever tried that I
would almost classify that finish as a
semi matte finish it's definitely not a
completely flat matte dry seaming finish
it almost has a little luminosity to it
more of a natural skin type finish if
you know what I mean texture wise it
feels almost a little bit whipped almost
as if this was the Revlon Colorstay
whipped formula in here and you're just
squeezing it out of a tube it kind of
reminds me of that but staying power is
not quite as solid as it is with like
Revlon Colorstay or Colorstay whipped
I feel like about 3/4 of the way through
the day even after setting this with
powder I definitely need
powder touch-up in my t-zone but this
may be something really good for someone
with dry skin much like the L'Oreal
visible lift that finish looks really
fresh not dry and cakey so this may be
something really good for a person with
dry skin who still wants you know a
decent amount of coverage location wise
I like blending this in with any of my
Sigma synthetic kabuki brushes like the
f8 but even if you just use your fingers
I think you're going to find that this
is very easy to blend in to the skin and
get nice even coverage with I love this
next product so much this is really cool
it's the Avon glow blush bronzer duo and
I have it in peach glow so it comes in a
little brown compact like this nice big
mirror and then check it out you've got
a split pan of a matte bronzer and then
a really peachy blush here as I look
into my little screen here it's looking
more pink this is actually a very Orange
II blush I really like both of I think
they're nicely pigmented and I love the
depth of this bronzer this actually is
almost an exact shade match for Too
Faced chocolate Soleil and it makes a
great contour I used it to contour today
and then I use more of a pinky blush
with this look I have going on but I
love these two I feel like well if there
seems to be more matte bronzers coming
out on the market and at drugstore
prices I feel like there still aren't a
lot of matte blushes so I love this duo
for that reason so from that line I
ordered this Avon glow bronzing gel and
so this is in the shade medium bronze so
you get it in a kind of long skinny tube
like this and they say to use dot on
face and blend evenly the way I like to
use this is I will put a little bit here
on my hand
and shear it out like just even it out
just a little bit almost so it looks
like that and then I take my little elf
small stipple brush go into that and
then dot it wherever I want it on my
face this is definitely more of a glowy
product it will go on your skin so sheer
and soft but it's not something I would
use it's like a real concentrated
contouring type product you look really
really closely you can see a very very
fine shimmer to this but it's very hard
to detect
find this to be a huge must-have thing
like Oh everybody needs a gel bronzer
but what it can be good for is if you
want to tint your moisturizers or add a
little bit to certain foundations to
deepen them up give yourself a little
bit more of a sunkissed glow you can do
that with this and it's very easy to do
you just blend it in with your fingers
and then dad you know your mixture all
over blend it in on your face or as I
said you can use the small stipple brush
if you just want a light application of
this but it's a cool product and I
haven't had any problems with now let's
get into the eyeshadows I when I was
looking at one of the Avon catalogs I
saw a gorgeous look and I think I've
talked about this in a video blog about
it do but a really pretty purple and
gold eye look and I recreated that look
with some other shadows I had but I did
end up ordering the shadows that were
said to be used in that look and they
were a couple of these true color
eyeshadow duos um so I have it in vivid
orchid and gold goddess so I'll show you
vivid orchid first you can see you're
getting a really deep plum and then a
light lilac shade the this shit has kind
of a pearly finish and this one has like
a very fine sparkle to it but it can
actually show up somewhat matte on your
eyes so I think those are pretty I don't
think these are the most pigmented
shadows across the board with Avon
eyeshadows I don't think they're the
softest most pigmented shadows out there
not as much as like wet and wild or the
balm or anything like that and this may
not make sense but I feel like they go
on the eyes more effectively than they
swatch on your hands like if you're just
doing a little dry swatch of these and
put them on your hand you're probably
going to be like maybe it's a ho-hum
kind of shade but when I put a primer on
my eyes and really Pat them on either
with the sponge tip or a flat brush I'm
much more impressed with the color pick
then this gold one I actually might like
this one even better you get a light
shade here which actually has it looks
kind of buttery and it has a slight bit
of golden shimmer right there in that
shit and this shade I would I would
describe is kind of an old gold color
you know it's not the bright brassy
ultra metallic gold Vista
have some shimmer to it I've worn these
and worn this in the crease and it's
just kind of that natural you know
barely there crease type load well I
don't see these shadows as a total
must-have just kind of
middle-of-the-road wear low price range
i shadow czar concerned and basically
the same can be said for this true color
eyeshadow quad and this was something
that was sent to me and this is what the
new I guess shadow configuration in
quads is going to look like like if you
look this up on the website at least on
the day on today when I'm shooting this
video when I look this up online it said
coming soon for these but this is the
quad in purple pop and I am wearing it
today some of this lightest shade around
the inner corner I use this on the lid
and in the crease I use this in my outer
corner and then I blended on the edge of
those Purple's out right in here with
the pink and I think it's a really
pretty look I also used some underneath
as well joy these shadows but I think
unless it's a really gorgeous or unique
configuration of shades I don't think I
would probably repurchase a whole lot
more of those something I'm absolutely
thrilled to tell you about is this Avon
extra lasting eye shadow pencil I have
it in amethyst and it looks like this
and this is a jumbo pencil guys if
you've been with me a while what does
this look like looks a lot like the
Mallee ever color shadow sticks to me
same exact size twist up format you
don't have to sharpen them not to jumbo
of a stick to where you couldn't just
smudge it under the eye which I did
today I actually had this as a base
under the whole look I think this
particular shade is gorgeous I think
this is like a taupe with a little bit
of purple undertone once it sets it goes
to a completely long wearing finish like
you can't rub it off I love that about
this I want to drive more of these
shades for sure and I'm very excited
that it's something so similar to Nally
and in the exact you know way Mally's is
constructed that's the way this is to
wanted to try those shadow sticks from
Malley I would highly recommend you look
at these if you're trying to save money
so that was the extra lasting line and
I've tried a couple of other things from
that line as well lip products that I
wasn't too happy with one is this
lipstick in the shade is eternal flame
makes it
the song I won't sing it for you though
but here's the lipstick gorgeous red
shade here I mean really really pretty
and it's very smooth and very creamy my
problem with this was and it may have
been my fault for wearing this out to
dinner one night but it totally very
easily moved outside my lip line like
you're eating you're drinking and around
the corner of my mouth like I when I got
back in the car and I looked in the
rearview mirror I was like I look clown
like you know I look like I have drawn
the product way outside my lips I
appreciate that they're putting out a
long wearing lip product that actually
is creamy since so many of them are dry
but if it's just gonna spread outside my
lips like that and then when I try to
wipe it off my skin that's where it
sticks and I'm like I can't get it off
of here kind of sad because it's such a
pretty red but I just don't see myself
getting a lot of use out of that anymore
and then the other thing I got was the
extra lasting lip gloss and always on
pink and this looks super duper bright
here I realize but it's definitely going
to go on more sheer it's like a pink
with a little bit of gold and iridescent
almost sparkle in there and I found this
gloss to be really sticky and
uncomfortable on my lips yeah I'm pretty
tolerant of sticky products on my lips
but the longer the stayed on my mouth
the more annoyed I got with it so I
don't like that but a gloss that I do
love I think this is a new one it's the
Ultra glaze we're in Palm Beach pink and
this formula I think is so comfortable
and so pretty on the lips
as well this is a really creamy pink and
I'm wearing it today I'm kind of going
out of order I'm wearing it today on top
of the lipstick I'll talk about in a
second it's a little bit sheer but I
still think the color is beautiful I
kind of like that the applicator is
stiff and it's actually just a little
bit squared off at the end so you can
get a really precise application on your
lips and I like that lipsticks from Avon
that I absolutely love and I know I've
raved about this one before but it's the
totally kissable line and I love this
lovey-dovey pink shade that's what I'm
wearing underneath this gloss so this
gloss pinked it up a little
more but these are so soft so
comfortable on the lips this is just a
gorgeous pink shade this particular
shade in itself I just love a tubes are
absolutely gorgeous with this mirrored
kind of finish all around I just love
these lipsticks so I bought another one
I think this shade is natural glow but
it's kind of covered up by a stamp
that's on here but this is more of a
nude shade it's got a little bit of
shimmer it's more sheer than lovey-dovey
pink I don't love the color as much but
still a really comfortable easy to wear
formula yay for these I love them a lot
and I'm trying to figure out what this
crazy callers doing on this shirt it's
got zebras all over it new meaning to
zebra print right oh my gosh these I had
to get for sentimental reasons the Avon
flavor savors lip balm like this cherry
flavor
I remember getting these as a kid and no
joke I would go up to the tree house and
eat them yes these actually have a taste
no I am not tempted to eat any more but
I talked about that in the 25 things you
don't know about me video but gosh
they're they smell exactly the same I
swear nothing has changed about the way
these are so I got another one of those
in cherry just because and then these
other lip balms it seems like they put
different looking lip balms in like
every month I guess but I have one in
watermelon and that was in maybe a
spring or summer collection and then
this one is vanilla I got that one just
recently these nice standard lip balms
all they smell great and the flavor
savors do actually have a taste so keep
them away from your kids if you're
worried about them eating them Avon
super shock liner I love this this was
mentioned in a favorites video as well I
have it in the shade Velvet plum I
really really like this isn't this a
gorgeous purple shade I mean a lot of
dark liners as I've said dark plum
liners almost come off on your eyes as
if they're black this one actually shows
up with this gorgeous color it actually
makes a pretty long wearing base as well
like a cream shadow so I just think
that's beautiful those liners do come
with a brush like this like a nice sized
full-size brush it's cut straight across
I don't love it for this kind of liner I
prefer an angle
or a very fine tip brush but just so you
know that comes with it that's but not
least the mega effects mascara this
would be the big launch recently that
everybody's talking about from Avon and
it does not look like a normal mascara
you take the cap off and then you've got
what seems like a paintbrush to me you
grab the handle you wiggle it side to
side and then out pops the brush so this
is what it looks like there are bristles
all the way around and quite a bit of
product comes off on this brush when you
immediately pull it out this is kind of
a wet formula and that is way too much
for my lashes so what I will do is just
blot it right on a tissue just like that
just touch it to the tissue to pull off
some of that excess because it just
makes my lashes stick together if I
don't what I love about this is that it
tilts see you can move that however you
want to get just a dead-on
straightforward application to your
lashes I also like that because there's
bristles all the way around you can flip
it over this way you can turn it you're
going to figure out I think as you use
it like what method actually works the
best for you at first use this I was
like what no way you know this this is
too weird too different but the more I
use this applicator the more I like it
like I think even after I use this up
I'm going to clean this puppy off and
use it just as like a lash separator or
something and these are rubber bristles
on here on the tip as I said they go all
the way around but if this was a more
dry formula mascara I think it would be
totally up my alley
that one problem with this for me is
that the formula is so wet you put it on
and like I said I bought it off first
then I put on a coat and it doesn't
really start to build on itself and
build you great lashes until your coat
gets a little bit dried to be entirely
dry but close to dry and that takes some
time if I don't let it dry between coats
my lashes just start sticking together
okay because it's just that wet so I'm
kind of happy with where my lashes are
built up to right now but it took some
time to get there if you know what I'm
saying because I was letting each coat
dry a low
but I think I did three on the top and
just one coat on the bottom this was
very easy see how much surface area that
covers if I would put this on my lower
lashes so I think I'm going to do a
full-on review just on this product
showing you application and formula is
definitely not my ideal but I mean if
you're an adventurous makeup loving
person who wants to try something new go
for it I could see some people
absolutely loving this mascara and some
people saying no I just like my
traditional one thank you very much
bottom line things I was really pleased
with the totally kissable lipsticks of
course the super shock liner I really am
excited about the extra lasting shadow
sticks
I like this glaze where ultra glaze
where lip gloss I would definitely buy
more of those also the Avon glow in
peach glow the fantastic matte blush
bronzer duo that's great things that
we're pretty good maybe not my ideal of
the Avon magics foundation pretty good
coverage leaves a little bit to be
desired for me in terms of staying power
but I think for a drier skin type this
could be really great i shadow z' i mean
definitely can be worked with their best
with its some sort of base or primer
underneath not the best eyeshadows from
a drugstore price range but not the
worst either missing avon lip balms
these extra lasting lip products that
was not at all a fan of avon glow
bronzer gel pretty good probably most
useful used as some sort of mixer type
product to deepen up current foundations
that you already have thank you so much
for watching thanks to everybody who
demanded some avon reviews on this
channel i hope you enjoyed that and that
it was helpful for you i'll have a
separate video coming up on mark
products in the near future so keep an
eye out for that and i'll see you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
