you this video and I wanted to wait
until I could both do a review on this
and have the time to do a little
tutorial demonstration with it as well
so you're gonna get a little demo on
this product in this video it is $1.00
it has four colors in it it's available
at the drugstore and it is awesome and
it is from ELF it's the brightening eye
color in day tonight and I want to let
you see what this product looks like
because I feel this is a phenomenal
value I love the colors they give you
each one has a special accuse I feel
like each there's no color in this
palette that you're gonna feel like
can't use that one you've got like a
really nice shimmery taupe shade you've
got a almost matte maybe a little bit of
a satin finish on that Navy this
gorgeous plum and a lovely highlight
shade here too so I have used this on my
eyes right now first off I guess I'll
take you through the swatches that I
have on my hand here just so you can
really get a sense of what these colors
are this is a really great highlight
because it's not only is it just you
know one of those standard white shades
that you get in most quads or trios but
it has a really pretty golden undertone
the plum is gorgeous pigmented these two
dark shades talked about not having to
work hard to get that amount of color in
these swatches I mean you just swipe it
on you will have to practically restrain
yourself a little bit like you might
have to with certain wet and wild
palettes from using too much of these
shades definitely tap off the excess on
your brush but there's a plum
there's the gorgeous Navy that can be a
smoky liner either of those can and then
you've got this awesome almost metallic
looking light brownish taupe color so
there's what you're getting talk a
second about the versatility that this
product has because as you can see
you're getting a couple of dark shade
options a couple of light color options
you don't have to use all four shades
every time you apply this product you
could go with just that pretty taupe
color all over the lid for a really
quick look you can use like I said
these shades as your liner if you wanted
to you could go totally smoky and do all
with that navy color and then maybe just
pop this on as a highlighter in the tear
duct or wherever the options are awesome
with this so I want you to be aware that
you spend one dollar for this product
and I realize you know these aren't
absolutely huge portions of each color
that you get but it's still a great
value to have all these different colors
at your disposal here so what I did I
use this today with my ELF mineral
eyeshadow primer that's another product
available from ELF
and it's very very easy use so I wanted
to do a quick little demonstration to
show how I put these products on take a
flat eyeshadow brush and go to this kind
of shimmery taupe shade right there
really pack that on your brush and then
I'm going to kind of look down into my
mirror and apply that all over the lid
right on the inside of the lid I'm going
to apply this sort of shimmery white
pearly shade so get a little of that on
your brush and just kind of DAB that
right there around the inner corner and
kind of take it just under the tear duct
and lower inner part of the lower lash
line using whatever kind of larger size
crease brush you prefer I'm using my
Sigma SS 217 and I'm going to this kind
of deep plum e shade it's kind of the
the second darkest shade in this palette
get some of that on your brush it
doesn't take a lot and just kind of work
this back and forth in your crease area
first I'm kind of just concentrating it
right there in the crease itself then
I'm going to just kind of start to work
it up just a little bit higher toward up
on top of the brow bone and a little bit
closer to the eyebrow using a kind of
really fluffy rounded crease brush like
this going into the white pearly shade
that's going to act as our highlight and
you can kind of overlap with the plumy
color and just get a really nice
highlight going on there finally we're
going to go to this shade which appears
to me to be
almost a matte or satin finish Navy
color and I'm going to take like a
pencil style brush as any small small
crease brush will do get a little bit of
that product on there and I'm going to
just kind of work that on to the very
outer portion of my eyelid here and then
kind of work it just into the outer part
of your crease finally take that same
Navy color and I'm just going to use
again that pencil brush and really
lightly kind of sweep it under the lower
lash line so we have sort of a soft
effect down there I am going to go ahead
and then line my waterline with some
black liner line my upper lash line with
some blank liquid liner
apply some false eyelashes and you've
got the look so there you go guys I top
the look off with some false lashes this
is such an easy palette to use it can go
for a settled a look it can be much more
dramatic than the way I did it if you
want to put even more emphasis on those
darker shades but I would highly suggest
you pick this up this is not a lot of
money and a lot of purpose and function
with this palette so thanks so much for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
it and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
