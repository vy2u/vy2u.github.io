mommy have a baby in her tummy what's
what's the baby in mommies tummies name
all flowers oh that's right
are you excited to see ebro's are you
excited about having a sister you like
babies well judging by our shirts you'd
think we were trying to do some gender
reveal trick we are so excited to meet
our little leaves today as of the day
we're sitting here shooting this we're
at 35 weeks it goes a small to-do lists
there's a lot less to get done this time
because we've sort of got got the
infrastructure in place or yeah just
kind of having a vision for how it's all
gonna go it's a lot less scary this time
it is it is I'm not scared at all I've
heard from a lot of people ever since
actually the first you know info came
out about this pregnancy people had said
oh it'd be cute if you kept the Disney
theme was it like well we didn't Natan
bail because we loved Beauty and the
Beast although that probably is one of
my favorite Disney movies but like that
wasn't where her name came from like
Aurora yeah
we just really liked the name Belle it
did have a little bit of family
significance as well but I mean there
just wasn't the Disney like choice
behind it although there's nothing wrong
with that but this name was another
situation I think where it was just a
sound we like you would pick dad's name
that you really liked and I was just I I
was not as nuts about I didn't hate the
name but I just it wasn't quite it
wasn't be name it wasn't the name in my
mind and then just one day she said what
about Eve boom you just know in the
conversation like I mean I feel like
we're both fairly decisive people numb
but what's that came up it was like a
mutual yes that's totally it and then
Eve Rose just sort of fell together as
oh my gosh that works so well plus we
have vitality Road I think that's kind
of a cool connection that sort of came
up without us even trying we just wanted
to hop on and say thank you guys so much
for all of the support and the kindness
you've given us throughout this
pregnancy it's been so appreciated all
the nice thoughts and prayers and I have
been doing my pregnancy updates over on
the vlog Channel if you want some more
specifics if you want the down-and-dirty
in thought was really good and things
have been pretty calm thus far and we're
just hoping it we could ride that wave
till the end right that's right no
crises no surprises yeah thank you guys
so much for watching and we'll see you
again soon bye what's the baby in your
tummies no the doctor told you that
ebro's is in your tummy who told you
that
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
