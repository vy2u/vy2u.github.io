tuning in at this point in the game I'm
sitting here at 38 weeks pregnant I will
be 39 weeks by this Thursday so just a
few days away from that and yeah we're
just kind of hanging in there waiting
for baby Eve's appearance and one thing
that's very important is to be prepared
with your hospital bag and I thought it
might be fun in this video on this
channel to talk about what I'm taking in
like my hospital toiletry bag you know
basically everything in terms of
personal needs for me that I'll be
taking outside of clothes so in addition
to this bag I'll have a couple of
outfits like kind of comfy outfits
involving leggings
what else do I put in there a robe some
slippers nursing bras outfits that
involve like those handy nursing tank
tops and stuff like that also snacks I
remember taking a lot of snacks last
year and not really enjoying any of them
myself because during labor it was like
you know Tyler had some other people who
were in the room were partaking but as
the person actually giving birth at that
time you don't really get any but I
remembered eating like hospital food and
other stuff didn't really take advantage
of my snacks but I will take some again
and then of course stuff for new babies
such as swaddling blankets simple
outfits going home outfit and then this
time around I'll also have a special bag
for bail so whoever is taking care of
her you know my parents my sister can
have some things on hand for her things
that she can eat wherever she may be
change of clothes some toys and books
stuff like that just sort of a portable
toddler necessity bag but what I thought
those of you who might be tuning in to
this channel might be interested in
would be you know what makeup am I
taking what other you know additional
things are good to have on hand in the
hospital room is makeup an essential
thing to begin with it's certainly not a
must-have requirement however on the way
I look at things like this major life
changes huge things that come in and
alter you know just the way your
day-to-day life is when I can keep as
many things sort of close to
my routine as possible it gives me it
makes me feel more comfortable it makes
me feel more confident and just more
normal and when a new baby comes into
the mix and I remember feeling this so
deeply with Belle it's like you're gonna
be looking for those things that were
the way they used to be still even
though there's a lot of newness and it's
a lot of great newness there's gonna be
parts of you in times where you're just
thinking okay now what things do I know
here because there's a lot of things
there's a lot of unknowns so for me I'm
putting some bang makeup in my bag and
you know maybe I'll use it maybe I won't
I think the only time I actually did use
my makeup when I was in the hospital
with Belle was just to apply a little
bit before we went home because that was
like putting normal clothes on I was
like okay this feels nice I think a
little makeup on do because I was all
clean totally up to you and what makes
you feel comfortable confident with it
in the moment as far as my philosophy on
actually wearing makeup during
childbirth for me that's kind of and if
it happens it happens type of situation
like with Belle the day started like any
other day I got up I got ready I put
makeup on and then that turned out to be
the day that we went to the hospital to
give birth so I happen to have it on
then but you know stuff happens
surprises can happen in the middle of
the night and I'm not gonna see that as
a must-do thing when I'm waking up 2
a.m. and thinking uh it's starting I'm
really hoping I won't have a
middle-of-the-night surprise but you
absolutely never know so anyway into the
bag this is the Sonia Kashuk weekender
bag and I think it is the absolute
hands-down best travel type bag for
personal stuff look I say I'm gonna show
you what's inside and then I'm gonna
talk for another 5 minutes but it has
really been an awesome bag for keeping
so much stuff contained in one it can
hold all my makeup and if I'm traveling
it can hold those extra little toiletry
items as well hair stuff larger bottles
if you've got them I mean whatever it
may be it seems to always be able to
accommodate and I love how many
different compartments there are
removable compartments that are really
handy it's just an awesome bag I've been
using it now for a couple of years and
the temptation will be there and I think
I may have acts
we've done this last time when going to
the hospital it's like you think okay
I'm just gonna take a little bit of
makeup so I'll just put it in a little
bag over here and then I'll just have my
few you know hair related items over
here in this small bag and for some
reason you're thinking all these little
bags mean you know you're not taking
much when really you've spread your
stuff out into a bunch of different
places if you've got to ask somebody to
go find something for you it's like
where the heck is it here everything's
in one just give me the bag and I'll get
it out so I'm going ahead and unzipping
the two large areas where this bag opens
up one of them has like a huge clear
zippered compartment one of them right
here on this side this is brush storage
and then there's a big zipper behind
this where this whole rectangular space
is open then on the other side got a
little note to myself that I need to add
glasses and a toothbrush but on this
side you've got a couple of removable
clear bags so they're just velcroed in
there two zip top bags and then a little
open slot where you can keep some things
now something I like to do with my
travel bag is keep certain things in
there at all times so I'm not even
really thinking about it like a little
thing of Kleenexes you know keep it in
there when you run out replenish it a
thing of wet ones you just never know
when you need a wet one I threw a little
headband in there this time around just
to keep the hair out of my face
and then I'll show you what's in each
one of these I've got a couple of like a
little shampoo and conditioner a little
body wash in there I mean think about
just when you're going to the hospital
you're going on kind of like an
overnight trip for a day or two I've got
a little deodorant in here and I grabbed
a little say to fill moisturizing lotion
maybe for me maybe for Tyler it's just a
super gentle lotion for body or face and
then in this other bag I packed quite a
few of my little equate hydrating daily
face wash cloths because those are just
great for taking off the makeup taking
off the gross nests of whatever on your
face got a hair clip in there because I
just I wear these around all the time
like you see me sitting here and I'm
having kind of a rough hair day to day
it's really staticky and hard to control
but it's like when my videos get done I
take
my hair and I put it up in one of these
I got a little toothpaste in here I'm a
little paranoid about breath so I've got
this Listerine these little pocket packs
from Listerine are so good they take up
no space and they work they're potent
and anybody roll-on scent here this is
from clean and this is the scent called
air and I just love these I love all of
those rollerball scents and that one is
so light and so just clean a few bobby
pins in there did I say that and then
lanolin you want you some lanolin maybe
you need this while you're in the
hospital maybe you need this you know a
couple weeks into nursing a baby but I
had a rough go of it in terms of Nursing
Bell for a good several months you know
she was nursing she was gaining weight
she was latching but I was still having
pain this stuff and you want to use it
generously um this saved me so I brought
I bought a fresh tube of this and I'm
hoping I don't go through the same
struggles this time around and I just
bought this just you know don't even
need it but by the way if you buy this
and you don't end up using it on your
nips you can use it on your lips why do
I feel like the background story about
this bag and just about going to the
hospital in general took way longer than
it's gonna take to tell you what's in
here that big zippered compartment
that's back here behind the brushes this
holds a lot and this also has one of my
little things that always stays in here
it's a smaller bag this one happens to
be fly Sonia Kashuk as well and this is
just again stuff that's always in here
I've got a ponytail holder
I could put a little ponytail in there
right now I've got a little moisturizer
I've got a little eye cream again keep
these things in here keep your sample
sizes just replenish whenever you need
to
I've got primers from Smashbox itty
bitty minis got a little tube of aqua
for got a little like urban decay
setting mist I always keep a pencil
sharpener in here I've got a little
eyeshadow primer I've got some random
little like floss picks and q-tips
little hair clips always good to have it
stays in this bag I don't mess with it
because I know those are going to be the
kinds of things that are
easily forgettable when you're
travelling so it's always in there other
things I've put in this bag are a little
thing is like contact lens solution in a
contacts case a dry shampoo that I just
found that well you know you never know
that might be a good thing to have and
then a little Tresemme hairspray because
this is my go-to so that pretty much
leaves the makeup that I'm taking and it
is minimal by design you know I don't
want to have a lot to put on I know I
may not be in a circumstance that's real
comfortable to apply much makeup so I
just want a few bits and pieces I could
use all of it if I choose I could use
just a couple things here or there I
could perhaps not reach for it at all
but I just feel more comfortable knowing
it's there so I'm gonna try to just take
you through what I've got and if there's
any coordinating brush with it I'll
mention that as well but I've got this
it cosmetics your skin but better CC
cream ultimate multitasker you can slap
it on you've got sunscreen you've got
moisturizer you've got really good
coverage I feel like for my skin it's
very good coverage so I have that in
medium and I'm throwing in a sigma f80
brush to apply that with as far as
concealer just keeping it really minimal
stick concealer is probably the easiest
way to go this is the Alma Age
essentials concealer I believe I have
this in light to medium nice easy smooth
good coverage can work anywhere on my
face I might need it around the nose
around the under eye area and then I've
just got a small this is the p80 brush
so just the downsized version of the F
80 to blend that out if need be those
are also a couple of products that can
be applied very low maintenance
brushless as well you know just blend it
in with your fingers I've got this
little Physicians Formula youthful wear
this is the translucent matte finish
setting powder just super lightweight
just easily sets your makeup in a hurry
and then something that's kind of new to
me because I ordered it during the
Sephora vib sale this is one of the
things that didn't come and so I had to
wait around and like you know tell
customer service hey you missed
something but I got this hourglass
ambient lighting edit surreal light
palette one that has
marbled look on the outside and I am
actually really enjoying this I'm
wearing this today I've been wearing it
quite a bit and you get this all-over
kind of soft setting powder type thing
here's your bronzer two blushes and a
highlight so it's a lot of stuff in one
and I really love the blushes I like
this powder also kind of all over
because it's more of a it's kind of a
satiny finish type of all over set your
face type thing the bronzer is subtle
but really nice probably my least
favorite part of it is the highlight I
guess I was hoping for something just a
little bit brighter than that or a
little lighter but overall I like the
textures of everything I like the way
they come off on my skin I like the big
mirror that this thing has and it just
seems like a no-brainer to have in this
bag and just have something to you know
boom boom boom toss on some color on the
face if I want to and you're good and
brush wise I've just got a couple of
things that can kind of multitask for me
here the elf small tapered brush I
sometimes use that with that Physicians
Formula setting powder and then this is
my Real Techniques blush brush which can
easily do bronzer blush highlight like
absolutely anything I'm taking a brow
pencil this is my NYX micro brow and
brunette and also this tinted brow
mascara this more realistically will
probably be all I use just because it's
it's the quickest thing ever it tints
the brows just a little bit but it
really also holds them in place so
that's very simple this is my eye shadow
that I'm taking it's one of the Mallee
ever colored shadow stick extras and
this is in the shade called bliss any
kind of mid-tone color in this line is
so so workable for all over the lid kind
of smudged up into your crease and it's
like boom done it's all day staying
power gives you a little bit going on
there but it's the most low-maintenance
thing ever you can just blend it in with
your finger or I am taking this Real
Techniques base shadow brush that can
help make it easier sometimes but these
are so so freaking handy this is just a
regular very basic taupe color so I
thought yes that will be fine highly
doubt I'll be applying any eyeliner but
I do have this one from the Estee edit
its bold Bordeaux and it's your
like inner rim brightener type color and
this really deep dark kind of whiny plum
shade and these are like these smoothest
liners ever I can't believe how just
hardly any pressure just applies them so
so easily so I thought that that might
be a nice little multitasker to throw in
I've got a waterproof mascara this is
the Too Faced better than sex waterproof
and I have not actually used this yet
let me know if this mascara has failed
you in some way in terms of waterproof
related needs but you just never know in
the hospital
hormones and going nuts there may be
tears the waterproof might be necessary
also throwing in a lash curler as well
this one's from Sephora all that leaves
is lip products and whether you're
wearing makeup or not a good lip balm is
pretty much always good to have on hand
so I've got my Nivea kiss of olive oil
and lemon any of the Nivea lip balms in
that line I think a really heavy duty
just smooth out the lips so so well in
addition I'm taking these three just
very comfortable easy lip products one
of my Revlon Ultra HD s in HD Vineyard
kind of a berry type color adds a little
life to the face if very little is going
on elsewhere this is my NARS Velvet lip
glide inbound which is one of my
favorite shapes from that line and those
lasts really well and that's just a very
natural looking color and then this is
the Alma smart shea butter kiss in nude
light which just has a little light
peachy shimmer that product lived in my
purse for a long long time and I
recently dug it out so yeah that is the
bag that I will be taking with me to the
hospital when we go to have baby Eve I'm
so excited
I really am feeling just so much
positivity so much love and yeah I just
think everything's gonna go really great
I'm just in a really good place mentally
I'm a lot less freaked out thinking
about childbirth and just the whole
labor experience then I was with Belle
not that I was completely terrified
going into that experience but there was
just a lot more unknown and just having
gone through at once she just realized
like yes
got this I can do this so thank you guys
for your support and I will talk to you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
