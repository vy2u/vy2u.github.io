I'm so excited about this one whenever
I've done like a shot my stache style
video where I want to pull out some
forgotten products I feel like I'm
generally drawn to pulling out things
that maybe I do remember you know from a
while back or like an old old favorite
you know something that maybe has some
significance to me that I remember but I
thought what if we just went with the
things that are like at the back of the
drawer you know like when you saw the
title you might have been like back of
the drawer what's that really mean but
then you think about it for a second and
it's like oh yeah the stuff in the back
of my drawer at home like that's the
stuff that really is questionable like
doesn't get reached for his some have
gotten stored back there maybe forgotten
about I went through my drawers and got
my full face of stuff that I needed for
this video last night and I damn near
had to call it an excavating crew
because I mean it was it was back there
if you got really deep drawers maybe you
could try this challenge and just go for
what's at the bottom of the dirt but for
me the stuff that really doesn't get
touched a lot is way at the back and I
guess what I want to seek to answer in
this video is it really bad or is it
just forgotten and I just have a hunch
that when I'm done with this I'm gonna
want to do this kind of thing a lot more
often because just looking at the stuff
I pulled out I'm like oh wow like a lot
of stuff has gotten ignored in favor of
just the new that's always coming in so
alright who's ready for it let's clip
the hair back
have some coffee first thing I went in
for was a primer and what I ended up
pulling out was the original Smashbox
photo-finish
and come to think of it I really feel
like I haven't used this in a while I do
like this product and I think it's
definitely been kind of a benchmark
product for a lot of different primers
that I have reviewed like different
primers that look like this I feel like
I always come back and reference
Smashbox photo-finish also Smashbox
photo-finish not this particular one but
way back in the early days of my channel
I remember my sister getting a Smashbox
photo finish primer for me for Christmas
when it had first come out I think and
it was really like kind of becoming a
hot item and not a lot of people really
knew about primers in those days yeah
this was way back
when and she had gotten me Smashbox
photo-finish that's so silky smooth
really feels like it evens out skins
texture it's a good product there's no
reason why I haven't used it much other
than I've just had newer stuff to be
trying my foundation that has been in
the back of the class for god knows how
long is this Too Faced Born This Way and
it's in the shade light beige and I
don't really remember the last time I
wore this
I know I've reviewed it and I've talked
about it in the past but like is just
it's floated to the back so we wrap up
somehow it looks liquidy thread it
around this shape does seem to be kind
of appropriate for me right now
I would kind of love it if this turned
into a tag type video I mean I don't
know how many people are storing their
makeup in drawers but I get the sense
that a lot of people probably are and if
it's not a drawer maybe it's a makeup
bag and you're looking in the bottom of
your makeup bag and you're thinking what
do I never reach for its shopping my
stash but to me it kind of felt like it
was on another level because I truly
ended up with some really forgotten
things it kind of takes your personal
decision-making out of it a little bit
and it just forces you to get what the
stuff that's in the back okay what do we
think about the Born This Way it's
definitely like a medium coverage
foundation you'll see a lot of like I
don't know little spots and stuff I'm
still coming through it seems very very
matte I don't dislike it we'll see how
it plays with some of the other products
I put on when it came to concealer I
actually pulled out a couple of
different things I went for something
that was kind of like a corrector type
product on that side of my drawer and
then also a traditional concealer so I
ended up with this thing this was way at
the back this all-around concealer from
Catrice they're giving us like some
pretty rich shades here in terms of
correcting and also just some standard
concealer colors I think I'm going to go
in with a little bit of this peach and
maybe a Sun of the lightest shade too so
it can kind of lighten up into a more
natural peach for me and we'll tackle
some dark circles here
now that orangie shade is not playing
they don't normally go that rich with my
peachy corrector color I'm not sure
really who this is geared towards skin
tone lights because some of the shades
are very very light but then your
corrector shades are extremely rich so I
don't know texture of them seemed pretty
good to work with but the tone was just
very like whoa I'm gonna top this off
with just a traditional concealer I've
pulled out this guy which has not been
used in so long it's from pretty vulgar
and it's the under cover concealer veil
of secrecy a shade is it apparently the
shade name is under the veil of secrecy
as well we're just gonna slap this puppy
on here I just don't really remember my
experience with this product even it's
been used so infrequently
I'm using a flat foundation brush to
spread this out
and I spread it around the under eye
area and then dab and press it in
yeah that's not bad I mean I'm not I'm
not mad at that coverage I can still see
a little bit of a circle coming through
here so I wonder if I can add a touch
more all right what did I pull out for a
loose powder the loose powder that was
way way in the back has been around
since 1935 it's the cody airspun loose
face powder this is the translucent
extra coverage we're gonna have a scent
flash back here because smell on this is
pungent I know some people really like
to bake with this stuff it just it's
been a while for me I got to say I
remember when I was trying this kind of
up against the laura mercier and feeling
like the laura mercier ultimately gave
me the best like longevity throughout
the day the best looking skin for an
extended period of time and I've also
enjoyed my Maybelline fit me but it has
been quite a while since I've used this
I'm gonna use my um this is my Real
Techniques insta pop brush for cheeks
and it can be a good kind of baking
style brush also
none of this is perfect I must say for
me and for like what I would want to
bake this area what girl let that hang
out for a second and we're gonna move on
to the brow product that I pulled out
which is from benefit and it's called
kabrel
it's in number four and this has one of
these nifty little things where the
brush pops out and pops in I know it's
been a while since I've used this but
fortunately the product doesn't seem to
have dried out in the least so a brow
pomade here
the most recent brow pomade that I've
really enjoyed is the one from makeup
revolution but that's not doing too bad
I mean shade wise it seems to be very on
point for me oh by the way how many of
you guys whenever I do eyebrows that's
when it's time to like reflect on
important parts of my life who saw the
idols and healthy the Idol finale on
well it was Sunday and Monday were you
shocked that they were in a relationship
Maddie and Caleb I like started to cry
when they announced that I thought oh my
gosh that's so sweet I followed them
both on Instagram and I thought oh wow
they just like seemed to both be really
good freebies but I didn't know they
were boyfriend and girlfriend so that
was really sweet and I wanted either of
them to win actually that was how I felt
going and I thought they're both just
they seemed very down to earth and very
unassuming I love humbleness and a
person I just like the thought of people
like that people with those kinds of you
know really sweet kind attitudes like I
know them personally but just like I get
from them and I just feel like that's
the kind of example you know I want my
kids to see Maddie she really did like
peak at the right time sort of in the
competition she just steadily it seemed
like got better and better maybe it was
just a certain song she was picking that
made her seem just I don't know so so
good and so comfortable but I'm also sad
that idols done now because I have so
enjoyed this season there was a ton of
talent the way my brow stuff is stored I
didn't really have a lot like super far
back but I I just dug in deep and I also
got this thing for models own it's
called now brow finale brow gel so I'll
just add a little bit of this in here
like when was the last time I used this
stuff maybe in the video where I
featured it it seemed like it deepened
things up ever so slightly and didn't
really add a lot of thickness
necessarily to the brows but just like a
tint okay now I'm going to dust away
some of this powder and we'll see kind
of what we're left with as far as the
look here on the under eye where we
baked I feel like I look super dry and
still seeing circles like it didn't
really help the coverage sometimes
that's what I'm looking for is just for
that powder that I put on top to just
say okay I'll take care of that last
little bit of coverage that you needed
there and I don't feel like this really
did it and it already looks quite your
eye
let's talk bronzer and contour this came
out my whole NYX palette I know this is
this is simply forgotten this is not
like a bad product because I really love
this for a time I think the tones in
here are super workable there's like
some non shimmery highlight shades
there's some with shimmer you got all
these kind of bronzer type contouring
tones I'm gonna use a little bit of this
shade it seems like it was my most used
shade and I'm gonna just sort of work it
in around the hairline oh you didn't
tell me I had that Cody airspun powder
like all over my shirt with this thing I
think it's all about this size of the
palette like this palette is so big
there's just not really a handy and
convenient way to store it and so it's
kind of getting stored at the bottom and
therefore not getting reached for a lot
but it is a good product good quality in
here I remember reviewing the whole
thing and I think in that video I used
it as an eye palette as well yeah I
think I'm only gonna use it for the
bronzer because I have different
highlight to use and guys look at this
blush palette that I drew out Broadway
powder cheek palette kit this is amazing
and it came from the dollar store and it
was quite a while back that I was
but I'm really jazzed up about the fact
that I pulled this out again I'm gonna
use some of this peachy color up here
excuse me look at this this is so pretty
Dollar General baby hmm you know it's a
good blush when I'm starting to apply it
and I just sit there and say mmm that's
the I'm satisfied with this blush noise
love it now we're gonna add a little
rosiness to it we've got our base color
it's liven it up slightly and these are
just matte blushes and then there is a
little highlight in there as well but if
you have broadway products at your local
DG don't overlook this this is really
good this is exciting guys is it not for
highlighter i pulled out a separate
highlight this one this was the one way
at the back it's physician's formula
powder palate mineral glow pearls and
translucent pearl are they still selling
this particular one there's a little
pearl on it just so you know it seems to
be very you know out there very shimmery
let's try it on it's been a while
ooh okay you can play with me more often
yes I'm into this big-time what that
glow on my cheeks I hadn't pulled out a
setting miss last night when I was going
through picking out all my products and
in case you didn't know they all sit
right back here kind of tucked behind my
mirror so the one that was the furthest
back is my Urban Decay chill oh that's a
nice spray or too always feels good I
can't stop looking at that highlight
that looks really nice even pulled out
the shatter of cheddar primer this is
from urban decay and it is the
anti-aging long-lasting eyeshadow base
this is not that old don't be concerned
too much about the age of any of these
products actually because believe it or
not I have you know cleared out old
products from my stash like after my
room got painted and everything I really
did go through some stuff then so it
can't be too old
texture of it feels nice easy to spread
it actually feels a lot like Milani
eyeshadow primer
what about eyeshadow who I there are a
lot of places I could have found it
there's a lot of things I could have
done I decided I'm gonna go for my
bottom most drawer in my set of drawers
that's where some of my least used like
limited edition palettes live and I
thought I'm gonna go to the back of the
drawer and the bottom of the stack and
what I pulled out is this from Urban
Decay it's the Vice limited palette I
cannot recall the last time I would have
used this well let's repeat that it's
got that fun lid that really pops open
shade selection here looking pretty cool
overall I mean there is there's a little
gold little copper floating around but
we've got Purple's blues okay who out
there has this palette and is still
using this palette that's what I want to
know I'm gonna first take this color
called laced right here it seems like a
natural sort of starting point for the
crease the shade kind of looks like the
natural color of my skin in this very
area just deepened up a little bit like
just the natural bit of redness that I
have in this area that's sort of the
tone it's taking on
then I'm gonna pull a little bit of a
freakshow into the crease that's purple
with some shimmer it's not translating
super well off the off the brush and
into the crease maybe it's more of a
packet on shade
well well I've committed at this point
whoa wait what it's like I wasn't
expecting to see anything and then I
loaded on way too much over here oops
got add more to this side now sorry if
this is a little hard to follow y'all I
don't know what to expect
shadow-like kind of way too far out over
here but I'm just going to try to blend
and make the best of it while I'm
working with this brush and just kind of
blending out I'll also choose a
highlighter shade I'll use anonymous
okay then I'm going to take crystal this
really pale blue right here with a flat
brush I'm gonna dab that right in here
inner corner feels really dry like just
to tap my brush into it and then I'm
going to take goddess this blue and work
this in all over the rest of the lid
space
I kind of dig the blue I'm not really
sure what's going on in my crease right
now I'm pulling a little bit of the blue
up to meet the purpley color it's kind
of an interesting tone of blue where
it's not like a true royal blue it's
just a little deeper than that I'm
building it up just slightly here and
then I actually think I'm going to take
a little bit of heat which is up in this
corner hiding out over here get a little
of that and maybe sort of blend it up
around my edge I don't know it's worth a
shot
and I try to work with goddess just a
little bit more and take a smudge brush
and kind of run it a little bit
underneath now when you put it on in
such a concentrated way it looks really
Navy just FYI for all y'all who are
pulling out your vise limited palette
and I'm just kind of lightly smudging
that shade along just pull it along and
then I'll use this road stripe shade and
just dab that right around the inner
corner that's kind of cool sort of a
iridescent little number there yeah when
you swatch it there's like a light lilac
ii pearl to that for eyeliner i pulled
out a liquid that was at the bottom of
my liquid eyeliner section and it's from
makeup forever and it's called graphic
liner vinyl pen liner and it seems to be
a good shape a good format but i don't
even know if i've ever used this so
now's the time time to shine
that was extremely easy it's not overly
juicy and I'm not meaning in a sense
that it's about dried out or anything
but it's like a nice controlled
application but it's plenty black enough
it's not struggling to show up on top of
my eyeshadow
and then as I tend to do I'll find that
dark shade perversion in this palette
bring it just down on to this lower lash
line so it can blend with my liner
and then I will go back with a little
bit more of that blue just to help that
all blend in
that's pretty I like that fusion of the
blue and the black
I want something going on in my lower
inner rim I'm gonna dig down for a
pencil
okay NYX tres Jolie gel pencil liner in
the shade pitch black okay this should
work it's kind of dry it's time for this
one to go bye-bye let's see if it can
get a little bit on here
that's overall probably much drier than
it was originally
now four mascaras there is shocker a
part of my collection and that is just
nicely controlled and maintained and I
know exactly what I have and so I just
kind of went to the back of that I did
pull out this voluminous superstar X
fiber so this is one of those two
parters where I've got the primer and
the mascara and this one I've used once
or twice but I haven't really given it a
good shot I don't feel like side one
first ooh the primer is black it's been
a while since I've used it because that
was a surprise to me
okay well go ahead and let this sit on
this eye and then I'll curl my other
side brush is kind of like an hourglass
shape here and the bristles at least on
this first side are very very short but
it does make it pretty easy to get on
there and this first side just gives a
very like natural effect side number two
though whew
this looks like it has some fibers on it
I can see the itty bitty fibers there
this isn't building up like I feel it
should because this formula seems to be
absolutely rampant and with fibers I
think I'm gonna do that first side down
here on my lower lashes though hopefully
it wears okay throughout the day I
always fear that when I put go putting
mascara down here that I'm a little
unfamiliar with like I can't trust you
yeah trust issues well you guys I didn't
forget about lashes I thought what is
lurking in the back of my lashes and
it's something I've never used before it
is the Urban Decay urban lash and
they're like individual clusters that
have three little knots of lashes I'm
scared
I really don't feel like I know what I'm
doing here there's really short ones and
then at the bottom there's longer ones
I am NOT one who really uses individual
lashes that much if at all like they
scare me a little bit I just feel like
they're a little more tedious and hard
to get them sitting like just the right
way but maybe these clusters will be a
little easier I took one of these
longest pieces and once it gets tacky
I'm gonna lay that down kind of on the
outermost part and then we'll see how
much more I feel like I need to put on
after that that highlight though the
highlight really was working for me the
I walk I'm a little bit like May I don't
know the the blue is just so murky not
that like navy eye looks are bad but I
think I was just expecting a little more
punch out of that particular color the
time has come don't lay this right out
here okay alright nice length
it totally does seem like it's popping
out of the blue because that is the only
thing I have added onto my lash line
there
okay I now have two of those long
bundles on each side and I feel like
they look very like obvious that I've
done that because they're kind of chunky
and I just thought they'd mesh in a
little bit better that you can do Italy
see what's going on here if everybody
could just keep their distance review
little bit they might look normal but oh
man I should have gone shorter working
in or it like made these a little closer
together I don't know it's okay I mean
I'm human but these are just a different
ballgame
okay these individual lash bundles they
were easier to put on and like make
cling to my lash line I felt than just
the individual little single knot lashes
that you might put on sometimes but I
think you kind of have to work harder at
making them blend because they are a
chunk of lash or less I decided I was
gonna go with the lip gloss and I just
pulled out three randomly I pulled out
one from my new drawer my neutrals
drawer and also a like pinky color too I
think I'm gonna go with this kind of
coppery brownish shade this is a read my
lips lip gloss from the balm in the
shade Kabang
now the bomb has just recently come out
with a new line of lip glosses but this
is one of the older ones here do I like
this I like kind of a caramel a deeper
verging on brownish color with like a
blue eye I think looks really fresh but
that's kind of sheer you know it's not
turning out as dark as it looks in the
tube which is fine that's a really
pretty color
I'm a fan it reminds me of one of those
shades that I really liked from that
lineup of new Beckett glosses the rose
gold color looks a lot like that okay
guys so finish look I think my skin
actually looks pretty good I mean when I
look up really really close at my under
eye area I'm kind of like you cringing a
little bit because things are looking
rather dry there but on the whole I feel
like my skin looks pretty nice and even
and the way the blush and the highlight
looks I like that the eye look is just
very so so for me I'm not feeling it so
much the lashes of course I mean that
was that was operator error there I
think those could have been made to look
better
really didn't want to spend all day
putting on little bundles of lashes and
the lip is good I like this lip color
but now I think I'm gonna do kind of an
on-the-spot declutter you know some of
this stuff is gonna stay some of it's
gonna go the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I think this can stay
actually I like the look of it I should
be using it more the tone seems to be
really right for me right now so this
can stay this Catrice all around
concealer kit this can go like these
shades just aren't right and I don't
love the texture enough to hang on to it
for the sake of these skin tone shades
so that's going bye-bye
the pretty vulgar concealer I know this
is not very old and I think I will hang
on to it the airs on powder I feel like
I'll be guilty getting rid of it I'm
just not ready to let that go yet
because I think the times I've been
dissatisfied with it have been the times
I've really full-on baked with it and
maybe in a lighter application if I
played with it a bit more in that way I
would like to look better definitely
keeping the blush definitely keeping the
highlight and these are working into a
more prominent place in my makeup where
I will reach for them more for here
they're getting a promotion you know I
like that stuff oh my Smashbox
photo-finish and this is essentially a
full and rather new thing a photo finish
so I'm keeping that the car brow I
thought did great actually really really
pleased with that shade and that formula
I'm gonna keep that but I think I'll let
this model zone go got enough brow gels
that I do really like I don't really see
the sense in keeping this around I'm
gonna keep my chill I really like that
setting spray uh what do I do about the
NYX palette it's good I've got so many
products to contour with oh I can't I
just can't justify getting rid of that
yeah I'm gonna let the Vice limited
palette go i shadow czar everywhere in
my collection just looking at the color
selection it's not really appealing to
me I'm gonna get rid of this voluminous
superstar
X fiber mascara because that didn't do
enough for me and I'm also gonna let go
of these lashes cuz it's kind of bulky
and I don't really like reaching for
this kind of lash and I'm done saying
like oh maybe I'll want that kind of
lash no so all this stuff I'm gonna be
getting rid of thank you so much for
tuning in for this I hope you enjoyed
it's definitely a new take on shop my
stash
and rediscovered stuff it's like you're
rediscovering as you go and some stuff
works out and some stuff just doesn't so
thank you so much for your time and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
