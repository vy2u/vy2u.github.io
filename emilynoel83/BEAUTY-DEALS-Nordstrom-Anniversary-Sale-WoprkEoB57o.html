sure you're seeing a lot of videos these
days pertaining to the Nordstrom's sale
the anniversary sale and basically
different aspects of the entire store go
on sale the men's department the womens
department homes stuff beauty stuff kids
stuff and I being the makeup addict that
I am was particularly interested in the
different Beauty things that go on sale
and let me tell you this sale is right
up my alley because if there are a
couple of things I love its pallets and
gift sets and if you're gonna give me
those pallets and gift sets not just old
ones but like newly released stuff at
some sort of discount I am so so on it
and I kind of first found out about this
sale I think it was 2013 and it's just
really really good deals deep discounts
on stuff so if you are a Nordstrom
cardholder you get in on the sale a
little earlier so that's what I did we
were in st. Louis already to go to Ikea
I'm like let's swing by the sale and see
what we can find
definitely found some good stuff and
then the sale opens up to everybody on
the 22nd but when I was kind of in their
little beauty area for the early access
of the sale they had you know different
pallets Nordstrom exclusive type pallets
from different high-end brands gift sets
a lot of skincare some jumbo sized
skincare that I don't know it's
available at all times different like
Clarisonic facial devices and tools
fragrances did I say that already so I
picked up what really interested me the
most I definitely had some successes and
there are a couple of things that I went
ahead and ordered online I'll tell you
about that in this video as well but
first thing I want to mention is this
little Bobby Brown Bobbi on trend cheek
kit so it's a little cheek trio palette
and this was just perfect for me because
I've never tried a bobbi brown powder
bronzer or powder blush and so here I
get to try three things in that format
plus it comes with a brush and I've
never tried a bobbi brown brush before
so this is just a great little try me
set and the things that are in here are
the golden light bronzing powder the
belives illuminating bronzing powder
which I have heard that those illuminate
bronzing powders may not technically be
like a bronzer to me this is more like a
highlight and then the pretty pink blush
and this is like a matte very bright
pink blush and I'm wearing all of it on
my skin today I applied it with this
brush this brush I think is perfectly
sized for blush and you know you can
even make it work if you wanted to use a
little bronzer as a contour type thing
you know you can do that the bronzer
shade is matte but it reminds me of so
much is the shade and the Charlotte
Tilbury Bronson glow only this is
slightly warmer but the intensity you
know just to look at you think well
that's a soft light bronzer to swatch it
you kind of think okay it's soft and
light but you put it on the skin and
that's when you really start to see the
impact as you apply it so I think that's
a beautiful really natural looking shade
so so happy with the blush that might be
my favorite part of this palette is this
really fresh pink blush I've sheared it
out of course quite a bit from that
shade but I love the way that looks and
then this illuminating bronzing powder
it might even look or wear on some
people like a really soft blush but
there's a bunch of golden tone in that
so I feel like when it sheers out you do
get this pretty kind of like golden
catch the light highlight a little
mirror in here great for travel so happy
that I got in on that because I think
those are three products that are
available in the regular Bobby Brown
line at all times but I was able to get
it in a special deal another thing that
I had kind of looked at online and I
knew going in that this would be
available as part of the sale and I
really hoped I'd find it and I bid and
it's the lorac refined romance eye and
cheek palette $18 you guys great great
deal on this product checkout the pallet
gorgeous design on here would this be a
great gift for somebody or what it's
going to be the exact same size as your
regular lorac Pro palette but you have
six shadows in here and three cheek
products so shadow wise it's not exactly
the normal layout where the top is all
shimmer and the bottom is all matte
because you have three very shimmery
shades up top and in the middle here on
the bottom is kind of
satin-finish taupe type color and then
these two are mattes so I was looking
through my lorac pro one and the newest
release the lorac pro 3 and because I
just thought at a glance looking at that
palette maybe some of these shades would
be similar but the only two that really
kind of matched up to me were these
shades the gold and this kind of garnet
color they do remind me a little bit of
the golden garnet from the lorac pro one
only not quite as metallic as those
still nice textures and everything and
the textures you would expect from lorac
but just the tiniest bit different in
tone from those shades but to be honest
with you even though I really like those
shades from the lorac Pro one palette
the gold and the garnet I was glad that
I wasn't seeing like 100% dupes out of
this palette whenever I get a new
palette I like to see fresh new shades
so that's pretty much what's happening
here I was playing around with this
palette yesterday and this color right
down here you might think what exactly
is that gonna do because it's maybe not
quite light enough to highlight this is
a really pretty soft crease color kind
of like a soft brown with just a hint of
rose to a very pretty unique color love
this matte I've never seen lorac
actually put out a dark matte burgundy
and so that's a gorgeous shade then over
here you've got all this happening and I
think essentially what you get here are
two highlights one that's very like a
light white shimmery highlight one
that's got a little bit more of a pinky
tone and then a totally matte mauve
blush and so if they're gonna give two
highlights I'm really glad that the
blush was matte so then you can kind of
apply that and then control the amount
of glow you get in your look with a
separate highlight I think this is going
to be a gorgeous palette going into fall
just looking at that gold and the kind
of rusty deep reddish shades that are in
here I think it's gonna make for just an
awesome look and as soon as I laid eyes
on this on the website I thought I hope
I can find that it is an amazing deal
for a high-end you know lorac palette if
you like that formula you're gonna enjoy
this and just watching it using it on my
eyes I was really really happy with it
now on the website I saw I think yet
another version of an Iron Sheik palette
that they had in everything and it
looked a little bit cooler and I did not
see that one in person
in my particular store but I didn't find
this so glad I did third Beauty by that
I came up with was this Mac look in a
box for 3950 they had various
configurations of these four product
sets so not all of them like if mine
contains a fluid line not all of them
were fluid lines not all of them were
you know the same color of shadow it was
just different little mixtures and I'll
admit I didn't take a long time like
poring over everything swatching out all
the samples I just kind of looked at
what was in there and thought what am I
gonna most want to try what am what kit
am I probably gonna like the most
products out of you know so this one
comes with a cream machine formula
lipstick the black track fluid line
mascara and an eye shadow so I thought
okay I'm going with that the lipstick
shade looked gorgeous this was kind of
like the peachy nude unit of the bunch
and so you get it out of the box and
you've got this cute little bag I think
they each have different colored zippers
on them but just a nice little black
cosmetic bag and one reason why I was
especially drawn to get one of these
kits was that everything in it is
full-size and that definitely appeals to
me and makes it a nice deal I am wearing
every part of this kit on my face today
so let's start out with the lipstick
it's got special packaging here the
shade is sun blessed again it's a cream
Sheen formula that's my favorite MAC
lipstick formula has that nice kind of
vanilla ish scent and it's a beautiful
peachy nude color it doesn't have
shimmer in it it's just nice and creamy
feels fabulous on my lips so very very
pleased with that shade another thing
that came in here is the black track
fluid line I know this is like a cult
favorite product I have owned a fluid
line before but it was not this shade
and for as much as I love a good black
liner I'm surprised it wasn't this shade
but I really have fallen in love with
this kind of fallen in love again with
the concept of cream and gel liners I
used it today with my Sigma 11 brush
which is a very very fine tipped brush
but I was able to go out here create a
beautiful wing great intensity
awesome smoothness laying around with
this the last couple days you know the
staying power really locks in on this
product so I was so happy that that was
in here and it's a full size I know
where have I been that product has been
around forever and talked about and
raved
forever the eyeshadow here's the little
disappointment of this kit for me if the
shade is called deception
it's a frost finish I'm not positive if
this is limited-edition or not but as
you can see it's kind of a topi Shea and
you look really closely at it when you
swatch it out you can see almost a teeny
bit of warmth or like golden sheen
coming off of this color it's an
interesting shade it looks like it
should be fantastic but it did not
swatch very well it feels kind of like
oddly dry to the touch and then I didn't
feel like as i swatched it my finger
picked up much color at all just weird
so I used it today to see if on top of a
primer I could get anything more out of
it so this is the only shadow I'm
wearing today I used it all over the lid
I blended it up in the into the crease I
sheared it out past that I buffed it
kind of on the lower lash line and also
smudged out some black liner there but
it definitely applied much better than
it's watched
I mean I'm pleased with this eye look
although it's just not my favorite
shadow to work with I've got to be you
know completely open about that I'm not
so sure this will be anyone's favorite
part of this kit but it's in there and
it applies better than it swatches and I
also wanted to show you I own satin
taupe and that's a very well known shade
for Mac's collection and i swatched it
next to deception the shade in this kit
and satin taupe just softer more full
color a little bit deeper I pick up on
just a hint more plumbing us out of that
shade and then the other part of this
kit is the full-size Mac false lashes
mascara I had never tried this mascara
before I don't think if I did it was
only in a sample size but the shape of
the brush is right up my alley
love the pointed tip it's really dense
with bristles and I would say two coats
is the sweet spot of this mascara one
coat I kind of got started thinking what
you know where's the false lash effect
2nd coat it really built up nice length
and I apply that second coat before the
first coat totally has a chance to dry
so it was a nice effect I got to say I
will definitely continue to use this I
don't find it to be better personally
than covergirl super sizer my opinion
could change after a couple weeks of use
you know how mascaras can be
you know they can get a little bit
different certainly in my opinion not a
bad mascara and if I like this okay love
the lipstick love the fluid line and an
okay shadow I mean I think it's a pretty
good value for that kiss so those are
the three beauties things that I picked
up in the store and then something I was
hoping to find in store that I did not
see was a new version of the Charlotte
Tilbury instant look in a palette but
they have one now for this sale labeled
the Dolce Vita and it looks like it has
some different eyeshadow shades perhaps
some different blush shades and then the
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow highlight and
bronzer and just to show you what an
instant look at a palette looks like
this is the original version and then
I'll have a picture of what I purchased
online I think there's a little more
depth overall just a slightly more
dramatic color palette but I thought I
went back and forth a little bit on
whether or not I should order it and I
thought no let's just jump in and do it
and the other thing I ordered online was
the Elizabeth and James Nirvana black it
was a duo set of a fragrance and I think
a body oil and I had smelled I have a
sample size of the Nirvana white and
then I randomly ran across the Nirvana
black in like a magazine sample and I
thought oh my gosh that scent really
speaks to me like the white was nice but
the black just I thought that was just
the best and when I saw that product at
a discount in this sale I thought I've
got to go after that so those are a
couple things I'm expecting in the mail
I will probably bust those out in a
future video just to show you what they
end up looking like but um picked up
something for bub here this is from
Kiehl's they do have some really big
like jumbo size skincare body care
products and this is the Kiehl's body
fuel all-in-one energizing wash it says
hair and body cleanser for men and he's
had the facial fuel and really liked it
so this is the body fuel and this was
$35 in the sale so I think that's an
amazing deal for 33.8 fluid ounces one
liter
when we have product here people and
then he got some socks and just just
please contain your excitement
know this this is legit gameful just you
know stops he can wear to work with his
suits he seems to have a thing for like
slightly more interesting socks so in
the anniversary sale I think those were
almost half priced seven dollars each so
that's the damage I did at the Nordstrom
anniversary sale really pleased with all
three of those makeup kits that I showed
you in this video although I would say
maybe perhaps I am most excited about
this lorac palette that I scored the
refined romance palette and also you
know this little Bobbi Brown face kit
with the brush I thought that was an
amazing deal too like the matte kit as
well but like I said you know a little
bit bummed that the eyeshadow wasn't
better but thank you guys so much for
watching if you've already shopped the
sale like I have let me know what you've
picked up or what you're thinking about
getting and I will talk to you again
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
