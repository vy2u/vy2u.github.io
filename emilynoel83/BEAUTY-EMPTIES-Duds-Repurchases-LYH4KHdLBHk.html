about some empties this video is long
overdue because I've got a lot of
different products that I've run out of
recently well some recently some over
like the entire past season so I'm just
going to go through these things with
you mention you know if there's anything
particularly notable about these
products would I repurchase them how
well did I end up liking them so first
couple things that are just sitting here
on top are a couple of containers of
lashes what I've been wearing a lot
lately these so on perfect six 15s and I
actually did repurchase these they are
the lashes that look like this they're
very symmetrical their longest in the
center and then shorter on the outsides
and then another pack that I went
through and this was mainly because I
did some wedding makeup so maybe one of
these pairs was used on me but the rest
were other people and they are the kiss
number 11s and those are pretty much
exactly like the salon perfect demi
wispies I've been wearing those a lot
lately too in fact that's what I have on
right now today and that's that style
that's a little more flared out at the
end so I guess both of these are things
that I went ahead and bought again I
think multi packs are a great value as
far as false lashes go so Walmart tends
to sell a lot of those along with that
I've got some lash glues here yes they
get very like gunky around the top
especially this one this got really
messy but the Revlon precision lash glue
I'm not sure why this one has a white
top they're the same formula and I love
this so much it was a total like
complete oversight on my part when this
did not get included in my Revlon top 5
bottom 5 because this product is like my
right arm of makeup I love this kind of
glue so much sometimes I don't even
really think of it I guess as a makeup
product it's just like a daily tool that
I use and in case you're not familiar
these have a wand applicator and like a
little brush tip so I think that makes
it really easy to get just the right
amount of glue along your lash band you
never feel like it's overloaded and it
dries nice and quick I think so that is
a total total must-have for me got a few
things I'm going to breeze through here
quickly the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towel
in the night calming version really the
bulk of why these got used is because I
was removing swatches from my hands and
I just I don't tend to use these
pre-moistened towelettes a whole lot to
actually remove my full face of makeup I
test them from time to time I sometimes
take them if I'm traveling somewhere but
honestly it's just not my favorite way
to remove makeup something that you
won't see in this empties video because
I just didn't save the boxes they're
kind of bulky but something I definitely
have gone through multiple times over
are the equate daily facial cleansing
cloths those are great they're dry
they're kind of like folded up and you
add water to them they suds up and
they're great about removing absolutely
every part of my makeup but you know I
still try these wipes from time to time
these are the CeraVe makeup removing
cleansing cloths ultra gentle these
might have been some of my favorites
they're very soft and very gentle on the
skin and I did end up using the rest of
these to remove swatches from my hand
which sometimes the skin on my hand can
become sensitive with certain wipes that
I remove stuff was not that I would
advise you know paying for a pouch of
face wipes just to remove your hand
swatches like baby wipes can do that job
too but if you kind of gotten past the
point where you're going to actually use
them on your face they work well for
that they're very gentle it says
accepted by the National eczema
Association and I sometimes have some
eczema on my hands at different times so
that's nice to know
some face wash cloths that I absolutely
hated and I really didn't enjoy using
these to remove swatches either the
Burt's Bees peach and willow bark
exfoliating facial cleansing towelettes
these are very very strongly scented and
there was kind of a sting with these it
says gently exfoliate cleanse and tone
in one easy step so I believe there was
some kind of texture to want at least
one side of the wire and it was just not
a pleasant experience it was a little
over-the-top scent wise like I said and
then who wants to feel a sting and that
takes me right into my face masks here
I've saved some of these I didn't get
all of my little pouches saved but a
couple of these from miss spa these are
two dollar masks available at Walmart I
tried the brighten one
and also I've used several of the
hydrate ones the Brighton one didn't
really do so much for me it did give me
a little sensitivity I felt a little
Steines on my skin using this one the
hydrate kind though is probably my
favorite affordable sheet mask out there
I mean the skin feels incredibly soft
after you use these they are paraben
free fragrance free free of artificial
dye and I leave it on for like 20
minutes and then take it off and just
kind of rub the serum in that's left
over and this is as good as most any
like high-end face mask without use so I
love those two bucks can't beat it
there's one I spent $5.99 on at t.j.maxx
and it's a dr. jart all that lift and
firm so this went although if I could
stop about sneezing and burping this is
called a hydrogel expansion stretch mask
and it actually does hook back behind
the ears instead of being one of those
like super wet masks it was like it had
a thick layer of this sort of solid gel
like it wasn't transferring any goo
penis to your skin it's not like putting
a gel insole all over your face that's
what I would liken this to and you hook
it behind your ears and it does feel
kind of tight but I took it off and I
was so underwhelmed I didn't think my
skin felt smoother or came away with any
typical like sheet mask effects for this
and it does say it's good for wrinkles
loss of elasticity large pores and
sagging really did fit the face well but
it was just I don't know I am $5.99 for
a mask that I don't feel like gives me
any really positive effects afterwards
maybe for different skin types or skin
issues it might have worked better I got
one of the elf hydrating water sheet
masks I know I talked about this in a
video but it reminded me very much of
the mists spa hydrate masks so this was
good I enjoyed it but it's just like a
buck
maybe yeah just a dollar I think more
expensive than this so I would still go
with this went through a little
container here of Bioderma this was from
my friend Norma and I enjoyed this very
much I kind of moved into my Garnier
bottle that has the pink cap on it love
that micellar water also I sometimes you
the micellar water at the end of the day
that has the waterproof version so that
really takes away eye makeup well I'll
sometimes use that waterproof micellar
water alongside the it cosmetics bye bye
makeup like cream that's a really good
hydrating way to remove your makeup but
a lot of times if I'm just hopping in
the shower I'll grab one of those face
washcloths like I mentioned and just get
it all off finished up this NARS skin
total replenishing eye cream I've used
this every single day for months now and
it's just like a tiny bit left there in
the jar and this is a solid eye cream
I'm not going to repurchase it though I
mean it's hydrating it's got a good
texture it doesn't ever feel like it
becomes too much on my under eye area or
interferes with makeup like I can go
ahead and apply makeup right on top of
it I don't necessarily feel like it's
doing anything for me that even a lower
cost just nicely moisturizing eye cream
could do for example I like my CeraVe
eye cream in a little tube I'll probably
continue using that as opposed to buying
more of this every so often I get some
of these Almay oil-free gentle eye
makeup remover pads and I'll just use
them sometimes if I have a little
residue on my eyes that is surface
before I start doing my makeup for the
day but anymore I haven't bought these
in quite a long time because I just end
up using that micellar water from
Garnier even just the pink kind go over
my eye area there's no sensitivity with
that but I don't think I'll be seeking
these out again any time soon oh I found
another brow blue this is the duo
version of the brush on brow glue didn't
really love the consistency of this as
well as the Revlon but I did go ahead
and use it up anyway oh we got a couple
skinny brow pencils here I used up an
entire color pop brow pencil in the
shade dope taupe yeah you could probably
see people with a lot lighter hair than
me using this kind of product or this
tone of product because it was very cool
I don't know if there's even enough yeah
there is enough for me to get a little
swatch going here it's like a very
neutral but kind of light cool tone brow
pencil and it has a little spoolie on
the other end and
it was just nice for filling in those
few sparse areas and yet I didn't feel
like I added a look of a ton of
thickness to my brow you know it's kind
of a fine line for those of us who have
a really dark fairly thick brows to
begin with but it's just a few areas
that you need to work with something
like that can be nice I also completely
went through a brow stylist definer in
brunette from L'Oreal and I really like
this but I was surprised at how quickly
I used it up this was a great tone for
me it's a little darker as you can see
than the one beside it but very cool
toned and certainly reminds me a lot
both of these of the NYX micro brow the
Anastasia brow Wiz it's just kind of a
matter of you know what brand you like
to buy from what brand sells your proper
tone I know these brow definers from
L'Oreal only come in like a few colors
so you might be a bit more limited there
but these skinny brow pencils you can go
through those pretty quickly and I've
still got like some different kinds of
brow products that I've been testing and
going through lately so I'm not going to
be in a rush to repurchase either of
those that I did especially like the
Loreal brow stylist definer couple of
brow gels that I used others this elf
wet gloss lash and brow
clear mascara that works Milani has this
brow shaping clear gel that was fine as
well I would say my favorite clear brow
gel and the one that I have repurchased
is the NYX control-freak the reason why
that one does edge itself out over
others is because you pull the brush out
and there's like no excess so you never
feel like the brow get scooped up on
which sometimes that would happen with
these and it truly does hold really well
if you've got maybe very wiry hair in
your brows that might be a good one to
check out because some of these others
like they can certainly do the job for
me but the NYX control freak is the best
Oh another set of lashes my Samantha
number Seven's I got these for Christmas
last year and they lasted me so long
these finally bit the dust at some point
I think in the summer and I had used
them so often and I did repurchase
another pair and that pair is kind of
been in my rotation here lately it's a
great style of lash it's very thick the
band is very durable it's like a twenty
dollar set of lat
and I don't normally buy lashes that
expensive but if you take care of them
you can get a lot of uses out of them
and I just loved how fluttery these were
they give you the appearance of having a
very thick lash line are not overly long
but they're just kind of fluttery and
wispy at the ends so they have sort of a
natural effect but still glam I have
used up a super sizer mascara from
covergirl I also went through a super
sizer fibers I did have a full review on
these and kind of compare them
ultimately I feel like both get your
lashes to the same point
they're both lengthening they add volume
they're good about holding a curl on my
lashes this one sometimes builds up a
little bit faster the fibers but I don't
really feel like I like that much better
than the regular super sizer you just
get comfortable with a certain mascara
you start loving the way it works for
you and that's Eric and of becomes part
of you but I've got news for you there's
another mascara on the market I think
I'm going to devote a whole video to
this I know this is a total tease here
but there's another mascara that is kind
of starting to steal my heart a little
bit from the super sizer could I be any
more dramatic on this topic my goodness
I used up an entire clump crusher water
resistant gone through many of these
have repurchased them just like the
supersizers - love using this on my
lower lashes i use it on my lower lashes
most of the time although i've recently
realized that super sizer does work fine
on the lower lashes as well so i
probably won't be using quite as much
quant pressure in that area and this elf
lengthening defining mascara i think i
got one of these and it seemed to be dry
like right out of the gate so this
didn't take a lot of uses to make me
feel like oh that's a bit the dust and
then I had a little sample here of the
Tarte lights camera lashes love that
mascara haven't really needed to
repurchase it because I do have quite a
few backups in my collection of that
product the label is entirely worn off
but this is my Jordana color Envy liquid
liner in black and V I have repurchased
this I bought I think for the last time
I placed an order on the Jordana website
I mean it is just one of those things I
know I'm going to continue running out
of I know I'm going to need more of its
the best like long wearing truly matte
a liquid liner and your tip is just a
little like brush tip by the way very
finely tipped a few primers I finished
off my Garnier five-second blur oops
this is a really great product the
consistency is so so similar to the
Mallee perfect prep poreless primer it
even has a slightly pink tint to it and
that just makes me think of that product
too but the texture is totally on par
with that as well I really do feel like
this has an effect on your pores it's
not the type of primer you would
absolutely need to wear like all over
your face but even just around the nose
sides of the nose wherever your pore
problem areas are or fine line problem
areas this is such a good primer I would
kind of liken it to the effects that you
get from the benefit Porefessional only
it doesn't feel quite as drying on the
skin when I apply it so that's a great
product there I also went through this
little Mac prep and prime sample I love
this primer I hadn't used it in any
other format beyond just the sample that
came with an order not too long ago and
it's very creamy it's smooth but it's
not like silicone II slippery compared
to like a Smashbox photo-finish let's
say but I really like how even that
makes my skin feel and I like that both
of these don't make my skin feel too dry
I like primers that smooth me out even
out the texture of my skin but don't um
kind of zap the moisture away I don't
like primers that make me - matte before
applying a foundation and then I've got
a little Urban Decay primer potion just
as good as Milani eyeshadow primer so no
I'm not repurchasing that this one I may
repurchase the gagne but it's going to
be a ways down the road if I do that
because I've got so many other primers
that I need to be using up oh my heart
candy sheer envy hydrating primer mist
completely gone absolutely love this
stuff this is my favorite setting spray
I feel like I get instant radiance when
I just do three mists after my makeup
says 12 hour power
electrolytes energize and hydrate the
skin oil free silicone free alcohol free
it is a great setting mist or just skin
refreshing type mist if you want one
that you can put on
and feel like yes my skin just looks
quite a bit more radiant afterwards
there's so many setting sprays that I
put on and I feel like him you know if
the effect is questionable
but this really does a good job it takes
away a powdery finish and just leaves me
with a more natural finish so I'm
absolutely repurchasing that that's
available at Walmart and I went through
an Estee Lauder Double Wear this is in
the shade 2n2 fresco it just you know
there might be a little bit left in
there but I really am having trouble
getting it out and it's kind of old
anyway and I do have the backup of that
except I have it in tawny now that would
be my Double Wear shade is tawny and
that is all of my empties a lot of like
actual makeup related empties in this
one I've certainly thrown away some
different body and shampoo hair type
stuff that I've used up along the way
but I've really tried to make a point to
hold on to makeup stuff that I've used
up and I did an okay job of holding on
to some of these mask packs but I'm
gonna be even better about that in the
future more conscious of it thank you so
much for watching I'm gonna clean up my
mess
maybe here and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
