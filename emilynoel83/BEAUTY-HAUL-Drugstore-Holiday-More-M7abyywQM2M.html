sitting here surrounded by a bunch of
new stuff that's really been the story
of my life lately with all of these
holiday collections so there are some
things you haven't seen videos on yet on
my channel let's say two-faced holiday
stuff Smashbox holiday stuff I'm right
on the verge of doing and posting those
videos so in this video it's really just
kind of a random hull of some just
individual products a lot of it
drugstore here and there then like a
little preview of some holiday things
that I just got in that I'm going to
definitely be working with over the next
couple weeks that being said Cheers
I need a drink you talk first about just
some random little things that I got
from Ulta one thing is this essence pure
nude highlighter and this says ten it's
number ten be my highlight and I'm
pretty sure this is the one it's so many
of you recommended to me on my
highlights that don't look like
highlights video and you're like oh my
god you've got to try this one from
essence and so I got it and I've been
using it and holy cow what a great
recommendation all of y'all who told me
you got to go get this this is so
gorgeous and it's so like invisible you
know what I mean it looks very beige
here it looks practically like a skin
tone powder with a little bit of Sheen
and the sheen is very subtle I mean
you're not seeing chunkiness in any
possible way but see how there is some
shine so once you share this out on your
cheeks I mean I feel like it just
totally camouflages itself on top of any
blush it's like you see just the sheen
but not a bunch of underlying color you
will never get like a visible streak of
this highlight on your skin it's so so
good and if I could go back and like add
a little edit to the end of that
highlight video I would totally include
this because this is really just exactly
what that product is it's a highlight
that doesn't really look like a
highlight it looks like fresh glowing
skin really hard to screw this one up
guys so yay and plus it's from essence
so it's super cheap couple of these
items are kind of like a my viewers made
me buy a type situation but the lash
princess mascaras have been wreck
to me and they actually have a 2-pack
for like seven bucks so it says best
sellers 20% off
there's the lash princess mascara and
the lash princess false lash mascara so
I haven't used this one yet it says day
look but I have used the night look one
first off adorable packaging and I love
that this is kind of rubberized at the
top and that might seem like a small
detail but holy cow do you feel like you
really are gripping something there and
then it's a nice kind of smallish very
tapered brush traditional bristles here
I really like the way this one applied
so far so I'm excited to try the other
as well but just in case you guys were
curious about those as well it does come
in a 2-pack and I was going to really
hold off and use up a lot of other
mascaras before I busted into these but
I think I'm just gonna hold off on this
other side and just try to go through
this one first that's what I'm going to
try to do Physicians Formula I got a
couple things that just randomly stood
out to me from this line one of them is
the youthful wear translucent matte
finish powder and I've kind of been
wearing this in place of where I might
use a fuller coverage powder all over my
skin to set foundation the thing I like
about it is that it definitely is
mattifying but it doesn't have that sort
of dry matte effect on the skin now I
assume much like any matte powder you
could over apply it and totally you know
see the product on your skin but it does
feel rather smooth it seems to do well
in terms of count locking in the
foundation and giving me pretty good
staying power throughout the day it's
kind of thing where yes I like it I'm
gonna have to put it into use a little
bit more to see if it kind of rises
above some other powders that I really
like but I just wanted to mention that
and then here's a product I truly do not
get it's the touch of glow stick from
the nude wear line it's adorable okay
it's got like its own little rose gold
bow tie on there jumbo stick and these
are all the things that it says on the
outside concealer foundation highlighter
touch-up tool what like is it really
gonna be all those things for me all of
those claims actually noticing that on
this product I thought okay let's try it
so it does kind of look like a
foundation
stick and I wore down part of the stick
there trying to wear it one day as
foundation all over my skin it was not
enough coverage the texture of the stick
is super smooth and it does have a
little bit of a sheen to it the tone
probably wouldn't work for me as a
concealer it's just called nude glow and
it wasn't like there was a whole big
lineup that I saw in my store of
different shades so it's just this
creamy stick with a little luminosity
not much coverage it's like it doesn't
go full on highlight it also doesn't go
full on coverage like foundation
concealer stick for me either but I
would love to know if anybody has had
success with this how do you like to use
it like what function does it actually
serve for you because it sure is really
cute I mean I can't take anything away
from that right now I'm not feeling like
it does any of the claims really well
like it needs to specialize a little bit
more you know what I'm saying there's
another thing I'm trying out from Ulta
it is from the boots number 7 line and
it's the shimmer palette in bronze so
it's got this very bronzy looking
packaging and it's got that shimmer
strip design that you might know about
from Bobby Brown or other products from
Physicians Formula and this is rather
deep I was kind of expecting to get it
and see it as more of a highlight but
even the lightest shade up top while
it's got a lot of gorgeous shine there
is some depth to it as well when it's
not hitting the light full-on on the
some of the brightness goes away and it
looks a little bit dark this might be a
really flattering highlight on deeper
skin tones because you start swirling
into the other shades and there's a
considerable amount more depth and kind
of like this borderline coppery tone
that it takes on it's super pigmented a
little bit goes a long way and I just
don't feel like this is my favorite
thing to use on my skin tone as
pinpointed like highlight right on top
of the cheeks if I use it I just kind of
dust it everywhere because I know it's
gonna give me a little bit of a bronzed
look and it is the shimmer palette in
bronze so I guess you do have fair
warning with the title there another
thing that I have hold and have been
meaning to talk about for a while and
I'm like why are people not talking
about this maybe they are and I've just
been missing it left and right
but the Anastasi of Beverly Hills creamy
concealer holy cow this stuff is so good
there aren't a lot of concealers in this
pot form that I feel like are just as
creamy if not even creamier than benefit
erase paste and this is like that this
is the erase paste formula in a fully
like skin tone range of shades so I've
got it in 2.5 I've been wearing it a lot
as under-eye concealer it definitely for
me needs to be set because it is a very
dewy like I mean you can just kind of
see the shine that it picks up as you
look at it in the pot there
it's dewy it's got a lot of moisture to
it but it can really effectively be
worked into the skin either with your
fingers or a Beauty Blender sponge I've
loved using this with my mini sponges or
even a larger one and it looks so
natural and it doesn't make my under
eyes look super dry so if you've been
thinking gosh I like the formula of
every race pace but I'd like to try it
in a skin tone thing that could work
really well all over the skin this is so
nice I think this would be a good dry
skin concealer option I have it in the
shade 2.5 right now it's working as I
lose a little bit of color in my skin as
we get deeper into fall and winter I may
need to pick up a lighter shade in this
but I think the formula is awesome only
thing it's a little off-putting to me
is the snap makes me think of crayons a
little bit but I really only noticed
that when I open the product up and I
don't notice that at all when it's on my
skin couple of other Ulta things I found
these in store little mask packets here
one is the mint chocolate chip crushed
cocoa mask I'm gonna have to try not to
just eat this it says refreshing and
tingly moisturizing treat and look at
this girl come on the things they think
to put on the front of some of these
mats are just absolutely ridiculous
but hey it was enough to draw me in I
think this is just a couple bucks and
I'm totally gonna use that I will
probably be snapchatting my experience
there and then they've got like body
moisturizers in these packets as well
and this is the goji berry body smoothie
this is the claim possibly the best body
moisturizer your skin will ever
so got to try that see if that's true
the brush bath permit cosmetics I just
got the small size of this it says
purifying brush cleaner instant quick
drying skin loving I thought this would
be a good one to compare to my ELF
little brush cleaner spray and see if
you know I think it's necessary to pay
the extra for it cosmetics have not used
that one yet so still some testing in
order there now as I said still totally
on the holiday review train and some
things like just came in that I thought
hey I'll mention those in my haul as
well one of them is my metal matte
palette
isn't that cool how it says it both ways
that's so neat this is huge this is a
big palette let me get something here's
a lorac pro 3 dang this is big way
bigger than I expected the Kat Von D big
holiday palette and yeah lots of
questions about this this is what it
looks like it's got some metallic shades
across the top and the little circular
pans well they're not tiny let me tell
you that they're about nickel-sized I'd
say if not maybe a little bigger and
then you've got these rectangular pants
that are also generously sized of your
matte shadows so a very clear split you
know exactly what you're getting when
you glance at it and I am wearing that
today I went for a gold and maroon thing
happening here I was totally inspired by
like this set up of Shadows here on the
end so I've got this on my lid I have a
lot of this underneath my eye a lot of
that in the outer corner some of this
shade in the crease as well and a little
bit of this peachy shade kind of helping
me blend some things out too but really
happy with the look crazy pigmented
colors one initial reaction that I have
is I glanced at it that I'm kind of
excited about is that the shades that
might not be my first like impulse to
pick up and use on my eyes like the
blues and the greens I kind of
appreciate how they're a little bit
deeper whether they're the metallic ones
or the mattes they're not like bright
bright electric blue you know it's like
a true royal blue a deeper kind of
forest green so I think those
are gonna show nicely in terms of color
intensity on the eyes but they're not
gonna be like they're a little more
approachable do you know what I mean for
being just a little bit deeper there and
then from about here over it's like
totally not a concern like this is my
comfort zone over here on this side of
the palette so I'm very excited to put
this to work a little bit more before I
review it and test out some different
color combos and stuff but a really fun
palette and I just I couldn't turn it
down I didn't have to even really think
twice because I have loved so much the
quality of any Kat Von D eyeshadow
product that I've ever owned really
another palette that really has only had
one go around for me in terms of being
worn on the eyes so far but I will be
trying it more in reviewing it soon is
the anastasia beverly hills master
palette by mario mario ded ivanovitch he
is the well-known makeup artist of kim
kardashian and others as well other
celebrities but this is the palette he
designed and so I had to get that I've
had really great experiences with some
of the Anastacio palettes they tend to
be a little lower cost it seems than
other high-end eyeshadow palettes but
all the quality tends to be there and
this has a great double ended brush it's
a very at um '''l earthy type of vibe
with these shades and I was really
pleased so far with the first look I did
and the swatches but full review to come
on that I got the Sephora favorites give
me some bold lip kit this has a tardis
lip paint in it laura mercier lipstick a
Sephora collection lip product ciatÃ© is
that how you say that and like liquid
lip velvet product a Kat Von D liquid
lipstick and also a bite lip product
here I believe the shade in that is
aubergine that may have been the only
one I owned one thing that keeps me from
getting certain Sephora samplers is like
if I feel like I've already got two or
three of the things already it may not
be worth it for me to buy but it comes
with little box like that there's like
some little crinkly filler in there and
I will certainly be trying those on for
you and reviewing it in a future video
$28 for that set by the way and then
from bite just when I thought like Oh
bites just gonna put out that one little
tin
amuse-bouche lipsticks that I already
reviewed on my channel they have a
discovery set so this is kind of
interesting in here they give you a lip
primer and a lip mask which are deluxe
sizes so a little bit smaller than
full-size and then it is full size on
the amuse bouche lipstick in beetroot
and also the matte cream lip crayon in
Lecce and so I just thought that's a fun
little way to try out some things I
haven't used before didn't have either
of those lip color shades I have tried
the agave lip mask and have enjoyed it
so I wouldn't mind having more and I
haven't tried the primer either so this
is a lot of cool things to sample in one
from my perspective as a bite enthusiast
and lastly I've got a couple of body
fragrance type things I'm thinking I
will do some kind of holiday video
probably devoted to any skin care body
fragrance like miscellaneous type sets
one thing that really just appealed to
me on ulties website that's where both
of these things are from the clean
rollerball layering collection I've
tried a couple of samples from clean I
think it was their warm cotton fragrance
and really really liked it so this
they're giving you clean skin air
rainblossom and warm cotton all together
and I was having so much fun smelling
these the other day I wore skin and oh
my gosh something about that scent is
kind of comforting and just like coming
from within a nice natural aroma type of
scent I really like that but then I was
testing all the others unlike me and
Tyler who are deciding Oh which ones do
we like I'm honestly not sure that
there's a single one of these that I
would dislike and they say for a
layering tip air acts as the ultimate
unifier combined this fragrance with any
of the sense to bring an extra element
of sheer floral brightness and sparkle
so I am so excited to get some use out
of those and then I like to get at least
one philosophy set every holiday season
and this one just had the sense in it
that I thought yes as soon as I laid
eyes on this set I knew this was the one
$27 some really good sizes here of the
products you're getting six fluid ounces
of HMS gonna drop
here on my shoulder it's danced at the
dew drop fairy
hot cocoa flamenco and candy cane candy
cane I have had experience with before
it is one of the most potent minty
cleansers ever like it truly will take
your sinuses and just go like I can
breathe again I need to be using that
right now the hot cocoa smells awesome
the stance of the dewdrop fairy I'm not
even sure like how to explain that one
do they have a description of that I've
only smelled that one just out of the
bottle so I need to actually use these
and maybe it will give me a little bit
more like I don't know
meat and potatoes to help me describe it
but these are the three-in-one shampoo
shower gel and bubble bath products here
so I have had so many good experiences
with different ones and the holiday sets
are always a nice time to stock up so
that is my whole you guys again reviews
to come on so many of these products as
well as some things you haven't seen me
talk about yet on my channel that are
kind of right around the corner so thank
you so much for watching and I will talk
to you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
