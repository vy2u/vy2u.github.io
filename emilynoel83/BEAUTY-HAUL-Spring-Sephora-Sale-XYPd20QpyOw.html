in this video I'm going to be talking
about the things that I picked up in the
Sephora vib Rouge or vib sale and I got
to tell you it's really random if we go
along with stuff I ended up picking out
in this sale is just kind of all over
the place so let's jump in the first
thing I got was tape yes
I got tape from Sephora it says line up
makeup tape it says this high-quality
medical grade tape has multiple uses for
makeup application perfecting winged eye
looks creating precise nail art
protecting against makeup fallout so you
just tear it off remove the paper
backing and then it says the tape can be
repositioned up to two times I would say
even more than that like I was really
adjusting it when I put it on I did my
eye look with tape today I put the tape
on and then I did feel very free I got
to say with my blending you know when
you do this technique you can just kind
of blend right over the edge of your
tape and assuming you lined up your tape
properly everything ends up nice and
symmetrical and it had been so long
since I had utilized tape in that way
you know and I might do it some more but
I got to tell you I don't love how this
is just a loose roll of tape like this
and it can so easily come off the Roll
and then when you're done you end up you
know trying to put it back again and
you're trying to peel the tape off from
the backing and honestly I feel like
scotch tape would be so much easier like
I have used scotch tape in the past and
it's already on the roll you just take
it off it's cheap as heck I mean this
did stay stuck down really well and it
removed nicely too I didn't feel like it
pulled at the skin super hard or
anything but I just I feel like I would
have the same experience with just
regular old tape off of the rolls I'm
not sure what I was looking for with
this was I wanting it to be something
way above and beyond different I don't
know what I thought I was going to get
out of this but really I think you could
save yourself the money from Sephora and
just get regular tape but the eye look
really it felt so strange doing my eye
makeup first and then you know anytime
you're using tape you're going to undo
your eye makeup first you're not peeling
off found a
right so I did the eyes then I did the
face and I don't know do you guys like
it like a lot better than the way it
usually turns out I mean if you're
wanting a really winged out and you know
this kind of effect with your eye look
it did make my shadow application a lot
quicker but as I said I think tape could
do that for you as well I also got a new
sponge I got the Sephora cake and baked
liquid and powder makeup sponge and it
says Vera Mona on top they do tell you
to wet this sponge and squeeze out the
excess and it says pick up liquid or
powder makeup products with the top or
bottom flat edge and apply to conceal
and/or bake since I use this today
you're looking at the sponge it's full
of size right now and it's really really
soft it feels you know how a real
techniques sponge feels different from a
regular Beauty Blender this feels more
like the texture of a Real Techniques
like orange sponge so it is SuperDuper
soft and it's got these angles and edges
to work with and I got to say I see no
flaws in the edges at all like there's a
tart sponge that I have and they really
tried to put this sharp edge you know on
the wedge shape of their sponge and I
felt like when I looked at it closely I
could see little bits of I don't know if
you call it fraying but it just wasn't a
totally clean edge and somehow here I
don't know if they've sealed these edges
in some way but it is absolutely perfect
on every side so that leads me to
believe hopefully this will end up being
a pretty durable sponge and it won't
just start chipping away at itself you
know that I did use this to blend out my
concealer I use shape tape today and
then I went over it with this side and I
didn't love that well it was okay like
on the flat plains of my face getting
the concealer blended out it was really
pretty hard to get this around my inner
corner even though you do have edges you
know it just wasn't quite enough to make
me feel like I was getting a blend and
instead I felt like maybe I was pulling
away more product than I was actually
blending in
however for baking I thought this worked
really well I used the other side just
like dip into powder and you can get it
so nicely like right here on the side of
your nose
and you know close enough there on the
under eye area and considering I had
this big winged thing going here I was
really controlling the powder by getting
it right out to the edge without going
over so I do think I'm really going to
enjoy this for baking I love the way it
lays down the powder and it laid down
more at one time I think just the flat
edge of the sponge it put down more
product I wasn't going back again again
over and over but some people might like
this you know to blend out concealer or
heck even foundation for that matter me
I do think powder is its strength and
I'm glad I got that I got a new lip balm
this is the Smith's tropical ambrosia
balm with coconut and mango rosebud
perfume company is who makes these bombs
and like they make the actual rose scent
which I love I think they originally
produce those in little tins and since
that time they started putting them in
these squeezy tubes and when I saw that
they have this tropical one I thought I
need to get that because I really do
like the consistency of these bulbs and
they're really moisturizing it ends up
being just kind of a clear balm as you
can see there I would describe the
consistency at slightly thicker than
Vaseline and the scent on this oh it's
so good oh it's just juicy and delicious
and it makes me think of like a pina
colada
mixed with I don't know like a starburst
or something perfect blend of like
coconut e suntan lotion scent and fruity
so if you're looking for a little treat
use wasn't super pricey or anything and
isn't the packaging so cute as well I
just love that alright for the first
time in a long time I have self tend yes
I'm self tanned in this video only one
application so hopefully you know it's
not probably looking too heavy but I
decided to try out the Josie Maran Argan
liquid gold self tanning oil
and this says hydrating natural glow and
there were a lot of cents available for
this one and I got two he SH in vanilla
I just thought you know if anything
vanilla is probably going to smell good
right this comes with a mitt which I
have the mitt downstairs and there is a
picture of it right here instead of
being like one of those
just foam mitts if you've had the San
Tropez self-tanner you know it's like a
foamy mitt and I like that well enough I
really think mitts are the way to go in
terms of sunless tanner application
because it gives you like the widest
path to go across your skin with it I
just think the outcome the evenness
always turns out better with a mitt but
this one is more like I'm going to
safely see on the outside but it's
different it's a little more luxurious
feeling than just one of those foam
myths and this self-tanning oil it's
really thin like it just feels like
maybe you've got a water bottle here you
see that it's just a super thin thin oil
it's not nearly as thick and say
different facial oils that you might put
on I don't know I feel like it's thinner
than olive oil but I might cook with you
know what I'm saying and they say to put
that mitt on you're going to cup your
hand a little bit inside that mitt and
just put several drops of this and start
going across your body I feel like I'm
still learning how much of this I need
to be applying at a time but I felt like
I would go over like the upper part of
my leg and then put a little bit more on
and then go over the lower part and it
does have a little bit of a bronzey tint
to it so you have that bit of a guide
that helps you as you put it on and I
was so surprised at how quickly this
dried and that is huge for me I don't
want to sit around feeling tacky if
somebody or some toddler or baby light
grabs my leg or my arm I don't want to
feel like it's something coming off on
them or anything like that I just really
want this to be set and done yet I don't
want something that's going to be super
drying to my skin you know there's that
really fine line that I'm walking in
terms of preference here and I do feel
like this did a really good job it did a
very even job I don't know if you can
tell here like I've got it on this is
just the first application so it's not
super deep or anything but it truly did
smell good it doesn't smell like classic
self-tanner I mean I think it maybe it
developed a little bit more of that
scent as it sat on my skin but the onset
like yeah it does kind of smell like
vanilla a little bit but yeah in a
nutshell application was easy it didn't
take long to dry I'm talking like I
stood around for maybe five minutes
after I applied it and I felt like I
could just go about my life normally so
that was really great the smell was not
bad and it comes with the mitt so it's
really working for me on all of those
fronts and then I also got the facial
one and this is the argon liquid gold
self-tanning face oil
it says hydrating glow treatment
concentrate and this also says Tahitian
vanilla although I didn't remember
choosing between scents maybe I just
automatically got this one but the
directions for this say apply four to
six drops to clean dry skin massage and
blend evenly wash hands after and here's
what really sold me on this this
hydrating concentrate can be used in
place of your traditional moisturizer so
I think sometimes at night time after I
take my shower this is what I'm going to
use and I do love the fact that I don't
have to feel like well is it time yet is
it Sun good enough can I go ahead and
apply
you know moisturizer after I can just
put this on and feel like my skin that's
been moisturized and the format is this
does look like a typical face oil only
it's kind of bronzy and you do see a
little bit of that bronzing as as you
put it on four to six drops I think it's
definitely adequate to get all over the
skin I just applied it with my hands no
problem there and I definitely feel like
I was a little more bronzy as I applied
my makeup today and it might not show a
whole lot on camera you know with makeup
on and everything but I definitely felt
like my skin tone was deepened a notch
or two it will be interesting to see how
these products build on themselves like
will they really do a good job of
increasing the tan over a period of days
but this was so good because my skin
felt like it had been a little bit
moisturized after I put it on but it
wasn't thick and sticky so I wasn't
concerned about touching my face and
then messing it up or something like
that it just felt like my skin had a
little bit of a drink of moisture going
on but it wasn't too much this feels a
little bit richer and more moisturizing
to the skin than this stuff does but
yeah I was definitely interested in
trying some new self tanners because I'm
going to be going to Florida in June and
I want to have a little bit of a tan
going on before I get there so I'm
definitely going to continue using these
for a while I thought you know maybe I
experiment with a few different sunless
Tanner's but if these keep going well I
will stick with them and then I got a
couple of hair products I've never
really tried anything beyond just like
sample sizes from living proof and so I
got this perfect hair day in shower
styler it says enhances texture and
shine for air-dried styles and I thought
you know for somebody trying to save
time this would be really good
especially saving time with my hair I
really do very little with my hair
honestly I wash it at nighttime and this
said is best for straight to slightly
wavy hair start your style in the shower
so the way you're supposed to use this
you shampoo your hair condition your
hair as usual apply this product
generously to coat the hair from roots
to ends while still in the shower
lightly rinse I'm not really sure what
lightly actually means but this says
towel dry scrunch and then air dry so I
use this in the shower just last night I
put it in my hair I may or may not have
over rinsed I just I don't know fine
heared people do you ever feel like
product in your hair like a little bit
really goes a long way and so I
definitely did rinse it it felt like
conditioner honestly it's all a
conditioner going on my hair kind of
like a leave-in type treatment and as I
rinsed it out I thought it felt a lot
like conditioner rinsing from my hair so
then I just put my hair up in my Turbie
twist briefly I find that that does a
really good job of just sopping up a lot
of moisture from my hair and just sort
of went around the house after that
letting it air dry open to the air woke
up this morning and I felt like my hair
did did have a little more like
thickness to it like maybe just a little
more texture but I'm really interested
to see is if it gets heavy and greasy
like by the end of the day today you
know what I mean like if this product
maybe it does make my hair a little bit
more manageable and easy to deal with
the day after I use it but is it going
to get me oily faster just by having
more stuff in my hair but I didn't blow
dry my hair I didn't use a curling iron
or straightener on my hair or anything
like that
like this is just my hair the one thing
I added in what the couple sprays it
this other thing that I got which is the
living proof style lab instant texture
mist and this it says create multiple
textured style shake well spray on damp
or dry hair says blowout if desired for
added volume so I just did a little bit
of that at the roots flip my head over
went like really worked it in and then I
just kind of combed my hair over parted
on the side gave it a little hairspray
just to hold the style a bit more I
think this made my hair feel a little
bit thicker this in shower product and
this gave it you know a little more
oomph from the roots so I don't know I'm
pretty pleased with the result for not
having done any more to my hair than I
did I'm interested to see how my hair
wears with these products though
throughout the day so I'll need to
update you on that and now a couple of
other things I just wanted to take the
opportunity to mention here in this
video I didn't call these during the vib
sale I got them prior to it but there's
just a couple things that didn't end up
really working for me they might work
better for somebody else but I got this
Brazilian bumbum cream and it claims to
help tighten and smooth like no other
honestly I haven't used this enough to
know about those claims but the reason
why I didn't keep using it with because
it made my eczema that I sometimes get
on my hands really flare up in a big way
sometimes certain really fragrance
lotions different ones from Bath and
Body Works you know we'll just prompt
that to happen with my hands and yeah
it's really annoying because this smells
so good I love the smell it's very like
a mix of tropical but still very creamy
and kind of soft I love the scent I
totally wanted to keep using it but for
whatever reason like the morning after
sometimes that will happen to me if I've
used something really heavily fragranced
and like my fingers will start getting
this eczema dryness on them at the same
time I got that product I also got this
Brazilian crush body fragrance mist I
don't know what the deal was I just had
this assumptions I was really going to
like the scent of these products and I
do I do love the scent Tyler even
commented how good the scent on this
stuff was to me it's like lick
a tanning oil a kind of scent but yet a
little bit softer than that and a little
bit creamier than that which is really
hard to clearly explain this but I do
like the scent problem with this is I
feel like it's gone in a flash and I
know it's just a body spray but honey
I've lived on body sprays for some time
you know the ones from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
different brands by one from Walmart
here there I feel like this one
disappears faster than anything like it
just does not last on my skin for
example I'll put it on in the evening
and by the time I go to bed I feel like
it's gone and I don't know it's just
kind of annoying I've even applied tons
of it in to attempt to try to extend the
wear of this product and it just I don't
know guys it's just not doing it for me
so I wish I could have had better luck
with this brand but just for one reason
or another it's not working but anyway
thank you guys so much for tuning in for
this video I'd love to hear if you've
come up with any unique or interesting
signs from the Sephora sale and if
you're just looking for ideas of great
things to buy from Sephora and you
missed my other video I gave five like
no fail works for any one product
recommendations whether you're in the
sale or not they weren't like limited
edition items they're kind of like
available anytime items off of sephora's
website so check out that video if you
want some more ideas but thank you again
