for joining me for this video where I am
going to tell you all about my favorite
my top gift picks for the season whether
we're talking gift for yourself or gift
for someone else these are some of the
things that I think are can't-miss items
what you're gonna notice here is that
there may be other things that I've
mentioned in recent months that I've
liked but what I've really tried to do
here is pare it down to just like the
best of the best and the main thing I do
have in mind here is gifting things it
would be easily giftable well-received
could work really across the board for
so many different people so I'm gonna be
recommending three great eye palettes
three great like kind of multitasking
palettes three great lip sets and then
three kind of just miscellaneous things
also in this video the main focus is
high-end type items I will probably do a
more drugstore focused video like this
as we get a little closer to Christmas I
think I just have more to try still so
that's gonna be still to come and just
because I'm doing this gift picks video
now it doesn't mean there's not going to
be even more like palettes and high-end
stuff why am I doing this
there might be more coming that I'm
still gonna try still gonna review so
you guys stay with the channel keep up
on the videos and see if anything else
comes up between now and Christmas cuz
there might be some good stuff still but
you are talking with someone right now
who has tried a lot a lot of stuff so
I'm gonna go through my top eye palettes
here so I'm just gonna name three I've
really whittled this down even though I
like plenty of other things one is the
lorac mega pro 4 I really love this
palette I've got a major attachment to
this palette I am wearing it actually
today I've got just a really simple
quick look because I knew I wanted to do
a bold lip today so I did honey on my
lids and honey just looks like basically
someone has put just soft lighting on
you as I was seeing that shade on my
lids as I was applying today I just
thought it's it's a subtle soft like
almost pearlescent Sheen across the skin
but yet it's a gold so often we see gold
is may be either sparkly or metallic
this is like soft gold I love that shade
on the lid I've got some spice in my
crease and definitely sheered up and out
I've also got out in my crease and a
little mo
as well but just a super easy basic look
there are so many creative and
interesting things you can do with this
palette and as with all the products I
mentioned if I've already done a full
video on I will link to that below
because that will obviously be a lot
more detailed info but the way this
palette works if you're unfamiliar top
two rows are matte bottom two rows are
shimmer and I just love the way they've
mixed up the colors and this one for me
it's like neutral with just enough fun
going on these colors down here are
phenomenal Fairy Tail Lotus Unicorn some
interesting lighter shades in here that
aren't just purely you know champagne
and beige and all that like you've got
your basics but there's some fun to
peacock is a gorgeous blue over here I
know I addressed this in my full review
on this palette but this is a large
palette that is not full of BS repeat
colors I don't want to see that I like
palettes that are full of unique
memorable special like shades with a
purpose and this is just full of that
you or whoever you're giving this to is
going to I think uncover countless
different ways to combine these shades
this is this palette in a nutshell you
feel like you're laying into your
favorite shade you're like okay I love
this shade I love this shade and then
the next day you pick up a different one
and you're like no this is my new
favorite shade that's what's gonna
happen to you over and over again with
this palette so I love it in the mega
pro 3 it was just like standard bunch of
neutrals it didn't really excite me
those excites me okay I love it it's
like enough woman you've said enough
already another eye palette pick here it
is also from lorac but this is something
a little bit smaller and it's the
unzipped desert sunset palette if this
sounds familiar it's because it was
talked about in my sunset palette video
because I feel like there's this big
trend toward palettes that contain like
a pop of purple and some warm shades
warm Browns oranges peaches and I
mentioned how this palette is like
everything you need but in a way way
edited down size because I tried the
hooda and natasha de Nona and all these
different ones and I felt like this one
was giving me every look that those
could give me but you know it's 10
shades and it's less expensive and it's
giving me a great purple pop here this
matte shade that you're gonna love love
love in your crease a nice gold this
really rich dark brown that's going to
totally
whatever load the Reds are really
important to me in this palette also and
I love that you've got something that's
a little bit more like rusty and then
something that's more burgundy you got a
little bit of berry going on it's just a
really perfect variety in this palette
if you like that kind of color scheme
that like I said its warmth but it also
has a little bit of purple a little bit
of a fun pop final purely eye palette
that I'm gonna recommend here is the Too
Faced just peachy mattes I've talked
about this one so much I know it's not
technically holiday and neither is the
unzipped and I guess the pro for doesn't
really seem like it's part of a holiday
collection but I'm just calling them
like I see them this year and these are
my favorites I love love love what's
happening in this palette have I said it
enough it's a great matte formula it's a
wonderful configuration of shades I do
think anybody of any age could enjoy
this I don't find these to look like dry
unnatural like caked up mattes on the
eyes they just look radiant and
beautiful and part of that is the shade
selection that's in here because we've
got peaches we've got warm Browns we've
got like plum berry type shades that
just work wonderfully well and colors
that are dark enough to act as liners to
be the perfect amount of contrast that
you need with these warmer shades like
it's so wonderfully done and I have fun
with it all the time even though you
know you might glance at and think well
there's no shimmers there's no
off-the-wall shades no but I can always
make this look beautiful on my eyes oh
and the smell some people who you might
give this to who aren't like super into
makeup or aware of the whole you know
makeup landscape might get this and be
like what it smells like peaches I think
this looks good in all seasons I think
it's a gorgeous night out palette it
could do a very smoky eye this could do
a very conservative work look for
someone I just I love that so much now I
want to mention three and face slash
multitasking palettes here one of them
is the in the balm of your hand volume 2
so by multitasking I mean instead of
just being eyeshadows they're gonna pop
in some face products as well so here
this is a really cool idea if you're not
familiar with the in the balm of your
hand thing what they're doing is doing
like a Greatest Hits palette featuring
shades that exist already in other
palettes or just like individual shades
here with the blushes they've already
done a volume one which I loved and in
the volume two what you're getting here
is the Bahama Mama bronzer you've got
down boy blush frat boy blush one of the
Insane blushes this is the shade called
houndstooth they've also thrown in mary
loumanizer highlight which is like an
iconic product from their line and then
they've taken shadows from like a meet
Matador palette BOM Jovi nude dude meet
matrimony palette like they've just
plucked certain shades from there and
then they've given you a really really
workable lineup so I have already done a
video on this one too so I will link to
that you got a mirror in here it's a
great way to like introduce somebody to
the balm who's never tried it because
they truly have wonderful formulas very
creamy blendable pigmented formulas and
their shadows and their blushes are some
of the longest wearing most fantastic
blushes on the market I would say and I
love that they've put in here products
that are still the top quality that you
would see from the full-size just you
know shrunk down into this palette and
the balm kind of has this knack for
creating iconic products they don't put
out just tons and tons of things all the
time but the things that they do do you
kind of get attached to so when they put
them in this palette you know what they
are like you've heard mary lou manizer
before you've heard people talk about
Bahama Mama and frat boy and all that
stuff so a very giftable palette again
kind of out of the technical holiday
range of stuff but very very good
another thing that I like to can't put
down I love it so much and I'm truly
think this might be a great gift for my
mom this year and so mom if you're
watching sorry for the spoiler but this
is the hourglass ambient lighting edit 3
palette and it's kind of pricey we're
talking around 80 bucks for this guy but
this is full of quality lately every
time I open this up I use every part of
it I've got it all on my skin today like
this is all the bronzer I need right
here this is a natural kind of soft
bronzer but it's so effective and it's
just like everything I need just for
around the perimeter of the face and a
very soft contour these two blush shades
oftentimes I will take this more plummy
one use it very softly if I'm right here
a little bit low on the cheek and then I
dust over it with the dim light this is
the ultimate like face powder blender if
you need to tone down anything on your
face it's great it's an
soft finishing powder as well this is
your pop on the cheeks so pigmented and
fresh right on the apple of your cheeks
this shade right here is one of the
ambient powders and diffused light and I
mean I can use that on my under eye it's
a great just kind of all over the face
set it and go and the highlight here my
mom is now in her 70s and she has just
kind of come to realize how beautiful a
properly formulated and also properly
placed on the skin highlighter can be
and she's got great cheeks I'm like mom
if you just popped a little highlight
right on the outer part of your cheek
like when you smile that glow that's
gonna catch from that it's gonna be so
nice and I think this would be a perfect
highlighter for her I've got it on today
it was truly like that soft look one and
done face palette I love it have been
using it all the dang time my last
multitasker palette is this one from it
cosmetics which I just reviewed on my
channel I mean it's really doing it all
it's totally going there I mean you've
got concealers you've got a cream
highlight the bye-bye pores press powder
a blush six lip colors all these
eyeshadows over here the one sort of
unfortunate asterisk that I would put
beside this is just make sure that
whoever you're gifting this to can kind
of fit within this range of concealers
because they're giving you one or two
fewer shades than they did in last
year's multi palette so fair skin light
light/medium me and on the lighter side
of tan skin tones I think could wear
this but the really deep rich skin tones
may not find as much use for these so
just keep that in mind but everything
else in here I think is highly workable
I know it's really hard to focus on with
all that mirrored finish here but it's a
much better packaging design than
they've ever done before because look
how it just literally folds in on itself
no mess no part of the palette is
touching the other part it's super
compact and in the video where I did a
look with this I only threw in my CC
cream and eye primer and a mascara and
then I used everything else from this so
this might be a good gift for the person
who really likes to keep it easy and
you're going to be giving them also a
great selection of eyeshadows that blend
very very easily neutral color family
they're the lip colors aren't just like
randomly
those are actually their blurred lines
lipsticks just put into a pan form so I
would use those with a lip brush but
they're ultra bomb-like and pillowy soft
I love those and they're giving you very
generous sizes of the inner light the
cream highlight the bye-bye pores powder
and the blush as well all in all it's a
pretty well thought-out palette and I
think a great gift idea let's move on to
lips I got three maybe technically four
things that I want to talk about here
for my top lip picks one is this L'Oreal
set got to mention it even though I'm
really not focusing in too much on
drugstore in this video this is the
infallible Pro matte gloss collection
you're getting eight shades they are
existing colors in the line I believe
when I talked about this before and in
the video where I lips watched all these
out I mentioned that they had ten shades
total so you're getting eight of the ten
actual shades in the line but this Pro
matte gloss is something so special and
so good I love the texture the idea of a
matte gloss is silly but I would call it
like a lip cream they go on so smoothly
so opaque in full color you're not gonna
have that dryness that accompanies many
matte liquid lipsticks it's not a liquid
lipstick just like the most beautiful
textured lip cream that actually feels
really really comfortable on the lips
and the shades are so great like you're
getting some gorgeous neutrals and kind
of plummy shades down in here berries
true Reds pinks this like watermelon II
bright pink shade so so good and if I
were to give this to somebody I would
give it and I would have a very serious
look on my face and I would say I know
you're looking at this thinking this is
just a box of L'Oreal lip products but
this is a mind-blowing ly phenomenal
formula that you need to try that is
that's what you need to say as you hand
it over just cue my video up to that
point and share that with them it's a
must y'all I know there are so many lip
addicts that are watching my videos and
get these mini sizes that's the beauty
of many sizes you don't have all the
pressure to use up a full size another
huge recommendation here and this was
like I think may have been the first
holiday video I did this season I was
talking about the bite lip sets and this
is the perfect bite set of for
amuse-bouche lipsticks I am wearing one
of them I'm wearing the shade Cayenne
today guys have you learned
ready that these kits are always pretty
dang good and you don't need my
permission to get one of these like
these are great sweet little set of lip
colors in the tin with the mirror only
twenty-five dollars I think it's an
absolute steal because the formula is so
nice we're talking luxurious cream
lipsticks real lipsticks if you've heard
me talk about liquid lipsticks and the
matte mousse and the blah blah blah and
you're like no just tell me about a
really great lipstick look into these
please this is Cayenne that's the shade
I've got on now which is a really
fantastic warm red they also give you
rhubarb this is your beautiful like plum
e soft berry sugarcane is a really
beautiful nudey pink type shade and then
honeycomb is some more like classic nude
with a little bit of tan like looking at
the shade in the tube I don't feel like
it does it any justice it's way more
beautiful on the lips I like how to give
you some range in these little sets I
would challenge you to give this to that
person who you've never seen in a red
lip they'll have the many of it they'll
have a nice go-to and these are all
really creamy so one thing I might
advise is if you are wearing this red
you might just give it one quick blot on
a tissue if you want it to totally like
mattify on you I'm not saying these are
ultra shiny when you apply them but
there's that hint of shine across the
lips because they're a classic cream
lipstick and if you want to kind of
enhance the staying power right off the
bat it might seem kind of
counterintuitive to blot some away but
sometimes with brighter shades that
makes me feel a little more comfortable
because then I feel like okay there's no
excess goop here I've just got the nice
purity of the color and I'm not
concerned about it drifting last pick
here is for the nude lip lovers this is
such a nice set from bareMinerals
they're gen nude formula the kit is
called said nudes which i think is so
funny but you're getting three really
great standalone shades or mix them up
kind of colors you're getting Swank XYZ
and him wear them alone take the
lightest shade put it in the center of
your lip on top of either of these two
we're talking ultra opaque color on the
lips matte finish but not uncomfortable
they're not gonna set to a completely
transfer free place so you are gonna be
able to maybe pull a little color off of
your lips but they do wear very evenly
and if you know like your person that
you're giving to just loves to stay in
that neutral family they would love this
trio one of
thing that I really want to mention if
you want to give the most luxurious gift
ever to someone I love that julep lip
mousse formula that I talked about in
the Oprah favorites video from talking
about that big lip vault the matte lips
don't lie collection of 25 lip colors
all full-size like that's a huge gift to
give someone they do sell a little trio
of that formula as well but like that is
fantastic stuff that's a diamond in the
rough I personally had not heard anyone
really talking about that formula but it
is bomb like it's a great long-wear lip
color that's not gonna feel overly
drying on the lips it's got a nice
little applicator to it it's right up
there for me with the bare minerals Jen
nude but they're selling an entire vault
of bat formula you might like go try out
one see if you like it and then if
you're in love with it like I am get the
dang vault lastly I've got three sort of
random outside of those categories
things to recommend one is the tart
brush set from Sephora and it comes in
this little cup and I am storing my five
Tarte brushes along with God knows how
many other brushes that I kind of use on
a daily basis and I'm keeping it right
here handy in my makeup area cuz I love
gold in this room so I've got that but
the brushes that come in here you've got
a great like foundation buffing brush I
love this kind of larger yet pinched in
at the ferrule brush it's really great
for face powder or bronzer I use it with
that hourglass palette all the time with
the bronzer in there and just go around
the face like that this brush here is a
great size for highlight I also love it
for concealer and then in this set they
also give you a couple of eye brushes
one is this sort of chunky brush that
could Pat shadow on the lid or this
could be a nice precision concealer
blender as well and then a blending I
brush super soft like who can't use a
brush like that it's a nice size too
it's not too oversize but it would be
perfect just kind of around the
perimeter of your eye look and then look
at all the other stuff I'm still fitting
in this holder anyway that's a super
cute really fantastic quality brush set
targets strength this year I said it
before I'll say it again was the brush
sets they also made a set for Macy's
which I'm using a couple brushes out of
that one here and there but the Sephora
one is my favorite another random thing
is this little fragrance sampler here I
have kept this in the box just because I
knew I was going to bring it up
probably in a video like this and this
is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana set
it says intoxicating fragrances for the
refined rebel these are little roller
balls of the Nirvana black Nirvana
amethyst and Nirvana bourbon and this is
just kind of like I mentioned with that
lorac mega pro 4 you're gonna keep
uncovering favorite shades I keep
uncovering favorite scents here I knew I
loved the black because I already owned
that in the full-size and then I thought
like amethyst was gonna be my favorite
and now I'm kind of not sure if maybe
bourbon is my new favorite but these are
really rich since like there's a little
sweetness to them but they're kind of
deep a little bit spicy a little bit
mysterious I don't know what that even
means when I say that but they're so
good and they last truly a little bit
goes a long way but they are great
winter sense and how nice is it to have
that rollerball that you can toss in
your purse great for travel great to not
have to commit to a huge full size yet
and you could see like which one do I
really like you know this allows you to
have a little play time while you make
up your mind and it's $28 so I think
that's totally worth it last thing I
want to recommend I'm gonna have to pop
up a picture because these are down in
my shower the philosophy holiday pajamas
duo it's a shower gel and a lotion such
a fantastic scent here maybe you're
staying at someone's house for the
holidays and you want to give like a
little hostess type gift or something
like that this is the type of scent that
I think would appeal to everyone in a
family like it's cozy it's warm it's
clean it gives me a little hint of a
clean laundry vibe like I get what
they're saying with the holiday pajamas
there's a freshness to the scent a
little holiday magic thrown into that
set I am the worst at describing this
but just trust me it's so good I think
man woman and child would like that and
their shower gels are not only shower
gels but they can be bubble baths or
shampoos too and then the lotion is
really nice and luxurious as well if
you've got sensitive skin issues it's
never bothered me and I do for whatever
reason this is odd like I feel like I
can do so much stuff to my face where so
many different products and rarely have
any kind of reaction but I put the wrong
lotion on my legs and it's like well or
my hands - my hands are that way also
but anyway guys thank you so much for
watching I am so excited about
stuff that I've chosen to talk about in
this video as you can see I did kind of
go outside the box I didn't go strictly
with things that are defined as a
certain branch like Holiday Collection
because there was a lot of holiday stuff
this time around that I didn't really go
for so much but there are some totally
giftable wonderful things out there that
I think somebody would be so excited to
receive I'm looking at everything out
here in front of me thinking I can
picture a person for that gift for that
gift for that thing for that thing like
it's really really a good bunch of stuff
I will Pat myself on the back right now
like I said earlier I will try to focus
in on some more great drugstore pics and
also you know some more reviews here and
there I'm not saying this is it for
holiday this year I will no doubt have a
few more reviews creeping in but I
wanted to put out this video at this
time so those of you who might want to
take advantage of sales and there's a
special deal you can take advantage of
you will know my full thoughts so thank
you again for your time everyone and I
will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
