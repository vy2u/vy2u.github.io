video is going to be all about some of
my favorite peachy Coralie warm red type
lip colors are really not sure what I'm
going to call this video yet because
like my top six here that I'm going to
share with you in this video it really
runs a little bit of a spectrum I really
wanted to include different variations
on these shades so there would be kind
of like something for everybody if
you're timid about these kinds of colors
I think there's something for you in
this video and if you want like the
bulbous take on a warm red lipstick I
have that for you as well they are
definitely all formulas that I really
really love I've even got a couple of
dupe type products in this video and
yeah if you've ever thought about
wearing a shade like this I think it's
truly the perfect time of year
springtime I think these colors are just
phenomenal three of my pics are
drugstore three or high-end so let's
just jump in the first thing that I've
got and definitely the softest shade
that I'm going to be talking about is
this NYX butter gloss in Maple blondie
so we're talking the lightest end of the
spectrum here very peachy pink now they
have regular butter glosses which is
what this is and they also have the
intense butter glosses those tend to be
more opaque and there are some beautiful
shades in that line as well but I do
kind of like the Sheerness of this I
think it makes it a little bit more
wearable I do think it's a very very
comfortable Blatz formula and I also
wanted to mention this because well it's
pretty is sort of a standalone peachy
pink this can be a nice way to sort of
transform some of the nude lipsticks you
might really like so if you've got just
a very basic nude pop some of this on it
makes it a little bit more peachy and it
just gives it that pretty kind of
springy bright tint but the gloss that
I've had on throughout this video is
much more intense it's the most intense
gloss in the Too Faced sweet peach
creamy peach oil lip gloss line and I
really really like the is when I first
mentioned these I think it was a video
on products that really surprised me I
mentioned these peach oil lip glosses
because I think the feel is spectacular
is a great gloss consistency it really
does feel moisturizing on your lips but
it's not a slippery it's not slipping
outside the lips there's just enough
thickness to it to keep it kind of
hanging on on the lip and I kind of like
that I can apply just a very
all amounted this and get a really
pretty just pop on the lips without
feeling like I've got a lot of goopy
gloss but yet the shine you know is just
brilliant
- so this shade is called tickle me
peach there's no shimmer in it there's
also no shimmer in the last one I
mentioned and I forgot to point out that
this maple blondie is very similar to
peach please from the two-faced lines
now moving away from the glosses and
into some more solid lip products this
what Neutrogena moisture smooth color
stick in the shade fresh papaya such a
long time favorite repurchased item here
for me and these are the most
comfortable lip products on the market
are very balm like but not in that
slippery sin sort of lip smacker way no
offense to lip smackers but I mean this
really is like a treatment for your lips
plus the color and the color I think
really delivers but this is going to be
the softest sort of lipstick II shade
that I'm mentioning today I think if
you're really timid about integrating a
peachy or orangie lip color into your
life this would be the way to just kind
of try it out I really think anybody
could wear this and as I said the side
benefit to the beautiful color of this
product is the fact that it really feels
like you're getting a moisturizing lip
treatment now are ready to dive into
some intense lip colors here I've got
three of them to share with you the
first one is from Charlotte Tilbury and
I believe it's from the hot lips line
she had named a bunch of lipsticks after
celebrities and this just happens to be
hot Emily what can I say I truly did
choose this not just because of the name
but because of the color and this is a
really nice formula before this the only
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick I had tried
was the mass that she makes and I like
those too but this is extremely creamy
and it's such a nice bright coral punch
I mean don't you think it's just the
epitome of bright coral so that one I
definitely wanted to give a shout out to
in this video but then I've got
something that's more of a true orange I
think so if that's what you're looking
for I've got one here from Maybelline
it's the loaded bulbs line and the color
is called orange danger and this I'm
very excited to share with you I think
it's a really good dupe obsess amazed
and you guys know I love my Besame but
this shade actually just the appearance
on the lips they're like both near
mattes you know what I'm saying neither
shade gives off a whole lot of shine but
they're not drying at all either these
are really these loaded bold lipsticks
from Maybelline our spectacular
Maybelline has a lot of great lipsticks
but if you're looking for a really
punchy kind of orange that's not so much
coral but more toward a true Orange you
might look into this one and then lastly
I wanted to mention the most reddish
orange option so in our lipsticks here
just to review we have the Charlotte
Tilbury which was a real Coral then the
one from Maybelline more of an orange
and now this one from Besame is the most
red and this is tango red which I have
mentioned several times on my channel
but you can kind of see the line up
there this one in a way if you're kind
of scared of orange it's the most toward
red it's a red with just that orange II
type of undertone to it instead of being
a blue based red and I think it's
gorgeous I think now is the time you
know for that type of shade it's one of
those shades that just makes you feel so
glamorous just kind of like an old
school vibe to it and of course I love
Besame Besame lipsticks can really just
do no wrong in my opinion I mean get you
one of these and just enjoy the outer
packaging and I normally do apply these
with a lip brush because they are so
intense I do kind of like building up
the color with the lip brush and you can
blot it off but for the purposes of just
straight-up showing you what the color
is on the lips in this video when I
applied it I just took it straight from
the tube but yeah I hope this video was
helpful for you if you're thinking about
a corally orange e lip color for this
time of year I think we've got a really
nice range in this video not only of
shades but of different textures and
finishes you know from glosses to more
of a little like tinted lip balm type
product and then into the more saturated
lip colors so now I want to know from
you guys what did I miss are there any
other colors out there in this color
family that you think I should check out
definitely let me know and I will see
you guys soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
