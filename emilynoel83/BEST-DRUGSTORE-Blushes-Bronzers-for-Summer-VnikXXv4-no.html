thank you for bringing up this video
idea to me and a couple videos ago I did
a whole like full face kind of bronzy
glowy type look and it brought about a
lot of questions for comparable blushes
to what I used in that video different
bronzer recommendations just lots of
discussion going on in the comments
section about different drugstore
options because I did use a few high-end
things in that video so I thought this
would be a great opportunity to share
some bronzers that I really love also
some blushes that I specifically think
are really great for summer not that
couldn't wear them any time I think they
work especially nice paired with your
bronzers and everything's drugstore in
this video so yay for that and just one
little thing I'm going to throw out here
to you guys because you just never know
what people are picking up on in videos
my forehead here I am a like three
dimensional person so my forehead curves
back like that and it kind of you know
may catch the light here or there but
it's just the fact that it's curved you
know it may not always be catching the
light and that's not you know misplace
bronzer that's not a haircolor gone
wrong it's really simply the fact that
there's glow on my skin and it's
catching the light in some places and my
forehead is not completely flat it is
kind of you know the shape of my skull
is around it and just throwing that out
there to anybody who may have been
bothered by it I will also do a
once-over bet here make sure all those
drawers are shut okay we're good so
first bronzer I want to mention and I go
way back with this one not quite as far
back as I go with NYC sunny which is a
really nice very light bronzer this one
has definitely come in over you know the
past several years and it's kind of
taken its place for me because I find it
to be very very versatile it's the NYC
color wheel mosaic face powder and I
have it in all over bronze glow this is
all matte I do have a full review video
focusing in on this product couple
reasons why this is so great first off I
love the all matte quality to it because
I think it can double as a contour
powder really nicely it's very pigmented
- but it's got you know these different
tones mixed in so you can kind of
actually focus in on certain parts to
get it darker or to sort of diffuse the
color a little bit
like right in this zone I see more
concentrated darkness around the edges
here maybe there's a little bit more of
that like light tan color mixed in and
so you can have a little bit of control
that way I used it a little bit in the
hollows of my cheeks and just around the
whole face today and even if you're
getting into more of a tan skin tone
adzes you'll still notice an impact from
this kind of a bronzer so I love that I
also want to throw an option out there
to those of you who have lighter skin
and you're looking to maybe get a little
bit of a bronzed glow but you want it to
look really realistic I would say try
the butter bronzer from Physicians
Formula but big heads up here this has a
very strong scent it smells like like a
suntan lotion suntan oil very tropical
saving and I could see that being a bit
much for some people so just know it's
heavily scented but it's got this really
interesting like barely-there glow enos
it's not super metallic or shimmery
you're not going to see a ton of glow on
the skin but it's just got enough to
look really natural and I think the
texture of it to it is kind of a creamy
feeling powder so it's very light I have
it in the shade bronzer I think there
might be a tonne of it called light
bronzer or something so this is actually
the deeper of the two so as you can see
I think it really is geared toward
lighter skin tones for me this can
perform as a very light soft contour I
think I used two in a get ready with me
favorites video last month really really
liked the stuff but I think if you're
extremely like on the darker tan side
you won't notice a lot of impact but if
you're lighter skinned you might be like
oh my gosh this is exactly what I needed
because it's not to oranjee it really
doesn't look super obvious on the skin
but it's just enough of that little tan
glow so I like that got to mention one
of my holy grail drugstore bronzers
which is from Milani it's called bronzer
XL and this is the shape called fake tan
love it because if you are a fan of
those cool tone contour shades this is
ideal you know the things I've mentioned
so far I think as far as bronzers go
even if you don't care about chiseling
out the cheekbones they're just good
bronzers this is something that can
really multitask and be the contour and
you know kind of a golden a glow to go
along with
this has just a little bit of shimmer
it's not real strong but I love that
two-in-one product so much product in
that pan so if you can find this
somewhere if you can find it online I
think it's a great Buy
and one other thing from Milani that's
kind of a rediscovered love for me I
never really got a lot of use out of
this when this was new to me and now I'm
really loving it because I'm kind of
enjoying getting a highlighted effect
through more bronzy gold any colors and
so this is in the shade glow it's the
Milani baked bronzer so you can see it's
got a lot of shimmer happening there but
it's very light today while I use the
NYC bronzer quite a bit on my skin I
also use this lightly with kind of a big
brush just all over the skin and it
gives you that little added glow but it
really meshes with the bronzed look so
not really your standard deep dark
bronzer but still I think worth
mentioning and speaking of glow I would
like to mention my summer highlight
favorite it's the Physicians Formula
shimmer strips and this is in the shade
Vegas strip really like all the
different options they have with this
but as far as highlighting goes I love
using the top part of this palette on my
skin and then I think if you're a little
darker you know you could edge your way
a little bit more toward the bottom of
the palette but I'm loving those
highlights that have that bit of golden
twist because it looks so flattering
paired with your bronzers I think so
that's a great one and plus these are
nice eyeshadows too now getting into
some blushes that I love for summer that
I think looks so good with the bronzy
look first one I would recommend would
be this elf blush palette now I believe
this is the one for lighter skin there
is a deeper one too but still these are
so pigmented I think about any skin tone
could benefit from these you can see the
nice big mirror the colors do pop out if
you want to customize or put other elf
products in there but don't you love how
everything is so bright and has such
great intensity I'm wearing this blush
color on my cheeks today just very
softly and I think on these Pink's
really give a naturally kind of
sunkissed look and at first why firs got
this a couple years back I was like oh I
don't know about that kind of tan shade
there but this is gorgeous
this is like that pretty neutral kind of
golden a tan blush that surprises you
once you get on your cheeks and then you
also got this sort of intense coral
color down here so this one a little bit
more toward pink more coral this one
lighter and brighter pink which I think
is always really flattering and just a
really youthful color but all in all I
think a great selection of blushes each
one's different from the next very
affordable so if you want a little
summer blush wardrobe and you could wear
it any time don't get me wrong but I
think these are really like bright fun
summer shades now let's talk about the
thing that I think I talked about in
another video as summer in a stick this
is the makeup revolution the one blush
stick and I believe this is the shape
called matte rush but they don't
actually put the name on here look at
this gorgeous coral blush stick oh it's
so intense it blends out really really
easily and let's say it has a complete
like cream to powder feel to me but once
you blend it out there's a little more
realistic like look at how that is
blended out but it kind of goes back to
the natural texture of your skin I don't
notice anything sticky it's definitely
got a range of intensities that you
could build to but you don't feel the
need to set it with anything so I love
that when certain cream blushes perform
that way I love when they're easy enough
that you could blend it out with your
fingers you could use a small stipple
brush but just like dot a teeny bit on
your cheeks and you will have a lot of
color but it is truly that perfect coral
glow and there's no shimmer in this
product so you can kind of rely on
different bronzers or highlights to give
you that this is just pure color and I
love it now another option that might
not seem really summery but I just want
to see somebody pull off this look maybe
I'll try this look sometime but this is
my Shea Moisture mineral blush in sand
and it looks really deep it's kind of
like this dark kind of brownish berry
type tone and I think this would be
great on a tan or rich skin tone I think
you'd see a lot of impact from this kind
of color but I'm picturing this kind of
you know maybe a little bit low on the
cheek area a dark lip but really bronzed
up skin and maybe like a bronzy smokey
eye would that be great like I'm
picturing this summer fall fusion type
of look and it would involve this blush
and I think it's Gor
another thing I love about this blush is
that sheared out you develop this pretty
like kind of neutral deep rose shade
it's a lot like Cola pop from Clinique
if you've tried their cheek pop blushes
which I love that shade this is just a
little bit more affordable take on it so
love it I had a lot of questions about
the Too Faced pink leopard and it's a
bronzer but I really see this as a blush
and I use this in my last tutorial and a
lot of people said is there something
similar out there to that and this looks
you know very unique but overall when
the shades are all blended together I
did find something in my collection that
gives you a very similar look it's from
covergirl and it is the classic color
blush and soft mink now this one
actually is just a teeny bit warmer than
this one is because there are some very
cool bright pinks mixed in and when you
mix all that together it does look a lot
like this this is just a little warmer
but I do think this is a great neutral
summery blush anytime blush really I've
talked about this before but I never
realized until I really started looking
a couple days ago it's very close to
pink leopard there's a reason why I like
them both and you can probably tell us I
hold the compact here it's got a little
bit of a satiny finish to it so very
flattering on the skin I think a lot of
skin tones could wear that one and as
far as the lorac take me to tan Tigo
palette that I used in that tutorial
someone asked if the elf bronzer palette
is a dupe for this I've compared them
and they're very very different the elf
has overall like totally lighter shades
not as much pigmentation this has the
two matte shades two shimmery shades and
so far palette wise I haven't found
anything that totally dupes that I do
think the different bronzers that I
mentioned in this video can give you
similar looks you know getting a deeper
one like the NYC maybe getting something
more glowy like the Milani baked bronzer
using them together it can give you you
know the variation in looks that you can
get from something like this it doesn't
have to come from a pallet and real
quickly before I go I want to tell you
what else I'm using on my face because
I've got some other drugstore stuff on
this is the covergirl trublend roses
palette that's on my eyes I did kind of
a matte look with that
and then my lipsticks are the hard candy
these are the plumping serum lipsticks
love these were these kinds of lipsticks
actually when I was giving birth they
lasted a really long time well staying
very comfortable so the shades that I
mixed are infamous and anonymous so
anonymous is that great nude this
infamous shade gives it a little bit of
pink but I love these thank you guys
again so much for watching I appreciate
your time and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
