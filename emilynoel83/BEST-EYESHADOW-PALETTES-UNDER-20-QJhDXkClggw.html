wanted to chat about one of my very
favorite topics which is eyeshadow
palettes love a good eyeshadow palette
especially love when you're getting a
really good value you know something
from the drugstore it's gonna give you
great quality but not cost a lot and
there was a time and I was interviewed
recently for a podcast and I don't think
it's out there to be listened to yet but
the topic came up about how more and
more drugstore brands are putting out
like a full eyeshadow palette instead of
just you know little duos and quads here
there we're getting a lot of substantial
palettes everything that I'm going to
talk about in this video falls under $20
some are kind of new and some have
definitely been around for a while that
I'm talking about so you might get a few
little reminders of something to shop
your stash for check and see if you have
it for example the first one I'm going
to mention here is the Coastal Scents
revealed palettes these kind of started
off as their spin on urban decay naked
palettes and one of them in particular
and I don't know that this really stood
out to me as much at the time that I got
it because I was a big fan of the reveal
too at first which went very rosy and
plumy but then the revealed 3 I'm kind
of coming to appreciate how gorgeous
this is and how it gives a little bit
more variety instead of just being rosy
like you do have some of that but you've
got like a straight up purple here you
got some really beautiful cool taupe
sand bronzy shades just enough mattes
and I tell you the texture of these if
you've never tried one of these revealed
palettes there's a lot inside and they
are so so smooth and easy to work with
you've got your black your really like
dark plum pink gold this line in general
if this sounds appealing to you if you
want to get like an Urban Decay Naked
palette looks but for about half the
price but still a lot of variety I think
you might really enjoy these and I'm
really trying to dive in and become more
of a use what I have type person and so
in doing that I rediscovered this
palette and I think the revealed 3 along
with the other options in that line are
really really top-notch like I said the
- for the longest time stole my heart
but the 3 seems to have even more
directions a person could go and maybe a
little less shade overlap here's another
great one BH Cosmetics weekend festival
palette for my colorful friends out
there whoo this is so nice something
special that I think they did here is
that they
didn't force all of their statement
colors to be shimmery you know how some
brands do that they found that within a
palette we're gonna have like this green
or this blue do you like the color
that's gonna shout from the rooftops and
it's gonna be shimmery and here you have
so many statement shapes that are also
matte and I think that gives it so much
variety and it also gives the non
shimmery lovers something that they can
still play with you know so like this
hot pink and this orange here this aqua
the pink over here they're matte and
they're very bold and very well done and
then you've got just such a splash of
other shades in here from greens to
yellows I love setting up a look with
escape kind of getting that warmth going
in the crease and then popping on
literally any of these other shades the
orange and the purple are very pretty
together I kind of want to do like a
week's worth of looks from just this
palette because it is a lot of fun and
it's very affordable at first it was on
ulties website and that's where i bought
it and now it's just on BH Cosmetics so
I'll link to it below next up you know
it's not officially a conversation about
bargain palettes until we bring makeup
revolution into the mix because these
are $7 and these are mind-blowing what
you're looking at here are color schemes
that are most definitely a take on
honest hacia palettes that exists and
the reloaded iconic vitality is modern
renaissance this one here the division
palette definitely makes me think
subculture when I ordered these off of
ulties website I was able to get this
one right away but then this one had
been sold out because I think there's
been a lot of comparisons made but $7 a
great shade range 15 color eye palettes
if you love the modern renaissance color
scheme but you haven't wanted to spring
for it price-wise I think this is an
awesome option so pigmented now some
people criticize not only on estancia's
formula but also the color scheme of
this palette I remember hearing a lot of
people say well I don't really even like
the colors in subculture but I love that
color scheme I'm here for a good olive
green I'll take the warm Browns the
honey mustard colors are surprisingly
great mixed in with all this stuff and
they've even kind of got those quirky
shimmery shades in here as well so it's
a fantastic bargain allow me to also
give mention to an older favorite makeup
revolution palette like the first
go-round of trying makeup revolution
stuff when I bought it from Ulta
member neutrals versus neutrals this is
so good I compared a lot of what's in
here to the two-faced peach palette like
it's not a shade for shade dupe or
anything but there's actually a lot of
peach in here and then all these kind of
mid-tone from taupe to Rosie to bronze
to dark bronzy brown really impeccable
textures to work with and I have dug
into some of these now Milani Milani
goes way back for having great eye
shadows to me like thinking about their
little singles that were around and you
go Walgreens do you be like do I want to
spend like four dollars on a single I
don't know I guess like I continually be
drawn in by those great quality singles
and they had like a cult following
online this is like even pre YouTube
days that I remember that well they are
on the palette train as well and they've
got these smaller ones called everyday
eyes and I love these and I think these
are a really great deal and I feel like
actually I vary a lot as far as which
one's gonna be my favorite for a given
time because they've got this warm one
that I think is so good that one's
called
earthy elements if you like a little
orange a little splash of bronze that's
good also they're very basic neutral
like if you don't go for warmth and you
just want those neutral shades that are
a little more topi a fantastic black the
must-have Naturals is good but the one
I'm really getting into now is the plum
basics and this one is really cool what
they've done here because they've given
you a deep plum that does have some
shimmer but then they've given you this
matte like dark red wine type color and
I love that too but what's really
smartly done here is that these aren't
big palettes you know there's only four
five six shades in each but they always
give you a variety of textures so you're
gonna have mattes you're pretty much
always gonna have them in the proper
shades that you would need them in you
know like your little crease color your
matte shade here to be your brow bone or
elsewhere you've got enough colors for
contrast they're just really well put
together not messing around no BS shades
small palettes but then Milani also said
we want to go bigger and so they put out
bold obsessions and they also put out
most loved mattes of the - I think I
like bold obsessions best because this
really I think is their take on a busy
art golden hour for sure it's got a lot
of similar shades I talked about these
more in a full review video but
the textures here are really nice
they've got some metallics that are
so-so going there but every matte
neutral that you might also want to
balance things out so this was an
extremely well done palette here and
it's a way to get that busy art golden
hour look without that price tag still
you got to take into consideration this
is like a $20 eye palette and those from
makeup revolution that I just talked
about are far less so keep a little
perspective there but if this is a color
scheme that you really love like I do
enjoy that palette and I actually used
just recently in a video check that out
for the how-to but it's this maybelline
city mini palette they've put out an all
matte it's called mad about town and I
think that this just might be the matte
basic palette that could serve so many
people who are in like the professional
environment they don't really want a lot
of shimmer maybe they don't even want a
lot of choices when they're getting
ready for their busy day like I can see
this being the working person's getting
me out the door type palette the colors
are very smooth you do want to tap off
the excess when you dip into these
you'll notice a little bit of powder
coming out of them they remind me very
much of lorac eyeshadows but they're
nice it's a nice color scheme and it's
gonna give you really basic everyday
looks hey guys I'm back
I couldn't let this video go up without
recognizing the fact that I had
forgotten something really really
awesome that is a 10 dollar palette
actually four different ten dollar
palettes that are great quality that I
really love and I haven't used him a lot
lately but they are fantastic quality
and I do have a full video where I
talked about palettes from shop hush and
specifically I think the bad habit
palettes are so good they've got these
smaller ones it's like the after series
I think you can get all four of them for
$30 or they're gonna be $10 each and
they're all inspired by the different
huda beauty obsessions palettes and this
after party one has been one of my
favorites because I thought that did a
really good job of actually combining a
little bit of warm but also a lot of
cool and it makes a great smokey eye I
mean we're talking a combination of
matte and shimmer and within the shimmer
some really potent metallic shades so
that one's a lot of fun another one for
my colorful ladies and gentlemen out
there the aftershock palette like as you
can see there are no neutrals in here so
you're gonna be perhaps pairing this in
with
maybe some other palette you have or
just going 100% rainbow mode that's cool
but the intensity of these shades is
totally not going to disappoint you and
then there are two more I would say
neutral type palettes the only one I
actually own of the hooda brand is the
mauve one so this is the bad habbit
counterpart to that and it's got
beautiful burgundy some light kind of
shimmery pinks and then your richer like
reddish and rosy colors so that's
gorgeous if you tend to enjoy that color
scheme and then after dark is for you
know the orange a terracotta lovers what
I like about these palettes is that
there is good balance with the exception
of the brides one I mean the brides one
is definitely bright pigmented shades
well done but in terms of creating like
a full finished eye look I like how most
of these other palettes do give you some
nice dark shades to play with this color
cold Merlot it's actually it might look
brown but it's got some burgundy in
there and the only shimmer in this
particular palette is the center one
that 24-carat which is stunning so
anyway I thought you should know about
those I didn't feel I could do this
video without those that habit does make
a lot of really great pallets that if I
had to choose just my favorite type of
thing they do I really like these
smaller ones because I think they're
very manageable very easy and they've
just done a really good execution of the
shades and I apologize for my lighting
being different I only set up one light
here for this because I was just up and
on real quick anyway that's all from me
future Emily see you later some of these
you've seen me use on my channel some
you may be not seeing me use enough so
I'd love to hear more about what you're
most interested in watching me apply and
do tutorials with but every brand is
really putting out pallets left and
right and I think it's good to be
reminded of the fact that there are so
many fantastic options for twenty
dollars or less in just a massive
variety I mean everything from the BH
Cosmetics one and through those makeup
revolution ones that are great like kind
of dupe palettes even your smaller
drugstore palettes like the little
Maybelline one and the Milani I think
there's something for everyone so I hope
this was helpful guys thank you so much
for taking time out of your busy day to
watch and I will see you again very soon
