me it is August favorites time on us
best in beauty I know everybody says
this but I really don't know what
happened to the month of August it was
here and then it was gone definitely
have a few great favourites to pass
along including this hat I know I never
wear hats and videos but outside of
videos I do wear hats a lot and this is
one of my new favorites I got this from
Dick's Sporting Goods right there with
bub he's looking for golf balls and golf
shirts and that kind of thing and then I
ran across the Carrie Underwood I think
it's called the Kolya
line it's like activewear and this hat
caught my eye can you see how this is
like a woven type thing up here and I
thought there's a hat that would match
anything and hats are just so quick and
easy you know you haven't had a chance
to do your hair you get out the door you
got your baseball hat on no problem and
my normal go-to hat is a white um
Cardinals hat with like a light pink
logo right here and I like that but it
doesn't work for everything so basically
in any circumstance where that hat
doesn't work this hat does so I really
like it's very comfortable it's got a
little like velcro adjuster in the back
and there's a little logo there on the
side it seems like really nice quality
so I have enjoyed wearing this a lot and
I thought now it's the time I'm gonna
talk about it in a video make up stuff I
got a couple foundations worth
mentioning one I'm not gonna go too much
into in this video because I have a
whole video devoted to it and it's the
estee lauder double wear nude water
fresh makeup with SPF 30 and I just
think this is a foolproof easy great
foundation if you do like the lighter
look I mean it absolutely makes my skin
glow when I put it on and it's not from
any kind of artificial bits of sparkle
pearlescent
stuff going on in it it's just like the
texture of the foundation is so
lightweight it's not quite as runny as
water but it is darn close and it's so
easy to just blend across the skin get a
light amount of coverage with you can
build it in certain areas and it won't
look heavy whatsoever so if you're
interested in this if you think you
might be into a lighter coverage product
but yet something that gives the skin
just a really fabulous look
this is definitely worth checking out I
will link to my video below where I talk
about that more - also there are a lot
of foundation sticks coming out lately
I've talked about this recently it seems
like every brands got their stick
foundation which i think is great I
think it's good to have all kinds of
formulas all kind of takes on this idea
because a foundation stick is just a
really easy way to just swipe on the
product and in some cases get great
coverage but not every stick gives great
coverage
sometimes they're harder to blend and
sometimes they're just thick and they've
often market themselves as a buildable
product but certain ones it's like well
you can only build it so far it's gonna
look pretty thick and it's not gonna
wear evenly I think the foundation stick
that I've tried so far that has the most
coverage and the best staying power not
just in terms of simply being present on
the skin later in the day but actually
looking good you know as the day wears
on like really no identifiable we're
down in the product I would say it's the
hourglass vanish stick I've got this in
the shade nude nude I'm wearing it today
and you might not be able to tell do two
different powders that got on top but
nude is a little on the yellow side for
me but this is the triangular foundation
stick and I just I think the coverage on
this is really just amazing it's got
such a nice amount of creaminess with it
I can easily blend it with a brush I
don't absolutely have to use a Beauty
Blender sponge I feel like it's enough
moisture it gives kind of a soft matte
appearance on the skin but it's not too
like chalky and thick and then like I
said look at myself later in the day
when I've got this on and I'm pretty
impressed by how fresh it actually looks
and this is not to say that there aren't
other good foundation sticks out there
I've enjoyed the Besame stick actually
that's just one example of one where you
can only go so far coverage wise because
then it starts to get a little thick or
wear a little unevenly patchy
I've enjoyed the Smashbox I've liked the
NARS but this one I feel like if you're
just going straight up coverage like I
need great coverage I want it to last
the hourglass is really really good
speaking of staying power
a nude liquid lipstick that stays like
none other is the maybelline superstay
and the color loyalist I'm wearing this
on my lips right now this line I mean I
tell you if you want a locked-in liquid
lipstick this is it I
tried the red what's the red color
pioneer I've tried the one called lover
which is kind of a pinky mauve and then
this for the nude this is like the only
new they have though and that's that's
the bummer of the line big reason why in
my last video when I noticed that the
bareMinerals Jan nude liquid lipsticks
were coming on sale in the Ulta 21 days
of beauty as a hot buy so I think that
means they're on sale every single day
of the event I definitely wanted to
recommend this because that's a great
line of nude and neutral liquid
lipsticks here with the Maybelline sadly
they only have this one that's really
nude but it wears like iron I mean it's
gonna be on my lips the entire day and
there are so many for whatever reason
the nudes can't last as well as the
brighter colors in these long wearing
formulas I don't care what formula it is
rarely do I see something that can hang
on even a little bit throughout the day
and so this one lasts really well and
you know the color is nice too I enjoy
that now I wouldn't be surprised if
Maybelline is holding out on us a little
bit I bet they come out with maybe you
know start of next year they'll have a
full range of super-state matte ink
nudes you know wouldn't it make sense if
they did that because they're so few in
the current line there's a lot of bright
colors in this line that's great but if
you like the neutrals and nudes there's
not a lot for you unless this shade
appeals to you which I really like it
but there's not much else to choose from
also in the lip department the color
riche matte lip liners from L'Oreal I
know I mentioned these in my L'Oreal
video top 5 bottom 5 so if you want a
lot more pics from that line check out
that video but I love these lip liners
this is such a must try here with the
shade called matte mastermind it's
really good really great neutral I know
you're probably like a neutral on board
but this is the kind of shade that
everybody needs to sort of define and in
some cases deepen up a to light nude
shades so I love that one they go on so
creamy they just go on quick
you know they glide on that easily so
that's a good one the one called mattes
it it looks like just packaging wise it
looks like it would be really close to
the mastermind one but actually it's a
lot cooler when you finally see it all
like spread out on the lips and you can
really assess
the color it's different from the other
but then there are some beautiful bright
shades as well I really like this one
called strike and that strike a mat Oh
what is it
Oh strike a match they're trying to be
so witty with the names of this there's
good red good couple of Reds there so
check them out I'm getting back into
something got a couple rediscovered
favorites here than that blush duo and
soft and subtle I did use this in my ELF
one brand video so this is just creeping
into the favorites for the month but my
goodness is that not a perfect perfect
easy blush shade right there kind of
wear it right in here on the cheeks I
love it honestly to glance at that it
looks like nothing it does not scream
blush at me at all but it's so pretty on
the cheeks I adore that duo and really
pigmented too just surprising and then I
was back and forth between brow products
I've been loving this month I was really
close like I had it in my little bucket
here on my Too Faced chocolate brownie
brow pencil I really liked that I
thought it was giving me a quick brow
but then I start working in this elf one
this two-dollar elf instant lift I'm
like this is actually doing the job even
faster and I'm for whatever reason
certain aspects of my makeup routine I'm
all about speed this is just one of
those things it's working so well for me
and the shade is so OnPoint the neutral
brown color in this if your hair colors
like mine your brow color is anything
like mine like oops I probably put some
on my hand this goes on super easily
it's just a little bit bigger pencil
than a brow Wiz would be just keep that
in mind but it makes really quick work
of the whole brow routine and then it's
got the spoolie on the other side I pop
a little gel on top of that and my job
is done on the brows so I love that two
dollars a highlight that I've been
reaching for a lot you may remember this
from my Amazon video where I tried
different beauty products that I got
from Amazon the Aesthetica strobe series
radiate palette I have it in tan to dark
honestly it's delivering more than you
would believe like this color here I
think one day I will hit pan on that it
is so vibrant I've got it on as my
highlight too
I love that and I can wear any of these
as highlights you know it's crazy
actually this one almost as a blush it's
just beautiful pigmentation here
beautiful shine on these shades you'd
almost swear once you get it on your
cheeks that there were some sort of
liquefied liquidy creamy quality to
these but no they are merely powders and
they go on wonderfully well this brand
has some really good stuff it's a brand
I want to explore more on on Amazon
finally here for the favorites video
gotta mention the cooling aloe vera eye
mask from Ulta I repurchase like three
of these after trying it and I mentioned
this in the cooling beauty products
video this is such a treat I got to tell
you they are like little gel masks that
you put on on your under eye area and
they're not goopy at all they really
stick there when you put them on now I
feel the cooling effect while I've got
them on for a period of time but then I
take them off and it's like it feels
downright cold on my skin and you touch
this part of your skin and you touch
down here and you're like oh my gosh
it's 2 different climates on my face
right now it's really neat very
inexpensive little luxury you know if
you're tired at the end of the day it
just kind of perks you up or you know
start of your day might be a nice time
for this before you do your makeup I
think men would enjoy this women who
ever try it out
several small complaints for the month
one thing that I just want to put out a
little warning on the elf waterproof
eyeliner in jet black is not waterproof
it's not even close it's not even as
good as various non waterproof eyeliners
that I have I just it doesn't last it
transfers more than just about anything
like it transferred up to my brow bone
it transfers and collects in the inner
corner I mean it's cheap yes but I would
still expect more why in the world would
they call it waterproof I don't know so
I'm gonna sit that aside the Maybelline
master camo I've got this in the what
she I've got this in the apricot for
dark circles shade to me my skin tone
it's just a little too dark to really
effectively do the job I need a little
bit lighter peach shade to really do it
I mean I know exactly what that product
is it is the
a benefit erased paste and number two I
mean benefit boring brightening
concealer now that it's been renamed
like that is my color that is that
product is one with me and this is just
a little bit dark and well a lot bit
dark I mean I put this on blend it in
it's rather dark but then I put
concealer on top of it and it's like
something's missing I'm still seeing
circles it wasn't like I needed that
product because you guys know I've got
things that I know will work but I'm
always interested if there's something
low-cost that might do the job as well
there's another thing I tried this Jake
at beauty Beverly Hills 90210 24
eyeshadow palette I'm not sure how good
i realistically expected this to be but
this is such a hit-and-miss eyeshadow
palette I mean the colors of it looked
good I think that's what drew me in I
thought okay it's a nice sort of blend
of light medium and dark here and some
of the shades like there's some nice
smooth mattes in here there are some
shimmers that really are nice but then
there are some of the most flaky
textures you've ever seen like dip your
finger in and it's just like chunks
chunks are just coming out of that light
shade in there and there are several
like that and I'm wondering like it's
it's snowing over here right now I mean
what is going on when an eyeshadow
texture is really chunky like that it
makes it very hard to work with I think
on the eyes because you're trying to
build it up and as much time as you
spend trying to build that one shade up
on your eyes you've got all this fallout
coming down because of the sheer amount
of product you're trying to make work
it's just it's a tricky thing there are
so many good eyeshadow palettes out
there can't really in good conscience
recommend this one even though they do
have some nice shades it's just very hit
and miss within the palate for me and
that is all for the best and beauty for
the month of August thank you guys so
much for your time thank you for your
great video requests I'm going to tell
you here a little teaser I have heard
more video requests than ever recently
for luxury products show us some brands
that you don't normally show us you guys
have been saying to me can you review
this brand or that brand I'm hearing you
and I'm gonna have a video coming up and
it's gonna blow your mind some of the
things that
in it I think it's blowing my mind
anyway the amount that I spent on that
stuff so you'll want to be tuned in for
an upcoming video there on that topic
I'm gonna be talking about the whole
two-faced peach line I've had some real
surprises
among those products that I've tried so
lots of new stuff to chat about thank
you guys again and I will see you soon
