in beauty I'm excited to share my finds
with you this month I don't feel like I
have a whole lot because I think there
were so many new products that I've
tried very very recently so they were
kind of on the bubble you know they were
things that I used a timer to I enjoyed
but they weren't like a continual
favorite throughout the month so that
does help me Whittle it down to some
products that I definitely have been
loving a little bit longer I'm going to
start off with my lip product cuz this
is a shade I'm just so excited about I
feel like I've had this in my collection
for a while and over the past few weeks
it was just the perfect time to pull it
out so it's the revlon matte balm in the
shade called fierce and i think this is
just the perfect fall shade you know
it's matte it's kind of spicy it's got
that brick reddish tone in it and it's
just so easy to apply these jumbo sticks
to me feel like velvety as I put them on
you know they're so comfortable I'm
touching them up is no big deal with the
matte liquid lipsticks that's kind of
where you run into an issue because you
might get like perfect application at
the start and then you eat a salad for
lunch or something and stuff starts
wearing down and it's like do I have to
go to some effort to fully remove
everything or do I add another coat on
top and really start to feel this big
time on my lips so this is just more
like a lipstick and I just love the
shade I know I've talked about elfs
matte lip color in praline a whole lot
and that is kind of similar to this only
I think this is a little more rusty it
has a little more red in it whereas that
one is a little more brownish but I just
love this color I love the feel the
texture you know but I just the shade is
so dead on right now for me the other
lip color that I've just kind of had on
me a lot that I've been wearing so much
is my flower beauty hydra silk I think
it's called Hydra silk lip butter in the
shade rose petal now I really like the
naked pedal shade in this line as well
it's more like your classic nude this
one as the name implies it's a little
more rosy it's definitely like a your
lips but better type shade so I've just
been reaching for this the whole heck of
a lot and I wore the
in my no makeup makeup look videos so
that's really like where this kind of
color falls for me it looks like
something that could naturally happen on
the lips but these have so much shine a
temple the face things that I want to
mention first off the tart shaped Cape
I'm pretty darn certain I mentioned this
in my last best in beauty video and it
just continues to roll right along as a
great favorite for me I loved traveling
with this recently because it was like
the only concealer I needed and somebody
noted in a recent video they're like oh
wow you can use that without like color
correcting you know dark under eyes or a
little bit of melasma that I have on the
outsides and I really don't have to
color correct with this that's the
really unique thing about it a lot of
liquidy you know doe foot applicator
concealers just do not do the job on
their own but this one does and I was
asked if I had a dupe for this I really
don't get this one has definitely
changed the game it's raised the bar I
think for a lot of concealers of this
kind and it's not just because it's such
good coverage but it's that it wears so
flawlessly throughout the day even if
you do set it with a little powder like
it still just looks so fresh on the
under eye area and I like the Kat Von D
Kat Von D's locket concealer I think is
good it definitely measures up in the
coverage department but on my skin I
feel like I notice it drying me out just
a bit more this like the freshness the
longevity is so so good and so unique so
I really do love that stuff and I wear
it in the shade light to medium and
another thing that I must mention is my
Too Faced primed and poreless skin
smoothing pressed powder I'm so
impressed and wowed by this powder I
mean I have a lot of loose powders that
I just I really like using but having
this pressed kind of translucent powder
here in the compact that really does do
something for my skin I feel like it
smoothes it out it mattifies really well
it just kind of perfects the skin but it
doesn't look powdery whatsoever I love
that about this product the top two
places where I love to use this are
under eye setting powder right after I
apply concealer or as a t-zone
setting powder after foundation or later
in the day as a touch-up it really can
handle like even being added on top of
your full face of makeup later in the
day and it doesn't look cakey so I love
it love it love it and the brush that I
often pick up to use with it is the elf
small tapered brush this is just great
for this area
you know just small parts of the face
where you need a little dab of some
powder it's awesome let's talk a couple
more brushes real quick I've got a
couple others that I've really fallen in
love with from Real Techniques and
they've been in my stash for quite some
time one is the contour brush I believe
this comes in the core collection set of
brushes so they have these kind of
golden a yellow handles and this little
brush these synthetic bristles make it
so nice for cream products and I've
really liked this for cream contour just
dipping pretty blues directly into
whatever cream contour I'm thinking I'm
gonna use and then just boom going right
to the cheekbone with it or right around
the hairline it's super soft it's you
know the bristles the cut of the
bristles is so super even nice and dense
you don't get a patchy looking
application and it can really put the
product on and then be soft enough and
dense enough to really blend it out well
so if you're looking for something to
apply cream contour this is really nice
they have something called the sculpting
brush that I've used for cream contour
as well very dense kind of cut in an
angle and I like this one too but for
whatever reason maybe just the smallness
the littler size of this one makes me
feel like I have a little more control
with it I guess
and because cream products are sometimes
tricky and it's hard to find just the
right brush to use another one that
really changed the game for real
techniques is this shading brush so
we're talking a small brush here you
know it's not super wide and then it's
very much pinched in right here but it's
just awesome to go over your shadow
sticks that you might be putting all
over the lid
either as a base or maybe you want to
wear them on their own and you want a
nice blended look up into the crease
this is so nice for kind of spreading
that product around and the act of
putting a brush over those products and
kind of using it to move that cream
product around a bit I
it picks up some excess and it allows
those products to wear better on my eyes
especially if you find yourself to get a
little heavy-handed with the shadow
sticks and you just throw them on you
put on way too much this is kind of like
your corrective step to go over that and
make sure there's not too much there
something that I have kept in my travel
makeup bag which by the way continues to
be my Sonia Kashuk weekender the best
bag for like carrying all of your makeup
stuff even if you like to travel with a
good bit of makeup like I do I mean that
takes my brushes that takes all of my
like bulkier palettes and things like
that it fits it all you should link
below to the video I did maybe a year or
so ago on that product loved that bag
and I like to keep a few like small
Basics in there like I'll keep a little
eye primer I'll keep a little face
primer a set of tweezers in there and
another thing that just lived in that
bag was this small size setting spray
it's the Urban Decay D slick and I'm
pretty sure the packaging is now
different but it's there oil control
makeup setting spray so they've got the
all nighter you know that's a very long
wearing much-loved makeup setting spray
but the D slick is specifically geared
toward the oily people out there and
just for its size you know that's what
was keeping it confined to that bag but
anytime I do go somewhere and use this I
always feel like it helps my makeup last
longer like it really locks it in heat
humidity walking around outside playing
outside whatever it really does make a
difference and sometimes was saying
sprays it's hard to know but I truly
feel like this makes a difference and
one thing I will say about this though I
think sometimes people have different
intentions with setting this sometimes
you put them on and you want to think
okay the main reason why I'm using this
is to take away the look of powder on
the skin and if that is your goal I mean
the hard candies Shiren 2nv hydrating
primer mist is one of the best for that
like I notice an immediate before and
after it's like instant radiance with
this type of stuff what I've noticed
what the D slick is that I didn't feel
like it hardly changed the appearance of
my skin at all if I had freshly applied
kind of matte makeup it didn't make me
unmet really whatsoever but at the same
time
feel like there was a difference in the
way my makeup lasted with this on top so
I don't know if you know you're going
into a sticky situation you are a really
oily person this may not be a bad thing
to check out okay on a very random note
here retro lip smackers I came up with a
four pack at Walgreens hold on let me
find the others I saw this four pack and
I could not turn it down look how even
the print on the outside is kind of a
throwback to old-school lip smackers
this is candy apple and this one might
be my favorite the cents on all of these
I'm going to talk about our strong candy
super super sweet maybe like my sweet
cravings they're just putting themselves
out there in the form of lip balm
preferences but yet this candy apple
smells so strong and Apple eat it even
does leave a little bit of a pinkish
tint on my lips look at the sour apple
like retro style packaging on that one
also in the set
you've got the sour orange and even a
red licorice which is just fantastic for
my Twizzlers fans out there so it was
just a four pack and it was on the end
of an aisle and they had various
different groupings of lip smacker
combos but this retro one just really
made me think I've got to try that and I
really love these sheet masks had been
my jam completely over the past month
I've used them so much and I have kept
all of their little pouches so I would
remember like to talk about them and
kind of remember which ones I liked and
which ones not so much but the standout
for sure has been a very affordable one
and this is like a $1.99 or $2 facemask
and it's the Miss spa hydrate version
and I got this at Walmart I think i
snapchatted about these I found them in
the spa type area like along with the
body washes and the shower puffs and
things like that not near the skin care
but this particular mask and I tried the
brightening one as well this hydrate one
is really really impressive
it is so skin softening it's baby's butt
type smoothness when you get done using
this it is a sheet mask you leave it on
for 20 minutes for whatever reasons
certain
sheet masks that I've tried had been
kind of stinging on my skin like it has
not been as pleasant soothing experience
this one's very soothing really feels
nice kind of cooling leave it on for 20
minutes take it off you've got all this
kind of serum type stuff that's been
sitting on your skin and you just kind
of continue to let that soak in I rub it
in around my face and down my neck and
wherever I want to put the extra about
this left my skin feeling so like
plumped up kind of hydrated and
extremely extremely soft so I see this
is being a good step like if you had a
big event coming up and you wanted to
give your skin just a really nice
treatment before you bust it into the
makeup this could be nice to use then or
I mean I just use it at nighttime that's
generally my masking time is I take a
shower and I'll grab a mess and this is
free of paraben fragrance and artificial
dyes so for just a couple bucks it's a
nice little treat for your skin so I
would highly recommend the hydrate one
another skincare thing that I thought I
would go ahead and mention this month
because I've been using this for gosh
I'm trying to remember when I last ran
out of my Bioderma and it's probably
been a good three or four months that
I've been using this and it is my
Garnier skin active micellar cleansing
water and so this is a makeup removing
type product but I use it in the morning
so I haven't been washing my face at the
sink like when I first wake up anymore
I've been sitting down here and just
getting some of this on a cotton pad and
going over my skin and I feel like it
gives me that nice fresh start you know
for my makeup but it never makes my skin
feel totally dried out or tight if there
might be a hint of residue like around
my eye area or something like that this
will pick that up it says all skin types
even sensitive skin and there is no oil
alcohol or fragrance in this product
either so I've been using it for a long
time I've only put I think I don't know
a quarter of a dent in this maybe a
third of a dent in the bottle for the
most part outside of just a few
renegades it's here and there my skin
has been really good so I think it
definitely has replaced you know
splashing my face at the sink every
morning and still manage to keep my skin
really nice and clean so I love that and
those are my favorites this month I'm
looking over here I've moved on to the
fall mugs that I've got my squirrel or
my chipmunk mug I've got my nice leaf
mug here I have a nice little fall
collection for some reason this time of
year just calls for cute coffee mugs so
anyway thank you guys for spending a
little time with me today
I love you guys I so appreciate your
kindness toward me I throw that right
back at you thank you for watching I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
