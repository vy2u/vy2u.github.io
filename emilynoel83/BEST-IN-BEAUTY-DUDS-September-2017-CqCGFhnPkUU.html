beauty time oh no I forgot to light my
candle back there
when I say lighted I mean turn it on
that's better now I may not know what
I'm doing with all my lighting in front
of me but at least I got a flameless
candle back there the month kind of got
away from me here in terms of the best
in beauty video because I'd been setting
aside some things that I wanted to
mention and then lo and behold her into
early October and I'm like oh yeah I
need to shoot that thing I'm so
inundated with you know wanting to
review the new holiday stuff anyway I
got some good pics to share I've also
got a few dud type products that I've
discovered over the past month one of
the things that I want to tell you about
is this little guy this is called an
invisible and these have been out for a
while I've had mine for a while I think
it was a was it a 2 pack or a 3 pack
I'll answer my own question in the
caption later but I got him from Sephora
and I actually had mine around the time
that I cut my hair really short so I
didn't get use out of him for a while
but now I am and I'm realizing just how
great these are they're a really good
thing for people like me who have fine
like really slick hair like with my hair
I feel like I've got to wrap an elastic
band around it a lot to get it to stay
and even then you know it loosens up
hair comes out and this is so much more
secure and I feel like the ponytail is
perkier I don't know what it is I think
it's because when you get it wrapped
around your hair kind of comes up
through these little like a separations
in the coil and yeah it just looks
better and my hair stays like in the
same spot all day and ponytails
buns are important to me right now
because eve grabs hair like it's her job
especially while I'm nursing like she
will grab for anything even if there are
a few hairs left out like she will make
it her purpose in life to go after those
few hairs and grab and pull it's painful
and you think maybe I'll go for the
shorter haircut because I have kids and
I don't have time and whatnot but you
know what they will go after any length
of hair so I find myself going for buns
and ponytails and all that and the
invisible is really good and also when
you take it out like let's say you've
had this wrapped two or three times
around your hair and you take it out and
it's looking like big and stretchy just
like lay it on your counter and go look
at it in a couple hours and it does go
back to almost
the size that it was when you bought it
so it's not like it's getting all
stretched out and that's another thing
with traditional like hair bands a
little those little hair ties of the
ribbon II kind of ones that I use a lot
they stretch out pretty quickly so I'm a
fan of the invisible they come in
different colors like I've obviously got
the brown but I think they have blonde
ones and maybe just some different
colors clear ones haven't a thing to
consider next time you're placing a
Sephora order another thing that I have
big-time been loving this month are
these infallible Pro matte glosses matte
gloss just sounds silly but that kind of
is what it is it is like a gloss kind of
consistency only a little bit thicker a
little bit drier but it doesn't feel
drying it all on the lips they're super
opaque the colors are great that I have
I wanted to get more like a head
statement nude first absolutely loved it
went back and so many of the tubes had
been opened up and people are so like
freaking just shameless about it it's
like you see goups all over the side and
it's highly obvious which ones people
have messed with like why are you
getting so messy it's like hey you're
breaking into the product in a store
which is a problem but B you're making a
huge mess about it and I was in Target
I'm looking around and I'm like I'll
take nearly any of these I love the
formulas so much I'll take any shade I
did a video on that topic products you
want in every shade this would be one of
those but nude allure was the one I
ended up with and it's really like a
pretty kind of warm rosy shade also
watch both of these on my hand and the
applicator is that sort of pointed doe
foot that L'Oreal puts in a lot of their
products that are like this so that is
nice for precision because these are
very pigmented but both of these I think
are super duper wearable their statement
nude which is a nice deep rich kind of
brownish nude and there's nude allure
which like I said rosy color nude allure
has been in my purse since I bought it
just because it's so handy it seems to
look good paired with most looks that I
do and today I'm actually wearing
statement nude mixed with Charlotte
Tilbury glastonbury lipstick oh that is
this gorgeous really deep rich berry and
then because I just love the feel of
this so much I have put a light amount
of that all over the
of it I think it's just really pretty
that way but yeah Pro matte glosses they
aren't shiny but they are maybe closer
to a gloss consistency than a liquid
lipstick you know like a dry and crusty
liquid lipstick they just feel fantastic
and super colorful you know the colors
are very opaque but worth checking out
if I were to have named these myself I
call them like a matte lipcream or
something like that a couple of things
from the Too Faced peach collection that
I've been using with a lot of
consistency are the primed and peachy
the cooling matte skin perfecting primer
just been reaching for this with darn
near any foundation that I put on and I
do love this I'm loving it more the more
I use it and I gave this a pretty
favorable review in my peach video but I
just I love the consistency it's very
light and seems kind of whipped almost
when you put it on but it is indeed
cooling smells really good and very
smoothing on the skin just like a good
clean slate
I think foundations go on more evenly
because this is sort of smoothing out
the texture of my skin a little bit on
top of whatever moisturizer I'm using so
this works under my Burt's Bees which is
a little more glowy Foundation works
under some matte foundations one that
I'll be mentioning here in a second so
really enjoying that also I'm always
using this stuff this peach perfect I
swear since I got this I've been using
this I use it on the under eye I kind of
dust it all over my face really lightly
it is the mattifying loose setting
powder infused with peach and sweet fig
cream and it's very fine the way it's
set up there's a little like stopper
here which I love that that's there so
it's not spilling out all the time but
when you pour a little bit of this into
the cap which is what I like to do to
sort of rash and some out as you're
using it it literally like pours almost
like liquid out of this the powder is so
so fine it's kind of brightening but not
in a shimmery way just it's by the
nature of the color tone that it is now
I feel like I'm tasting it but I like
that so much I've been using it tons
have you even more info on those
products by the way an application of
those in my peach video that I've done
also full video on these products as
well but my argon skin care which is
what I've been using at night
these days I have never woken up with
better skin than I have with using these
at night I've never sat down to my
makeup area being so pumped about the
way my skin looks before ever putting
makeup on it's great and it's not just a
look thing but it's the feel of it the
softness is so good so I use the pure
argon milk I go a little heavier with
this and then this has been at least the
formula that's worked for my skin and
then just a few light dabs of the actual
pure argan oil like on the under eye
area and anywhere where I feel like I've
got some wrinkles going on fine lines
whatever you want to call them I work
that into my skin and it really has been
fantastic so full review on those if
you're interested but I have been loving
them I'm still using them and I don't
see myself turning back from those
anytime soon let's talk about just an
overall look that I've liked for the
month it's kind of matte with a soft
glow you can use a lot of different
foundations for this because it's sort
of a matter of what you do on top the
kinds of powders you set it with like
the peach powder is really good on top
of even more dewy foundations it just
gives this really soft even look but I
have discovered this month a foundation
I thought you might want to know about
that I would totally put into my full
coverage category there's a very short
list of foundations that I call actual
full coverage let's go through them
shall we we've got the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum cover the Urban
Decay all nighter I would say the
L'Oreal infallible total cover but a
little asterisk by that you've got to be
kind of careful with that blending
because that can look sort of thick but
one that easily just works its way onto
that list is this even-steven whip
foundation from the balm I've not heard
anyone talking about this but this is
fantastic the container is tiny okay and
there's Stephen by the way looking
preppy as all get-out I've first got
this I thought this is tiny like what's
going on here did I get a sample or
something it's 0.45 fluid ounces but
then I started putting it on and I'm
like okay I guess I kind of see what's
going on here that's like potent
coverage but it is this sort of light
whipped texture I don't get it it looks
really good on the skin and it manages
to cover so well like I've got that on
too
it gives me this beautiful matte look
that I'd say a little more coverage than
the two-faced peach foundation although
I love that one too that gives a
beautiful look on the skin that one
gives maybe just the tiniest bit more
luminosity to the skin and this is just
very like flat-out matte both seem to
have good staying power for me though so
I wanted to mention that if you were
possibly interested and then I've been
using this a bunch and this is the new
hourglass ambient lighting edit three
like this and this have kind of created
my look that I'm loving which is soft
matte foundation and then you kind of
layer on a little bit of glow that's
never too much you know and I love the
bronzer that's in here I got the one
that was like the marble II packaging
that I guess came out last year last
holiday season yeah I was using right
after F was born literally in the
hospital I had that one with me but I
liked this bronzer more because it shows
up so much better on my skin love the
two blushes these are gorgeous I'm
wearing both of them today this is the
highlight and the center up here which
is really beautiful if you like
barely-there glow like that's what's on
the top of my cheeks and I think it's
perfect and then in terms of the ambient
lighting finishing powders you have
diffused light over here and dim light
and when hourglass first started putting
out all these powders like that was the
first kind that they did were the
finishing powders before the blushes and
the bronzers and everything came along
and there was a while where I felt like
I wasn't really getting the point of
those powders like especially
differentiating between different ones
but here in the context of this palette
I totally get it like I can see how I
can layer dim light over the deeper
blush and it's a beautiful like softened
effect like I kind of see what they mean
by that this blends and softens
everything this I would even use like
kind of lightly on my under eye and it's
a little bit brightening but not
glittery you know I'm just kind of drawn
to these multitasking palettes and I
think these are really nice quality
pigmented powders but very wearable on
an every single day basis there's a new
line of products in my Walmart store
that I found it was right next to the
new Burt's Bees display and it's called
found and I've been trying a few
different things from that line and I
haven't had a ton of success I'll go
ahead and start by saying the thing that
I did really like is this baked
looming blush and Rose glow very very
pretty color here you might at a glance
actually think that it's similar to the
deep color in this hourglass palette the
deeper blush right there
I mean don't they look like they could
be dupes at a glance but the one in the
hourglass is more like reddish rosy and
this one ends up having more of a pinky
bear eNOS on the cheeks but it's very
glowy as the kind of blush that I would
wear and maybe not even highlight my
skin and just let the blush be the glowy
thing but this is soft like ultra soft
and pigmented not one of those dry baked
powders so I really like that a lot and
I would most definitely look into other
colors that they're making in those but
the other three things that I've dried
from this line I've been kind of let
down on one of them this BB cream it
says for added moisture and sheer
coverage well yes it is sheer coverage
and I would just like a little bit more
it says 98% natural which would be the
advantage here and it does have
blackberry extract I have it I guess I
just stuck the sticker back on here
shade 20 it's just okay but I find it to
be really really sheer maybe you want
like a BB cream on the sheerest end of
the spectrum that's kind of what this is
like it's not as much coverage as the
Rimmel BB cream which I love the one
with the blue cap I just want a little
more even if it is just a tinted
moisturizer or BB cream whatever I want
a little more coverage out of it I don't
want to just put it on and think hmm it
doesn't look like I've put anything on
another product that was maybe even more
problematic I guess than that is this
found full coverage concealer I have it
in light it's a concealer stick and it
does have a lot of coverage but it's way
way too dry I mean it's reminding me of
kind of old school stick concealers that
tug across the skin it might work on a
blemish here there but you got to ask
yourself where am i eating the full
coverage concealer for me I'm wanting
full coverage concealer right up in here
you know cover up the dark circles and
it's too dry for that like if you've got
any amount of fine line Ã¤j--
you're gonna feel like oh gosh I look
even older now with this concealer on
and then they've got these tinted lip
balms hydrating tinted balms and I'm a
sucker for a tinted lip balm I got the
one in honey kissed warm soft pinky
brown type
teller and I like the product itself but
when you've got the stick like this and
you put it on and it's a little too soft
look how it tips around and then the
edge comes in contact with the side and
it starts pressing up against it and you
start getting at first a rim but that
will start to break down over time as
you continue using it and it keeps
getting looser with how it's planted
there in the stick its duopoly and it's
still formula wise I don't even like it
as well as my Neutrogena tinted lip
balms so I'll stay in that place they've
got the better packaging design the
better formula and product overall but
this was this was okay like I was on the
verge of liking it but I just can't get
on board with the packaging I just want
to go like this with my hair after every
time I haven't done a darn thing to it
so maybe I shouldn't expect my hair to
to do anything for me it just aired
right out of the shower but I'm going
through still like that postpartum hair
loss like feeling like my hair is
already fine and flat to begin with and
on top of that you're losing some hair
and then on top of that you don't have
any time to do anything with it in the
morning so that's where I'm at can I
make just a small very minut gripe about
this NYX matte liquid liner I love a
matte liquid liner I love my Jordana
color Envy liquid liner and I was kind
of hoping that because these are almost
the exact same packaging that this would
just be you know a more accessible
option compared to the Jordana but
here's what this does this has a little
flat brush it's tiny you know it's not
super wide but it's flat instead of just
coming to a little point it's like
there's a little side to this brush look
the here's where I'm holding it sideways
and then I turn it and you see what I
mean it's wider on one side and I don't
like that because then that in some
places gives me wider liner than I want
can I just have what Jordana makes you
know just one one small tip where
everything kind of forms together and
that's what you've got to work with it's
not a huge deal I'll keep like seeking
out my Jordana color envy online because
it's impeccable staying power on top of
everything but I just love the way it
goes on I'm gonna mention one last thing
here and this isn't like a favorite so
much because I've only more I think this
is my third time wearing it but I just
wanted like a show of hands how many
people are
actually knew that this was a thing this
to face chocolate chip it's a little
mini Matt chocolate bar palette here's
what the box said I got this on Ulta and
I don't know if this was out for like a
hot minute sold out somewhere and then
never to be seen again but I bought this
like within the last three weeks or so
on Ulta it says we transformed eleven of
your favorite shades from the
best-selling chocolate bar shadow
collection into modern buttery matte
finishes okay this is what it looks like
see there are chocolate bar shades here
that I know we're shimmery in that
palette and now they are matte here and
it does smell chocolatey still and I've
got it on my eyes today just for like a
standard sort of brown neutral look I'm
wearing like all four of these and that
shade and a little bit of the pinky
shade on my lid I love the size it's
adorable my child would probably
actually pick this up and think it was a
true chocolate but what's going on with
that I get the sense that maybe this was
out before like when they put out the
white chocolate one which I do have the
the white chocolate palette you know the
small like this but that had some
shimmery like lighter shades but I love
Too Faced matte eyeshadows so it's like
oh my gosh it's a little chocolate bar
by the way I hear you guys who are
asking for a video on the original
chocolate bar palette that's gonna
happen but for this video I'm done I'm
gonna step away from the camera now
