joining me today I am a little under the
weather right now our entire house is
actually sick Belle came down with a
cold summer colds just really freaking
blow no pun intended Eve's got it too
I've got it and just last night bubs
like I think I feel a little tickle in
my throat and last night fortunately
like the sleep was a whole lot better
because I think what happens with colds
at least with kids it seems like the
first night that they're coming down
with it it's like awful I was up the
night before so many times a little bit
thief by the way I say her nickname
without even thinking and then like
Belle was coughing and stuff too it was
just bad but then by night too
they've exhausted themselves so much
from it they actually sleep really well
so that's what happened and I slept
really well because I was very tired too
so and this is the chance anyway this
morning that I have to shoot my July
favorites and I tried to I look at this
stuff and I was like then it's kind of
still a lot of stuff but I tried to
really be very selective with the things
I'm mentioning here there's so many
different videos that I do that give a
different kind of recommendation here or
there you know and so I want to make
sure that my best in beauty is really
like the best of the best
like let's get picky so I do feel that's
really what I'm sharing with you today
and I also may share a couple of duds
like one thing I really don't like and
the other thing I'll just save it for
that segment of the video I just I've
got a little bone to pick with a certain
brands that can I mention how much I
love these little H&amp;amp;M cardigans they're
kind of a little bit longer there's this
notch on the side and I have them in
three colors I think there were only
like 12 bucks or something I have the
like light kind of peachy pink shade a
hot pink and then this gray as well and
I just they're so comfy like there's
some give to them you know there's a
little stretch I don't feel like slouchy
and sloppy in them and if you're wearing
you know nursing tanks for I just like
live in tank tops a lot during the
summer but when you go out or when
you're shooting a video you know maybe
now and then you want to cover up a
little bit this is so so nice and like
breathable and good so it gave for that
I'm going to jump into a makeup thing
that is rediscovered in Michael
election that I really really like and
it's like when I first came across this
item I wasn't so nuts over it in fact I
did like a review on my beauty broadcast
Express channel and I wasn't so like
over the moon for it at that time and I
think maybe it was just the sheer amount
of contouring palettes that were coming
out at a certain time you guys know this
one for me just didn't stand out as much
and I don't know that it really did for
tons of other people as well I just
don't hear it talked about that much but
I just randomly kind of would go through
my drawers and decided to come back to
it and I'm really really loving it
because it's serving a lot of different
functions for me and it's the lorac pro
contour palette this is really excellent
quality stuff in here I'm loving it and
I'm using almost everything in here I
would say the couple things that I don't
dip into as much would be like the
yellow highlight shade and usually I'm
not using much of the deep contour but
the beige highlight has become like kind
of a face powder really this is my new
face powder I'm just using certain ones
in certain places right so I've got the
beige highlight shade which is matte
it's really creamy and nice and I'll put
that you know under the eye area center
of my face this medium contour shade
feels kind of like bronzer to me like I
got that around the hairline a little
bit here you know chisel it out the
cheekbone sometimes I just do the light
contour there like I can use either one
and then I never gave this shimmer
highlight quite enough credits giving a
gorgeous glow as well these are really
soft pigmented shades you know if you
are familiar with lorac texture in their
eyeshadows it's kind of like that pulled
into a face palette and do that amount
of pigmentation this could maybe seem
like a lot to some people but I look at
my skin and it looks really fresh I
don't feel like it appears to be caked
up with makeup
it just it's working really well for me
right now and it's one of those things I
was glad I kept it ooh a mess nice my
lashes still attached it's just one of
those things that I look back on and I
think I'm glad I held on to it even when
it wasn't such a fixture in my
collection you know because I've gone
back to it now and I enjoy it more than
I ever did when I first got it no I'm
just seeing this is such like a face
powder replacement I'm not wearing any
other
odors on my skin you know except for
blush other than these things and so I
really like that ability to do that and
a brush that I think is making my
contour a little bit better or maybe
just easier is the Sigma soft angled
contour the f23
another rediscovered thing this has been
in my collection for at least a year
just kind of sitting there looking
pretty in my brush storage thingy and
I've been using like their small
contour brush you've probably seen me
pull for this a lot and one day I just
like you know I'm going to go for this
thing and this really is quick and very
easy for kind of getting there under the
cheekbones and I really like taking it
around the hairline as well because
there's a lot of kind of mobility in
these bristles I can use my ELF
complexion brush as well for these steps
but this does do the cheek contour
better than that it kind of concentrates
the product in there just a little bit
better just a really good shape and size
impeccable softness as well with this
brush but is it chunky Wilson you know
so I really like that another makeup
item that I've just been finding to be
super useful and practical has been my
Smashbox photo finish primer with the
SPF 20 in it because now and then I've
been reaching for different moisturizers
that may or may not contain the SPF and
so I feel like I'm getting that extra
level of treatment when it's in here
because sometimes my foundations don't
have it in there either on top of that I
feel like this is a nice like smoothing
primer it doesn't feel exactly like
regular photo finish to me it almost
feels just a little more a little bit
more on the moisturizing side and just
step down slightly in the silkiness but
it still does have kind of a silky
smooth thing happening there so I like
what it does just for the texture of the
skin but then the added SPF it's just
nice to have that little backup there
let's talk nighttime skincare for a
second because these milk sticks have
been huge I love these so much I kind of
gave these a little mention when I was
talking about the cooling water stick
and by the way the dupe for the cooling
water stick is most definitely the hard
candy sheer envy coconut water primer
stick this is so good I love right on
that under the eye area when I'm first
starting my makeup like before I throw
that other primer on like this goes
under the eyes and it feels so good but
it
time I've got the matcha toner from milk
and I've also got the hydrating oil
stick and toner toner is one of those
things like do I need a toner I am
really been using much toner but okay
I'm going to throw this on it feels kind
of cooling and refreshing on the skin
and I just kind of grazed that all over
the skin it's like it's got a nice slip
to it just a really nice smoothness I
just put it on all over and kind of pat
pat pat it in and then this hydrating
oil stick here's the weird thing about
me for a second well one weird thing I
could go on but we're just going to talk
one weird thing here normally what I
have new makeup I overuse the product
like I'll get a new foundation and my
instinct will be to use too much of it
and then with skincare oddly enough my
instinct is usually to use not enough
I'll come back to a moisturizer or maybe
it's like a scrub or a mask or something
and I'll be like oh I just needed to use
a little bit more of that product now
I'm seeing the effects and that was
totally my experience with the hydrating
oil yes this is just a clear oil stick
like you can look right through it it is
clear and at first I was doing like
basically one pass over my skin where I
felt like I had it everywhere and I kind
of blended it in and using it that way
like I remember thinking I'm kind of ho
home on this product you know it's yes
moisturizing enough I wake up in the
morning I feel like it's totally like
gone I don't know I wasn't profoundly
like appreciating this product and then
I thought I'm just going to use some
more so I like layered it on to where I
looked like I was dewy and glowing after
I used it I would say maybe like double
the product is what I use like one pass
over the skin and another pass over
particularly in like the under eye area
around here any places where I know I'm
really dry I really laid it on thick and
then I really would seeing something and
I was surprised that it wasn't like
breaking me out or you know that amount
of product use wasn't having some kind
of adverse effect in some line but it
was doing really well and I feel like
when I wake up in the morning to do my
makeup I'm starting with better skin so
like the matcha toner it's really nice
but I think I would probably give the
most credit of the two things if you
were just going to get one I would say
the hydrating oil is pretty dang awesome
don't be afraid put it on heavily I mean
I've only
given this product like one little twist
up and I have been using these two
things for well over a month now I feel
like it what I had these for such a long
time but they're working really well and
also that the card candy stick you know
the cooling water is great for milk but
this is pretty much just like it couple
other things here that aren't really
especially makeup related but this a V
no baby continuous protection sensitive
skin lotion and this is a sunscreen with
SPF 50 and this is really really good
bail has been outside a lot of summer a
lot of pool time largest outdoor play
time she has not had a sunburn yet and I
really credit this stuff i slather this
all over her and she has not had any
sensitivity to it you know I get it all
over her face everywhere no problems in
that way and no burning and also Eve -
and she's probably got the most you know
sensitive young little six-month-old
baby skin just kept her from burning
like when we were down in Florida on
vacation I wasn't worried it says sweat
and a lot of resistant for 80 minutes
and I think it's certainly proven itself
in that way and I'll put it on my face -
that's the other good point anyone who
deals with melasma knows this like Sun
is kind of your enemy because if you
have skin that's prone to getting the
melasma for me hormones the hormones of
pregnancy really bring that on in me I'm
not pregnant now that is saying like
what I was that would really come out in
my skin but also the Sun will bring it
out kind of regardless and that's this
kind of dark discoloration I get it here
some people get it like it's really
common on the upper lip area so you need
a really really good sunscreen if you're
going to be out in the Sun and this is
what I'll put on my face and then I'll
just like spray that super group stuff
that I got from the Nordstrom sale put
that all over my body but this is a
really good sunscreen you can count on
and I'm saying in this video because
even if you don't have kids and maybe
you are extra sensitive you're just
looking for something that it has proven
itself it really does work this stuff is
good and then I got a shower thing this
dove deep moisture shower foam this is
the best like foamy shower product I've
used it's foamy but it's still kind of
nourishing and even though I'm all
stuffed up I can still kind of smell
what this smells like it's that dove
scent it's kind of like dove soap but a
little
like added freshness mixed in it's
really good and I put it on all over
it's just like such a quick process a
really quick rinse sometimes you know
you have to just take a quick shower
like it just needs to be fast and this
is the quickest way to do it but it's
also not drying at all it actually feels
like it's giving some moisture back so
yay for that I've enjoyed it I got mine
from Walgreens and I've seen it other
places too now let's talk about what I'm
not really liking so much or sauce a dud
for me is the Too Faced melted latex
liquefied high shine lipstick and this
is a hair grabber you know you walk
outside with the slides been a breeze
and it's pulling stuff in it's pulling
in God knows what else honestly like
it's sticky it's uncomfortable I just
don't have the patience for it as a mom
you have no choice but to have to have
like patience for so many things in life
but lip gloss doesn't have to be one of
those like life's too short for
uncomfortable lip gloss just get
something that feels good get something
that feels like lip ball there about
like eight zillion comfortable lip
products out there this you know well
it's going to be beautiful color and
it's opaque and the color really shows
and it's shiny that's nice but the
thickness and the stickiness is a real
problem for me I know what I have to
think about the lip product non-stop I
want it to feel good and I'm picky about
that so that's what's coming through in
this little feedback here I like the two
face regular melted stuff I even like a
couple of their melted metallic shades
but this is melted latex like that
doesn't even sound appealing to me to
say that we melted latex my other
problem here is this Milani color
harmony in bronze burst I have no no
problem really with the product itself
it's good it's kind of a combination
blush and it's got a gold any kind of
highlight there it looks pretty on my
skin like if I were to swatch this blush
type area and then there's a highlight
separately it's kind of this pretty
rusty type shade and it looks nice on
the skin it's pigmented enough but do
you know what I spent on this at
Walgreens $12.99 like who are you Milani
I remember back in the day when they
were putting out the sunset duo's you
know those were kind of like a glowy
thing a little
blush and I'm about positive I wouldn't
have spent more than seven or eight
dollars on one of those for like you
know little mosaic powders and different
things that they've had out over the
years they were about half the price and
now I look at this and I'm thinking you
know I love you Milani I love this brand
in the drugstore but it's like what are
you turning into this is nice but it's
not like transcendent I don't know it
frustrates me I want my own Milani bag I
love the old Milani prices not they
price like their entire line in
ridiculous ways but this was a new thing
it was out in a new display I thought I
don't know that I like the direction
this is going and I didn't even realize
it until after I bought it I glanced at
the receipt and I was like wait no that
wasn't $12.99 was it really I checked
the website and yes indeed this is a
$12.99 product and I don't think it's
really worth it rant over I'm stuffy my
makeups hanging in there though I'm
wearing my Urban Decay all nighter
foundation have kind of come back to
that a few days here recently and that
will hold up to some nose wipe and
monent yeah and because apparently I
just want to keep this video rolling and
don't want to stop talking on my lips I
have three different products I don't
have the patience for one sticky product
but I will put on three comfortable ones
and drop one I got the new honest Asya
palette the subculture palette done one
look with that so far it was a success I
must say thus far but I've got this
Anastacio a matte lipstick and rum punch
that I bought at the same time it's like
a deep rosy color with some warmth to it
so it's kind of this nice like late
summer a little bit of richness in the
shade just feel it I really like that
I've wanted a bit more shine and
honestly some more moisture because my
lips are really really dry so in the
center of my lip I layered on the Revlon
Ultra HD I actually just put this on and
left a little gap for the Revlon the
Ultra HD in HD sand this is the perfect
like nude color from this line and then
I've got this L'Oreal infallible paints
metallics in the shade moon list if
you're into this kind of lip topper idea
you know where you put something kind of
glowy there in the center this is that
kind of shade for me I feel like I'm
going to use this so much and it's not
quite as like golden E and
right as the GA skinny-dip see it's got
a little more rosiness to it but it's
still very metallic and I see myself
reaching for this a heck of a lot
because I do love this formula it's even
less sticky than the issue a and I see
it working on top of so many lip colors
where I just want that little bit of
shine but not all the sticky not all the
you know thick gloss sorry that was my
phone so I think looking around here
that's all I have if this turns out to
be a super long video I apologize thank
you for taking time to watch if you're
still with me or at the end thank you so
much I appreciate you I'm so glad you
enjoy the videos that I make and I will
see you very soon my eyes are watering
because the sneeze is going it's bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
