actually with my hair today so that's
that I'm not entirely sure how I feel
about it's like I got ends going every
which direction I'm just not used to
seeing my hair this way but I think I
like it so anyway we'll move on to the
favourites and in this video it's really
like I've got the beauty stuff to talk
about but also some sort of Christmassy
things some random really cheap really
good finds that I had from Dollar Tree
and I thought I might just lump them
into this video to show you how I
integrated those into my decors like I
said in the last video I was inspired
when I saw lip gloss Leslie go out and
buy a bunch of cool stuff from Dollar
Tree so that's what I did too but for
the makeup first okay this little thing
look how old-school this looks this I
mean it does a product look much more
old-school than that it's the bramble
berry rose lip balm from rosebud perfume
companies I believe this is the same
brand that makes like the rosebud salve
that's maybe a little more well-known
and popular but this scent is really
fantastic and I don't know how I ever
liked it you just kind of got back in a
drawer and I wasn't reaching for it for
a while but I always liked putting some
kind of balm on my lips well like I'm
applying my moisturizer and something
can sit on there while I'm applying most
of my makeup and then by the time I get
to lips everything's nicely hydrated
right well this scent mmm I can't even
explain it's like a little bit berry a
little bit rose a little bit bramble
whatever that is I feel like some sense
do hit me a little bit differently these
days in pregnancy I think when I land on
something I really like I absolutely
love it and plus it looks like something
that you just plucked off your
great-grandma's vanity so there you go
traveled recently for Thanksgiving and I
don't know about you guys but when you
take makeup with you somewhere obviously
you're not taking like your entire
collection certain things are getting
hand-picked to go with you on a trip and
do you ever feel like you really get a
chance to officially bond with a product
when you travel with it you know it's
like you didn't have all the options in
the world so that was the thing you were
kind of
you sing and so for me I definitely took
my it cosmetics most wished for palette
and I know I have mentioned this in a
couple of other videos so I don't I
don't like feeling like I spent a long
time talking at length about stuff in a
favorites video when I know I've
mentioned it quite a bit in other videos
like I don't want to just bore you to
tears with the same exact topics at the
same time I got to remind myself not
everybody watches every video you should
but you don't no just kidding
but don't really watch every video this
is my pick gods medics most wish for
palette I'm in a strange mood today so
let's just keep it going but there are
certain elements of this palette that I
feel like I really got a ton of use out
of just really exceptionally enjoyed so
I want to point those out for you number
one this highlight the powder highlight
in particular I do like layering the
powder in the cream but this powder
highlight I feel like it's so soft and
beautiful and it's surprising it can
sneak up on you like when you go back
for like a swipe number two you've done
your first application you go back for a
little bit more and then you add it's
like wow that built up quite a bit so I
love that highlight I've also been
absolutely head over heels for the
blushes fantastic blushes in this
palette I'm wearing a combination of
these two today this peachy one has a
little bit of shimmer these other two
are matte one is kind of pink and one is
a bit more plummy
and this is probably the one I've
overall worn the most so today I wanted
to combine the other two but I love them
all there's also lip stuff in that door
as well but then the other superstar
standout while I was traveling I'm
wearing this again today this eye shadow
right here this is so so beautiful I got
to give you like a legit swatch of this
so you can take it all in how's that for
some metallic lilac taupe action going
on there this is such a good like one
shadow look I'm wearing it today all
over the lid buffed up into the crease
smudged on my lower lash line the only
additional shadow I'm wearing today is a
little of the black just because I
smudged that on the outer part of the
lower lash line too but otherwise like
this shadow is the star of the show and
I think it's so so pretty there are many
pretty shadows in this palette you know
there's warmer colors there's nice mats
and everything but I found that more
than a few times when I just wanted a
quick look that shade is a really easy
go-to because it can coordinate so well
with like whatever your lip might be
it's got kind of a pretty shine to it
it's a little bit different than just
some of your standard neutrals so anyway
just wanted to point out the studs of
this palette try to give a mention to
like my most used foundations and
concealers as of late I've been working
and I feel like quite a few foundations
but the couple that I have been enjoying
the most the Fiona Styles luminous
finish foundation concentrate and zero
for you can see that in action in my
last get ready with me I use this I just
love the finish I love the lightweight
feel but yet it covers an unexpected
amount of coverage so I've been enjoying
that getting a lot of use out of it and
then my dad dream matte mousse which is
one of those products upset before it's
like that's a product of the olden days
something we may have reached for like
in high school and I swear the formula
is creamier now than it was this still
super mousse like and everything but I
just like dabbing that around my skin
and then the Beauty Blender that's maybe
one of the biggest game changers is to
blend this stuff out with the Beauty
Blender and it looks so smooth and so
nice so just depending on how I feel on
a given day I'll bounce back between you
know a liquid and maybe that dream matte
mousse and then the concealer the
Anastacio concealer I'm telling you guys
if you are a dry skin person a normal
skin person even or if you would even
classify yourself as like a combo skin
person but you feel like you've got
concerns about the under eyes starting
to get really dry on you these days this
would be a nice concealer to work with I
like the way benefit erase paste has so
much richness to the texture and I know
I've talked about this like zillions of
times so I'm not gonna harp on it
anymore but this has such nice coverage
it offers so much moisture back to the
skin 2.5 is still working for me
although I keep saying I'm gonna get a
lighter shade but as long as this works
I'm gonna keep using it but it is
coverage it is consistency and it is
like leaving you with a very I think
fresh look to an area that can sometimes
look very creepy and dry drugstore lip
finds I have just been really enjoying
these Revlon Ultra HD newly repackaged
lipsticks they're like the skinny
lipsticks and I've got two I've got this
one I'm holding here called HD desert
I've also got HD vineyard which is a
little bit more of a soft berry color
and I love the shine I love the feel
there's quite a strong like sort of
tropical cocktail type scent that I
always pick up on when I use these but I
really enjoy them I think in the hall
where I talked about these I referred to
these as the second coming of lip
butters because now lip butters have
kind of been wiped off of Revlon's lip
map for whatever reason and I think
these are sort of replacing that
consistency you know very bone like but
still offering quite a bit of color and
they do have a nice shade range and what
was so funny is the other day I was
using this little product very similar
format from flower Beauty this is one of
their Hydra silks and this particular
shade in a rose silk has always been you
know kind of an easy go to this product
is frequently in the rotation it's in
the purse rotation it's just out there a
lot for me and I was using it the other
day and I like I just love this color so
much and then I'm like wait isn't this
darn near identical to the HD desert
from Revlon and they do have such a
similar finish similar feel these two
tones happen to be like almost dupes for
one another in fact if you're just
curious I'll swatch them both side by
side here for you okay that's the Revlon
that's the flower beauty I do feel like
in general the flower ones give off like
a little more shine but they do have a
really similar field but don't you just
want to kick yourself like this happens
to you guys right where you're like oh I
love this shade I love this shade you
actually start looking at them and
you're like they're the same shade
there's a reason you know what I love
them both but I would say overall
Revlon's line the HD the ultra HDS
there's a better shade selection
happening overall there there's more to
choose from but I just thought I'd share
that because I love both of those
products I think they have a great
formula in each but those two
happen to be like the same exact color
this is the wild hair it's actually a
wild little chunk of hairs a tuft if you
will just kind of poking out I'm just
gonna let it do what at once scent i am
loving is from clean and it's part of
that little fragrance sampler the
rollerball sampler and it's the one
called skin and this one is it's so good
don't get me wrong I really enjoy the
ones that make me think of snuggle dryer
sheets and fresh air and clean water and
all those things but this one makes me
think of I don't know it makes me feel
pretty it makes me feel like a little
bit spicier than those even though I
it's not like hardcore spicy heavy
perfume I would say there's more of a
clearly feminine vibe to this one when
you smell it maybe there's just a hint
more floral a hint more depth but at the
same time very hard to put your finger
on usually the sense that I really
really like they're hard for me to
describe clearly to you because they're
just a little bit out there but I love
the rollerball set in general because
they are so easy to travel with you can
pop them in your bag and they don't take
up a lot of room and I'm not concerned
about like the cap easily popping off
and then the little spray or getting
pressed down by something else you know
this twists on nice and tight so yeah
and then another little thing that I am
trying to get more use out of in my
collection are my visor art eyeshadows
and let me tell you it's a pleasure to
get back into those because I've been
using a lot of different palettes lately
and then I'm like you know I want to use
some things that I have they're just not
beginning enough love and things that I
spent a good chunk of money on so I
should be using them one of those things
this little guy this is one of their
what do you owe theory palettes and this
is the one in minx
and I got this because I still haven't
pulled the trigger on vies arts neutral
matte palette but here you get three
neutral mattes so I'm like okay
those look like a nice way to try some
of those basics and then these gorgeous
shimmers right here as well now I
already do have the sultry music which I
love and I've checked because a couple
of these I thought are those like the
same shadows as what's in here and
they're not but
took this with me when I was traveling
also I've just used it here at home
quite a bit lately the pans do come out
by the way look at that very easily just
lift out if you'd like to load up a
different palette with a bunch of these
you totally could I just think it's cool
cuz I've got my easiest matte neutral
look ever here with the cream and the
medium brown like those two it's no
brainer easy and then this copper is
just outstanding this shade here this
kind of rosy but a little bit of brown
in it aren't those just yummy
this was the palette I wore when I went
to see Carrie Underwood at the Grand Ole
Opry that was a while ago and I love my
eye look that night but the more I use
this the more I love it if you're
looking for a little splurge or maybe
trying to add something to your gift
list you might think about that that's a
really nice way to sample both vice Arts
shimmers and mattes because they tend to
be split up in their larger palettes
like sultry muse is pretty much all like
shimmery / satin finishes and then they
do they're fully matte palettes but
these combo palettes are really cool now
I've got a really random holiday
beverage to tell you about and this is
something that goes in your Keurig if
you have one of those and I picked this
up when I was at CVS and I just saw that
they had I think they might have been
marked down a couple bucks but they're
their little apple cider cups and it may
be just the store brand that CVS sells I
wasn't really familiar with it it wasn't
like that Green Mountain organic kind
though I've had that before it's good
but I feel like this kind that I've got
now is even more flavorful like a little
more spicy perhaps and it's just great
great warm apple cider even when I fill
it up on the largest setting like for a
big cup of it hold on miss knees
even when I use the largest amount
possible it doesn't taste watered-down
and I've noticed that sometimes
happening with beverages other than
coffee so that stuff is really good also
little like Advent Christmas countdown
type things Bell got the cutest thing
from my parents we did early Christmas
with them because I'm not really going
to be traveling around Christmas time
because it'll be so close to the due
date so we did gifts then and she got
this neat little thing from it's from
Melissa and Doug and you can get this
gosh I think Toys R Us sells it you
probably find it on Amazon but it's a
little tree cutout and there's a tray on
the bottom and that tray holds all these
itty bitty magnetic ornaments well
they're not teeny-tiny like your kids
not gonna swallow what every day leading
up to Christmas you add one of those
ornaments on to the tree and then on
Christmas Day there's a little star that
goes on top so I think that's a fun like
visual way to show a young child you
know like we're getting closer to
Christmas yeah it's cute it's just so
adorable and then I want to tell you
about some my cheap cheap decor that
I've gotten from both five below and
Dollar Tree probably my favorite find
from Dollar Tree are these red glittery
bows they have twist ties on them and
they are so easy to just stick into
whatever you got you could put them on
your Christmas tree you could put them
on your Garland but they're glittery and
they're beautiful I was kind of playing
with a few different places where I
thought I might want to put them in my
house and then I settled on attaching
them to like kind of every other
wraparound of my Garland down the
staircase and they add so much pizazz
there I think they're so cute they come
in two packs and they do have a few
different styles I've got a slightly
different like more sort of woven II
looking style red bow that will probably
just end up going on the Christmas tree
if I can't find anywhere else for them
but I thought that was so cute and then
ornament wise they really did have some
cute one dollar ornaments these kind of
jumbo sized bells that hang and have a
little bow type thing on them there
and a little bit of garland mixed in
those are cute I got the prettiest
glittery reindeer golden reindeer I've
got on our big tree we do have a lot of
like kind of personal
sentimental ornaments that we've had
over the years on there but mixed in
with that is a lot of red and gold
anything that's just kind of random that
I put on that tree I keep it red and
gold so it is sort of the color theme
tree but it's got other things mixed in
and then from five below they had some
cute $1 ornaments as well they had a
whole section of $1 de coeur and so they
had cute little penguins like little
chubby penguins you could put on there
and bail really likes those so I got two
of them and they had the most precious
cupcake ornaments so beautiful like they
really looked charming on the tree but
it's just fun to find stuff like that I
always feel like oh there's so there's
always room for one more ornament right
so especially when it's a dollar I can
definitely make room for that ornament
but I think that wraps up my favorites
for the month of November thank you guys
so much for watching I hope you liked it
I hope you enjoyed the little bit of
randomness I tossed it thanks again I
hope you guys have a great day and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
