best in beauty video I have some
fabulous things to share with you things
that i have been using tongues so
excited about some really different kind
of off the beaten path items as well as
perhaps a few buzzed-about things here
and there too but thank you so much for
joining me for these videos sometimes
with review videos I feel like I want to
give this exact info I want to make sure
I don't leave anything out and it can
become very businesslike you know but
these favorites videos are always a lot
of fun as are my own get ready with me
videos too and I'm bringing some
old-school glamour for you today I used
my hot rollers and just got a ton of
volume in my hair from that I do so love
my T three rollers I'll link to those
below but they are the best hot rollers
I've ever used and I have learned by the
way that if I give them an extra long
time to heat like there are a fast heat
up thing you know they say only like a
few minutes but what I've been finding
is if I can turn them on just a little
bit earlier and give them like I don't
know 15 minutes of heat up time it's an
even more amazing long-lasting result in
my hair so just a little trick just
something you come up with after you use
them time and time again but just
looking over some of the things I have
to talk about I think I'm going to start
actually with bronzer this is something
I was thinking about doing just a
devoted video too but I thought you know
it is one of my monthly favorites so I
just explain it all here for you instead
of making you wait but it's their new
take home the bronze bronzers I think
these are absolutely fantastic the balm
does powder products wonderfully well
I've raved about their blushes their
eyeshadows also a specific thing about
their blushes that I've loved over the
years and I see it in these two
especially their in stain blushes but
you can like swatch them out on your
hand and then rub over them and these
are powders granted you can rub over
them and they practically stain the skin
like they're very long wearing and these
bronzers have that very same effect so
I'd love to see great staying power in
these products they do perform really
well on the skin just in real life not
just in little test swatches but
basically what they've done is come out
with three tones of bronzer where as
before with Bahama Mama they really only
had the one and this is a great bronzer
but some people may have found the tone
to be you know not exactly perfect for
them or maybe a little darker a little
light so with take home the bronze
got three shades now here's what's odd
to me I was just looking at the BOMs
website and they've all been named
different things like mine the lightest
shade is called Oscar the middle shade
is called tawny and this one the darkest
is gram II and they're all different now
on the balms website so I don't know why
they made that change but I think you'll
still easily be able to know what I'm
talking about and identify them as like
light medium and dark basically but they
are 100% matte bronzers and I think the
lightest shade has been so great for me
in terms of contouring like I'm wearing
it as a very soft contour today I do
feel like using a bit more targeted
brush for that contour works really well
like for example initially when I got
the product I was just using my ELF
complexion brush which don't get me
wrong this is a great brush for just any
kind of all-purpose powder all over the
face but my Sigma soft angled contour
brush or any may be a little bit smaller
even more pinched in type contour brush
really applies this nicely and you see
even more color payoff from it and it's
just such a perfect slightly cool and
not too dark shade for hollows of the
cheeks around the hairline I love this
and it's definitely lighter than Bahama
Mama if you ever felt like that was too
dark now the middle shade that they've
come out with just to give you a little
description here it's quite a bit warmer
now these the claim to fame with these
bronzers is the fact they're calling
them take home the bronze and they are
anti Orange bronzers but this one is
considerably warmer I think if you have
a little more depth to your skin
naturally if you tend to have a lot of
warmth in your skin this might be a
workable shade but it's warmer than
Bahama Mama also and I'll throw up some
swatches too but I think intensity wise
depth wise these two are kind of on par
with one another this one is just a
little warmer this one's cooler and then
this is your deepest so let's look at
that next to Tony it's cooler and it's
definitely darker and I kind of stayed
away from this one when I first got it
because I thought oh it's just it's
gonna be way too dark for my skin you
got to keep in mind that even though you
can do finger swatches of these in a
very opaque way it's a bronzer and
you're gonna wear it fairly lightly on
the skin and I can wear this one I
actually have this one around my
hairline up here right now I think in
the summer months as my skin gets a
little bit deeper and thinking of also
doing some self
tanning as well I actually think this
color will be extremely versatile this
deepest one because it's all about you
know just how much you get on the brush
how lightly you apply it is pigmented so
I think for a much deeper skin tone it
can go there and provide some contrast
for you but if you are more like my skin
tone you can absolutely use this as well
and let's hold it up in comparison to
Bahama Mama I feel like it's a similar
undertone definitely the deepest bronzer
offering from the balm so again if I
were to say my favorites I really love
the lightest just for everyday wear easy
soft contour and then this one to really
like amp up your skin tone use it with a
soft hand very lightly it's extremely
versatile but these apply so smoothly
great pigmentation amazing staying power
like I said so a great job to the mom on
that and today it's actually the Oscars
the day I'm sitting here shooting this
so how appropriate is that now here's
another thing that I truly have been
using so much this past month and any
time I go somewhere I feel like this is
something I want to throw into my travel
bag and I mentioned this last month as
well so I thought does this even qualify
as a favorite and then I thought yes
it's definitely worth mentioning if you
feel like you've used it a lot
regardless of the fact that this was
mentioned in last month's favorites too
frankly I think that's even more
impactful that I value this product that
much but it's from visi art it's my
theory palette in enamour'd so this is
the face one and this has gotten some
use everybody like if you look up
closely at this palette I mean I've been
kind of digging down into these shades I
think the blush is gorgeous it's a
beautiful mauve shade I'm wearing that
blush and the highlight as well the
highlight is so brightening it's got
just a tinge of pink to it like you're
not gonna really necessarily even swatch
it out and think oh wow that's pinky but
it's just a hint that makes it so super
brightening and then I can use this
as well for a quick contour or bronzer
honestly it doesn't have quite the
softness of the bronzers from the balm
but I would say it's kind of like a mix
between Bahama Mama and their middle
color called tawny it's like if you mix
these two you would get the shade that's
in this busy art trio but it's just so
compact so travel friendly it's just one
of those no-brainer space minimizing I
know it's good quality I know these
shades you know
shade of blush can work for absolutely
anything the highlight as well it's
gonna be like everything I need but guys
here's another fascinating product here
so there's something from Sephora let's
back it up for the back story here so
for has something called the perfection
mist nude glow I've gotten this quite
some time ago the shade is universal and
it kind of feels like this dry spray
it's actually an aerosol and you can
mist it all over your skin and you do
develop this sort of undetectable glow
I've mentioned this before in a video if
this is sounding familiar but it's not a
real like hydration pack spray like
certain setting sprays or refreshing
sprays that you've maybe tried it's kind
of like a texture free glow if that
makes sense so I was sort of intrigued
after I'd tried that and I decided to
get one of the blushes so this is the
perfection mist airbrush blush in pink
of perfection you shake this stuff up
and I do have a little bit of this as my
finishing touch on my skin today so like
I did all my face makeup I set my look I
think I use that cover girl look lock up
all over and then I really like this as
the very last step because the finish is
so incredibly fresh and subtle but
beautiful guys and I probably need to
demo this in a video or maybe I'll just
add a little bit more right now and
you're gonna be scared to do it the
first time you're gonna be like what
like am i spraying blush on my cheeks
but it's very subtle you can just feel
it like I can exactly feel it coming in
contact with that spot on my cheek
I sort of pulse my finger on it a little
bit and I'm not trying to apply too much
here because I already did put it on but
if you hold your finger down just a bit
more you'll notice the intensity
building up more but it is so fresh and
just completely lightweight if you're
looking for a different take on blush
like I have loved this so much and it's
sort of just been this like absolute end
of the look accent type thing like oh I
think I'm done no I'm not I'm just gonna
pop this on and it's like the glow it's
totally game changed by that product so
that's awesome
talking eyeshadow palettes here there's
been so much eyeshadow palette
experimentation over the past month
thinking back to all the bad habit stuff
we had the new honest hacia palette
which I love but I haven't necessarily
had my hands on that for super long but
I would say a definite favorite shadow
palette of the month would be my bad
that after-party palette if you watch my
video you saw my rave about this one and
the other little palettes in this style
see if you want to spend $30 on the bad
habit app you can get all four of the
different after palettes that are
fashioned after different huda beauty
palettes the obsessions ones and this
one I love so much because it does have
a couple of little pops of warmth with
this gold shade and the color called
morning after but then you have the
topes the dark Browns it's like perfect
smokey eye with a little bit of shimmer
if some of you were saying like oh no
these are out of stock and I know like I
waited for these to come into stock as
well before I made my order so I'm sorry
if you've been waiting on this and
haven't yet had the opportunity to get
it I'm wearing these for my look today
I've got some of the center shade here
and this kind of topi bronze on my lid
I've also got the dark brown and a
little bit of the black in my outer
corner and this morning after shade
right here sorry I'm holding it upside
down so I don't blind it with the mirror
but this color right here is a great
little like just above the crease shade
I've got some of the black smudged out
on the lower lash line so it's just a
fantastic kind of like warm meets cool
smokey eye natural palette in the
quality I mean I raved on this in the
shop hush video but it's superb it's
absolutely amazing can I though just
mention one more thing that's really
just swooping in here right at the end
of the month I've used it several times
and I'm just like this is so good I love
this this is the mint chocolate palette
from makeup revolution and they have
some different chocolate bar things and
I've gotten a few that I've really yet
to dig into but this one was the one I
was most excited about with this color
scheme now there are some gorgeous
mattes happening here some mats that are
definitely like things that I love with
rich Browns the kind of cranberry color
there's a nice matte dark forest green
you've got shimmery green shimmery
copper Gold's like this palette is fun
as heck to play with and I love the
looks I've done with it I took pictures
I know of at least one and was talking
about it on snapchat I feel like I have
so much to talk about from makeup
revolution has just been kind of a
culmination of trying different things
I've got concealing and baking and
palettes and so much to talk about from
this line and it's not like I haven't
done
makeup revolution videos in the past but
they're coming out with things so
quickly that I think an updated video on
that brand is definitely warranted right
now do you guys it's gonna be such a
nice day out there today like look
outside at the weather window we've
already got blue sky we've got chirping
birds spring is coming let's talk about
some lip products now because I am
wearing a friggin cocktail of things on
my lips today I combined several you
wouldn't have to I mean but it's hard in
these videos because like you wanted to
demonstrate and show all the favorites
and I've got like six lip favorites here
so overall lipstick this little Jim this
is another makeup revolution thing this
is one of their life on the dance floor
I believe is the name of the special
line 1 of those lipsticks it feels like
the same formula as their Renaissance
lipsticks I think they were called the
ones in the kind of rose gold tubes
those were beautifully done very soft
creamy lipsticks and so there's a shade
in this line called exclusive and it is
the perfect very dusty rose so that's
the shade that I've got like all over my
lips today and then this has been my
thing lately I found a perfect deep red
lip liner now let me rephrase that soft
deep red so we're not talking like vampy
rich vampire red it's not intense on
that level and it's not as intense as
like the fire engine bright Reds but
it's just so perfect when you want to
add a little red boost to any look and
it's the color called gash from Urban
Decay's so let me swatch this out for
you here I'm gonna swatch it kind of
thick so you can really see the shade
see how there's richness to that right
to most accurately describe this I would
say it's a bit of a mix of red and rust
and it's just so perfect when you want
to add a little extra definition to any
lip look or just fill in your entire
lips with this it's very creamy very
easy to put on but today's color is kind
of the fusion of these two shades you
know that neutral dusty rose with a
little bit of the red lip liner added in
and then I hope those of y'all who tuned
in for my video on the whole two-faced
life's a festival collection and maybe
you saw those first few products that I
mentioned in that video we're kind of
like not really hitting the mark for me
but if you hung in there with me and you
stayed for the big lip color Tryon that
I did there were a couple of fantastic
finds there with the angel tears this
stuff or as men as some of the other
things in that collection were for me
these were like gold got the angel tears
lipstick this is gonna be like the
ultimate little accent thing I'm gonna
add a little bit more right here like
it's a lipstick texture but it can act
kind of in the way you may have used a
lot of lip toppers you see it right
there's this light hint of pinky gold I
have been loving to accentuate the
center of my lower lip with that kind of
thing or I'll use the gloss so the gloss
is equally amazing out of everything in
this whole line that came out these were
the most kind of pearlescent beautiful
accent type colors so you can just dab a
little on glosses are making a huge
comeback in my makeup collection so just
depending on the texture of the look
that I'm going for I mean I think you're
gonna get the most opaque intensity with
the lipstick but the gloss really
provides an amazing pop as well so these
are just total stars complete winners
for me now this was taken straight from
my purse it's been living in my purse
ever since I don't know probably the lip
gloss Renaissance video that I did it's
Lancome gloss number 272 this one is
very everyday there's like a micro fine
little golden e shimmer in this maybe
the best description is like warm rose
or warmish soft red but it's a gorgeous
shade I tried it on in that video but
I've been wearing that a lot it's been
the purse go to this formula feels so
nice not overly sticky not too thin and
these tiny shimmers in this gloss you
won't feel that texture whatsoever on
your lips it's not chunky but it almost
like exaggerates the shine that the
gloss is already giving you right so
it's absolutely beautiful and then this
last thing that I haven't yet shown you
in any video I'm going to take off my
lip color for this this is from Mac and
it's their tender talked lip balm in the
shade called play with me and this is a
beautiful fun kind of soft reddish
although it has kind of a like a soft
reddish pinky look on my lids
that feels so fantastic and pillowy on
my lips like we're talking a beautiful
spring and summer soft red here there is
a little bit of like gloss like shine
that comes off of this but guys it's the
perfect thickness like it really does
feel lit Boni I think I have another one
of these tender top balms somewhere in
my collection and I remembered at the
time I thought someone told me they were
getting discontinued or something but
they're on ulties website now and this
shade called play with me I think is so
fun and it looks great with the black
and white striped shirt too but the
added bonus with this shade that I've
loved is that as it wears a little bit I
do have this kind of like popsicle stain
to the lips like not stain stain not
annoying like when will I ever get it
off my lips stain but just it leaves
behind a little soft color that actually
lasts surprisingly well for the fact
that this has such a balmy texture you
guys I feel like I could just talk for
days on this stuff but I hope you
enjoyed this this sort of roundup of my
favorite products most used products and
for now me and my hair are gonna go
downstairs have some breakfast got a fun
week of videos ahead so I will talk to
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
