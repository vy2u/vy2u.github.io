good I'm feeling really good this
morning I've got a lot of great things
to tell you about as part of my January
favorites and I feel like I'm really
drawing off of maybe even a longer span
of time than a month here because the
last time I really did a favourites
thing was the Emily awards and so that
was part way through December so these
are favorite things that kind of took
shape I started really making notes on
them from about mid-december on so this
is a great list of favorites I feel
super strongly about these things I was
excited to do the video even though Eve
has started waking up in the night again
it's not cool guys one two in the
morning crying teething I think it's
some long nights everybody it's some
long nights and that transitions me
perfectly right into my first thing that
I am going to talk about though which is
this Real Techniques under-eye Reviver I
mentioned this this is part of a set
right back here that sits sort of in the
background of my videos but those are
some skin care brushes from Real
Techniques which I reviewed this whole
set I will have to link below so you can
really get the specifics on everything
there but one of the most fantastic
parts of that set is this and this isn't
actually rolling your under eye creams
and things aren't gonna get like swooped
down under this ball just this
immobilised little ball that's super
duper cooling and I like to use it and
when I apply an eye cream in the morning
so I just get it on there I don't fully
100% blend it in with my fingers and
then I just go in with this and I start
moving it around and it feels so
refreshing so cooling I don't know it
just makes you feel so alive you need
something like this especially if you've
had some long nights like me and the
hair is kind of sort of bothering me
today so it's going behind the ears okay
I've got a couple of foundation e-type
loves one of them is this NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation been
experimenting with this on and off since
Christmas time I did travel with this
around that time I am in the shade
Vienna it's a really good shade for me
I'm wearing it today and it's a
surprisingly good coverage foundation
let's face it when the words natural and
radiant are part of something you don't
always think coverage I really would
classify this as a full coverage
foundation and very little comes out
with one pump I usually use two pumps of
this because it's such a small amount
that's dispensed but it blends out super
nicely with a brush does have a very
natural appearance on the skin doesn't
look too flat even though it has managed
to give you very very even coverage I've
enjoyed the staying power of this a real
test of that is when you go for like a
night out and you've been eating and
talking and just doing so many things
and it's late when you get home and then
you look at yourself and it's like did
everything hold up and when I wear this
yes I feel like everything held up if
you would like to see more details on
this more of like a real application and
nitty-gritty type of you know talking
about everything as it's being applied I
can do that but I definitely have been
testing this on and off for over a month
now and I'm really sure of what I think
of it at this point I think it's
fantastic my next thing is more of a BB
cream really light coverage quick and
easy type of product on skin now in the
Emily Awards I know I named my Rimmel BB
cream as a favorite again this year and
it really is an amazing thing but since
that time something else is gonna come
in that I felt like experimenting with
for whatever reason I think I was just
remembering back to when this had been
recommended to me by some viewers I
tried the regular Garnier BB cream just
the original one that had come out and
you know it's really light coverage it's
fine or whatever but more than a few
people had said like it doesn't really
matter if you have the oily combo skin
that this one is labeled for but this
one works really well and I must say it
does I have it in light to medium five
and one miracle skin Perfector like I
remember way back on my channel one of
my most popular videos on my channel was
comparing different BB creams and the
original one the original Garnier one
was in that but long since that time
they have come out with the oily combo
version this does have SPF 20 and it's
very very liquidy but this does have
like a little more coverage than I was
expecting it makes my skin look really
nice it's not too a full coverage place
it's not doing what this NARS is but
it's evening out a lot it's making look
very I think naturally radiant and the
staying power is honestly quite good and
I don't consider myself like oily to
combo but this is still moisturizing
it's still somewhat nourishing I'm not
really sure what this is doing for the
people who are truly really oily does it
work for you in that capacity because
I'm pretty normal verging on dry
especially this time of year
and it works great for me so I just
wanted to throw that out there is
another great drugstore BB cream option
I mean it's like right up there with the
Rimmel and maybe it's the tone of this
that's playing into that but I might
even like just the finish on my skin
from this even better did a big big
super informative video on julep within
the past month or so and this is a brand
that I think really flies under the
radar big-time they've got some
phenomenal lip products a lot of really
great products just here and there
throughout the line and one of those
things is they're so radiant diamond
powder bronzer I have this in medium tan
and this is what a bronzer is meant to
be like it's not a contour although you
can gonna do a little contouring with it
but it is really like the purpose that I
think bronzer needs to serve in this
world because it does give you a little
bit of subtle glow but it is so natural
like putting it around my hairline like
yes it looks so good it's that subtle
sheen and the perfect tone this is not
to oranjee okay it's real tan in a pan
that's what this is with a subtle glow
I'm wearing this now in the dead of
winter loving the way it looks on my
skin and you can bet this is gonna oh
sure its way right into the summer
months where I'm starting to spend some
time cool and this will be like that
perfect little finishing touch type
powder on my skin it's just so nice and
so natural-looking put it where the Sun
might naturally hit it can be a soft
contour it's not too orange for that
it's just one of those beautifully
executed products you know it's a soft
powder it really just does exactly what
you want a bronzer to do also on the
face a huge favorite that I just tend to
want to reach for all the time is my
shiny blush palette I think this has a
name like fuchsia is something it's a
six color blush palette it's on Amazon
and it's a wonderful range of blush here
what is special about this like as you
look at this if you hadn't seen my video
which was on products that seemed more
expensive than they are this was in that
but like glancing at this what makes
this special to me is the variety of
tones sometimes generic kind of blush
palettes you'll buy one and it's the
pinks and one and it's the peachy shades
this is everything okay your true peach
a really nice pink here another tone of
pink right here hidden these dusty kind
of shades down here which
I love you know I love this coral by the
way but these two specifically you know
dusty rose something with a little more
of a bronze and neutral tone I am
thrilled that they packed all these
different things in generously sized
pans into one palette this is
inexpensive they're so nicely pigmented
but yet you don't have to feel like you
got to be insanely careful with them you
know they're easy to use and it's every
blush shade someone would need now I
mentioned some of these things that I'm
putting in this video where thinks that
I was even loving like back over the
holiday time when we did a lot of travel
we went out to the Smoky Mountains we
went back to my hometown we had like one
little buffer day at home in-between
those trips so I was living out of my
makeup bag for quite some time and the
thing that I took with me for the only
thing that I took for my blush bronzer
and highlight was this theory palette
from visi art and it's the theory
palette in enamored so they've got a
couple tones and this would be the
cooler tone one I think I actually maybe
when I first talked about these in a
video I may have gravitated more toward
the warm but this one really speaks to
me right now especially when my skin's a
little lighter this like slightly pinky
toned highlight absolutely
you know radiates off of me I love the
Mavi blush you've got a bronzer /
contour shade there as well but I mean
this thing got used y'all like this was
what I took with me and the only thing I
was using for these purposes and that's
a matte blush by the way works really
great alongside that highlight and it's
so small it's so compact like this kind
of thing is a traveler's dream to think
that this could be three different bulky
compacts but instead it's just been
pared down to this little guy here the
other thing that I traveled with for
eyes is equally tiny like this is the
size of a credit card
really the petite pro palette from busy
art this has been out for a while and I
have had it for a while I hadn't really
bonded with it until I was like okay I'm
gonna bond with this is gonna be the
only palette I throw into my bag for my
turn apples and this was so like smartly
that's where this is so wonderfully
designed and put together mattes down
here shimmers up here and the variety
you can actually achieve with these
eight small shades is just great and it
doesn't take a lot of each shape
either like I know these are small pans
that I'm only dipping like one time into
that beautiful kind of reddish-brown
here this dark near black is great khaki
color here mat cream shimmery champagne
gold copper and even this fun purpley
shade so I'm wearing this today for
example and what I do like to do when
I'm using this palette is go into this
cream and kind of with a fluffy brush
just get it all over like I put my eye
primer on and then get that cream shade
all over because this khaki color if
this is going to be your go-to like just
prep the crease right away shade this
has some depth so when I kind of prep
that area first with the light shade
everything goes on perfectly and it
doesn't seem too dark it doesn't seem
too heavy in certain areas but I've got
some copper on the lid I also love using
the copper out here on the border even
though that looks really really metallic
it's got enough just like pure color
pigment to it to where when you shear
that out on the absolute edge of your
crease area it just adds some kind of
peachy warmth so I've got some copper
and some gold on my lid today I smudged
this color on top of kind of a plummy
dark eyeliner on my lower lash line and
I love what that did although it did
kind of deepen the effect of this shade
it doesn't necessarily look that dark
when you've put it out all over your lid
let's say but there are so many options
in here and again a traveler's dream you
take these two things you see how much
that can potentially eliminate in your
makeup bag I've got a new favorite lash
just this lash can do no wrong so I just
got something my phone was sliding off
my desk and I actually caught it
normally you guys here thanks crashing
to the floor but I caught something okay
Coco lashes in Soho this is probably my
new favorite style they're so full
they're so fluffy they're are a fluffy
lash they are long lengths short lengths
just a perfect kind of mix of everything
I honestly probably wouldn't reach for
these for like every single day type of
wear like when I'm doing videos I'm
always feeling a little fancy so I'll
throw on anything here with you all cut
for a real special occasion type lash
like I want to look my freakin best type
lash this is it
were they like six bucks six dollars and
maybe some change on the lady mas
website Gil oh and for your reference I
did trim them just slightly I trimmed
like this much off of the outside to
make them fit my eyes so if you might
have larger eyes than me like there's
plenty of length there and you can
totally just trim them to fit here's one
of my lip favorites I alluded to the
fact that this would probably be in this
video not too long ago but this lip
smacker kiss therapy SPF 30 super fruit
mm-hmm you want to check this out next
time you're at Walgreens guys oh it
smells so good mmm I think my fruity
candy lovers and or my tropical cocktail
lovers will love and appreciate the way
this smells mmm it's just it's so good
it's a really nice texture of lip balm
too I would say it's kind of like
traditional lip smackers stepped up a
little bit in moisturization and just
kind of overall quality but it's so cute
and they have other scents and flavors
of course as well but this was just the
one that I happen to grab and I happen
to love it it's so nice nice kind of lip
prepping step also it's kind of you know
competing with my EOS now for being that
first thing that goes on my lips because
it's not too slick it's got some
smoothness and some just you know it
glides on nicely but it's not too super
slick so if you want to just straight up
top that off with a lip liner it's gonna
make everything go on more easily but it
won't prompt anything to really slip
outside the lines another huge huge
favorite here for me is my Marc Jacobs
Lamarck liquid lip crayon the shade
night moths that's where I've been
wearing in this video this shade like I
haven't had this that long and look at
how much abuse it seems like this shade
it's taken like it has been dropped yes
it has been dropped but I mean it's been
used but yet it's still plenty of
precision on my lips and I just did the
whole video where I tried on every shade
in this line
they are fantastic you'll definitely
want to see what some of those other
colors look like but this was the first
shade I tried I think it's one of the
most probably potentially universally
liked shades in this line it's got great
wear it's just got a great look on the
lips it's got that little ghost pearl as
they call it
she and
last but not least I've got two things
that are a little more like skin and
body oriented one is another thing from
julep which I have been experimenting
with the julep skincare somewhat when I
did that video I mentioned I had tons of
makeup to try but I also had some
skincare and definitely there's one
clear well maybe two there's something
I'm kind of starting today thorn Island
with a little bit but there's one
surefire thing that I absolutely love
from the julep skin care and it's called
nightshift deep sleep facial mask so if
you are going through a really dry time
you might not need to use this every
single night this might not have to be
your permanent night cream but if you're
really feeling like okay my skin needs a
ton of extra love and attention tonight
put this on and it says massage a thin
even layer on to face avoiding eye area
apply to clean bare skin or layer over
serum and moisturizer when I've used
this this is just all I've put on leave
on overnight and rinse off in the
morning it's a treat it's a treat for
your skin you know it's a thick cream
okay this is a thick moisturizing
treatment but it's not suffocatingly
thick it doesn't feel ridiculous on your
skin you don't feel like you're messing
up your pillowcases with this but it's
just very deeply hydrating if you've got
dry skin always or you're just going
through a dry skin time just
periodically this is good to have now
let's talk about your dry feet dr. teals
dr. teals coming in huge with the foot
cream with pure Epsom salt moisturize
and soften shea butter and aloe vera I'm
not sure if there are multiple versions
of this kind of thing but guys this
smells so good by the way it's kind of
fruity like a fruity foot cream what's
going on with that I don't know it's a
really nice texture it's not too thick
in fact when I first put this on I
thought is this going to be thick enough
on my feet to really do anything but it
totally does and some people will say
the experts will probably say put this
on your feet then put on a thick pair of
socks and then sleep that way and you'll
wake up feeling great well I don't sleep
in socks I really don't like wearing
socks period it really killed me for a
while when I had to wear that boot on my
broken foot for a time but I guess part
of my point here is this doesn't feel
all that thick but even when you put it
on your feet with no sock on top of it
it's doing its
it's doing what it needs to do it says
shea butter aloe vera vitamin E to
provide intense moisture to end help
prevent rough spots says use daily to
keep feet touchably smooth I would say
use it a couple times a week it's gonna
make a difference I'm dry not only on
the bottom of my feet but also kind of
on the top of my feet and furthermore
around my toes - like I'm dry everywhere
because I am barefoot a lot I guess I'm
doing it to myself but this this makes
it all bearable so thank you guys so
much for watching that is my January
favorites video the best in beauty I
must do in these it feels like it's been
forever since I've done one because the
Emily Awards just really took over
December you know yeah I'm in a funny
