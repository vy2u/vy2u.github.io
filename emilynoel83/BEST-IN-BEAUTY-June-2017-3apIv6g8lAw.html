video we're going to be talking about
just a little quick few products and my
best in beauty because I feel like I've
had a couple of sort of favourites best
in beauty type videos already this month
for this past month I had my most used
products on vacation those are certainly
some favorites I also very recently did
like a top 5 new products at the
drugstore so I'm left with still a few
things to talk about here and I was
debating whether or not to even do this
video but then I thought I don't want to
miss out on doing a best in beauty video
and I certainly have some things that I
want to mention here but to avoid being
redundant I'm not going to go into all
the things that I mentioned in those
other couple of videos if you want to
see what's in those I'll just link to
those below for you quick mentioned for
a rediscovered concealer that I've been
liking it's the maybelline superstay
better skin
it's an oil-free concealer and it just
has a wand applicator I wear it in the
shade light/medium kind of along the
same lines that I enjoy that Loreal Pro
Glo concealer it's nice for when you're
wearing a very lightweight foundation
look and you want your concealer to sort
of follow suit with that I really have
found that this strategy works well for
staying power for making everything seem
kind of even all across the face whereas
when you wear like a really light
foundation or BB cream and then your
under-eye concealer is like full
coverage like a whole other world that's
when things can look really unnatural as
the day goes on because you've got this
thick heavy full coverage on the under
eye and everything else looks natural it
just doesn't make sense so how is this
different from the pro glow it's still
kind of one of those natural lightweight
concealers but maybe just a little bit
thicker but more than anything this
particular shade this light/medium is
maybe just a little bit darker than the
ivory shade that I had in the pro go and
as my skin gets a little bit more of a
tan going on it can maybe handle a bit
more depth in the concealer department
but I've got that all in this area
that's the only concealer I'm wearing
today and I just think it did a really
good job without a lot of time without
much hassle whatsoever just blended it
out real quick and I was done yet
another rediscovered product that I've
been enjoying over the top of concealers
and just a
well brightening like right in this area
right here also the t-zone is my best ma
brightening powder here it's the
brightening violet powder it says
translucent but it is a very light shade
of violet it's really strange but the
coolness of this powder it almost makes
it more brightening than just a white or
cream colored powder you know and I just
lightly take it with like my ELF small
tapered brush this brush right here and
I just dab it very lightly right in this
zone and then I take it around my nose
because I'm not really wearing powder
anywhere else on my face like a skin
tone powder I've got powder bronzers and
blushes and stuff but the main area I
want to hit is here with that and I put
it on the t-zone real lightly and that's
it's just a very pretty powder it
doesn't look too thick obviously you
could apply too much of it make it look
thick but I just find that to be very
very brightening I had taken the vanilla
one which is a little bit yellow toned
on vacation with me I like that too but
I do believe that this lilac one is even
more brightening or the lavender violet
another thing I mention just sort of
here and there in other videos what I
wanted to give it a specific like thumbs
up and my best in beauty video is my Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer the sweet tea
baked luminous glow bronzer so good I
never really thought I would like a
luminous or slightly glowy bronzer as
much as I do
with this product because I will take
the deeper half of the compact and just
use that a little bit right in here I
don't know that anybody would even
identify that I have been contour but it
just shades this area slightly you see
what I mean and it looks really pretty
taken you know across the decollete area
around the hairline it's so perfect it's
just the ideal summer bronzy glow and I
reach for this I want to use it everyday
in addition to my Maybelline fit me
blushes which I have in a couple shades
that I would classify as kind of rosy
neutral you know the nude shade the wine
color they're not super bright shades
but what I want to go a little bit
brighter with my blush still really been
enjoying this infallible paint compact
here today I'm just wearing this shade
that's the only blush color I have on
very lightly when I want a really good
Coral these two colors together are
great and these pinks there's something
about a pink blush in the summertime it
just brings a lot of life to the face
maybe your skin is getting a bit more
color to it these types of blushes are
just so flattering and they're all that
they're really intense I just I love
this compact so much I love that
something like this is available in the
drugstore I'll be it at a slightly
higher price than maybe some other
drugstore things but it is a palette of
four blushes little goes a long way
blushes so you're going to have this for
a while if you get it one other thing I
don't think I've mentioned this at all
yet this Smashbox
spotlight palette in Pearl this is the
one that I'm Katie Holmes she has a
couple of them there's a pearl one and a
gold one I've had this for a little
while and I was using mainly like these
first couple shades one is the really
light pearl one is a little bit softer
kind of champagne color
I don't know how different they are from
a lot of things that I have and then
randomly I decided to jump into this
last shade now this last color this has
turned it on pearl crank it up pearl and
this last - it's called blow a fuse
pearl and it has identifiable like
little bits of sparkle in there to bear
to the other two it looks like a really
over-the-top highlight and I just
thought one day I'm going to use that as
like beige but it's got all the sparkle
and pretty bang frosty and I had not
really liked the way that looked just
swept on my cheeks and then I realized
what you need to do with that shade to
make it look absolutely next-level
beautiful and I'm going to demonstrate
this even though I'm already wearing it
I'm going to put a little more on I've
got this highlight and glow brush from
Mota this is a must must have highlight
brush in my book I pick up some of the
product tap off the excess and then
absolutely buff this shade in don't just
like grace it across the skin like you
might do with some highlights actually
buff it in circular motion hit the top
of that cheekbone and then come down
slightly on top of the cheek as well
this compact does have a mirror by the
way like that but something about
buffing this one into the skin it's like
you kind of hide it into your skin a
little bit more it just meshes with the
skin
when you buff it in and then take your
setting spray like this is a very
natural process for me because highlight
is normally the last thing that I use
and then I'll put some setting mist on
the setting mist on top of that this
happens to be the Mario Badescu but I've
used different kinds when that highlight
gets that little bit of moisture added
to it and it's already been kind of
worked into the skin a bit it just looks
so naturally Chloe it's awesome I love
it I love how I even have that right up
in a potentially problem area or you can
see a few little lines coming in there
like around the eye outside of the eye
area and it's not even affecting that
problem it just looks so DUII and nice
so I thought I'd share that little trick
with you because I really like that
highlight used in that way and also
somebody did ask me on some form of
social media recently what my favorite
brushes are for bronzer blush and
highlight so real quick elf complexion
brush love this for bronzer love it for
a really fast contour so of course I use
that with the Too Faced sweet tea today
or blush I kind of bounce around
sometimes I love my Milani one which is
kind of a thick fluffy blush brush and
this Estee Lauder sculpting brush is
nice for maybe some more neutral softer
blushes because it will pick up a decent
amount of product it's kind of densely
packed here in this curved shape and it
really accentuates this apple of the
cheek I don't like using this with my
most intense blushes because obviously
it can pick up a lot at one time and it
doesn't really diffuse color it's more
of a sculpting kind of product guys with
my softer or more neutral or neutral
blush neutral blushes it's nice with my
softer or more neutral but its nicest
with my softer or more neutral blushes
and then I've got this one this is my up
and up blush brush and I've had this for
quite some time this I really like when
the color is a bit more intense and I
just want to dab into it and pick some
up lightly and brush it right here on
the cheek it's got a nice taper to it
it's a little more flattened out than
the Milani and I find I really like it
with you know bright shades like this it
just gives the perfect small pop of
color highlight wise I just showed this
Moda highlight and glow brush I think
you can buy this on it
own however when I got it from Walmart
it came with this quick contour brush
I've not really decided if I like this
Brit haven't used this enough to
understand it really it appears it's
kind of meant to cup the cheekbone
somewhat but I don't want dark product
going up above my cheekbone contour wide
so I don't know if you love this brush
and you want to try to explain it to me
go for it but I love the highlight brush
that came with that right after getting
back from vacation I used up my
precisely my brow pencil from benefit
the number four and I decided to pick
this one up this Tarte arch architect
and it's a universal brow pencil I don't
know how much luck all y'all have had
with a universal you know something
marketed as works for any one type brow
pencil but for me this is working pretty
well it's kind of a cool taupey color as
you apply a lot of a pressure or
intensity you get this kind of shade if
you keep it lighter it just ends up
looking like a light almost blondish
brow pencil I guess a cool blonde taupe
can you see the tip of this product it's
a straight up triangle so it's
definitely thicker than a precisely my
brow pencil or an honest onto your brow
wiz NYX micro brow lot thicker than
those I would say it fills in the brows
a little bit faster but I just go over
the whole brow with that and then on the
other end you've got just a clear gel
which i think is rather handy to have
together with this product sometimes if
I feel like I've applied too much of the
pencil
I'll grab for a separate spoolie and
just help break it through you know just
a bear one but I do really like having
this gel on the opposite end of this
product I think it just makes everything
really quick and easy so I like that for
me and I would love to hear in the
comments section if you're a different
hair color skin tone I don't know
whatever does that color actually seem
to be Universal and work for YouTube
also a shout out to this lip architect
thing from Tarte this is a lipstick and
liner in one this would be the wide end
of the lip product and I would say it's
smaller than most jumbo pencils but
larger than most lip liners and I really
like filling in my lips with this and if
they describe it as a satin matte finish
it's
very pretty I've got it in the shade
called cutie pie here I love this color
it's kind of a berry with a little bit
of neutral thrown in it's not a real
purpley berry then the liner side is
what you would expect out of a standard
lip liner it coordinates pretty much
exactly with the lip color I'm going to
draw them side by side and I tried a few
other shades in this as well and it
seems like what they're giving you is
the same shade just a little bit
different formula you can just tell a
little bit more creaminess with the
thicker side and then the lip pencil
part is like 100% matte I like taking
the whiter side and filling my lips in
with it and there's a ton of precision
with that yet it glides on so smoothly
and then I just take the liner side and
kind of perfect little areas just get my
edges really nice and clean but yeah
