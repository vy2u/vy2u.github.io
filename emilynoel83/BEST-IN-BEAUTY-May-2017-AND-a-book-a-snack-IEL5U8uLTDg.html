great day I am excited to join you in
this video with my favorites of the
month who I got that line out that took
me like five times to say that first
line of my video I'm just getting warmed
up here I guess but I've got a lot of
great beauty favorites to share with you
things I've been wearing a lot and just
some interesting stuff that I want to
tell you about but I do have two random
favorites one is a food item and one is
a book and so I thought I would just
tell you about those at the starts and
normally those get left off till the end
and yeah they've both been really good
things for me over the past month or so
so the first thing is this 52 lists for
happiness book I thought several people
on my Instagram feed posting about this
I know there's lots of Instagram makeup
trends but then you see a book every now
and then I guess this whole concept was
created by Maria seal her name is right
down here it's a beautiful book isn't it
I love those flowers there and the rose
gold that's really speaking to me but
this is weekly journaling inspiration
for positivity balance and joy and I
love the thought of this I am how many
lists in right now I'm six lists in so
I've been doing this for six weeks but
it's got different chapters sort of so
the reflect list that's the one I'm into
right now and then one chunk of list is
labeled acknowledged invest and
transform and so here's what some of
those lists look like the ones I've done
so far like the first one lists what
makes you happy right now with the
routines in your personal life and work
lists the things that you're really good
at was the things that get you out of
your head I've been doing these weekly
lists on like a Sunday or Monday and
then trying every day throughout the
rest of the week in the morning to get
up get this book out and kind of go
through that list for the week and think
about it just really reflecting on this
and so much of this so far I feel like
comes back to sort of a gratitude
journal almost idea at least so far it's
really having you focus on a lot of
things that bring you joy that bring you
comfort to clear your head I'm a person
who before I go to bed at night like
before when I'm in bed and I'm just
before I fall asleep I pray I am in
prayer at that time and that's always
just you know I reflect on the day
and I just have so many people and
things that I'm praying for and that's
always the way I like to wrap up my day
that those are the last thoughts that I
like to be in my head you know before I
fall asleep but this in a way kind of
brings me to that prayerful state at the
start of my day and I think the start of
your day can sometimes get away from you
like oh I've got to do this video or
I've got to tend to this person or that
person but if you can try to set aside
like just a 5 minutes of quiet time and
kind of think about your list that
you've made it brings you to that place
of gratitude and sometimes in prayer I
don't know if anybody else is this way
but it's kind of like you're telling God
you're your list of needs
you know like god police help is
vertically do this is this and sometimes
it's not enough about praise and I think
this kind of brings me back to that
place not that this book is written from
any religious standpoint but if you do
feel that way it just brings you back to
that places gratitude and it's a great
way to start the day so I would highly
recommend this book it says 1695 here on
the book but that's a great item and I'm
going to enjoy doing that every week my
other non makeup saying here is this
kind bar and this came or one of these
came in a PR package from Tarte they
sent some foundation sticks I have been
drying those I will let you know how
those have been going but there were a
bunch of kind bars in there as well and
I had never tried these only fruit and
chia bars before and the one that was
sent in the package was like a
strawberry and apple and it says only
fruit and chia no sugar added two
servings of fruit gluten free good
source of fiber low glycemic index no
preservatives low sodium very free vegan
so it's like really good for you stuff
and to me it tastes like a freakin even
better than a fruit roll-up
like I used to be all about fruit
roll-ups as a kid and this is just like
a more real fruit tasting type of thing
it's kind of something I can grab for
when I'm having that I want some fruity
candy or a skittle type of thing like a
real skittle craving earlier in the
month like I got into these and it got
me away from feeling like I wanted the
candy quite so much all I'm holding here
is a cherry apple Chia I had also bought
the mango apple and the strawberry Apple
I would say strawberry Apple is my
absolute favorite got the right amount
of sweetness tartness
getting like little fruit texture in
here it's like it's all kind of pressed
together and it's definitely nowhere
close to a life rip your fillings out
chewy it's just like this soft chewiness
and you know you're eating something
that's kind of good for you and yeah
it's great to grab a piece of fresh
fruit when you can but that's not always
convenient so these are a nice little
option there spend a little more time on
that stuff than I thought I would but
I'm going to move on to my beauty
favorites here and this is just
something I've been using this is not
necessarily something I see myself
repurchasing but it's just proven to be
handy for me this past month these from
Ulta these micellar water makeup remover
cleansing pads that says hydrating
no-rinse formula with aloe and cucumber
and there are 30 in here and I had seen
these on ulties website and one of the
last times that I placed an order I
thought okay let's see how ulties do in
the micellar water saying because in my
makeup area that's the first thing I do
every day I've been using the Garnier
one for sensitive skin and I'll just put
some on a cotton pad and run it all over
my face and it works great my skin has
been in pretty darn good shape since
doing that routinely and then when I
recently ran low on my cotton pads or
ran out of my cotton pads I saw that I
had these I'm like oh yeah maybe I'll
just try those it's like the laziest
thing to do ever because here it's pre
soaked there's a nice amount of juice in
each one of these and I just run it all
over my face at the start of the day and
it gives me that very same feeling that
I got with the Garnier one only it's in
a pre soaked pad I would say these
leaves maybe a little more feeling of
moisture on the skin after I use them so
they've been good you know they've been
really handy and like I said a total
lazy persons way of going about this
these might be you know easier to travel
with if you have one of those big
bottles of micellar water you know at
home and you don't want to take it
somewhere you can just buy the pre
soaked pads but I still have some
micellar water left so I just need to
replenish the cotton pads and I'll be
good at there another semi skincare
related item here my Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe cucumber and
green tea this has kind of been changing
my face setting spray gain lately now I
do think there are some that really
extend the wear of makeup and I kind of
put them off in another category and
that would be the Urban Decay all
nighter and all
the urban decay d slick I have seen
those actually like do really impressive
things on my skin but a lot of times
right when I get done doing my makeup
I'm kind of wanting just something to
take the edge off of the powdery look a
little bit and just make my skin look a
little fresher and something I can also
use all day long to just revise things
and there is a great rose scented spray
by this brand and I keep that down in my
refrigerator I think that's really great
too it's a great scent but something
about this aloe cucumber green tea like
the smell on this is the bomb and I love
the way it makes my skin look it truly
takes away the look of powdery finishes
and I've kind of been grabbing for this
a little bit more than my hard candy
shear and B primer mist simply for the
scent because I feel like both of them
do a very similar result on my skin but
I love the way this smells is so like I
don't know spa-like I were to ever go to
a spa I would expect it would smell like
that bottle the Urban Decay Naked skin
shapeshifter I wear this in the light
medium shift and I won't go on and on
about this because I just did a video
little powerhouse palette with your four
powders there and then you got four
creams over here you got magnetic
closure sturdy Paola's a mirror on each
side of this little divider which i
think is fantastic and yeah I've been
enjoying that a lot it's such a little
one-stop shop I've been having to remind
myself like oh you meant to try this
other bronzer or contour stuff like that
because this can take up so many steps
in your face routine and then before you
know it you're done and you didn't have
to pick up anything else for the nitty
gritty definitely check my last video
okay when I talk about things in these
favorites videos I really want them to
be purely favorites I don't want to
think like oh it has to be this price
range or it has to be blah blah blah
like I just want it to be a pure like
from my heart and this is something
that's a favorite item of mine and this
next one happens to be a pricey one I'm
sorry to say it's so pricey but I do
love it and it is my busy art plum
bronze blush palette now I almost
borderline not this thing I think in my
video where I talked about the theory
palettes which are there smaller palette
and they come out with a couple of faced
ones they have like a bronzer contour a
blush and a highlight in there super
handy super convenient
I had already had this and I hadn't used
it a whole lot I think I was maybe a
little intimidated by it for whatever
reason I just wasn't reaching for it
that Michael I thought why am I not
using this and so I started using it
more and I have realized just some great
things about this first off these
bronzers appear like those are great
bronzer contour colors on me those work
really well this shade down here is a
very interesting like I don't know soft
rosy plummy bronze sheer doubt on my
hand there it's like a rosy bronze with
Sheen that's gorgeous and then you got
these pretty blushed shades and I'm
sitting here with my skin tone saying I
like this but I think people with rich
deep skin tones could love this too this
mom's blush is great you got a rich very
almost burgundy blush and it's just a
matter of how much you use right you tap
your brush into it a little bit and it's
going to be just like a beautiful light
rosy blush shade but you can put it on
more intensely and definitely get more
in terms of shimmer in this palette this
definitely clearly has some and I feel
like I sense just a little bit coming
off of this shade but not much and then
these are met but the best thing the
thing that I love so much and I almost
wish like they just release it as a
single is this blush right up here now I
stayed away from this blush like I used
everything in this but that blush and
then I just started dipping into it and
trying it and I realize that it is the
shade of baby cheeks
it is like the natural and pigmentation
that a baby has in their skin without
even trying you know that unfair
beautiful that's the baby gets to just
have on their cheeks it's that and this
might seem like it's too light to do
anything and that's maybe why I didn't
reach for it so much I'm wearing this as
my blush today and I think it's
absolutely unbeatable you know is that
is there nothing younger and fresher
than that particular blush color I love
it anyway I'm pretty pumped about that I
think this is a gorgeous palette for
other reasons obviously but that is
beautiful and today I'm wearing that you
know it's the main chunk on my cheeks
but a little bit lower on the cheek I've
got some of the moms but you know me am
never not keeping my eyes peeled for
more affordable options if I can find
them but right now this is just awesome
awesome awesome and I'm kind of overdue
for a dupes video lately by the way
because I've thought of a few I've got a
few kind of waiting on deck to be pulled
into a video a couple of affordable nice
little drugstore eyeshadows here from
Rimmel I've been trying a few of their
singles and they got a couple good mats
here that I wanted to tell you about one
is called all about the base not all
about that base all about the base and
it is the classic crease color that so
many people want you know that kind of
neutral transitioning shade not too warm
pretty much on the cool side I guess
with this shade but it works alongside I
think so many looks it can be a nice
just base naturally shadowed kind of
crease color and it's nicely pigmented
you know it's matte it works well I've
got that in my crease today and on my
lid I used a little bit of this bobbi
brown shade that I've had for a while
and wanted to use called rose gold
that's what's all over my lid I topped a
little bit of the powder highlight from
the shapeshifter palette like right in
the center of the lid and then a little
bit on my outer corner I use this other
Rimmel shade in the color called Group
II so this is a nice matte plum so I
just applied that very lightly kind of
into the outer corner I didn't really
pack this on or concentrate it too much
in any one area but I've just found both
of these to be pretty nice little matte
singles from the drugstore I think those
can kind of be hard to come across so if
you're looking for any specific shapes
like that you might check Rimmel Fline
but I will also throw out that I tried a
shimmery one it was the gold it was
called a gold record and I did not like
that one as much I felt like I was
seeing just the flecks and not enough um
you know pearly Sheen was making it all
hang together that one looks like this
and it just not impressive did y'all
notice I'm not wearing any falsies today
I'm just wearing my mascara I'm not even
wearing eyeliner and the mascara
favorite that I've been wearing mostly
this month it's been the excessive lash
for makeup forever
mmm I used this in the last I remember
video that I did so if you want to see
that going on check it out but this
little brush is really nice really easy
to use it kind of reminds me a little
bit size-wise of tortes lights can
our lashes or shape-wise I should say
but it doesn't have quite as many like
little spiky spoken off of it it's even
smaller yet than that it's fantastic for
building lengths and it's also really
great for holding a curl something I've
been picking up on with this as I've
applied it is when you take the wand
through your lashes the lashes stay up
like as you do that final sweep through
here the lashes kind of stay up whereas
sometimes lashes and dip immediately you
feel like you know you're raking them up
you're pulling them up with your brush
but then they fall right away and that's
not to say that some mascaras that give
a nice curl at the start can't cause
your lashes to fall later in the day but
I just love seeing right as I apply this
it's like yes it's really locking in
that curl that I did with my lash curler
and by the way I love my friggin lash
curler always loved this this tweezer
men the lash curler for round eyes I
think it's called the pro curl so good
really gets in touch with my entire lash
line and makes anything that I got you
know it makes it curl but is this
mascara not so good and lengthening and
gives a really nice look and since that
last video I have been using it on the
lower lashes and I don't have any
smudging or flaking issues there so
that's usually the problem spot for
mascaras for me but yeah this has been
pretty awesome I love it and for lip
stuff on the lipstick that I'm wearing
right now is by makeup revolution and
it's one of their Renaissance lipsticks
this is in the shade life-long and the
packaging is totally like a Charlotte
Tilbury copycat I've actually got one
over here like look how similar those
guys look when I purchased this I
actually got another one as well it's in
more of a nude shade that I haven't worn
quite as much but this has been the
purse color you know this has been the
thing that when I'm out on the go or I
just need to grab something before I
leave the house and do a quick lip
touch-up this has been the kind of shade
I've been going for it's such a fresh
like pink but it's not too dark not too
light I think it brings so much beauty
and life to the face it feels really
really creamy and there is definitely a
scent to this it's like a mix of makeup
and maybe a little bit floral or a
little bit of like sweet vanilla put in
there - it's pretty fragrant I mean I
don't notice it while it's on my lips
but I certainly notice it as I apply
yeah it's just a beautifully creamy lip
color and if you have issues with
product drifting outside your lips when
you wear something really creamy like
this you might use with caution
you might try to blot a little bit more
with this because it is just so so
creamy but the color is very saturated
it's very comfortable on the lips I
guess it does feel a little similar to
the Charlotte Tilbury hot lips and
lipstick that I have but the thing
that's first coming to mind as
comparable to this would be like Revlon
Super Lustrous lipsticks only these feel
maybe a little more like actually
moisturizing though kind of nice thing
they got going there and of course the
price is good with makeup revolution and
my last little lip thing here would be
the Neutrogena revitalizing bulb
I love these I've gone out and gotten
two more I got the healthy blush color
and the sunny berry shade and I have
owned like all of these at one point in
time in the past but quite a while back
I felt the need to get rid of them they
were getting old and I had repurchased
the caramel and it just got me back on
that train and I do love the shape of
these by the way they're like an oval
lip balm and they give you just a little
bit of tint and super comfortable great
amount of bulma like thickness it
actually moisturizes the lips but these
are going to be softer color wise than
most of those like Neutrogena chubby
stick Moisture smooth color sticks that
I love or the most part these shades are
even more subtle than those so it's
something you can definitely slap on
without a mirror and just feel good
about the way your lips look this one as
I said in a past video like put on a lip
liner that's kind of neutral or nude and
then put this soft caramel shade over
the top and it's so comfortable but yet
long wearing I like pairing it with my
NYX light on lip liners last thing here
is a love but also kind of a question I
got this Sephora vib Rouge little perk I
guess this pro mini flawless airbrush
okay so the pro flawless airbrush I
guess is one of their top selling
brushes that so many people love and I
got to say this is a great brush I've
been using it sometimes for foundation
sometimes for concealer and sometimes
for like the creams in this palette I
saw it's good for like a little cream
contour also
but is this is the brush part of this
mini hobby and obviously the length of
this brush is many but they call it the
pro mini flawless airbrush I'm just
wondering is this smaller this top part
smaller than the regular full-size or is
it the same let me know this is a great
brush though and I can see why it's a
best seller but thank you guys so much
for tuning in for this favourites video
the best in beauty of the month I'd love
to hear what products you're loving
lately if there's anything new that you
think I should be trying out and
reviewing let me know in the comment
section and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
