favorites it feels kind of weird doing
this actually on time the time I'm
supposed to be doing it in the month but
I have rounded up some great products to
chat about today and I also have a few
things that are sort of in the dud
category and I think you know it's nice
to check in on a monthly basis and let
you know what those things are -
normally I do these really loose buns
and today I chose to like tighten it up
and I feel very secure normally my buns
are like just a tiny gust of wind away
from completely falling apart so this is
nice I got fancy today for some reason
but I want to jump in and talk about the
first thing that kind of saved my skin
after I had travelled and I'd had
sunburn situations I feel like my skin
in the past month has been a little bit
weird I've had breakouts in areas where
I don't normally get them so I felt like
gosh I don't want anything too heavy on
my skin but other areas of my skin
really had felt dry so I felt like I had
to cater to dryness but also I guess
sensitivities so I thought what's the
most basic thing that I had that's not
gonna have a lot of fragrance it's not
gonna make anything flare up and just
calm my skin down for a while and what
really worked well was this Clinique
Moisture Surge intense
I feel like this 100% helped out my dry
areas but also it didn't make my
breakouts any worse like I had a weird
little flare-up a few days ago and I'm
not sure what that was from but you know
that's kind of calm down now since I
just feel like this is a good option
when you want something really gentle
you need the hydration but you're a
little scared about breakouts and things
going too far I mean I feel like this
never made any sort of breakout that I
had on my skin worse but it really
catered to the dryness and yeah it's
just a good basic all-over really
intense moisturizer so I enjoy that very
much as the Moisture Surge intense that
also kind of saved my skin during that
whole like full coverage foundation and
Tryon thing that I did where I put on
six different foundations all in a row
and this was the thing like in between
all of them that really get my skin from
drying out and I think it also gave the
fuller coverage foundations the freshest
most natural look possible speaking of
those foundations a lot of those in that
video you've probably heard me talk
about quite a bit but my newest
discovery of the month would probably be
this Jay essential high coverage
cream Foundation and my big full-size
did come in but I'm still using up my
sample although this might be like a
really good thing to travel with
actually but I wear the shade cameo and
something I did notice as I went through
the editing process at that video and I
was looking at all like my little before
and after pictures that video is loaded
with before and afters because I wanted
to show you know here's why my skin
started here's what the foundation alone
did for me and the whole kind of premise
was concealer optional skin and I do
think this one might have been the best
with not only helping discoloration or
spots or redness on the face but it
actually did a really good job on my
under-eye area too so today like I'm
wearing this foundation and I just
dabbed a little bit of like a
brightening concealer sort of right in
here but I didn't make any big effort to
conceal my under eye and I think that's
really cool what else is special about
this if you've never tried this
foundation before it's so full coverage
but it's really really thin it's
definitely the thinnest out of anything
I talked about in that full coverage
video so it's got some really impressive
qualities and it's very easy to blend it
doesn't set too fast on the skin
although today between it about this do
I like
thought I had a major street going on
right down here on my chin and I was
like blending and blending over it and
then I turned my face a little bit I'm
like no that's a crease from my freaking
pillowcase or my sheet or whatever but
highly impressed by this foundation this
was sent to me in a PR box but I did buy
the full size normally I have my stuff
all in a nice little neat pile but today
it happens to be all over the place
a couple of base things that really
knocked my socks off this month are my
bronzer and highlight from makeup geek
and these are the ones being sold at
Target now so congratulations Marlena I
think that's huge so impressive and
she's got this tawny medium skin bronzer
that I feel like is just so incredibly
on point for my skin just really really
looks great from a contouring
perspective from a lightly bronzing the
skin perspective I'm starting to realize
I think this is the perfect tone so I
love that and then maybe something I
love even more than that look I'm even
more over-the-top impressed by is the
Starlight highlighter and this is what I
have on my cheeks today and what you
want to do with this is put it on with
your little brush you know maybe a brush
about this size get it going on the skin
and then buff buff it in in circular
motions because it really achieves I
think the most beautiful sheen on the
skin when it's actually blended in like
this will give you that you should
streak of highlight if you want it but
it really looks so flattering when you
kind of blend it all over that apple of
the cheek and on upward oh she did such
a great job on that I've also kind of
been experiencing this rebirth of blush
palettes here and one that I've loved
this recently come out from Milani is
the floral fantasy trio and this is the
more like kind of coral and earthy tone
blush collection that they put out I
have a whole review on some new Milani
things and this just really impressed me
and I had some people telling me after
that video like Oh too bad saled on the
website or I can't find it where I live
so I did kind of start looking through
my collection and really kind of
reexpose myself to a complete old
favorite which is my makeup revolution
hot spice palette it's the ultra blush
palette but the shade that I love in
this is hot spice they also have a
cooler more pinky option but a lot of
the shades in here really take you in
that same kind of direction that I love
so much in the Milani like this color
right up here in particular I'm wearing
that today is my blush and I'm wearing
it very softly but it's kind of like
that can't put your finger on it look of
health on the skin not necessarily like
oh my god would you look at that blush
they're just really pretty flattering
shades in here you've got some that do
go more toward the pink perspective and
some that are more of like that natural
peach which is also something that's in
this palette and then they give you a
couple highlighters to boot here so it's
a really great value I've been a fan of
their blush palette their contour
palette for the longest time they've
been Emily award winning products on my
channel and the process of kind of going
through my stuff and shopping my stash
which by the way thank you so much for
the response to that back of the makeup
to her video I freaking love doing that
I thought that was so much fun and I
want to keep doing that because I think
it's the absolute best way to ultimately
like declutter your stash you might only
declutter like a handful of things but
what I love about it is that instead of
just going through a pile of products
that I'm vaguely familiar with you know
some of them I felt like it was a video
practically like a final cut or
something like actually giving things
one more shot really thinking about
and then being really sure about my
decision to let go of something or keep
something so yes I enjoyed that I'm
gonna keep doing that kind of video but
something else that I've come up with
here that is a really good blush palette
plus bronzers - two of these top shades
or bronzers this is kind of like a
neutral blush to me but it's this visi
art plum bronze palette and this is one
of those things in my stash where I'm
like it's a fancy product like I don't
want to use it all up too fast like I'm
gonna just tear through it and hit pan
in a week or something but I want to
feel more free to like yeah use the good
stuff you know if you got it use it
don't just let it sit and there's a
shade in here and I've actually used
this quite a bit I don't know if you can
tell how much the brush is really torn
into that shade but that lightest color
looks almost like nothingness here but
it is such a pretty fresh like baby's
blush type color I think is what I've
called it in the past I've talked about
this palette before it's great when you
mix it in and take it a little deeper
with the plum this is a very rich berry
shade that yes even I will wear like a
deeper skin tone may be perfectly suited
to that shade but for me I can even
blend in little bits and get a gorgeous
look on the cheeks so that's just
another sort of little rediscovered
palette fine I feel like I got to give
it up to a couple of killer eye brushes
that just they rock if you didn't see my
video where I did a five brush full face
makeup look these were the two brushes
for eyes let me back that up I really
hope you'll watch that if you didn't see
it cuz I was very proud of that video I
thought it turned out really well then
please share it with the makeup
beginners in your life who are just
overwhelmed with brush selection and
just want some easy drugstore choices
because everything was drugstore but
these were the eye brushes they're sold
in a duo they're from Real Techniques
and they're called the insta pop eye
brushes one is bigger chubbier can do
crease can do blending I mean but the
cut of the brush is everything from the
side kind of a wedge shape but then
they've got this flatness to the overall
surface of the brush that makes them
great for packing on shadow and I think
making the most of a shadow this smaller
one is what you want to be using packing
colors on the lid working them out into
the crease pulling them up and creating
that lifted look from your outer corner
also this is a masterful brush at
blending the lower lashline if you want
to here like all those steps in great
detail
watch them apply some eyeshadow check
out my makeup brushes simplified video
and if you're into quick application if
you're into not too fussy they're great
but even if you are into fussy this
small one I tell you will surprise you
completely with all the things that can
do on your eyes and I think about like
the creation of these brushes and what
they must have done to like figure out
this unusual shape and when they
realized how good it was like they must
have had an absolute party over there at
real-time news headquarters like I'm
gonna go ahead and say it I think this
is one of the most brilliant brush
designs of our time and they've also
made that design this is probably the
best way to show you because on the
blush brush you can see this is this is
what the shape is they've just paired it
way way down for the eye brushes but
it's got this flat area to collect
product and then you also have this sort
of tip that can also do so many things
brilliant brilliant brilliant stuff my
favourite lash that's really taking over
my life are the Koko lashes in risque
I'm wearing them now here's a backup set
so you can really see what they're about
but I love this lash I don't have to cut
this lash it's actually not too long
left to right the bulk of the length is
in the middle it just frames the eye
really beautifully but it's dramatic you
know it's a pretty dramatic lash but
it's just kind of different from a lot
of things I have in that the length is
really hitting you here not so much
pulling outwards so it shapes your eye
differently and I just I think it's fun
I love that style Koko lashes are also
insanely durable like I have a ton of
backups but I'm on probably my first
ever pair of wrist gays that I've owned
you know what I'm saying like I've worn
these probably dozens of times if you
just take care of them and you're really
careful about pulling your glue off when
you're done with them and not like
leaving them in a rumpled mess like
under a magazine or a coast or somewhere
like don't last
also let me let you in on a little
secret this thing okay what is this this
is not an eyelash curler this is from
Sephora and I don't know the exact name
because I've gotten rid of the box but
this I'm going to nickname this guy I'm
a little clamper this is your eyelash
clamper it opens really wide and then
once you got your lashes on you can go
like this ooh and you can bond those
real and false lashes so
well and nothing is sagging down this
way
nothing is cutting into your actual ice
space your eyeball space you know what I
mean sometimes when lashes or even just
your natural lashes sag down lower than
your real lashes this is a straight lash
person problem here that I'm talking
about but we can struggle when we don't
have perfect curl in our lashes and
maybe we're playing with a new mascara
that day it just kind of everything's
falling down this really sticks them all
together so I'm gonna use it to put on
like a little puppet show for my kids
later a couple of lip things and then I
want to mention a couple of duds as well
one I've been wearing throughout the
videos this amore shine from Milani and
it's in the color Idol it's like a pinky
berry it's very opaque it's very shiny
it feels fantastic on the lips it's a
really nice formula if you like that
full color like lip lacquer type thing
you know cuz it's shiny I also loved my
Becca glow glosses particularly the
shade camellia which is going to be a
little bit lighter and softer I guess
you might say and the more I shine I
tried this on of course in my Becca
Tryon video but it's just like it's a
glowing type look off the lips because
there's just enough Sheerness in this
Becca pink and it just looks so pretty I
don't know what it is but I'm really
really feeling a fresh pink glossy lip
right now but while the Milani shade
isn't like a total dupe for this cuz
like I said this is lighter a little
more sheer I'm kind of wanting to dig a
little deeper into the amore shine line
and see if they haven't even the lighter
pink the other one that I have
that's called enchanting is more of a
warm pink neither one is a total match
for camellia but I think it might
possibly be out there come on dupe watch
for that one for sure okay here's what I
didn't like these these from L'Oreal
these are the lid chocolates scented Pro
matte liquid lipsticks yes they do smell
like chocolate kind of they're trying to
be chocolate they do smell a little
chocolaty okay I'll give them that there
are six shades when they give them to
you in these frosted type containers
it's so hard to tell what actual shades
you're dealing with I think I'm going to
swatch them all on my hand for you real
quick the positive points about these
would be that yes they smell like
chocolate when they sent the PR package
they also sent like the most adorable
box of lip chocolates and those were
really good and those really like threw
off my healthy eating for a day or two
but you guys are not watching my channel
for me to tell you how great the
chocolate was you want to know was the
product actually good and I just can't
latch on to these now remember the pro
matte glosses those are amazing from
this line the pro matte liquid lipsticks
I've not really been huge on just the
regular line of these that are out but
there are some really pretty colors so
I'm kind of like okay you know that's
fine here I can vouch for the fact that
there overall super long wearing
although kind of patchy there's a lot of
the color still remaining on my lips
after like an entire day and into the
night because I thought I had one of
these removed one I didn't but they
don't feel great you're gonna go through
this phase after you've put them on
where it's like okay smooth and creamy
then the dry down starts to happen and
you go through a short sticky phase
where you're thinking are my lips gonna
feel like this all day like pressing
together and sticking together and then
I don't know after a short time maybe 10
minutes that seems to pass and it
becomes more just like a dry madness on
your lips but there's a little heaviness
even when I go for the sheerest like
thinnest application of the product and
it just does not look pretty as it wears
down because these nudes can make my
lips look extra dry and even like a
bright color my and then as they start
to wear off it's like I just hate the
look of seeing that inner part of my
mouth and how unnaturally these colors
kind of chip away from that area and
look so gnarly
these are the swatches and I did notice
as I was testing these they all get a
little deeper as they dry if I were to
pick one shade that felt somewhat
wearable to me it would be this fourth
shade in one two three four this one
that looks a little bit like ma vie
there it's called boxer chocolate the
only reason why I point that out is not
really because I'm so in love with that
color but because it's a little bit more
close to my natural lip color so it
doesn't look as bad as it wears down and
this dark one here is like you feel like
you're applying Hershey's chocolate
syrup to your lips you put that on
that's exactly what it looks like and
they're intense colors they are opaque
on the lips they don't look
streaky at the onset but they don't feel
great on the lips while they stay on
most of your lips through the day this
patchy wear down that inevitably starts
to happen is just not appealing to me
but a lot of these tones just make me
look really blah just like I think
they're here to be really trendy and
take on that kind of grayish cool cast
but if there's something I've learned
about lip colors it's that they can be
so beneficial to the look of your entire
face it's not just something that you
put on and you like isolate it from
everything else and like oh that's an
interesting lip color no it's gonna play
off of your eyes your cheeks your whole
skin tone and everything and a great lip
color can do so many favors for all
those things a great lip color can make
you look healthy when you're sick you
know it's really a thing and these just
fell short for me like I said don't
confuse these Pro matte liquid lipsticks
with the line of pro matte glosses which
are just phenomenal they're like a lip
cream kind of thing they don't set up to
be this really hard like a natural
feeling a separate layer of product on
your lips they feel so good here's the
other thing that was sent to me that I
didn't really go for it's the Urban
Decay light beam eyeshadow palette I was
interested and I've done some looks with
this but I can't make it be outstanding
a matte shade called nudie this color
called vibe has a little shimmer paradox
is pretty shiny that peach color golden
hour wants to have like a little bit of
warm reflectivity but yet it comes off
kind of greyish blue as well and then
influences this deeper bronze I've used
Golden Hour kind of on its own I've
tried layering it up over some of the
other shades in hopes of finding some
real sweet spot like oh my gosh this is
a transcendent like really really
beautiful eyeshadow look and I'm just
not really nailing it if you've got a
really special way to wear this palette
what's the secret because my looks you
know well this color is nice and that
can really brighten things up my looks
come off just kind of dull I feel like
but I like the compact size you know I
like the idea of a little five color
palette from Urban Decay you know a real
pared down selection of shades I think
when I work in this bronze as well
things get kind of murky this is a
shimmery bronze and I don't know murky
might be the best description of most
looks I do with this guys
we need to talk about another purchase I
made here which I'm I feel I must tell
you about this because I just I want to
know whether you guys think this was
worth it or not because I'm kind of
edging toward no but I got one of the
girl on lipsticks and they're doing this
thing with Sephora with all kinds of
pretty caps which the caps are cool they
come off and there's a mirror that opens
up you've got double mirror there so
this little jigger right here holds it
down when it's on and then when you take
it off you know that'll pop open but
they had all different cap designs and
they're very weighty on this side like
there's a nice weight in the hand to
this product it feels expensive and I
can't remember the name of this I'll put
it on the screen but the style that I
got I think turned out gorgeous it's
like this soft pink but kind of
opalescent it's so pretty so you'll have
this cat forever and you could buy I
guess different lipsticks that would fit
in with it this was the lipstick that I
got it's number six it's pretty it's so
basic it smells a little bit floral II
like a hint of old-school L'Oreal color
riche lipstick coming through there but
not quite as strong I feel like I need
to put it on for you guys
rich it's creamy it's smooth it's kind
of like a warm pink
there are probably countless drugstore
lipsticks that could feel like this and
give me this kind of a look like a such
a freaking common shade and maybe that
just my error in what I chose but I just
wanted something that I thought I could
wear a lot of if I was gonna spend money
on this product but I really think I
just bought it for the cool cap I
thought oh that's a neat idea I really
want to get one of those cool caps the
enclosed mirror and everything but the
lipstick itself
I'm just underwhelmed like I don't know
what I wanted it to feel like I've tried
some expensive lipsticks I have a Tom
Ford lipstick that I think feels
expensive the creaminess of that
lipstick it's like it's really an
experience to glide it across the lips
and it just feels expensive this kind of
feels like any cream lipstick if this
were like a blind test and somebody put
this on me and then put on a Maybelline
Color sensational I don't think I'd be
able to feel the difference the cool
thing it's just that you've got a neat
customizable cap the practical side of
me says of course it's not worth it the
fun side of me says but the cat does
flip open I am so so interested in your
take on that and whether you think the
lipstick was worth it or the cat was
worth it or is it all just totally
ridiculous but thank you guys so much
for watching this video I always enjoy
these monthly product chat sessions we
have and I will see you very soon in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
