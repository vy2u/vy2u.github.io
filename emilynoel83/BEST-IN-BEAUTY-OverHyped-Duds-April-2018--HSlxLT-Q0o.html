make up room it feels so good to be back
although I did love vacation in Destin
over the past week it was so wonderful
that you know what they say home is
where your makeup is this is where most
of my makeup is and what's going on with
the cottonwood tree back here I mean it
got leaves while I was gone but I am
excited to pass along in this video my
favorites for the month of April I also
have some things that I wouldn't call
them full-on fails maybe to be most
accurate but there are things in
particular that I think some people
really really love and I just can't get
on that level with them things that I
just don't think are that great
first off let's just talk lip color for
a second I know I've been a broken
record about these L'Oreal color riche
shine lip colors but I love them they're
everything they're the lipstick
application they're the gloss like shine
they're the balm like comfort they are
such a great like multitasking lip
product and I think vacation made me
fall in love with them even more and the
shade that I was wearing the most is
called burnished blush and so it's just
this gorgeous soft pink I think it's so
spring friendly it's pink but it's not
too pink you know I think it's a safe
enough pink for people who maybe don't
wear a lot of Pink's on their lips also
let me mention a hair thing that's kind
of random here I got this from Target
they had kind of like a try me section
at the end of one of the makeup aisles
and it wasn't just like hair care but
also skin care and little makeup things
too and I picked up this Carol's
Daughter black vanilla leave-in
conditioner I had this maybe a few weeks
before I went on vacation this smells so
freaking good best smelling hair
leave-in type treatment by far oh if you
like vanilla I mean it's like a rich
vanilla type scent and I'm one who is
always kind of trying to guard against
my hair getting too oily I'm really like
careful about that at the scalp but the
ends of my hair you know can't still get
rather dry especially when you're
swimming just being outdoors a lot I
feel like the hair can dry out even
faster and this is a great little thing
to spray in maybe after you've been in
the water and you've showered off and
you just want something to number one
help your comb through your hair a
little bit better I've used this on
Belle as well works really nicely
it's a leave-in conditioner it held
with detangling a bit but ultimately I
think it kind of restores the moisture
and softness on top of it all it smells
great I'm sure they sell this in a
bigger size this is just the two ounce
size so carry on friendly if you're
traveling or you just want to try
something new and not get a huge size of
it this is so good and anything that
helps you get through a kid's hair
faster you know Bell has long hair and
its really fine like mine it's tangle
prone and she tries to tough it out like
when I'm going through it if we hit kind
of a snarl her eyes are just like well
up immediately it's like hitting a nerve
or something so that helps a lot now you
may not be able to tell too much on
camera because my camera noise is making
me a little bit lighter than I truly am
i wonder how much my sunburn shows oh
there you can see sup Dan laughing I
freaking burned while I was on vacation
we were there for a week and it was on
Wednesday and I'd spent a lot of time
well first off I think at the beach that
day but also by the pool and we had this
spray thing of Coppertone sunscreen it's
like ajust a copper tone kids SPF 50 but
you know kids sunscreen can be used on
adults really doesn't matter I don't
think that was the thing it was an issue
here I think it was just the staying
power of the sunscreen even though I
reapplied even though yes I did go on
and rub it in even after I sprayed it on
it was just too lightweight it could not
hang it was just not doing the job and I
don't typically sunburn that much or
that easily but now several days later
as you can see this is kind of dying
down turning into a bit more of a tan
but I was definitely burned on top of my
legs even my stomach now my face did not
burn and I did have this an absolutely
ageless levon day mask lotion this is it
particularly a favorite I haven't been
using it that long but it's got SPF 30
in it and then on top of that I had the
Aveeno baby sunscreen
now that stuff I should have thought
more about this because I have used and
loved the Aveeno baby sunscreen for a
couple years now I think it's probably
been featured in a past favorites video
and that on my face I mean I didn't burn
it all maybe my nose got just a little
bit red but hardly anything and it was
on the girls do you know sensitive
baby's skin and they didn't burn it also
the Aveeno baby is a huge thumbs up I
love that stuff the copper tone spray on
like just in general I am definitely
going to be backing away from the spray
on sense
I think the reason why I've used them
quite a bit in the past is that they've
just they've gotten me through short
situations where I was outside for a
little while and it was enough but the
Florida Sun I think number one is a
different story and I think you just
really have to find something that's
gonna stay on your skin I think the
staying power of the Aveeno is really
fantastic but in recovery from the
sunscreen I had a couple of these things
on hand this is a mini size of the cup
re coconut melt and I really did like
this and this under ingredients it says
it is just coconut oil organic coconut
oil so maybe I'm not necessarily saying
like you have to have this because there
are plenty of coconut oils out there but
I put this on pretty much head to toe I
also did use some of the coconut face
cream no sunburn I use quite a bit of
this on my face and they both worked
really well I thought they felt very
soothing on the sunburn they moisturize
my skin very deeply you know aloe is
always a good choice after a sunburn as
well because it can feel really cooling
I just give you kind of an immediate
cooldown effect to the skin but it's not
always super deeply hydrating so I found
this kapowee
really really was I have enjoyed a lot
of different things from this brand
actually and it was nice to have this
small size of the coconut melt I didn't
have to go throw in a full-on jarred my
you know makeup do it something I feel
like I always come back to in the summer
months as a favorite or rediscovered
favorite is my it cosmetics CC plus
illumination this is in medium and part
of it might be the fact that I think the
medium shade when I get a little color
in my skin the medium shade of this
stuff is so so perfect and the
illumination version of this can be a
little intense at times you know they're
not playing with that concept I mean it
is very very illuminating now you're
seeing it on my skin with a little
powder on top and you know a little
concealer as well but there is something
I think very naturally beautiful about
this when you're doing minimal makeup
and I almost think the glowy version of
this can look more natural on the skin
under that circumstance when maybe this
is all you're gonna have on compared to
the regular CC cream even though I love
that stuff it's a little more matte on
the skin and this kind of gives you this
whole natural Sheen and I like that it's
not actually glittery but somehow it
does manage to
SuperDuper glowy it's also got that SPF
50 plus which is great you can wear it
very minimally like I said and just
really show off the glow or if you
decide to do something a little more
full coverage with your look the glow
can really be toned down just with
powders and concealers in different
areas you know what I'm saying but this
is always the kind of thing I want to
grab for what I feel like okay my skin's
got a little more color to it I really
want to show off the glow I think this
is gorgeous
also the staying power is really really
nice for me always has been with the
cosmetics CC cream products I've also
come across a concealer guys that I
think is a great little multitasker if
you'd like the peachy tone if you like
full coverage and you really try to
guard against your skin drying out it's
not quite as peachy as a race paste so
it's sort of like a fusion of a peachy
concealer and a regular concealer I'm
sorry to get so specific about this
shade because I know this won't be
everyone's perfect shade but it's
working so well for me it's the 110
ivory C color where it also says 0-1
beige on here but it's the Lancome taut
Adal ultra wear camouflage little goes a
long way with this product I put it on
the innermost corner this whole kind of
under-eye zone and my my I love the
coverage I love this shade happens to be
just a hair peachy which is kind of
perfect it makes me think a little bit
of the it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
but not quite as tacky and sticky as
that it's definitely a concealer I like
to set at least a little bit but I've
really been loving this stuff and I was
getting into it pre vacation but then
when I took it with me I was like yes
this is awesome here's another part of
my look that I think has been really
important lately and a powder that's
several powders that I like but this
Milani conceal and perfect powder so you
know they got the conceal imperfect
foundations very popular this is the
powder it says shine proof powder I have
it in zero three natural light and I
feel like this is Milan ease multitasker
powder basically all over again
multitasker was a great powder
foundation it had really nice coverage
it felt very very soft to the touch and
this has been a good shade for me
because it's maybe just a little deeper
than some other powders that I have and
you know if I go to set my under eye
let's say with the Maybelline fit me
powder in fair or the Laura
a powder or something that's slightly
more brightening on the under eye this
is a really nice powder to put
everywhere else or a good way to use it
is just truly as powder foundation like
you're maybe not thinking about wearing
a liquid foundation at all you're just
gonna conceal a few areas and set
everything this is so nice for that it
is mattifying it can definitely go there
coverage wise but I feel like I've used
it enough in both capacities either to
set foundation or as powder foundation
in itself and its really delivered in
any situation I think it's definitely
prolonged the staying power of my makeup
and as you're gonna see as I continue on
I've got a couple other powders that I
have not been so thrilled with and just
a little frame of reference comparison
here to another powder I know I talk
about a lot L'Oreal True Match I feel
like this is maybe a bit more coverage
than that product has but a really
similar feel and finish on the skin I
have really been into face pallets
lately a couple I've just been using the
heck out of my Too Faced natural face
palette this was really the gem of this
whole collection for me I mean I do love
some of the lipsticks also but in terms
of the new palettes that two faces come
out with they redid natural eye again
they redid natural matte and this puppy
right here I just love what they're
doing they've given you a bronzer
they've given you this kind of mix of
bronze and rose type shaker which I
consider a blush a couple of true blush
tones with the mauve and the pink couple
of highlights as well this was so
fantastic for travel the container here
the palette is durable as all get-out
at first when I reviewed this I thought
you know this bronzer is working for me
with kind of borderline fair light skin
but even as I've gotten more Sun I found
that bronzer to still be really really
nice I'm wearing that today I'm wearing
this pink blush which i think is so
fresh oh I just love a light light
dusting of that you do need to be kind
of light handed I think with your blush
colors right here because a little bit
does go a long way but I'm generally I
build it up slowly kind of gal so that's
fine for me and the highlight shades in
here what is pinky tone and one is more
golden so it's kind of nice to have that
option although that's gonna roll me
right into my next topic nothing beats
this and this glow kit from honest hacia
the sugar glow
oh my word when I was talking about the
best-selling highlights at Ulta in that
video where I compared five spoiler
alert if you haven't seen that yet this
one was a major winner for me I'm
wearing starburst today but I find every
tone in here wearable and unique and
you're getting a lot of product it's
just a tremendous value as you can see
better Scotch more golden gumdrop has
some pink eNOS to it I think it's a
beautiful blush topper and it might look
like it's gonna be a glitter frosty veil
but it's not it really does not look
glittery on the skin there's gum drop a
little more coolness to that shade and
then marshmallow has the warmth and the
golden age tone these highlighters are
just fun and that's all I can say like
when you finish your look and you think
okay it's coming together pretty well
and then you pop one of these on it's
like yes this is so good a few more
favorites guys not done yet here's an
eye liner favorite I'm so glad I
stumbled across this this was in like a
little goodie bag that I got when I went
to Houston with makeup revolution it was
for the Ulta a neural Managers
conference and they gave me this cool
little eyeliner pin and let me tell you
this is long wearing easy to apply and
very very black that is a felt tip there
at the end it's super fine but not so
tiny fine that you have to go over and
over your line again but one of the
biggest points about this and the thing
that I struggle to really hit on with a
liquid liner most often is the staying
power like if it's not gonna last if
it's gonna be smudging on my outer
corner or smearing into my tear duct
throughout the day the liner need not
apply it's got to do that that's a
deal-breaker if it can't stay and this
stays so well and I don't think this
claim to be waterproof but it definitely
gets through my days so well if you like
to swatch a little bit of this on your
hand like it's not going anywhere and
the intensity is totally there like I
said application is easy winged liner is
very easy with this for me it caps nice
and tightly which is very important with
these pen style liners and I still
really love my Milani 17-hour stain
matte but if you prefer to have
something in a pen style applicator I
think this is very handy also a very
subtle detail about this see how it's a
little bit thicker right here in the
middle it tapers down at both ends but I
find that they
like very easy to hold on to easy to get
a good solid grip with so if you're an a
liquid eyeliner beginner this might be a
great place to start
I showed this on my Instagram story
recently but the covergirl super sizer
just back in my life again
I mean this stuff we're taking it back
maybe a year and a half to two years on
my channel where I was initially talking
about this the brush is not really
impressive at a glance because you're
kind of seeing some short bristles and
then to sort of flat almost bold sides
to the brush but what that does is it
allows you to get some product on your
lashes and then you kind of turn it so
the bristles are sweeping it on through
and the end result is for me amazing
length like it's very very impressive
what this does and it's really good
about holding the curl as well in
comparison to some other mascaras I've
been using lately like lash paradise or
also it cosmetics superhero I feel like
the drying time on this it takes just a
little bit longer to dry but it's really
really impressive lengths so
rediscovered favorite I repurchase it
recently and I'm back in love with this
also got to tell you about what's been
going on in my brows lately I feel like
for weeks and weeks I've been using this
deep brown from ELF this is their $2.00
I think it's called instant lift maybe
or eye lift and this is the deepest
shade I've ever used in this and
something about it I feel like it's so
perfect for the tone of my brows the
deep brown color I think I've tried to
get away with lighter shades and they've
been OK workable fine but this is a
really great retractable brow pencil
it's gonna be thicker than a brow Wiz or
a NYX micro brow and for me that's okay
I think I can get the job done pretty
quickly with this actually and then
you've got the spoolie on the other end
it is normally capped but I lost that
somewhere between here and Florida just
really loving this stuff for the color
and the ease of application and also of
course the price and then I had seen
Lisa J on her Instagram story mentioning
this brow stylist boost and set from
L'Oreal and this I have in the shade
dark brunette and this was something
where I'd been sent it in PR but I
hadn't used it yet and she was talking
about how good it was and I was like ooh
let me double check and see if I have
that and
is a teeny-tiny little thing of a brush
here
and this is so great for adding a little
boost a little thickness a little tint
to the brows there's a product sort of
like this that I love from hard candy I
think it's called brow ink or something
they don't make that anymore so this is
that product all over again a really
really fine brush and I'll find I'll
fill in my brows you know in a
pinpointed manner with that pencil and
then kind of go back through with this
and the whole is phenomenal with this it
holds so well if you've got unruly brows
kind of thick brows that sort of want to
go their own separate way hey the little
hairs this really does a good job and it
was also nice on vacation because I felt
like if I just wanted something quick
didn't want to spend time slaving over
the brows I just sweep some of this
through when it'd be fine now I think
that's all the favorites I do have them
all listed here so I make sure I don't
forget anything but I got a few products
that were misses for me one big one that
I can't stress enough is the spray on
sunscreen that did me wrong and got me
all burnt but here's another one and I
know this is a love product for a lot of
people but for me I just can't get why
it's so special it's the Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish skin
perfecting powder I have this in shade
one fair and I just don't know it's a
nice textured powder it is soft to the
touch I don't see what makes this any
better than L'Oreal True Match though it
really doesn't have any sort of like awe
inspiring transformative effect in my
skin like suddenly I look airbrushed and
flawless it's in fact maybe a little
less coverage than the L'Oreal True
Match and I've of course said that the
Milani is more coverage than that so
this is more coverage than this one as
well it's mattifying I've used two in a
touch-up sense and maybe liked it a
little better just touching up with it
as opposed to actually working it into
my makeup application but it's a pricey
product it gets talked about as though
it is just absolutely next-level and I'm
not quite understanding why it is nice
and soft and smooth but so are a lot of
things out there I mean even that LA
Colors mineral pressed powder is
tremendous and feels maybe even creamier
than this stuff if you really go for
that kind of a
rich buttery feeling powders so I don't
know I in lighting you feel free to in
the comment section here's another
powder that I know some people like and
I travel with this I've traveled with
this on several occasions because for
one reason it's got the nice little
thing that covers up the sifter so I
don't feel like all the powder is gonna
completely shake out of this thing and
get all over my cap and everything else
but this is the cover FX perfect setting
powder and a lot of people really enjoy
this stuff I've got it in translucent
light I think it most definitely does
the job of like if you want to use it to
set or bake the under eye it really does
the job of taking away a tacky finish
but that's kind of where it ends for me
I don't feel like it adds any extra
coverage and the Laura Mercier loose
powder does and so does my Maybelline
fit me I'm wearing that Maybelline fit
me on the under eye area today I love
the way it looks I feel like those two
also wear really really well all day
long and this while yes it's giving me
the proper texture that I want to the
skin and I don't feel like it really
OverDrive's me it just doesn't give me
as flawless of a look as those other
products do that Maybelline powder I
tell you really really good stuff
definitely does the job here's another
thing I haven't actually watched any
reviews on so I'm not sure if the
internet community is loving this
product but I generally speaking do
really like the Marc Jacobs eyeshadow
palettes that are packaged in this way
these skinny palettes the black ones I
think have some brilliant color schemes
in there this is the iconic palette
infantis seen and it's come out with the
newer like summer collection and I got
it off of Sephora's website and I
thought maybe just maybe this is gonna
be like a perfect color scheme and I've
used it quite a few times and yes it's
pretty but I'm kind of bored by it when
you look at this shade and then this
shade and then this shade I mean we've
got like three variations on peach in a
palette with only seven colors I
should've maybe realize this more going
in but outside of the peachy shades your
only real statement type color is this
one which is really pretty it's very
pronounced but I feel myself turning out
the same kind of looks over and over
again and it's not a knock on the
quality because I think the textures of
the Marc Jacobs eyeshadows are just
tremendous and there have been some of
these eye
conic palates particularly just part of
the regular line the black packaging
that I think are just dynamite at this
one I think it's just the color
selection I'm not loving it in case you
were wondering what's on my eyes today
and it's something new to me that I'm
trying it's from Milani and it's the
everyday eyes must-have metallics I used
a lot of the gold this shade right here
definitely not favorite status yet
because I'm just now playing with it for
the first time but just in case you were
wondering that's what I'm usin and that
is it everyone I had a fun time catching
up with you talking about some of my
latest makeup finds and I just want you
to know I so appreciate you spending
time with me every week whether it's a
makeup video or the vlog your complete
kindness in the comments section I'm
always in awe and just so thrilled that
we have this positive really uplifting
community here on my channel so thank
you guys again and I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
