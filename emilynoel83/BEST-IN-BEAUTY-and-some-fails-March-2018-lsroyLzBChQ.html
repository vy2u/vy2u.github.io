joining me for my March favorites a
really wide range of things happening
here I definitely have some misses that
I want to incorporate into this video
this month it just seems like the right
time to sort of update you tell you a
few things that I tried that didn't work
out I've got a couple of really great
rediscovered gems and just some general
favorites as well let me start off with
one of those rediscovered favorites it
is the Becca and Chrissy Teigan
collaboration palette you remember when
this came out was it like two years ago
I don't know I I'm completely losing
track of time and when things happen but
it's a beautiful palette and I feel like
I like and appreciate it now a lot more
than I used to and what brought it back
to my attention was I stumbled across a
video Jenna Dewan Tatum has a youtube
channel I don't know if y'all knew that
but it's really good she's got a lot of
great videos there and she was doing her
makeup routine and she pulled this out
and I was like ooh that looks really
good on her and I was like I still have
that it's back in the back of a drawer
somewhere so around about a month ago I
pulled this out and started using it and
I really have enjoyed it so much I don't
think I ever really gave enough
attention to this bronzer before but I
really do like that the blush is a
gorgeous pop on the cheeks I'm wearing
everything today by the way now it does
kind of have two sort of highlighting
options here it's really hard to hold
this because it's so darn reflective but
the one up here is rose gold and the one
down here is peach nectar so this is the
shimmering skin perfecter that some of
you may have liked as an individual and
I like to put that kind of swirl it
right on the apple of my cheeks and then
take this really peachy Beach nectar
shade and kind of graze it over the top
of my cheeks and I love it I really love
the look plus I'm wearing it on my eyes
today I've got the bronzer in my crease
I've got the why do I want to call it
peach nectar but the shade called beech
nectar I put that on my lid and that's
pretty much it I love taking a palette
that already seems really multitasking
and just taking it the extra mile but
yeah I feel like when this first came
out maybe it was just among certain
other products that launched at the same
time like this maybe didn't grab me as
much do you ever think about that like
in the context of when something
launched were there other things that
were just capturing my attention more
but now that I've picked it back up I
mean I've been using it all the name
times so I love that
another fun rediscovered favorite it
cosmetics superhero mascara now I
recently decluttered my mascaras and I
found like a new tube of this stuff and
I was like oh yeah I loved that stuff
and it's got a really great brush and
there's just a very gentle curve to it
natural bristle brush there little bit
of a taper toward the tip I do find it
very easy to control and it builds
length and like a thicker look to every
lash just very very quickly and I've
always appreciated that about this
mascara but you know new things come in
you're always experimenting another
mascara that I've really been liking is
the Neutrogena hydro boost I mentioned
this in like my 5 must-have new
drugstore products such a good mascara
here seriously builds up such a pretty
kind of fanned out just beautiful
looking lash builds length really nicely
as well kind of a cone-shaped brush
there and I feel like it's a big deal
that I'm even talking about mascaras
because there are so many that I try I
get kind of disappointed by I just set
it aside or I'm just using it as a means
of getting a little something on my
lashes before I put falsies on so what I
really start feeling this satisfaction
level with certain mascaras I think it's
a really awesome thing and I do love my
lash paradise' still too don't get me
wrong but one thing I've not done for
the longest time is like layer 2
different mascaras and randomly I
started trying that here I put the
Neutrogena on first and then I thought I
wonder what would happen if I just like
kind of went over the tip like the outer
length of the lash with the superhero
and y'all it's just it's pretty huge
like I'm pretty dang thrilled with that
result on my lashes like look how long
they look I'm not saying you have to go
out and get superhero if you don't
already own it in order to make this
look good because they were already
looking pretty good with this but this
was just like the cherry on top the
icing on the cake if you own both of
these like just please go try that just
tell me how it went on your lashes cuz I
love that combo and on my lower lashes
it's always clump crush or
water-resistant just cuz I can trust
that stuff you know with my children
seriously though it does not smudge
moving right along I want to talk about
a BB cream that it feels a little bit
rediscovered because I had kind of
gotten on track using this for a bit and
I recently picked it up again and I just
think it's fabulous and it's the Garnier
skin active BB SPF 20 for oily combo
skin I swear I have a much different
experience with this than I used to have
with the original formula I don't know
what it is because this doesn't feel
especially like ultra mattifying or
something like that just has a nice
natural look on the skin and maybe
whatever is in here to make it more
friendly or oily combo skin is keeping
it wearing a little better throughout
the day because I'm definitely like just
a normal skin type but it comes in
light/medium here's the complaint on
this as far as I know this only comes in
light/medium now because it's a BB cream
and it's more sheer coverage that can
cover quite a spectrum of light skin
tones the butt gardenia you've got to be
making this for the deeper skin tones
too so they can get in on the
wonderfulness of this product because I
have this all over my skin and I think
it evens out in the most beautiful way
it actually does where well it's just
very very lightly set my skin I mean I
did not have any major dewy sticky tacky
feel and it just looks so fresh i blend
it in with a brush and I feel like it
gets the best coverage so any kind of
buffing brush this one happens to be
from Ecotools it's called airbrush
complexion but anything you know around
that size I think does a really good job
of just blending it into the skin and
then I take just a little extra of this
product and I build it up like right in
here kind of around the center of the
face where I could use a little extra
coverage and it's just it's so nice and
then you guys know you can take a fuller
coverage concealer and you can really
tackle like dark circles and any other
problem areas you have but if you're
generally speaking across most of your
face pretty even I find this to be a
very like satisfying coverage level to
me so I think that's so exciting new
moisturizer I've been playing with them
loving here is from a glow recipe and I
was just I was drawn in by the look of
this on Sephora's website like look at
that bottle isn't that beautiful and
it's called watermelon glow pink juice
moisturizer the name alone just
intrigued me and so I got it I've
started using it prior to makeup and
it's a very thin feeling moisturizer
you're kind of think like okay is this
gonna be one of those things that just
feels kind of watery on the skin and
before I know it I feel as though I
haven't even been boys dat all like
we've all been there with something
where you blend one blend and then the
whole feeling of moisture just leaves
you know this while it does feel very
thin
you at the same time feel deeply
nourished by it I feel like this has
been a wonderful step to actually
moisturize my skin very effectively
really preps the skin well keeps me
feeling hydrated but at the same time
it's thin and it's not like interfering
with the textures of the products that
you're layering up on your skin the
scent is outstanding and you might think
do I really want to go in with something
like really strongly fruity scent it on
my skin I wouldn't say it comes off as
super strong because the scent of
watermelon honestly is not like
something that knocks you over you know
what I'm saying it's just it's got that
sweetness and it's a very pleasant
experience I haven't quite a few new
skin care type things that I've been
experimenting with recently and I'm
thinking about just doing sort of a
whole roundup kind of thing talking
about some things that have worked out
just a little skincare odds-and-ends or
if you want to know my full routine that
I've been using lately could update you
on that as well but this stuff very nice
lip products if you watch that L'Oreal
video love love love the new color riche
shine formula please watch that if
you're even just slightly intrigued
about these because I try them all on
I point out my ultimate favorites one
shade that I've probably gotten the most
wear out of is the varnished rosewood
shade which is a classic your lips but
better sort of mauve it's just
completely easy wearable works with
anything and the amount of shine on
these guys they're like glosses in a
stick but yet when you press your lips
together if you didn't even know what
you just applied you'd probably think
hmm I just put a lip balm on so it's
like the best points of a gloss you know
that beautiful appearance the feel of a
balm and that beautiful easy format of a
lipstick another one that is so so
stunning what I'm wearing in this video
is luminous coral
I mean spring anyone anyone I don't like
to really take forever going on and on
about something that I know I did a full
video on but I'm just I'm giving it the
shoutout here another thing you know
that I've worn a ton concealer wise is
my makeup revolution conceal and define
c v you've seen it a couple times in
recent videos capable of really strong
coverage I just apply a little bit more
of it than I do of Tarte shaped tape and
for me that's still not a lot it's just
a little like boop boop and that's it
it's got a little more lightness to it
than shave tape I think if anybody has
found shaped it to be too heavy but they
still want
pretty darn close to that level of
coverage this would be a good thing to
try oh here's another lip product that I
think is pretty cool this is something I
could maybe do a full video hunt as well
because I just love doing lip color dry
odds but Revlon kiss plumping lip cream
I have all of these shades and when I
first unscrewed the tube I was
immediately disheartened to see that we
have not a doe foot nothing like that we
have a squeezy tube with that crazy
slant plastic edge there and that that
does not excite me there used to be a
time when a lot of things came out in
this format and I was always like taking
them off with my finger rubbing it in
with my finger and I never really loved
doing that here's the saving grace of
this product it is truly like a lip
cream there is some thickness to this
gloss it's not like it just comes
running and oozing out like a little
volcano lava out of this squeezy - it
actually has some thickness so therefore
when you do use the slant tip to blend
it all out on your lips it's thick
enough to kind of hold its own and it
doesn't just start streaking up or also
losing out of the - it's thick enough to
be easily controllable I guess is what
I'm getting at and the range is all like
very natural shades like kind of soft
peachy shades a handful of nudes in
varying intensities and this one called
almond suede I think is just lovely and
my goodness I see why I like it it looks
so so similar to that shade I just
watched this one right here is varnished
rosewood from L'Oreal and this is the
Revlon this is a little more brownish
I'm not sure if you're picking up on
that but a little less mauve a little
more Brown in this almond suede color
but it does look beautifully even on the
lips glossy but like I said the texture
is a cream it's definitely not too thin
and slippery I find the coverage of
these products like the amount of color
in them to be quite opaque even with the
lighter shades are they plumping what I
find is like maybe close to a minute 30
seconds to a minute in with wearing them
you start to feel this little bit of
coolness the plumping factor I think
it's all about illusion really with a
lot of these things it's about a lip
product that's thick enough and shiny
enough to basically wipe out the lines
in your lips and make them look more
filled out and full that's what's Happ
here really if plumping was not even on
this tube I would still say like these
are a nice quality whipped cream product
I'm still not in love with the fact that
it's a slant tip applicator but
surprisingly enough like I said it's not
really getting in my way of creating a
huge problem and I don't feel like I
have to you know go in with my finger
and interfere with the process like they
do apply fine and it's because of the
thickness of the lip cream here's a cool
little lip product thing that you may or
may not already know about Maybelline
has something called the super state
eraser lip color remover this is really
handy for those of you who like to wear
a very long wearing lip product and even
by the end of the day some of its
hanging around like those certain liquid
lipsticks that just really hang on and
maybe you struggle a little bit with
removing them or you feel like you have
to be too rough on your lips with your
washcloth or makeup wipe or whatever
you're using to take it away has anybody
done that you feel like gosh I shouldn't
be treating my lips this bad well this
little stick actually kind of helps melt
everything down and Urban Decay has
something similar which I really like
but this would be I think the drugstore
alternative to that it's just this
really smooth stick you can put it on
your lips let it sit there for I don't
know 10 20 seconds and then wipe away
and sometimes with certain things I have
to go back and repeat that step but no
more than two steps and you've really
got everything nicely removed without
being really harsh and tough on your
lips one other little update here on my
Milani 17-hour where stay put liner
which I am loving it's really it's it's
working so well as far as liquid liners
I'm so excited to have found something
that does not lose intensity throughout
the day does not smudge and smear you
know around on your inner corner
whatever just completely stays in place
I'm really a fan so I love the classic
matte black but I just wanted to update
you that the coffee matte the dark brown
is also really really beautiful
something that I kind of noticed that I
like about this is you put on the matte
Brown and then you've got your super
dark
you know black mascaras and and using
the brown as your liner I mean it's near
black guys it's it's close to black but
using that
and then having your really black
mascara it almost makes the lashes stand
out even more effectively does anybody
know what I'm getting at there but I
just want to throw that out there the
brown is also nice as well as the black
and both are matte now let's talk about
a few fails from Revlon this Revlon kiss
exfoliating balm not a fan it's put
together much with the same idea is elfs
lip exfoliator 's accept elfs are way
way better elfs are the perfect like
concoction combination of the grit and
the balm and I feel like I don't have to
spend like ages rubbing it across my
lips in order to feel legitimately
exfoliated with this yes you can feel
the little scrubbing action taking place
but so much balm ends up getting
deposited on your lips so by the time I
feel like I've finally gotten enough
scrubbed down on my lips I've also got a
ton of excess product and I know that
that's probably to make your lips also
feel hydrated in the process of being
exfoliated and I think they've got a
good intention here but that elf stick
just like hangs together so much more
solidly and you don't have all this bomb
depositing along with the scrubbies
because typically when I use that I'll
follow up with my own bomb you know
separate step I will get my lips free of
any scrubby residue and then I'll do the
balm step I don't really need them being
one in the same you know what I mean
here's another thing from Revlon that
I'm not digging and it's mainly for the
format because I don't completely hate
the foundation it had okay staying power
on me I mean straight up medium coverage
but this instant filter foundation like
what are they doing here this sponge and
then you take the top off and guys I
have stains on my carpet from where I
took the top off a little too vigorously
and this super liquidy foundation will
just like fly it's coming up through a
hole here that you twist up and then I
guess you can use this to dab it around
on the skin I certainly wouldn't use
this sponge to attempt to blend it onto
my skin I have to pull in something else
it's like they're trying to control this
really liquidy foundation that would
probably best be delivered in just a
squeeze tube or maybe a pump but again
to get attention you know brands got to
try to reinvent the wheel with stuff and
it looks okay on my skin but I hate how
careful I have to be with this and then
you know you twist it up and then
suddenly this little bit of liquid will
appear at the top and then you got to go
back and twist again okay how many times
do I have to twist now I just think it's
a frustrating design and finally an
eyeshadow primer that I really am NOT
digging here and I have used this in my
elf video because I didn't have an elf
eyeshadow primer and so like before I
started in with the eye shadow step I
just threw on something else and I used
this photo focus from Wet n Wild and I'm
realizing that this is way too thick
like I start blending this on my eyes
and I've really got a tug to feel like
I've blended it out across my lids and
then I feel like it practically makes my
upper part of my lid want to like stick
and downward like stick and cling a
little bit to the part of my lid that's
closer to my lashline it's really weird
I've never had that issue with anything
else
overly tacky too tacky and I don't get a
real even application of it because it's
wanting to cling to certain areas and
I've got a rub so hard you don't want to
rub and pull on that eye area too much
guys and then I felt like I did notice a
couple of spots in my eye shadow look in
that elf video when I was going back and
editing where I thought gosh like there
was one little area where I didn't think
the shadow really applied evenly and I
thought I wonder if I even got the
primer blended over that spot so if
you're wondering about eye primers and
what I would recommend I mean I always
have really consistent good luck with
the Milani eyeshadow primer if you're a
fan of Urban Decay primer potion I mean
that has worked really well for me also
that Marc Jacobs coconut primer I don't
feel like I would need to spend the
money to repurchase that but that does
work well but this is just an odd
unusually thick texture I think it's
going to actually cause you trouble to
use that so friends those are the
favourites the rediscovered favorites
the fails I'm giving you everything I
can give you in this video thank you so
much for watching and by the way did
anybody figure out what's on my shirt
here they're a tea bitty ladybugs I got
that from Target it was not really
impressed with the selection of target
shirts and tank tops when I went but I
did find this one and I loved it so
anyway thank you guys again I hope
you're having a great day and
we'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
