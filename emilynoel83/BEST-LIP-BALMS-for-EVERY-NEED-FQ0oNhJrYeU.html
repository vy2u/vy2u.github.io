on here and talking to the camera and
I've got my full face done but I've got
no lip product on because I thought I
would just kind of try things on as I go
in this video and we're gonna be talking
about lip balm I mean is there a more
like core basic essential thing that
everybody can use kids all the way up to
any age lip balm was totally like the
gateway makeup product for me I mean
when I was a little kid I would eat lip
balm
I've got lip balm running through my
veins so I'd love to talk about lip balm
and I was so glad that this video was a
viewer request o'licious said I think it
was in a youtube comment she said tell
us about the best lip balms for certain
reasons like before lipstick or bedtime
are going on outside you know all
different lip balm needs and I thought
that was brilliant and I love outlining
and categorizing so that's what we're
here to do first thing I'm gonna
recommend here it's lip exfoliating this
step is like basically getting your lips
to that clean slate place where they can
best receive the lip treatments you're
putting on so if you've got dry flaky
cracked lips and some people say well I
use the lip exfoliator but my lips are
so dry like they need more or something
if your lips are legit like a dry flaky
hot mess what you should probably do
first is put like a little bit of a balm
on your lips and just to soften all that
dry cracky stuff and then exfoliate cuz
then I think you'll see a little bit
more of a result from it right now my
lips are in pretty darn decent condition
because of another product that I've
been talking about but I am gonna go
ahead and exfoliate with this elf lip
exfoliator and I have it here in a rose
and it smells fabulous and you just kind
of rub it across your lips like this and
the grit is in the stick so you're not
gooping in with your finger to some pot
of lip scrub and trying to make it go
like this is just the actual scrubbing
happening here but it just feels super
gritty and you just run it across your
lips a little bit like this you don't
just spend too long with it but it's a
nice thing to do maybe in the mornings
or even
nighttime before bed routine would be a
good time to do this but this is
basically the scrubby's like suspended
in a bowl there's a nice concentration
of them and then when I get done I just
kind of DAB off like this because
there's usually a little bit of
scrubbing residue but now the lips feel
SuperDuper smooth the first ball might
want to recommend or the first type of
lip balm because there's multiple like
cents you could get this is a balm for
absolutely any person any occasion man
woman child like you got dry lips and
you just need a good solid lip balm to
reach for I would go for Nivea and this
one happens to be the kiss of milk and
honey version they also have a minty one
I don't know if they still do the olive
oil and lemon but that one's great too
and then they make a variety of
different tints that I want to be like
trying out as well this feels so good
they've got a great formula going here
because there is that a bit of thickness
to it what I like to see in a really
good lip balm is that hint of thickness
that kind of cling to the lips
I don't want thin greasy slipping off of
my lips I want to feel like yes it's
just hanging on there and not only does
that mean that it's gonna be more deeply
hydrating your lips but generally the
thicker the balm the better it's gonna
just stay on there so common sense tells
me that if the bombs gonna be staying on
my lips longer my lips are gonna be
taking advantage of the hydration longer
and I'm not gonna have to be worried
about the reapplication thing so a Nivea
lip balm under any circumstance I think
is a good thing I'm gonna get that off
here so we can get a clean slate lip
balm Tryon videos are real pleasure
compared to the liquid lipstick your
ions I gotta tell you something to wear
under like a lipstick or whatever lip
color you're wearing is kind of a lip
primer I have been using this so much
lately
in this respect and it's my EOS sweet
mint and I'm saying specifically the
sweet mint because not every formula in
the EOS line is exactly the same some
have a little drier texture I even
noticed within the kit that I got for
the holidays it was like a trio and they
aren't all exactly made the same but the
sweet mint is a perfect texture and I've
talked about using EOS this way before
and this is kind of a rediscovered thing
but this is even a little bit thicker I
hate to describe a lip balm as do
because it's truly plenty of moisture
it's just got a little less slip to it
than the Nivea and so therefore I think
it's great under lipstick the scent of
this like wakes me up it's truly like
Orbitz sweet mint gum in a lip balm I
think of using it this way like you put
your moisturizer on maybe you do a
little lip exfoliating every few days or
something and then apply this and let
this start to soften your lips as you're
doing your whole makeup application
particularly in these drier months it
can be nice to have this layer
underneath whatever lip product you're
wearing also let's say you've just got a
great lip liner that you love even
really nice lip liners can be a little
bit dry sometimes going across the lips
and all it takes is a bit of balm to
help that particular shade glide on more
smoothly so this is just a nice prep
step I think for the lips next up is the
product that made me think I have to do
this video soon because this is
something I have been using at night
before bed and I'm a believer okay this
is not a cheap drugstore fine but it is
the hype is real over this this is the
Laneige special care lip sleeping mask
and what this says is wake up to baby
soft lips this relaxing berry infused
overnight mask is enriched with berry
mix complex and vitamin C and leaves
lips soft and smooth guys I will put
this stuff on in the evening okay
like after dinner or something like if I
don't already have some long-wearing
thing on my lips and I'll put this on
and my lips still in the morning when I
get up they feel awesome like it's
downright transformative for the lips
not even kidding so you put it on this
is the appearance that it has on the
lips there's a little bit of shine as
you put this on your lips and it kind of
meshes with the heat of your body you
feel it almost melt down a little bit on
the lips but I put you know a decently
thick amount on and you know there are
those products that like you put on your
lips right away and you're like oh I
just love having this on my lips because
it feels so smoother it looks a little
shiny you know whatever it's a nice
experience as it's on the lips but this
is one of those true products that even
the long after this has actually worn
off your lips feel so good like
a great intensive treatment and this is
a big tub of product here I feel like
I'm gonna have this a long long time
because I'm literally only putting it on
before bed and my lips have felt so
great in the morning all of your lip
stuff is gonna look better because
you've been using this kind of product
underneath I would say give it as a
stocking stuffer but it almost requires
I think more razzmatazz than that like
put it in a big fabulous box and be like
it's a lip mask enjoy it smells
fantastic - to me it smells like
strawberries and cream I love it I don't
even want to be taking this off but the
show must go on okay so we've talked
about the exfoliator we talked about
just general all-purpose lip balm with
the Nivea
gos for your lip prep this is your
before bed what I'm left with here are
some good tinted lip balm options and
Neutrogena dominates here this is where
they just no doubt they do awesome lip
balm e-type thing several things worth
mentioning here even though I know
you've heard me talk about them before
they're revitalizing lip balms first of
all just the best shape can we start
just by default making lip balms in this
oval shape because they go on so
perfectly this way these have an SPF 20
and then there's a small range of shades
I've talked about the soft caramel which
looks like just a like a light nude kind
of on the lips lately I've been keeping
the sunny berry shade in my purse that's
just good for any time any look this one
is called petal glow this was one of my
more recent purchases here so I'll just
put that on but I love how they supply
so easy color wise these are on you know
the very subtle end I wouldn't even
think I needed a mirror to put any of
these on and like I said the control of
application is totally there with this
oval shape but this is petal glow and
it's got just the tiniest bit of pink in
here and I hope to get across in this
video is like you know there are all of
those colourless lip bumps that I
mentioned that are great but when you go
out in the day and you're like okay I've
got to have some color on my lips you
don't have to sacrifice that concept
because there are colored lip products
that can bring that life in that color
and that energy to your face but are
still completely 100% feeling like a
balmy lip treat
so they're revitalizing lip-balm is one
thing and y'all know what i'm gonna
mention here the moisture smooth color
sticks these are North Dakota tested I
mean in the wintertime they're wonderful
the one complaint I might hear on these
is from people who say the scent is kind
of strong and they're right it is strong
I kind of like it because it makes me
nostalgic for those days when I would
open up a packet of kool-aid and just
take a whiff half of a packet that's
kind of what this is but over the last
few years they've really expanded their
shade range they've got bright shades
dark shades a really great nude I'm
gonna try on a couple of colors here
that I've been wearing more recently
well what everything has in common that
I'm mentioning in this video is the
thickness you know I don't want to slip
and slide thing going on my lips I just
want it to cling I want the hydration to
last I don't want that feeling of I
gotta go back and reapply reapply
reapply just stay on my lips and do your
job so one classic shade that has been
in this line from the beginning of
moisture smooth color sticks is this
sweet watermelon it's got a little bit
of shimmer whenever I wear this I feel
like it's instant youth you know like on
the lips it's just this light kind of
easy wearable shade and the moment you
press your lips together for the first
time after putting this on just feel it
just slow down let yourself feel that
mmm you put this on before bed and then
you keep your lips covered in this stuff
by day and you will just have the best
lips in town
that's lips in town where am i coming up
with this stuff pink nude is another
great shade look at this this is just
creamy this doesn't have any of the
shimmer like is this not just a gorgeous
nude in its own right just talking color
here long-standing favorite everyone
tried and tested I have heard so much
feedback on these these Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks over the
entire life of my channel these might be
the things that I've heard the most
positive feedback on from people who are
like yes I went and tried it I loved it
these are great and it's not just Pink's
in the lineup like I said there are
corals there are deeper berry colors you
can wear that and have that level of
hydrating lip treatment all day long but
actually be wearing a full-on opaque
color so that's really cool the last
thing I want to mention here is another
tented lip balm option because it's just
undeniably great I started to kind of do
into my stash of these in recent days
and I was reminded of just how nice
these are very luxurious
it's from fresh and it's their sugar
line of lip balms so this is sugar rose
I'm gonna go ahead and put this on this
is a mini and the minis one thing you
have to be aware of is they can be a
little fragile sometimes that balm stick
can move a little bit just apply light
pressure this rose shade though is kind
of like my current favorite from the
line because how natural is that and
what this really makes me think of is
kind of a similar thickness to the
Neutrogena but somehow there's sort of a
line filling thing happening here
because I swear whenever I put on any of
the tinted shades from this line and I
look up close at my lips I see no
texture it's like just smoothness and
yet not a ton of shine either because
sometimes you only get that feel when
you put on let's say a really thick like
ultra shiny lip gloss you know and then
you look up close at your lips I'm like
wow what do you know they look perfect
but to get that from a lip balm I think
is really cool and I have so loved and
the berry shade is well a little more
colorful I've got the tulip shade in my
purse which is one of their newer ones
and that's more of just a straight-up
pink and then I've got just the regular
here as well and I sense just a hint of
lemon in the scent with these SuperDuper
Pleasant ultra comfortable if you were
looking for a nice little gift I mean I
know Sephora sells different sets and
probably other retailers have different
configurations of those but they're very
very nice so that's it everybody I hope
this helped you out if you're looking
for some really nice things for your
lips I mean I think we've got about
every category covered here I think it's
a great time of year to be thinking
about treating your lips as the weather
gets colder and I love the fact that not
only do we have classic colourless balms
in this video but I also love the
thought that you can wear something
tinted with a little color and still be
getting great treatment all throughout
the day sort of like thinking about your
lips a little less from a makeup
perspective and more from a skincare
perspective and I think your lips will
thank you for it and I think you might
just win best lips in town so thank you
guys so much for your time I hope you
enjoyed and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
