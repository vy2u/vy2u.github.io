me I am excited to bring you today's
video it was really like a work in
progress
kind of complicated so I'll give you the
backstory on why I am doing this first
off on Monday I shot a video with the
Charlotte Tilbury an instant look in a
pallet $75 pallet it's got the film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow products and here a couple
of cheek products three eyeshadows and
it claim to be able to create a
five-minute face along with like your
foundation and your brow product and all
that I did that challenge I executed it
I was able to do it in five minutes
enjoyed the look and really enjoy this
palette and while I knew this palette
has been kind of difficult to come by I
didn't realize it was totally out of
stock for good I emailed a PR person for
Charlotte Tilbury and they got back to
me and said no this is never coming back
this is gone for good and I had asked on
Twitter you know you guys still want me
to do this video but after hearing that
it is literally never coming back and a
lot of my video was kind of raving about
how much I liked this I just thought you
know there's got to be a way I can make
this video more useful and more
beneficial for the people watching
because well I really do like the
quality of the things in this palette
another part of it another aspect that I
enjoy is just the multitasking ability
the fact that there are so many things
in one you know if you're going
somewhere this is space-saving this is
easy it's kind of no-brainer like boom
here the shades you can put on so I've
kind of been looking around for some
other palettes that I thought would also
be multitasking that could also you know
have at least more than one function
inside but I want to let you guys know
my very favorite part of this palette is
um the face bronze side and then the
face highlight side and they are the
same as the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow
which i purchased this a lot of you when
I had mentioned Charlotte Tilbury way
back in another video you guys said
you've got to try this particular
product and it's funny because this
looks so light but it's such an
effective natural contour I love it and
the highlight is just really gorgeous as
well like perfect amount of glow so I
guess it's kind of nice to know that my
favorite part of this palette the part
of this palette that I found to be the
absolute best is something you can still
purchase however I do like the
blushes you've got two different tones
of that and then three eyeshadows which
I like I think creates a very simple
very easy look but the shadows would
probably be the least unique or least
remarkable part of this palette you know
so it's got a nice big mirror in there
and once I learned that that is never
being sold again I thought oh well shoot
I've got to come up with some
alternatives so I've got a few
multitasking face palettes that I found
that I want to mention several that are
newer to me and then several that I kind
of went through my collection and found
one of them is from pixie and this is
the brand available at Target and by the
way everything is for sure at least half
the price of the Tilbury palette if not
like around a third of the price but
this one around $24 at Target and it's
the pixie book of beauty and I think
there may have been a couple options
with this and I got the one labeled
minimal makeup because as I looked at it
it really struck me as having some
similarities to the Charlotte Tilbury
palette this comes with two beautiful
highlights neither of them contain
glitter but they do have a really pretty
shimmer one's a little more baiji one's
a very bright pearl type shade a
beautiful matte peach blush a shade it
actually does kind of remind me of that
contour in the Tilburg palette because
it's very subtle and I contoured with it
today it gives you that very light
understated contoured look but depending
on your skin tone I think this could be
like a pretty neutral blush as well and
then you have for eyeshadows here these
two are met these two have a little bit
of shimmer once kind of a soft a little
bit peachy beige there's a dark bronze a
light matte creamy color and a dark
matte Brown and as far as multitasking
palettes go I find everything in here to
be completely usable really nice quality
the one thing that I guess I don't
really love about this palette is that
the windows here are not like a really
solid plastic there's a little bit of
bendiness happening there it's not like
super loose and maybe I'm just a little
like overly concerned about that issue
with palettes I mean odds are you're
probably not going to have any issues
here it does have a good magnetic
closure but I like this palette a lot
and it
kind of remind me of what's happening
with the Tilbury palette in terms of
offering highlights blush a potential
contour shade and eye shadows all in one
now in my hunt and my newfound obsession
for multitasking palettes I discovered
Pacifica and I know this isn't a brand
new makeup line but it's definitely new
to me this is my first thing I've tried
and it's the natural minerals solar
complete color mineral palette says all
you need to look naturally gorgeous and
the palette is really kind of a thick
book like palette but this is what
you've got on the inside a really
gorgeous blush a bronzer there are three
kind of like cream to powder texture
highlights and then six eyeshadows and
just let me dive into the texture these
first the way these shadows feel I mean
I don't think I've ever felt anything
quite like that it's like they feel so
silky and so light and so smooth as you
graze your finger across them it's like
there's zero resistance they are so
light you don't even expect to look at
your finger and see product there but
sure enough you've got a full-on
colourful swatch so they're pigmented
but they're just incredibly lightweight
and what did it say about the products
here um it says six coconut infused
long-lasting creaseless eyeshadows and I
definitely use these on top of a primer
as I do with any eyeshadow but holy cow
that's a fun shadow experience there for
anybody who's really into the texture
and feel of products and it's the same
kind of deal with the blush and bronzer
too a little less extent I mean they're
still pigmented and creamy but those
shadows are really something else and I
don't want to take anything away from
the illuminators up top which like I
said these kind of strike me as
something that feels really creamy when
you first put your finger on them but
then as you blend them out on the skin
or blend them between your fingers you
feel that instant dry down so they
really strike me as a cream to powder
and you're getting one that's kind of
golden I'm wearing some of that a little
bit on the top of my cheeks and also one
that's kind of peachy I wore that one
right on the apple of my cheeks and then
there's a pink one in the middle I am
wearing this as my blush holy Wow
I love that color Lance a do you think
what's going on with that blush it's
like dark peachy rose it's very
different than a lot of things that I
have in my collection it's got that
little kind of bronze neutral thing
happening I love it I wore the bronzer
as well just kind of dusted all over my
skin does have a little bit of shimmer
and I would say a downside to this
palette is that everything in here has
shimmer although I was able to get a
full eye look that I'm satisfied with
just keep in mind there's nothing truly
mint in here so what I did do on my eyes
I couldn't stay away from this color
right here that's pretty like light
turquoise I put that all over the lid I
use some of this dark brown in the outer
corner and because it's so dark I think
that's what allows you to not maybe
notice so much shimmer in that shade
when you put it on the eyes so that's in
my outer corner I've got some of this
really dark bronze in the crease and
then I haven't done a ton of lower liner
lately but I did dark brown in my
waterline and really smudged out both of
these shades on the lower lash line as
well so really happy with the look that
I got pleasantly pleased and surprised
with the quality of Pacifica products so
if you're looking for kind of a new
summery palette like reinvent your look
type of thing this might be it because
I'm very excited about this color here
it's kind of like a very soft rose gold
this true golden e shade again so so
soft love the way those shadows feel now
there's another palette that I've tried
it's a little less multitasking but I'm
still really really happy with it
quality wise and just the color
selection that's in here and it's from
Stila they've come out with these
perfect meet perfect hue palettes I
don't know if you've had a chance to
browse the selection but these are
actually categorized and sold by skin
tone and I went for the one that was
labeled medium tan because from the
picture I saw on ulties website I just
thought the look of these shadows really
appealed to me they just seemed like the
most interesting eyeshadows and I
thought well I'm sure I can make those
blushes work on me too and what do you
know I love this palette texture of the
eyeshadows first off reminds me so much
really takes me back to the textures in
those rectangular kind of cardboard
palettes you know there was one labeled
in
light he had in the garden in the
whatever I really loved the way those
eyeshadows felt so soft so creamy and
you've got two mats here really dark
brown and also a very dark plum a light
shimmery shade that can still work as a
highlight on my skin tone and then a
beautiful rose gold over here there's
also a shade that's labeled like a base
color too blushes here and this is
inspiring and this is called mysterious
kind of shimmery deep peach and then
this one over here is like a classic mob
all gorgeous shades all really nice
quality I would really encourage you to
look into this line one downside would
be if you were expecting multi tasking
that took you through the highlighting
and the contouring and all things like
that it's more minimal it's also smaller
so that might be a bonus to some people
but if you like the idea of a little
eyeshadow blush combo pack and colors
that work really well together this
might be something to check out now I
just want to remind you guys of a few
pallets that I've talked about in the
past that I think are impeccable quality
and also do happen to offer a lot of
multitasking first off these NYX go-to
palettes the quality in these palettes
I've raped and raved on the pop palettes
it's just like those this is the best
NYX eye shadow texture in these palettes
and those palettes but I have seen them
create I mean it's really high-end
feeling very very pigmented so you're
getting six eyeshadows in each of these
you also get a contour of blush and a
highlight so a lot going on for like 17
bucks I think it's really worth that
price tag even though you're thinking
well it's NYX and it's a drugstore type
brand this one called wanderlust this is
going to be your little bit warmer
palette the shadows go a bit more bronzy
golden your blush is a little bit more
peachy here and then in the other
palette this is called bon voyage and
here you've got a couple more like kind
of jewel tone type eyes shadows kind of
a cooler look overall and then your
blush is more pinky but the quality also
of the face products you know really
really nice stuff so I just wanted to
remind you that those are still out
there and still available and then
lastly this one who could forget I mean
the Boehm does multitasking it as good
or better than anyone else because they
always know how to separate off those
creams that's how you do it other brands
you put a flap over your cream products
so your powders don't get you know all
messy in there I know I've talked about
this a lot but if you're new to my
channel I'll just give you a quick
description here these are all products
that exist in the bones line um the eye
shadows all come from different pallets
that the balm has made so shady lady
pallets new tude balm Jovi you've got
all these shadows here a couple of them
kind of dark and smoky with this dark
plum that's a matte also a dark olive
green love this kind of mischievous
Marisa rose gold shade and then a cooler
kind of greyish taupe silver throw in
mary lou manizer as well which is like a
cult favorite highlight and then all of
these cheek products hot mama blush in
stain blush in Argyle cabana boy blush
and Bahama Mama bronzers so there is so
much happening over here that can
multitask for you you can do different
things you can use these as eyeshadows
if you want to that highlight is of
course very versatile and then on this
side you've got how about them apples
blush and a balm girls lipstick it's
called in the balm of your hand volume
one so I'm expecting a volume two to
come out someday so it's been an
interesting week it's been a week of
discovery for me because I really
started off thinking you know gosh this
is the only thing out there that really
does all these different things in one
palette then you really get to looking
and you discover there are a lot of
other options that are a fraction of the
price not that I don't love this I
really think this is great but if it
ain't coming back if it's not going to
make another appearance on the market at
any point in time I think it's good to
have other options so thank you guys for
watching I hope this was useful to you
and fun I so so appreciate your
viewership your kind comments I don't
even feel deserving of the sweetness
that you put out there to me but thank
you so much for offering that up letting
your light shine being such positive
people in the world I thank you so much
and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
