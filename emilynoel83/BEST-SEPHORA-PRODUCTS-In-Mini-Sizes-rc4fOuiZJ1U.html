is gonna be all about Sephora minis mini
sized products mini versions of what are
likely really popular makeup products
and they recently if you were on the
front page of Sephora within the last
any few weeks they sort of reap remoted
this idea of look at all these minis
we're selling and it wasn't just
individual things but also sets of minis
which of course really start cropping up
this time of year in anticipation of the
holidays so I thought it might be fun to
point out some of these products that I
really like that are available in a mini
size so if you want to try them out and
spend a little less or maybe you're a
major you know makeup lover makeup
collector and the thought of buying a
full sized quantity of product is kind
of an issue for you and you think well
I'll never use that or it's gonna take
me a really long time to use that up if
I could buy it in the mini sized I
prefer to have that so I think there can
be some real advantages to the minis and
in a lot of cases I'm gonna be showing
you just for visual purposes the full
size that I have here but the cosmetics
CC cream this is available in a mini
size on Sephora's website and i think
this is one of the most fantastic
coverage foundation e type products that
i have it's the real all in one thing
you know this can moisturize my skin
this does give really amazing coverage
the best coverage out of any CC BB type
product that i have it's got SPF 50 in
it I'm wearing it right now I just love
the way it looks on my skin I'm about
out of this tube I also have the
illumination version which i think is
really nice as well the downfall of the
mini on Sephora's websites that they're
only giving it in a light or medium I
wear medium I'm pretty certain they make
that product an affair and also some
deeper shades definitely as well so why
are they not putting those out in minis
because it seems like the whole point of
maybe trying a product would be do I
like the coverage do I like the formula
can I find a shade that works for me and
if they're not gonna put minis out in
all shades I think that's kind of a
problem so I guess I'm kind of calling
them out for that but I do love this
product and I don't know maybe in store
they're offering more shades of minis
maybe this is just an online oversight I
do think this is a fabulous product and
if it's something you're looking to try
in a smaller size I mean I'd go for it
okay here's another thing that
absolutely love holding it here in the
full-size but they sell it in a mini and
it's the laura mercier translucent
setting powder so so good I've recently
talked quite a bit about the two-faced
peach powder I thought this video might
be a good opportunity to kind of compare
the two or sort of the different
purposes for each the peach I really see
as kind of a finishing powder a
mattifying like lightly dusted all over
the skin type of powder it's also a very
nice light like dusted over the
under-eye with a brush kind of thing and
I feel like okay I've got a more
perfected look there but this powder
what it's going to do is add a little
more coverage to the skin in places
where you use it and this is the baking
powder
I've tried baking with the peach it just
doesn't quite have as much of an effect
I've baked my under-eye concealer with
this I mean and if you want the most
flawless looking under-eye that's
something you might want to try doing
and this powder does it the best of
anything and I don't feel like I
actually have to use a boatload of
product I mean when you watch people
bake you see like a ton going on there I
don't even feel like I have to use that
much of this really to get the job done
and get a really flawless looking under
eyes so I think even having a small size
of this would probably be plenty for
quite some time
Urban Decay all nighter they're selling
this in a mini size they also sell
diesel akin and mini and I think they
might have a couple different variations
of different setting sprays that come
with one or the other you know like
smaller duos this again is the full size
that I have here this is a makeup
setting spray that I can really 100%
stand behind I think this as well as Dee
slick really lock in the staying power
well what I've noticed on my skin after
I apply them they don't do a lot to make
my skin look super like supple and dewy
or whatever like right after I spray it
on it my skin just kind of maintains the
same look overall there are different
mists and things that make your skin I
think appear instantly more hydrated and
the ones that come to mind would be the
hard candy sheer envy primer mess talks
about these a lot sorry for the broken
record but the Mario Badescu sprays are
kind of that way as well but all nighter
and then D slick if you're especially
oily those really have a profound effect
on staying power now I'm not wearing
this right at this moment because I am
making a commitment to see if my Milani
make it last spray can come close
what this is doing standby for my full
thoughts on that I will follow up I
promise I'm just really trying to figure
it out right now but if you want a
really tried-and-true great setting miss
that's going to extend the wear of your
makeup
I think the all-nighter is a great one
to try and they do have D slick too okay
Bobby Brown's shimmer bricks they have
these in a couple of shades including
bronze in a mini sized for $25 and I
have the bronze actually within this
palette this is a wonderful multitasking
product it's so good because the range
within this powder is so extreme you've
got everything from a very light
highlight some very rose gold coppery
bronzy colors and then a really nice
deep rich bronze here my eyeshadow today
is only this my highlighter on my skin
today is this I really centered my brush
right in there my blush brush to give me
my blush today a light dusting of the
entire thing all over the skin for a
little bit of a bronze glow I mean it
can do so much it's really good quality
it's nice pigmentation I just love the
variation between all the colors and
then for eyeshadow you know this is
absolutely going to be a great crease
shade that you can use you can work in
the Koppers or the lightest shade on
your lid you can smudge them out on your
lower lash line you know it's a totally
workable practical multi-purpose product
the last individual product that I ran
across that I really really love that
they're selling in a mini is the Gen
nude matte liquid lipsticks in a couple
of shades including one of my favorites
which is vos and that's what I'm wearing
today mmm
is it not just the all-purpose works for
anything color like I love this I love
it going into fall and winter it's just
got that little bit of richness to it
dusty rose to the max you know it's just
so nice and I love this formula well it
can transfer off I've said it before
I'll say it again you know you can pull
a little bit of color away from your
lips with this product it's not a 100%
budge proof thing yet as it wears down
it wears so evenly I think it's because
it's not attaching to your lips in this
dry layer feels comfortable looks matte
you know if that's the look you're going
for and this shade called boss I love it
now the other shade that they have it
appeared to be a little more pinky and
it's called swag but man such a good lip
color
that shades so much and then while we're
on the topic of minis outside of just
individual products you can get some
great values especially this time of
year with little sets of minis so I
thought I'd throw out a few of those
that I think are really good and one
that I've reviewed in a previous video
so I'll link to it for all the lip
swatches and info but this year's
perfect bite set is really really good
you're getting four mini amuse-bouche
lipsticks in here and they're a great
range you go kind of from nude to pink
to berry to red really super rich
comfortable formula so this is a great
way to tried those out they come in a
nice little tin - it's so giftable also
becca has a nice little duo and i don't
have this particular one like I've got
all these products and either full sizes
or minis that I've gotten in the past
but they've got a little combo set of
either opal or champagne glow in the
shimmering skin perfecter pressed and
the liquid did I say champagne glow I
think that's champagne pop actually but
those are really fantastic highlights
and they're definitely the kind of thing
especially with the pressed powder
versions of those it does not take a lot
of product to get the look on your skin
that great profound glow so if you had a
mini of one of those you would have it
for a good long while also lately I've
talked a lot about argan oil and how
that's a huge part of my night time
skincare I use both the milk and the
standard argan oil well I noticed on
Sephora's site they've got for $19 a duo
of minis it's the regular 100% pure
argan oil and the light version and I've
really been wanting to try the light and
I wouldn't mind having just a mini size
of the regular for travel too so I think
I'm gonna get that one and they have a
few other variations of Argan Josie
Maran product minis I noticed on there
here's a set of minis I got recently
that I am so so happy with and it's a
fragrance one it's $28 is the Elizabeth
and James line it's their warm and spicy
minis ooh
this is good this is really good I love
the black I have the full size of the
Nirvana black it's so rich I'm just nuts
about that fragrance and now I got to
try the amethyst and the Bourbon and I
truly enjoy both of these scents I think
I like the amethyst most though like
this is just reeling me in right now I
don't know if I should waste my time
trying to explain it but this family of
cents is just very rich very cozy it
seems
the kind of smell I want to have like
this time of year these are roller balls
and they're super handy and I would say
if you've been wondering about any of
these cents I think a fragrance sampler
in minis is a great way to try them so
everything I've mentioned here today
with the exception of this this is $28
but all the make up step has been $25 or
less so if the thought of minis appeals
to you hopefully this helped you out if
it doesn't appeal to you at all we still
got some info from me on products that I
really really love from Sephora so thank
you guys so so much for taking time to
watch if you haven't subscribed yet I'd
love to have you as a subscriber here on
beauty broadcast and I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
