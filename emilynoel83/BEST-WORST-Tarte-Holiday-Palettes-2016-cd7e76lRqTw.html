here thank you so much for your interest
in these holiday reviews this video is
going to focus on tarts big 3 the
largest palate style products that
they're putting out for the holiday
season last week I did a video on some
smaller gift sets but now I've had a
little more chance to bond with these
larger products try them out really get
a feel for what's in there three that
I'm going to be talking about are the
color vibes palette this is something
that's available on tarts website
perhaps Macy's website as well clarify
that in the info box this is called the
TARDIS paint palette and this is the
Ulta exclusive palette and then Sephora
has probably the biggest one of the
bunch the most expensive it is called
the pretty paint box so in this video I
think I'm going to go three two one I'm
going to talk about my least favorite
two most favorites so number three of
this bunch for me would be the color
vibes palette so this is a straight-up
eyeshadow palette heart generally does a
good job of dividing up their palettes
into a very like user friendly format
you can glance at it and if you don't
feel like skipping around all over the
palette at a glance you can pretty much
see what shades should be used together
so they're divided up kind of into these
five color segments your top two are
both very neutral and brownish you've
got some blue tones coming through down
here and then a plummy selection down
here in this corner and the size of
these pans is actually rather large it
seems like every holiday season Tarte
has some sort of palette that includes
this size of square pan overall two
things that I have to kind of complain
about about this product first off color
selection does not excite me much at all
like I glanced at it and I think how
many times have I seen these exact kinds
of tones included in a Tarte holiday
product I mean they're just very very
common and not just common for Tarte but
common in the scope of all kinds of
eyeshadows you know if half the palette
is going to be these just brownish
neutrals very middle of the road type
shades it's just not that interesting
for me and then number two I did find
the quality of these shades to be a
little bit hit and miss something
going to hear me touch on a lot in this
video is the fact that tardy has
recently put out some you know very
specific palates in their line the
tartlet the tartlet in bloom in terms of
what I've personally tried I got these
styled by her Uche palate and I felt
like what was in there is probably some
of the best quality shadows that Tartans
ever had like their shadows both mattes
and shimmers in these pallets have kind
of reached a new level of buttery
creaminess really easy to work with very
smooth I've just been really impressed
with what they have put out and so that
of course causes me to have this thought
in the back of my mind maybe they'll
carry that through into their holiday
stuff and while maybe a few shades here
and there share some qualities with
those other pallets I mentioned a lot of
them don't and while I certainly have
been capable of getting some decent
looks out of this color vibes palette I
mean it's not unusable
the mix of light medium and dark makes
it totally workable really you know in
terms of putting together a look on your
eyes but I just feel like the textures
of certain shades did not meet my
expectations and then the overall feel
of the palette I was wanting something
more something more interesting some
little pop here there that just really
takes me to a different place that Tarte
hasn't done before just taking you
segment by segment on this palette first
off this top corner up here you can see
the swatches you've got a matte peachy
shade in there and also a matte dark
brown everything else has at least a
little bit of shimmer some of those
shimmery shades I found to be very weak
and patchy and then moving to the next
brown segment right next door to it got
a very sheer shimmery shade in there and
as a whole I feel like that group of
Browns performs a little bit more
intensely than the others moving on to
the blue section in the lower left-hand
corner I do like seascape which is this
kind of shimmery blue and I thought
inked turned out to be a really nice
navy blue and then the deeper Purple's
in the final section I thought were
pretty shades but can require quite a
bit of building up and working with when
you finally get to doing a look with
them on your eyes like I said Tarte has
revealed what they will do what they are
capable of putting in certain pallets
with the softness of the mattes and the
really nice creaminess and
movements of their metallic shades and I
just saw so many missed opportunities in
this palette to do something like that
to integrate those kinds of formulas so
this is my number three really wouldn't
recommend it unless something in here
absolutely jumped out at you you know
I'm not trying to make your decisions
for you but for $46 and someone who's
kind of seen this overall idea come and
go a lot into arts holiday collections
I'm not all that enthused the number two
product for me would be the pretty paint
box and this is from Sephora it's the
most expensive set of them all it's $59
looks like this has a pretty outer
design it's a magnetic closure you open
it up and I do think it's probably in
your best interest to keep the sheet
between which I think is a huge pain and
I wish they would have just you know
gone Smashbox style and done some sort
of you know nice little plastic window
in between these but I mean I think if
you want to keep the fallout separate
once you close the palette you're going
to want to keep that between your
blushes and your eyeshadows there so
blushes cheek products down here bunch
of eyeshadows on this side this little
window pops open and you do have a
mirror there and then three individual
products a mascara and eyeliner and a
lipgloss okay things I like about this
palette number one I think they're
giving you a lot it's a lot of shadow
for cheek products some individual
things thrown in I do find it to be a
good value as far as just the quantity
of things put in here number two I think
the face products the quality of those
is really good especially compared to
some of those individual blushes that
were in one of those sets I talked about
last week I feel like the quality in
here was a lot softer a lot smoother
there's a nice blush highlight couple of
bronzer type options and again I feel
like the layout was really nice over
here just with the way they put these
shadows together you can easily look at
it and see okay here's like my light a
couple rows of medium and then dark but
also if you look horizontally you can
easily see some very simply laid out
quads that follow certain color schemes
if you're unsure of what to do now the
things I don't like about it and I think
kind of an important thing again a sheet
that's that's
well you have you got to keep track of
that I think if you want to keep the
fallout from shades that are flat-out
black over here if you want to keep that
separate from these blushes number two
the quality of the eyeshadows very very
hit and miss the misses were such big
misses for me and then the couple of
hits that I had I really really like the
shades that I liked in here but is it
enough to overtake the whole palette and
make me feel like it's worth $59 not
really I'm going to go ahead and show
you the swatches and I decided to go row
by row so we're kind of going to go
light to dark lightest row contains two
shimmers the shade called glitter glue
that first one is specially flaky Pearl
Earring a little bit smoother but
everything else is matte and just didn't
quite deliver enough intensity for me
and applying them on the eyes they
required a lot of building up going into
the next row more disappointments here
with these medium shades that I thought
should have been delivering a lot more
the shade called frame worthy which is
kind of right in the middle a medium
Brown that I think would get a lot of
use out of this palette I didn't find
that to have enough color payoff also
hearts and crafts which is a little more
rosy that was a weak shade as well so
many colors in that row that looked like
they should have been awesome and had so
much potential and I think will be
frequently use shades in the palette
that didn't give enough pigment and then
we move into kind of some statement type
colors a little more shimmer a little
more pizazz and a lot of these they all
do contain shimmer and bronze casting
probably the worst of the whole palette
I mean so flaky so weird to work with
really hard to build up on the eyes the
color called selfie portrait which is
that kind of taupe eros shade gorgeous
it was like they could only put in one
shade that was metallic and really rich
and smooth up to the standard of what
I've seen in their other palettes they
could only put in one like that but then
we move into our darkest row and they're
definitely some hits in this row but I
found silhouette which is your all-out
black to be much drier patchy err and
harder to work with than the shade right
next to it called charcoal sketch which
came through softer deeper more
pigmented but yet in the palette it
looks like it should be lighter there's
one
shade in that road that has a teeny bit
of shimmer and that's the deep brown and
then I did like the stained glass and
still live shades those are your berry
and plum colors but again the few shades
I liked in this layout of shadows I
really liked but the missus just took it
so far south for me that I just I can't
look at this and think wow this is great
quality blush highlight bronzer section
I was a lot more impressed with I think
these are pretty generous sizes
I like the matte blush called moment I
think it was a pretty you know very
Universal peachy type shade authentic
for the highlight I found to be very
workable shimmery but not too shimmery
and unique has a little bit of shimmer
in it although I don't think that
translates a lot on the skin and it's
very warm bronzer then a little bit
cooler tone that more people might feel
comfortable contouring with with the
color called provocative so overall I
really liked those are getting like
what's probably a deluxe sample size of
the TARDIS mascara and I prefer the
lights camera lashes mascara that they
usually include in these kits but I
realize they're wanting to show off this
new mascara and the way the samples are
in here I really don't like how they
lift straight out of the tube applies
fairly nicely on the eyes it's pretty
buildable for me but you've got to get
rid of that excess somehow and you end
up putting it right around the outer rim
so when you put your thing back together
I've usually got goop around there that
I've got to clean off I do love this so
fine eyeliner that they put in here
really super fine tip black liquid liner
pin this was very black very intense but
a really fine easy to work with tip so I
enjoyed that and then you get one of the
TARDIS lip paints that has the glossy
finish not the matte in the shade called
obvi and this is a pretty kind of like
peachy nude I think it's pretty I think
it's a very you know across the board
people would like it type of shade again
the things I like in this palette I
really like I think they're doing some
things definitely right but the things I
don't like just take it over the edge
for me to not enjoy this palette very
much the quality of the eyeshadows was
just way way too
hit and miss for me considering what I
know about Tarte shadows recently the
types of palettes they put out over the
past year year and a half
been really nice and so this just wasn't
consistent with that so I realize this
has been kind of a min video so far but
I do have something that I really really
liked and I wasn't just like trying to
find one that I liked if I didn't like
this one either I'd still tell you but I
did really enjoy the palette from Ulta
the Ulta exclusive which is $49 so you
got that first one I mentioned which was
46 the Sephora is 59
this one's 49 it's called the TARDIS
paint palette and I think this has much
much much more consistency with the
eyeshadows and much more interesting
shades overall really that truly
interest me so I was excited to see them
actually have some good color payoff
every look I've done with this palette
I've been happy with and then you do
have some extras in here as well so you
open it up first off you have separation
total separation between your eye
products and the face products no need
for a special plastic sheet that you got
to keep track of huge mirror up top and
I like sitting it on my table and
knowing that it just stays open like
that it doesn't have to take up like a
whole lot of surface area this doesn't
come all the way back but it stays
standing and you could actually put it
at eye level with yourself if you're
standing up to a counter or a dresser or
something and be able to use that full
mirror and see your entire face you've
got four rows of Shadows going across
and then if you look very this time I
think you can see some quads of shades
laying themselves out very easily for
you then you pull out this side pocket
and you've got extras something also
worth noting with this palette and that
little gold window that was in the other
they had these plastic lift out dividers
so you could take out the divider and
put all these things back in as well as
some other things I think more would
definitely fit if you wanted to throw in
some other liners or mascaras or brushes
so just keep that in mind but one thing
that lifts out of here is your face
palette and this contains it's really
cute I like this little palette and then
you've got a blush bronzer and highlight
you also get this blending brush another
glossy lip pain
in a different shade from the first one
and another sample size of the TARDIS
mascara I feel like the quality of the
eyeshadows in here is mostly on par with
the other kinds of palette start has put
out and the swatches really tell the
story I decided to go like across the
lightest row and then on down so you
look at these there's a lot of mattes in
here and they weren't patchy they
weren't too sheer they really kind of
surprised me as far as what those mats
were capable of when I put them on my
eyes they really show without the need
to build up too much at all next row
down the mid-tone shades in here were
really nice
take it ezel Renaissance woman those
first couple I think will be widely used
as crease colors and they were really
good I think abstract is gorgeous that's
that shimmery kind of soft rose color
you've got a bronze in here another sort
of deep Stoney colored crease shade and
honestly it just keeps getting better
for me as we move on down into the next
row there are a couple of shades there
these two right here kind of warm colors
that have a little bit of like golden
sparkle in them but I don't know
sometimes I see it on the eyes sometimes
it maybe it just depends on the way I'm
turning it doesn't always transfer in a
huge way and it's not super flaky so
overall I think you get a matte effect
out of those shadows it's a really great
Burgundy in that row also a nice plum
with a little bit of shimmer and then in
your final row all but the green are
totally matte and I just thought these
colors killed it with the exception of
Gothic which is the black and it seemed
just like the black in the last palette
where I thought okay that seems drier
than all the other mats but everything
else I thought wow I love it I love the
deep deep orange e terracotta color
called doodle rich plums and browns I
like the olive green as well this is
more variety color wise than I'm used to
in tart holiday collections
I love how warm they went with you know
this shade down here you get some olive
you get some burgundy I mean if you are
a warm shadow lover you totally have
options in this palette not only with
that shade at the ROYGBIV and beret
colors that had like that little bit of
unusual sparkle in them
those really work nicely if you're after
warm tones in this other palette really
the Shh with our bronze casting and
metal work up here and those were not
very good those were some of the weaker
colors in the palette so I think just in
terms of overall variety warm and cool
everything executed really well in this
palette what do we think of the rest of
it I've already told you my little gripe
on the sample size of the TARDIS mascara
I do really like this shape probably
even better than the gloss that was in
the other this I've been wearing
throughout this video little bit deeper
richer nude the brush they give you can
make a nice blending brush on the eyes
but I find I actually like using it as a
highlighter brush because the highlight
is really the one thing out of this
palette that I didn't enjoy so much I
feel like I've got to work with it a
little bit more build it up a little bit
more I mean on my finger there it looks
plenty shiny but something about picking
it up with a brush it kind of requires a
smaller brush so we happen to have that
in here and it works well this you know
with these synthetic bristles this could
also make a really nice concealer brush
to just FYI you've also gotten that and
that kind of deep dusty rose blush here
and this matte bronzer they've got this
contour label on here but I think a lot
of people will probably find that a
little bit on the warm side for
contouring it's still nicely pigmented
and it makes a nice bronzer but I like
it better as a bronzer than a contour
but my sort of order of application for
those shades on my face I did use this
kind of under the cheekbones softly and
also elsewhere on the face just warm up
the skin tone used a blush brush with
the blush very happy with that tone and
the pigmentation the quality was better
than some of those individual blushes
and the other set that I've referenced
several times and then you know the
highlight like I said smaller brush
really applies better now this plum
shadow look that I'm wearing on my eyes
today I did want to show you just a
brief demo with these shadows so you can
see how it goes on first off I had
applied a primer and then I used
renaissance woman which i think is it
going to be a very widely used crease
color in my crease nice dusty mauve then
today was my first time playing with
kaleidoscope on my eyes that's the
shimmery
and I really like that color kind of
getting it on the outer part of the lid
pulling it up into the crease looks so
so pretty there also smudge that color
on the lower lash line as well and then
I also pulled in Renaissance woman again
there on the inner part of the lower
lash line I use the color called on
display which is a really kind of
brightening pinky matte color and I use
that on the inner part of my lid I also
use that as a highlight shade and then
that shimmery burgundy called being
original I just applied that lightly
kind of on the border of my eye look I
did apply that tardis mascara which
again I think it builds up nicely it
takes me a little bit of work sometimes
to build it to the point where I want it
it's an okay mascara not the worst not
the best in my opinion and then I
applied some demi wispies false lashes
just to finish off the eye look and I
have some mascara on the lower lashes
too but those are your three largest
pallets from Tarte again this one this
is the Ulta this would be the one that I
will continue to get the most use out of
the one that I would feel totally
comfortable gifting to someone and
feeling like I was giving them something
special that had a lot of variety a lot
of good quality in it and I mean I just
the proof is in the use of the shadows
and I've just found these to be a
pleasure to work with and I've enjoyed
every look that I've gotten out of it
frankly it's just a better design
all-around compared to this one I know
this might be bigger and you look at
this and think oh there's even more
extras or even more eyeshadows but
really this one I think wins out just
quality and all things considered it's
the best I have had a lot of questions
about the Too Faced holiday collections
reviews on those will be coming soon so
many other random little holiday things
that have been coming out I've been
getting them I've been trying them it's
just been a little workshop in here
lately so thank you for watching and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
