me um thanks for making me part of your
holiday week here I hope you guys have a
great Thanksgiving wherever you're
celebrating if you've been keeping an
eye on my channel over the past couple
of months I have had loads of holiday
type gift set palette reviews in this
video I wanted to do something I
normally do which is kind of give you
the full roundup of the ones that I
truly thought were the best with an
added twist I'm gonna give you five of
the worst as well five of the worst gift
sets palettes that I've tried over this
little time frame here I hope this is
useful for you if you've been closely
following what I've been doing lately
some of these may not come as much of a
shock but I do think it makes it easier
to kind of see in one big bundle okay
which really were the best which stood
out as the top picks in which we're not
so good if you're looking specifically
for drugstore gift picks I already did a
video on my favorites so I'll link to
that below and I also have a video on
more like body skincare fragrance type
things that I tried and like well some I
like some I didn't like but I sort of
sorted out that arena in a separate
video too so I'll link to that one this
is gonna be all about makeup so at the
time I'm sitting here doing this this
stuff is all in stock but if something
goes out of stock I'm sorry talking face
products first one thing I would totally
recommend is this Besame brightening
setting powder trio this has been
awesome I absolutely love these powders
to set the under eyes set all over the
face each one has a little bit different
tone and a little bit different scent
which is interesting so you've got the
vanilla rose vanilla and violent
brightening powders all in here this is
the size you're working with okay so
they're not huge but it does definitely
give you the ability to experiment see
which shade you know you really like
these are all available in full sizes
but I am so loving the sampler set and
I'm really having trouble figuring out
which one shade is my favorite or the
best for me because I rotate a lot and I
always like the effect I've been wearing
the viola a lot as an under eye setting
powder and then today I reached for the
brightening vanilla and I just I feel
like I really like that look too so
these are great another thing that I
love if you're looking for a highlight
Becca glow on the go
this is the moonstone set so they give
you a moonstone shimmering skin
perfecter pressed and also the
shimmering skin perfecter spotlight so
that's a mini size of the liquid
shimmering skin perfecter so I've got
both of those here I think this is a
great value you can certainly layer them
both choose one or the other I think
both are great formulas and I have
really latched on to the liquids over
the past couple years I very much
enjoyed those so I think it's great to
get this in a shade that I personally
didn't have already which was the
moonstone and these liquids just looked
like undetectable beautiful glow on the
skin it's a doe foot applicator so you
can dab a little bit on your hand use
your finger to dab it on your skin or I
like my ELF small stipple brush just
graze it right across the top of your
cheekbones it's a beautiful look and
then I think a lot of people are
familiar with the texture of the powder
shimmering skin perfectors so this is
fantastic this can give you a very
customizable heavy duty highlight if
that's what you're after or you can just
wear it very lightly and you have all
the control with this little duo and I
think it's a great way to sample what
Becca makes third face product that I
absolutely love it Cosmetics genocide
quoi palette this is such a good value
if you're looking for multiple face
products all in one I love this it's the
bronzer the sunshine and a compact
bronzer you've got a bye-bye pores
translucent powder pressed and a bye-bye
pores blush in genesee quoi and then the
perfect lighting Luminizer in Jenna's
like well over here I think all of these
tones work really well together and
ultimately the convenience factor with
this is huge it's all of your powder
needs in one you know including that
translucent setting powder which I
really like that's a great under eye
setting powder just dab it all over the
face quickly and you feel like you've
got your foundation set I just see this
as being a really giftable item this
holiday season I think those tones are
very universal and it's just a great
quality product moving on to eye stuff
that I would recommend I've got a couple
pallets to mention but also this TARDIS
eyeliner set anybody remember what I
mentioned this way back in my earliest
reviews that I did $35 product you're
getting four different shades of the
TARDIS eyeliner which is a very unique
format base
it's like a little squeezy tube but do
you see what your product squeezes out
into it's almost like a little flattened
out palette and so that makes it so easy
to pick up just the right amount of
product on your brush which they give
you a great double-ended brush here and
you can just easily go across your lash
line the consistency of this I would say
it's like between a liquid and a gel so
it does give you I think maybe a little
bit more feeling of control than some
liquid liners might but it lays down
with so much ease so you're getting the
black there's a navy blue in there
there's a beautiful bronze and an
aubergine kind of like deep wine type
color really great stat now a couple of
palettes one of my tip top eye palette
picks is the Kat Von D metal matte I
noticed that this is still in stock on
Kat Von D's website not sure whether
this is coming back on Sephora or not
but I did talk about this quite a while
back really love what's happening in
this palette in terms of the matte and
shimmer split and also just the shade
selection you know it's giving me some
things that take me a little bit outside
my comfort zone but the same time I've
got plenty of things that also make me
feel very comfortable in the textures
the quality of the shadows the
pigmentation is just really unmatched
it's a big palette you feel like you're
getting a lot but you're not getting a
bunch of like repeat shades over and
over that's kind of become my pet peeve
with really large palettes is that you
look at them and you think okay well
there's that shade like five times over
by the time it gets worked out on your
lids it looks like the same color
everything in here I think has its own
unique texture finished personality
really really impressed with this and I
would highly suggest getting your hands
on it if you can and the other eye
palette that I was super happy with was
the dose of colors ice cream palette and
this may not be technically like holiday
but it's out now and I really enjoy it
so so much I have a video on this and
I'll link to every video I have down
below where I talk more about each of
these items much like the reason why I
like the Kat Von D metal matte if I was
impressed by the color selection and the
variety and the feeling that every shade
was in this palette for a reason
doubling up on colors no repeats it's a
really fun shape selection with some of
these unique pastel pops that a lot of
palates don't give you but those are
being anchored by some gorgeous neutrals
and the quality of these colors is
phenomenal I love the way they swatch I
love the way they apply I'm wearing it
today I've got some bubblegum on my lid
I've got a little bit of blueberry swirl
and hot fudge in my outer corner and I
love cone for the crease cone is a great
light kind of rosy brown for your crease
I don't think I've ever not loved a look
that I've done with this palette so I
would really recommend that I've got a
few little lips set recommendations I
think all of these are really affordable
like 25 bucks
number one the Besame mini lipstick set
ah I love this brand I love what I've
tried from this brand so far which would
be the powders and this set of lipsticks
you are getting two sample actual
lipsticks from their line this isn't
just some randomly toss together holiday
kit they are giving you five of their
mini vintage lipstick recreations they
are actually specifically formulated to
look and feel like the lipsticks of
these certain eras the creator actually
goes through the process of researching
and finding old lipsticks and swatching
them out and trying to pick up on what
pigments are in there and how can she
you know make these lipsticks sort of a
what's old is new again type concept so
I love what's in here you're getting a
really deep dark red I think a couple of
finishes on true Reds with cherry red
being a little more matte red velvet
super creamy rich red dusty rose is more
of like a mommy pink and then your
chocolate kiss has more neutral this is
the size we're talking about here it's
the same kind of like Besame lipstick
design but plastic tubes and miniature
and then the bullet is still formed the
way a full-sized Besame lipstick would
be it's sort of slanting in and meeting
at the top there instead of being like a
typical lipstick bullet if you have any
questions about these or the Besame
powders please check out my Besame video
because I really went in-depth with
these and I so enjoy every part of this
kit and yes I have purchased that as a
gift
other things which have been mentioned
before so I won't talk about these at
length but kits from bite these are
can't-miss items you've got the perfect
bite set which is your mini lipstick set
of before amuse-bouche lipsticks and the
way these come
I love how compact it is it's a nice
little tin your tin does have a mirror
in the top and then sitting inside are
your four little lipsticks this kit is
very neutral actually I'm wearing a
couple of these shades put together I'm
wearing honeycomb which is the most nude
and also fig which is a little more
pinky
thus the pinky nude that I've achieved
here and it feels great yes it does on
my lips and then you've got pepper a
little bit deeper rosy neutral and nori
which is very deep and dark but I truly
feel like with this selection you could
achieve any kind of soft pinky nude that
you might want if you're gifting to
someone who you know isn't super into
the brights but you want to give them a
fantastic formula of easy to wear
neutrals plus you know that dark shade
that can be a fun mixer they all mix so
well so I really like the perfect bite
set I might like this set just a little
bit more than the best bite Redux set
which is their matte cream lip crayons
simply because this is more unique for
bite I'm used to seeing them put out
this little like quartet of brightly
colored skinny sticks every holiday
season and here it was kind of cool to
see them go with a more neutral color
scheme and with that lipstick formula
which the revamp formula I had not tried
until that set but if you know you or
someone else likes the bold lips this is
certainly a good option too because
these are all matte colors you're
getting a really good range here I will
link to the video where I talk about
this more you're getting orchid which is
sort of this almost lilac infused pink
phrase which is a nice bright red red
velvet a deeper red and then truffle a
nice rich dark color packaged in the
very same way as the other one I think
they're both awesome quality sets just
kind of consider who you're giving to
and who might get the most use out of
one or the other but I'm honestly
surprised that those are still in stock
at all right now and my final
out of my like top 10 that I would
recommend is this little guy from it
cosmetics full video on this going very
detailed but this is the palette that
doesn't quit and you look at from the
outside you're thinking okay did you
just pull this off the shelf at some
random drugstore or what is this but
truly what's in here is it cosmetics
quality stuff just packed packed packed
into one pallet so you've got these
couple of little doors that open up here
eyes shadow 'z which are the naturally
pretty eyeshadow formula if you like it
in their palettes you're probably going
to enjoy it in here as well two forms of
their Hello light highlighters both the
cream and the powder open this up you've
got your bye-bye under-eye correctors
for shades there
bye-bye pores powder you've got a
sunshine in a compact bronzer that does
seem to go a little deeper than the one
in the quad compact that I mentioned
earlier and then oh yeah there's a
little bonus drawer down here with three
fantastic blushes I'm wearing this one
today and these are blushes and all
things that exist in their regular line
and then there are six of the blurred
lines lipsticks in here and with only
one exception those are very consistent
with what is actually sold in the
full-size tubes so there is truly all
hot packed into this palette less than
$50 I think it's a fabulous deal and I
was skeptical at first because we see a
lot of brands kind of scaled back on the
quality sometimes with their holiday
kits but this really is one of those
kind of diamond-in-the-rough items I
think it would be a good thing to get
your hands on if you enjoy a lot of
things from it cosmetics
let's talk not so tough gift picks in no
particular order here things that just
really disappointed me from Tarte this
blush set here I was expecting more I
generally like the Amazonian clay
blushes I felt like the shades in here
were kind of weak and it was cute to
look at you know I like what they've
done with this kind of artsy design on
the outer packaging they give you a
brush in here that I think is a little
bit better suited to highlight because
it is so light and wispy and honestly
these blushes to pick up the color off
of the blush you need a stiffer more
dense brush actually to do that because
they're just not very pigmented blushes
I mean there's white one
the mix that I would really gravitate
toward the others I could leave them
another thing that fell short for me was
this nutcracker suite' eye palette it
was the smokey eye compact the nine
color compact really looks pretty at a
glance and a few of those shades do
stand out nicely but a lot of them
really didn't it just did not meet my
expectations I have tried I shadow from
Mac that I think are fantastic and I
really do like their pre put together
warm neutral 15 color eye palette with
the round pans in there but in this
palette the lack of intensity in a lot
of these shades keeps you from getting a
lot of variety with different looks
things I loved about my dose of colors
palette and my Kat Von D palette where
the each shade made a statement it was
there for a reason it had a purpose and
a lot of the shades in here just aren't
intense enough to really like have a
reason to be there you know urban decay
naked illuminated trio not a fan of this
kit I just thought it was a glittery
fallout filled mess and there's just way
too much highlighter competition in the
marketplace right now I mean you think
about that becca duo that's where you
want to just cut to the chase just go
ahead and get that you've got the you
know the shimmering skin perfecter
liquid and press and those works so
amazingly well that moonstone shade is
gonna look gorgeous on top of any blush
that you've got on this thing here just
don't don't waste your time it's too
much glitter fall out flakiness one
thing that I don't think was technically
released as part of the holiday
collection but it's out now and I've
tried it recently and I did not really
enjoy it and you might be considering it
as a gift it's the benefit they're real
big sexy lip kit the claim here is
double the lip basically in every
lipstick the way the color is on the
bullet you're getting like two shades
the tip the more tapered part of the tip
is always a little bit deeper and then
the other part is like more the full
bodied color that's all over your lips
and that darker shade is supposed to
kind of go around the outside it's
supposed to make your lips look fuller
and kind of act like lipliner and
lipstick and one
for me though I truly didn't get the
effect I felt like there was maybe one
shade that had a decent amount of
contrast that was the one called pink
thrills everything else the colors were
pretty close I found the formula to be
kind of dry and then on top of that I
thought the shade selection was not very
universally workable at all like every
shade was pretty bright this lusty rose
color is a little bit softer but I was
so shocked that with this concept they
put in all like brights with the rest of
them why not throw in something a little
more nude or neutral I just I didn't
think it was a great execution it's kind
of a gimmicky idea and I do trial on
gimmicks here on my channel some
gimmicks work some gimmicks don't I mean
I honestly thought that that I kit that
was like swiping across two shades at
once and then get your eye look I felt
like that had a little bit more going
for it than this lip kit and finally I
know this is drugstore but I didn't
really have anywhere else to mention
this because when I was talking about
products in my drugstore video it was
only like the best but this I got this
sponge trio from Elle and these
disappointed me quite a bit this is just
the size not saturated with water but it
grows so freakin big like if you need a
really big sponge you might like this
but at the same time I did not feel like
it was soft enough to really effectively
blend out foundation or concealer or
anything like that
even as close to as good as an actual
Beauty Blender and I know guys it is so
hard to know what these sponge sets what
you're gonna get especially if you're
ordering online unless you've researched
it you're kind of making a total guess
as to what kind of texture these are
gonna have once they get you know under
the sink it just gets so big it's way
way bigger than I would ever need and so
I would not recommend that so thank you
guys again so much for spending some
time with me today and I hope you have a
wonderful holiday and I hope these
recommendations and anti recommendations
helped you out a little bit and I will
see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
