this video this is going to be all about
the top 10 best selling makeup products
at Target for whatever reason I thought
this would be an interesting video to do
I really wanted to focus in on the best
sellers because you know those are
popular items but they're not
necessarily top-rated so I thought it'd
be cool to take this opportunity to look
at each of them some of them are
products that I've definitely had in my
collection for quite some time and just
kind of talk about whether or not
they're worthy are they really that good
are these makeup bandwagons you should
jump on and I figured this out I got on
targets website I like use the filters
to look at bestsellers I narrowed it
down to only like makeup products and
brushes and beauty tools the thing I'm
not certain about is whether this is
only products sold online at targets
website or if in-store purchases are
also factored into that data I'm not a
hundred percent certain but either way I
think this is an interesting little top
ten and there are some surprises in here
for me there is a really loud bird it's
very distracting but I'm gonna go
through the top ten we're gonna go up to
the number one best selling product as
it appears on a targets website so
number ten is actually the essence pure
nude highlighter this is a product I'm
very familiar with I love this highlight
I think this is a great natural
highlighter it's really on the softest
end of the spectrum I like it because
when I put it on my skin instead of
giving me like a streak of visible
highlight but it gives us like this soft
real skin glow so if you're looking for
a highlight that's not too much that
doesn't exaggerate the look of pores and
fine lines just something really
wearable for everyday I think this is a
great option got to give you the heads
up that as I go throughout this video I
did do little demos with these various
products but they may appear out of
order because I'm just going through the
top ten like ten to one
number nine is the EOS sweet mint sphere
and this is a great product I mean I've
been a big fan of the EOS products and I
had a bunch of these quite a while back
but have since tossed them out and more
recently repurchase this one and it's a
lot smoother than I remember like I
remember the texture of these being just
a little bit stiff
but this had a really fantastic glide in
the scent is just like that sweet mint
gum from Orbitz or whatever the brand is
so I like I feel like they improved the
formula since these very first came out
they were a little bit drier and thicker
and I think the feel of this is probably
a lot more pleasing to a lot of people
number eight is another lip balm and
it's the yes to coconuts naturally
smooth lip balm this is a 99% natural
product I do like the shape of this it's
shaped like those Neutrogena lip balms
that I really enjoy and if you like a
coconut scent it is all there it's a
very natural like really good pure
coconut smell and the smoothness of the
lip balm is really nice it almost has a
little bit more of a slip across the
skin and like the regular Burt's Bees
lip balm has I've used it recently as
I've had really dry lips the past couple
of weeks and it's been good the staying
power isn't amazing not that you're
expecting fantastic staying power out of
a lip balm or anything but it's like you
kind of want something that's gonna hang
on to your lips a little bit better so
they feel more moisturized long-term you
know what I'm saying I think the EOS
actually hangs around a bit longer on
the lips before I need to reapply number
seven is another highlight and this is
the Maybelline master chrome and this is
an intense highlight probably one of the
most intense like as far as potential to
get a really maximum glow on the skin
probably one of the most intense from
the drugstores is really going there and
it's a very golden shade and in this
demo I just sort of layered this on top
of the essences essence is not a huge
highlighter factor on the skin here it's
a very soft look and I thought we'll
just a show I'll put this on top and
it's really intense with just a little
bit of product and at a distance you
know I've got that on my skin now I
think it looks kind of pretty but when I
look up closer to my skin it really does
exaggerate any kind of fine line
happening out in this area and pores
you've really got to watch it so I don't
think that highlights for everyone I
think almost anybody could pick up the
pure nude and have better looking skin
for putting this one on but it's not
giving you that super reflective
highlight this definitely is but I think
there might
like price to pay in terms of the look
of any texture on your skin number six
we've got another lip balm in the mix
here and it is the Vaseline lip therapy
rosy lips this is such a random thing
like to having this top ten I don't know
I had this product way back and have
since repurchased it because I knew I
was going to do this video like a couple
weeks ago and I wanted to sort of retest
some of these things and it's definitely
adorable I mean a mini sized tub of
Vaseline who doesn't want that
but the rosy lips thing it's very very
subtle like get this more because you're
wanting Vaseline for your lips not so
much because of the actual tint because
the tint is like hardly visible you're
gonna get more tint out of a Dr Pepper
lip smacker or you know any of those
Neutrogena tended lip balms those are
amazing what I do like about this though
is there's some real thickness to this
it's thicker than just regular
straight-up Vaseline talking about
staying power and not needing to reapply
too frequently with lip balms I would
say this is the one I need to apply the
most frequently it wears off the fastest
the EOS is kind of in the middle it has
a considerably better job compared to
the yes to coconuts but this one is
really thick and nice the application
style you know having to dip your finger
in there is not gonna be everyone's
desired way to go about it so there's
sort of a con but thickness wise in
terms of being a nice treatment for the
lips it is quite nice and it does have a
really nice scent like just a slightly
rosy thing going on there number five is
the Real Techniques flawless base brush
set and I've got to go back here and get
a look at what this is now because when
I first bought this it was a little
different configuration of brushes now
they've got something that's like a very
flat top but also pinched in kind of
foundation II brush and there's also an
itty bitty concealer type brush I'm not
sure where that brush is living in my
collection right now but the two main
ones that I really adore from this set
are the buffing brush this is a great
one for foundation application BB Creams
powder foundations even this is awesome
for that super soft just a great size
and then also this guy which I've
brought out constantly for contouring
you could absolutely use it for powder
contour but I love it for creams just
the size of the brush its synthetic
bristles and it just really works in
cream contour very very well it's small
enough to apply enough pressure and
really get that kind of thing buffed
into the skin but it's not so small that
it streaks you out so in this set if you
buy it these days again there's going to
be a little flat top looking brush and
also a teeny tiny brush that could be
like a pin pointed concealer type thing
but even for only these two it's worth
it that's a great brush set number four
on the top 10 best-selling products from
target is the Milani make it last
setting spray I've had this in my
collection for a while was not
completely blown away by it in terms of
being super different from other things
like it performs every bit as well as
other setting sprays that I like like my
elf makeup mist and set I'm not
convinced yet that this is better than
that but I'm going to make a commitment
to you guys that I'm gonna use this
consistently and try to figure out like
if it's really leaps and bounds better
than something else what I do love it's
got a great scent
hmm I'm just kind of a very lightly
fresh scent does anybody notice that it
smells really nice and the sprayer is
fantastic a really fine mist when I
missed it on my skin I wouldn't say it
changes the texture a whole lot like
there's my hard candy sheer envy primer
mist and my Mario Badescu sprays and
those really I think give an immediate
look of radiance to the skin this might
turn out to be something that performs
closer to an urban decay all nighter or
something like that but I need to use it
with more consistency to be able to tell
you so I'm gonna do that this is gonna
be the setting spray I'm gonna be
working with to really see if it gives
this 16 hour wear number three on the
bestsellers list is the Real Techniques
sponge you guys know I love this sponge
it's really soft you're looking at it
right now at maximum size because I used
it to apply my foundation today I'm
wearing the elf on flawless finish I
believe it's called in sand and I just
love the softness of this
the way it blends product out you're
gonna have a flat side to it and then
also a pointed side at the other end and
I think here's the determination I've
come to I still really like this sponge
but my top favorite like drugstore
blending sponge or really top favorite
shape overall is this one from NYX and
this one is not saturated so it's at its
smallest size but it has the flat side
but it also has this little curved off
side at the bottom so what's really nice
about that is if you like bouncing a
Beautyblender on top of your skin and
you like that little rounded bottom that
it has this really has that too and it's
super soft when you get it all like
saturated and then ringed out this you
know I still love the Real Techniques
sponge but I'm finding less of a need
for the little pointed part and more of
a desire to have that rounded bottom
just for bouncing product in but I do
love the flatness here I mean I think
it's a great sponge and if you're
looking for a really nice affordable
thing that's going to apply foundation
and give you a really nice even look
like a Beauty Blender my I think this
along with the NYX sponge a couple of
the best things you can go for number
two is the Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda
concealer palette oh my gosh talk about
rediscovered favorite here it was years
ago when I first tried this stuff when
it was back in the white trimmed
packaging and so recently like I said I
thought about doing this video and I
repurchased it and I've got it in the
shade light and I'm being reminded that
this is probably one of the best
concealers in the drugstore period like
it's a great great product you're gonna
get three creamy concealer shades two of
them are like I would say a light
concealer a skin tone match concealer
and then this neutralizer that just has
a hint of olive to it like I would use
this around areas with redness and then
there's an awesome very smooth buttery
rich setting powder it actually adds
some additional coverage on top of these
concealers I've hit pan on my old pallet
that I had of this it's just really
really good stuff and the texture of the
concealers is so nice and creamy really
fantastic coverage so the way I like to
put it on is I'll take the deeper of the
to dab it on the under eye and then add
a little bit of the light on top so
ultimately I end up getting a blend of
those shades and then you can use the
lighter shade anywhere on your face you
want to highlight the neutralizer like I
said
around any redness get it all blended
out I even used my Real Techniques
sponge to do some of that blending and
then the ability to set it and have that
right there in this little bitty compact
that fantastic matte setting powder is
so so nice so this is a total
recommendation and something that I am
going to be reminded to go back to again
and again and targets number one best
selling makeup product is the NYX
ultimate eyeshadow palette now this does
come in a couple of shade options one is
really bright and colorful this is the
one called warm neutrals this is the one
that first came up I suspect this is
probably the best-selling one that they
have but yeah neutral eyeshadow palette
I'm kind of surprised it's a best seller
because this isn't exactly cheap this
actually sells for $17.99 but it has a
ton of positive ratings as well it's a
matte and shimmer neutral mix and I
would say I know this comparison has
been drawn before but it's giving me a
very naked heat type feel
you got some rusty and golden metallics
got a really dark burgundy a dark kind
of reddish brown light highlight shades
in matte and shimmery options I mean the
way I use this today I'll just bounce
right into a tutorial here for you but I
use one of the mid-tone Browns in my
crease just to get things going there
and then anytime there's a rest you
gotta see what that rusty is made
of so I used that dark matte in my
crease as well and once I got that
blended out I used a cream shade up as
my highlight and then also one of the
light champagne colors for a little more
of a pop on my brow bone and then on my
lid I used the lightest gold on the
inner most part and then I worked more
toward the center of my lid with the
deeper gold then once I got those patted
on there I took the rich warm dark brown
and I got that all on my outer corner
area and I used some of that on my lower
lash line as well as well as some of the
medium brown just to get it all smudgy
and smoky the end result
I definitely think is a pretty look I
see why people like this palette it's
very usable and I think it has probably
been referenced a lot on YouTube as
being a good shadow option for me I
think the strength in this palette would
be the mid-tone and deeper mattes the
shimmers honestly disappointed me a
little bit though like this gold and
this gold I expected to see
way more richness out of those shades
they're just definitely on the shear
side and when you do build them up on
the eyes they don't look like that nice
kind of smooth really sleek Sheen across
the skin I know I've been messing with
my lorac mega Pro for a lot lately and
it's not really fair to maybe even
compare the two but the way those
shadows like hang together is you put
them on and the mattes are really doing
a good job in this palette but the
shimmers are really more on the sheer
side and I'm not a huge fan of that so I
would say well there have been a bunch
of things in this top ten where I've
been like yes this is a great thing
totally deserving of being a
best-selling product this one I couldn't
put my fullest recommendation behind it
if I had to pick some favorites out of
this top ten that I think are the best
things that I've talked about
I love the essence pure nude highlight
and absolutely I mean this is my winner
right here from Target the Sonia Kashuk
hidden agenda concealer palette these
brushes from Real Techniques are just
fabulous and I think can hang with any
other high-end type brush and I love the
sponge to this along with the NYX you
know a couple of my top makeup face
sponges this is in my rotation you know
I'll use one I'll get it dirty I'll grab
for a clean one you know if it's this
that's great and please you guys hold me
accountable on this Milani make it last
setting spray because I'm gonna keep
using this I really want to know how
closely it's gonna end up comparing to
something that I really know works well
like Urban Decay all nighter let's say
so if you guys enjoyed this video
I would definitely appreciate a thumbs
up that would be a nice way to let me
know if you'd like to see more of this
kind of thing as well thank you so much
for your time and I will see you soon
