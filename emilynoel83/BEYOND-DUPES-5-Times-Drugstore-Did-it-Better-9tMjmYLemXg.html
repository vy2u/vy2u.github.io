joining me love-love-love doing this
kind of video where I kind of compiled
some things a really random selection of
things actually I mean I'm not following
any sort of theme like face eyes lips I
just kind of like to do these sorts of
videos as they come as the products
naturally become discovered by me but
it's times when I feel like drugstore
products definitely without a doubt beat
out the more expensive high-end
alternative I do have another video that
I did a lot like this all linked to that
one below if you really enjoy this kind
of theme but yeah these are situations
where maybe you've heard a thing or two
about the different high-end products
but I'm telling you here they're not
worth it you don't have to go there and
spend that much and as I show some
little demos throughout the video kind
of in the background I'm gonna be using
all the drugstore stuff so that's what
the finished look is is really all
drugstore first thing I want to talk
about is this product from Becca and
it's called the anti fatigue under eye
primer and it's this kind of mint green
colored cream here and it feels a lot
like a lip balm I would say the first
thing I really noticed about it was how
it almost felt like it went cream to
powder that might be a bit of an
exaggeration there but it's like creamy
and then it very immediately goes away
and you don't feel any creaminess and I
feel like why would I want to put
something on my under eye area that
wasn't just adding extra hydration I
feel like almost anybody can use a
little extra hydration there also I've
kind of picked up my glitter nails so I
have a few figures I don't have anything
on them so just think of those as accent
fingers another thing with this is it's
calling itself anti fatigue and I'm
thinking why is there no like cooling
sensation with this wouldn't that
totally help with like deep puffing you
know prepping that area I've got two
products right off hand that I think
definitely do everything I would want in
this area and one of them is the hard
candy sheer envy coconut water primer
stick also elf has their prep and
hydrate balm but both of these are big
sticks here that you can put on your
under eye area you could really wear
them all over the face if you wanted to
but they're nice and smooth they almost
melt down on the skin and do add some
extra hydration so even though I use an
eye cream
find this extra hydration to be helpful
but they're also cooling so they're
super refreshing when you put it on that
under-eye area and you're adding some
moisture so you're not gonna be all dry
underneath your concealers and stuff but
also I can visibly see that area deep
puffs and I also like to use my little
eye roller I call it a roller but the
thing doesn't really roll this little
aluminum ball thing from Real Techniques
that you can run around that area and
that is intense cooling but I gave this
Becca thing a lot of shots and I was
like what's special about this I kept
trying to see what makes this you know
worth a high-end price tag and I end up
thinking no the hard candies better the
elf's better for sure here's another
thing that I've been experimenting with
a little bit I've got this product from
Charlotte Tilbury called Wonder Glo
instant soft focus Beauty flush this is
like some liquid glow that you could put
over your foundation you could use it
kind of as a spotlight at highlight you
could use it under your foundation kind
of like a glowy primer and that's the
way I've been kind of experimenting with
this quite a bit it's got a nice little
squeezy tube design there the bottle is
of course beautiful I love the Charlotte
Tilbury packaging but whenever I use
this I feel like the effect kind of
disappears from my skin and what I ended
up seeing like I look up really close
and I can see some small flecks of
glitter I can see where the product has
been you know it's leaving a little bit
of a trail but it's not like all hanging
together in this nice fluid glow to me
it just seems like a much cheaper effect
on the skin then I would expect from
something with this price tag right and
so recently you guys may have seen me
using my covergirl video this covergirl
vitalists go glow luminizing lotion and
this is in the shade daybreak so this
would be the color that I think is
comparable to at least the effect that
the Tilbury product is trying to pull
off and this one yes it does have a
faint smell of corn chips I mentioned
that there it's just got a little odd
smell to it but you don't notice it once
you you know put it all over your skin
that kind of goes away there's a little
sweetness in there too like I don't know
what they were trying to achieve with
the scent honestly but the more I play
with this the more I do really like the
effect it makes a really nice primer on
the skin and the glow you know what I
mean about kind of a pearly glow that
sort of hangs together on your skin
there's not itty-bitty bits of sparkle
they're kind of
you're like what's this actually doing
no it's very obvious I think what this
is doing and to top it off another
function of this it can be a nice liquid
highlight - I would say it gives my skin
some added moisture before I put my
foundation on if you're looking for that
and the extra glow - and I will say the
more shear the foundation is that you
put on top of this the more that glow
matters I guess you'd say because if you
put a really full-coverage matte
foundation on top it kind of takes away
that effect as you might expect this
could also be a nice mix in product to
shear out or perhaps change the finish
of different foundations if you mix it
in with it you will see some effect but
yeah I definitely prefer the covergirl
over this one even with that strange old
scent now let's talk about a foundation
here wow this foundation from Dior I
don't know if I've ever tried to do our
foundation before but this is the
forever undercover 20 for our full
coverage foundation and I feel like I've
tried a lot of good long wearing
foundations from the drugstore lately so
when I saw this on sephora's website I
thought you know let's give that a try
let's see how a product like this
actually measures up to some of the
other ones that I like I have this in
the shade 20 and I am NOT a fan guys I'm
really not a fan of the way this war yes
it did stay on my skin I won't say 24
hours because I didn't even test it that
long but it stayed you know from my 6:00
in the morning till like 10:00 at night
timeframe it was definitely still
present on my skin it didn't even seem
to wear down on my oily areas but that
being said it did not look pretty like
the coverage on it truly is pretty good
it says full coverage but it's not the
fullest coverage thing that I own but it
exaggerated so much texture on my skin
that I didn't even think it was there
like I look at myself after dinner time
up close in the mirror and I'm like is
this really my skin do I really have all
these problems like I was looking across
my forehead and it looked so textured my
under eyes looked like it was
practically like this foundation was
just put on and that kind of
shrink-wrapped like it just kind of
shrunk on my skin and there are I would
say a handful of drugstore foundations
that I like better than this but let's
first just spotlight a favorite that I
love so much and I feel like I loved it
before it was even cool here I'm YouTube
the superstay from Maybelline 24-hour
foundation this step is full coverage it
looks
really fresh all day and by the way it's
truly full coverage I feel I think if
you want coverage it's the best full
coverage foundation in the drugstore I
wear warm nude which is a little dark
for me but I haven't gone ahead and
bought anything lighter it's amazing how
this looks on my skin late in the day it
seems fresh it doesn't seem like wow
that must have been applied 12 hours ago
or whatever this one I'm just not
impressed with the wear down at all and
like I said the coverage could be a
little better next stop next up we've
got the thing that kind of prompted the
idea for this video when I tried it I
thought no way there's got to be a
better drugstore one and I know there is
because I've been using drug store
liquid highlights now for quite some
time
the balm my precious the balm a brand
that I really love put out mary-lou
manizer in a liquid form and called it
mary lou manizer so great name great
name choice I love that and it's a
liquid highlight with a wand applicator
here it looks very metallic very
pronounced as you can see problem is I
feel like it sets literally on contact
like I swipe this on my skin and I can
barely put down that wand fast enough to
get it blended out like it just really
clings in there and it's hard because I
only want to apply so much pressure to a
highlight that's sitting on top of you
know foundations and concealers that
I've artfully blended out on my skin you
know try to do you only want to have to
do so much rubbing and this sets
entirely too fast although the look you
know if it would be able to maybe have a
little more moisture in it and not set
so fast
that would be a really pretty liquid
highlight but we have options y'all we
have the NYX away week low which I used
that today because I don't know that
I've demoed this one a whole lot it's
super brightening you don't have to work
real quickly with it I mean I wouldn't
just hang around and go make my coffee
and then come back and blend it because
it'd probably be set by then same deal
with the makeup revolution liquid
highlight and champagne I love love love
this one too I think you've seen me use
this on my skin more recently but both
you know you don't want to take forever
on them but they don't rush you really
there's just more ease with it with this
Mary do manizer I physically like can't
move fast enough to get that blended out
but how about that away we glow on my
skin today don't you love that here's an
their brand that I typically love and
this is a product that I wouldn't call
bad but I'm seeing drugstore do it way
better and it's from bite and it's their
lip liners okay I got this this number
36 it came in that champagne discovery
kit and here's why I like it it's truly
a wonderful shade it's like the lip
liner color the deep neutral that's so
my jam the spice colored lip liner can
work with so many different looks it's
so versatile and great to have but the
more I think about it the more I'm like
I'm really disappointed in how dry this
is and how much it kind of pulls across
the skin and I think about how wonderful
and luxurious feeling their lipsticks
are and this kind of feels honestly a
little cheap especially when I've been
using my color riche matte lip liners
this is the one called mastermind and
you watch how fast this thing sweeps
across my lips it's a lip pencil it's
not extra wide it doesn't have some
unusual size to it it's the same size as
the bite but I can fly across my lips
with this I've got it's watched right
below the bite one it's a nice kind of
warmish neutral shade with a little rose
and it leave dusty rose I also love
mattes it which is a bit cooler there
you go there's the full lineup that's
mattes it on the bottom that's
mastermind in the middle and that's the
bite one up top and I just get so much
full on color with these it's just
wonderful and then you can move on and
do whatever you want with them like
leave them as a matte lip color in
themselves today I took the angel tears
and I went on top of mastermind and
that's my look look today but yeah I
think that's been one of the first
products from bite where I've really
been scratching my head with it thinking
this doesn't seem super consistent with
the quality that I see all throughout
the rest of their line so that's it guys
that's 5 times when a drugstore product
completely did it better than high-end
