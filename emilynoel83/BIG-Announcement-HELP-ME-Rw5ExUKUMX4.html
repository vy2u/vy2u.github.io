you this video today because I had a
super super exciting announcement and I
really really hope I can get your help
on this i arrived at work this morning
to see some tweets that people had sent
me saying I voted for you and I'm like
what is this and I click the link and
the official YouTube blog has actually
started a new feature called on the rise
and beauty broadcast along with three
other channels are up for basically a
special feature on the YouTube homepage
youtube yeah I know it's like you know I
do my videos and I do my thing but now I
guess youtube and the higher ups or
somebody within power has taken note and
basically it's a voting thing so you
could vote for me and if you do my video
will get this special opportunity or my
channel will get this special
opportunity to get a lot of great
exposure and the channels that were
picked were ones that guess have shown a
lot of growth here lately and they kind
of want them to get out there more so I
am so appreciative to whoever stumbled
across me and thought I was worthwhile
for this I feel honored I feel just so
thrilled and I would really like to take
advantage of this opportunity but I do
need your votes
you
I know you guys are probably sick of
hearing all these campaign ads for
midterm elections but I just had to do
something fun it's not my absolute oh my
gosh you couldn't do without it the
pigmentation is so great all-time
favorite shades as in of any web product
I know that one key pick up big bulk of
it I'm a city yeah and still small enjoy
oh my
I don't want to go on and on about
anything any longer but I would really
appreciate your vote i'll have the link
down in the bottom bar just click the
more info thing it will expand and you
will have a link there where you can go
and cast your vote for me and I'm just
very excited said this is the first time
YouTube has done anything really like
this and so I would just be thrilled to
get to be part of it and really
represent the beauty community because
like I said I'm the only makeup related
channel that's part of this and I just
think it would draw a lot of people's
interest to this and let them see just
how popular and how powerful the beauty
community on YouTube early it thank you
so much for always taking the time to
watch to show interest in my videos and
for the friends that I have made through
this whole process thank you and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
