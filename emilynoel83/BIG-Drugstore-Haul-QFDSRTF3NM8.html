video yay I love doing haul videos when
it's like a bunch of drugstore products
and things that you know we've all been
seeing in our drug stores lately and if
I've gone ahead and picked him up it
kind of helps me to do this video or it
helps you know what I have and what
sorts of things may be coming in a
future review or tutorial and things
like that so this is purely drugstore
products and it I definitely didn't go
out and buy it all at once it's over
time since I don't know probably like
the start of the year so I'm not quite
sure but some of these things are like
general needs and then others are
definitely just like fields i found and
stuff like that so let's go ahead and
get started i'll start with the eye
products and the first one I'm gonna
tell you about is the Maybelline eye
studio I've gotten so many questions
people saying have you tried that what
do you think about it and I did do a
tutorial on this actually here's your
little preview so this is green and like
a maroonish aid mad from office and so
it's kind of an interesting palette i
will get into much more detail on this
particular item in my tutorial kind of /
review video that i did on it moving on
i also tried one of these I studio duos
I think they look like a baked product
you know where it's like that I can't
get it open there we go this one is
called carbon Frost and it's really
strange it's like okay trying to make it
show up on this side here this is like a
mix of pink blue maroon and gold and
it's like if you rub your finger on it
the shade you would actually come out
with is like a topi grey shade and then
you have the black on that side so these
are pretty pretty soft I mean they're
not super pigmented I don't know if I
would go back and like won really want
to buy a bunch more of these but it's
okay it's it's okay the next thing that
I got that I haven't tried yet and I'm
really excited to is these new um
pallets from wet and wild called color
icon this one is in pride so it's long
blues and the greens in it and basically
the concept behind these is that you get
three shimmery shades and three matte
shades so I know for all of you that are
kind of over you know shimmer some
people love shimmer some people don't
I'm well aware of that so here you go
you got on three matte shades right here
in three shimmery shades so I have not
used this on my eyes yet but if I swatch
it and the colors are really freaking
bull like just a little bit on my finger
really shows up a lot those are the
matte shades and then for the shimmer
you can see those are pretty nice too
but the matte shades are really really
bold here so I'm very excited to test
that out because as we know like wet and
wild has so much you get a Kleenex what
wild has some products that people
really love in terms of eye shadow like
the ultimate expressions palettes but on
a lot of cases those were like all
shimmery so these may I think bringing
some more people to their brand by
incorporating more matte so that's
interesting another eye shadow product I
got was from Revlon and I think I was
getting like a buy-one-get-one on
something although I can't remember what
the other thing was I I don't know but I
got this shadow palette in wildflower
and this is the colors are like I hope
it's not getting too washed out but the
colors are green like gold lilac and
taupe here so they're not very vibrant
you can't really tell much of a
difference between them when you put
them on your eye um I gotta say I'm not
like super hit over heels for it but it
just looked pretty to me in the
packaging so I went ahead and got it
next thing is a couple of really good
deals i got from CVS on Milani stuff and
I'm pretty sure he's not getting
discontinued but they are seventy-five
percent off at least at my CVS and the
sunset duo's you know how much I love
these and I have almost all I think I
have all of them now after getting this
one which is sunset City and this is a
nice matte bronzer and then you get this
really pretty peachy gold blush that
comes with it I get a lot more use out
of the bronzers in these but they're
really good lie
I mean I'm talking like NYC sunny kind
of thing like they may even have a
little more color payoff but they come
in varying degrees of how dark that
bronzer is I have that on today and it's
just nice that it's you know no shimmer
just nice to perk up your entire
complexion there and then I got also
seventy-five percent off and that amount
of these were both less than two dollars
with a seventy-five percent off and this
Milani glimmer stripes in a glimmer
stripes in pink glimmer just a neat
highlighting kit here basically it's one
of those things where you can just run
your brush through it and just get a
nice like light highlight or you can use
them all individually and what I found
and I talked about in a video long ago
is that I believe that these
highlighters um the colors here are very
very similar to the feel and the
consistency of the Milani single
eyeshadows so if you get one of these
and which I have them in some that have
more Browns to them and there's some
that have more pinks as well if you get
these it's like you're getting ooh I
just flipped it over got my thumbnail in
there anyway if you get these you're
getting what's very similar to those
single eyeshadows that people love so
much and you're getting like five
different shades so consider that these
can be used all over the face not just
as a highlighter but on your eyes to
other thing I got some nails I love
these nails Broadway nails natural nude
French deceptions it says most
natural-looking French manicure and it
claims to have a softer white tip so
that's what I have on right now um don't
know how well you can see them but they
are just a little more natural and that
there's not as much contrast between
like the nail part and then the whitetip
done they're just a little more like
soft kind of finish very finished
looking but not so bold I mean don't get
me wrong I love I love the French
manicure look but these are just a
little more like they say softer a
little more natural that's what it looks
like nude for
inch and I got these from walgreens yeah
I think I got one from walgreens um next
thing I got some new mascara from Rimmel
it's the max volume flash mascara I
could only walk past this pink tube so
many times without picking it up and
trying it and this is interesting I
really think it builds volume quite
nicely it's a brush that's a traditional
brush but the bristles kind of like kind
of like twist around the brush that's
kind of the pattern they have is like
going around instead of just spiraling
it so that's interesting it does build
volume pretty nicely in one coat if you
keep going over it with a lot more coats
that might get a little bit clumpy but
overall it's pretty good next couple of
things are from Maybelline hits the oops
drop that it's the color sensational
lipstick in blushing brunette it's what
I have on right now and this is a kind
of rosy tone shade and as you can tell
by the cap this is in the nude family I
believe like you know they're all the
color sensational stuff is like
sectioned off which I think it's kind of
helpful but it's just kind of a lightish
shade it is very complementary to like
your whole complexion like it works well
with other like I looks I feel like yeah
sometimes like a bold red or a bold pink
is going to kind of steal the show on
your face but this kind of works nicely
with everything not being too loud but
still brightening the face i really
think lip colors can kind of brighten
the face sometimes over the top of that
i have mocha glaze this gloss it's just
a slightly metallic kind of beige nude
it has a little bit of a warm warm kind
of capri undertone I almost want to say
in a little bit of shimmer but not a ton
i really like the way these lip glosses
feel on my lips the packaging could not
be more boring I mean there's not even
like a cute logo or anything on it it's
just plain and it's probably the reason
why I just walked past it so many times
and didn't think about picking it up but
I just kind of got these two with the
intention of using them together and
that is the look you're going to get if
you use them together and last couple of
things away three more things here
revlon lip sticks they have some new
lipsticks out they look like this and
they feel a lot like the color
sensational in terms of color I got two
very light shades I got a light pink and
like a nude in these I love how the
color shows they have you know an
indication of what the color is on the
tip that's nice but anyway they there's
a special name for these I can't
remember it right off the top of my head
i'll put it in the sidebar but it is
very cute packaging i love that and
they're very creamy soft color is nice
even for the fact that like i was saying
these are kind of light shades this is
baby pink and so just a nice nice light
pink really really like this shade like
i totally recommend this shades of
people who want that light pink that's
not like bright bubblegum pink and then
this shade is blush and this you're
looking at kind of a nude but not the
nude that's going to erase your lips
this is going to give you a little bit
of warmth it both of these are like
straight up like cream lipsticks they
don't have a lot of Frost's to them i
mean there's maybe a subtle frost aspect
but not like sparkle sparkle you know
what I mean there do they go on very
creamy but we're talking kind of a light
beige with this caramel a color sort of
not like I said not the new that's gonna
erase your lips so I really love the
field both of those on they just feel
good i love that last thing biore pore
strips i had heard about people on
YouTube talking about how you know like
how I use my my pore strips and I love
him and I'm thinking I haven't tried
those four years like it's been so long
and I thought maybe I'll give those
another shot because you know we can all
use a little you know reduction in our
pores not hard on our nose instead
and so this is the ultra deep cleansing
pore strips I guess that's like a step
up maybe from what they would have made
years ago it's been kind of revamped you
put them on in like 10 to 15 minutes you
take it off and basically it goes right
over your nose like you see in the
picture here and it just pulls the gun
guy out of your pores and I used one the
other night and I was like facebooking
about it on my beauty broadcast facebook
page and everybody like I got so many
comments from people saying either love
um hatem you know it's a very polarizing
a beauty product but they also had him
where you could get them for the
forehead as well i just have the nose
once i think there's six strips in that
package Wow guys have you had enough yet
because that's all I got for this haul
video I'm so glad you tuned in and like
I said you can expect to see more on
these products in different videos
whether it's a review a tutorial or
whatever so now you kind of know what
I'm working with and thanks so much for
tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
