joining me for this video this one's
going to be all about some new stuff
from elf it's going to be another one of
those haul and review type videos all
mixed together and I'm sorry if that
feels a little like overload with having
just at the wet and wild one that I
posted but I'm just kind of trying to
stay up-to-date with some of these new
products and bring you the information
while the stuff is still somewhat new
and available in this video what I've
got are several face products I've also
got a few new things for lips that are
very exciting and a product for eyes as
well so as with the last video I think
it's useful to see these things actually
applied so you can kind of get a little
more sense of what they're like even if
they didn't work for me maybe it might
be the kind of thing that you enjoy but
I'm pumped and just a little spoiler
alert here it's about the sequels in
this video good stuff that elf is put
out and they've kind of re-released it
giving it a new little flavor or twist
and I think they've done some really
good things where that kind of product
is concerned so I'm going to go ahead
and get started and first talk about a
new foundation that I have it looks like
this and there's like nothing about it
on the bottle at all so I had to keep
the packaging here aqua beauty aqua
mousse foundation so they've got this
whole aqua beauty line where a lot of
the stuff is packaged and guess what
aqua my shade is light to medium it
actually borders on being well I
wouldn't even say borders on it's too
dark and it's too yellowy for me so the
shade is just not dead on but you're
ordering this stuff online that's gonna
tend to happen all of this was from just
one online order so in the claims with
this one it says hydrating gel
foundation that gives a radiant looking
dewy finish infused with purified water
coconut oil and vitamin E the silky
formula glides on and provides shear to
medium coverage I can get on board with
the fact that this is like a light to
medium coverage foundation the things
that don't really make sense to me are
that this is moisturizing in any way
like I actually found this to be kind of
drying on my skin it sets very quick
almost to the point where it's a little
bit difficult to blend out formatted the
product it is a nice squeezy tube which
I enjoy that for sure and the
I used it I just dabbed it all over my
face and I've used some brushes in the
past couple of days to blend this out so
I thought today I would try the beauty
blender to get it all buffed in I think
the beauty blender did about as good as
could be expected I think it worked with
this foundation that was kind of trying
to set very quickly on my skin rather
well but I was just expecting something
different with mousse in the description
of this product and just with all of the
moisturizing claims I was thinking it
might be a little bit more like that
Maybelline Dream velvet foundation
that's in the tube I have actually kind
of enjoyed having that in the rotation
lately because I feel like the coverage
is just tremendous and I don't feel like
it's overly drying this one just
surprising like how immediately after
it's all blended in and you touch your
face like wow things feel totally dry
like not even a little bit of moisture
on my skin and I felt like I used a
generous amount sometimes it's about the
amount of product you're putting on your
skin and you can put a lot on you be
like oh yes I feel doing now because
there's just been a lot of product
applied but in this case you know I
applied it what I think was a reasonable
amount for me to get all over my face
and it just set fast it didn't feel like
any moisture was given back to my skin
maybe I'm talking to those of you who
have oily skin and you you need
something like this that isn't going to
be dewy but it really does kind of go
against the claims that the product has
been given I'd say you know when I
finished my foundation I just wasn't
overly impressed with the look of
everything like I said I was dealing
with the shade that was a little bit off
as well in addition to the different
texture things that I found to be a bit
odd but I paid pretty close attention to
this staying power wise just yesterday
when I was wearing it I'm not seeing
really any situation where this
foundation is really excelling for me in
areas where I'm interested because it
faded rather quickly with very little
setting powder on top of it because
frankly I don't want to set this
foundation too much because it is so dry
next thing I want to talk about in this
video let me get my box for this - it's
a beautifully bare lightweight concealer
stick and I got this in the shade fair
to light this I think has been around
for a little while but I wasn't able to
act
we order my shade or the I thought
was my shade until just recently but
this is a pretty light concealer I'd say
in comparison to my skintone it does go
a good couple shades lighter says create
a flawless natural look with this
lightweight creamy concealer blends
seamlessly and helps cover imperfections
also claims to contain vitamin E to
nourish and hydrate I was expecting a
little bit smoother concealer honestly
with this type of claim you know the
beautifully bare line is a very natural
line from ELF many of the things that
I've tried are lightweight too they kind
of slip across the skin and with this
one I was kind of surprised that the
concealer was as thick as it was and
it's almost just a little too thick and
dry for me I feel like I'm being so
picky but this is just the way it goes
sometimes stick concealers are touchy
there are some brands that are doing
really good ones in the drugstore now
I'm thinking of the almay age essentials
concealer stick you know that stuff
glides on easy to blend the Revlon
Photoready stick covergirl plus Olay
concealer stick these are examples of
things that you could put on your under
eye area and not think like wow that's
going to attract attention to every
single little line with this just
grazing across the skin you can tell
there's some thickness to it and that
can help the coverage I'm not really
knocking it too much from that angle but
it's that it's just sort of dry so
you've got a work kind of hard to blend
it in I worked with both a Beauty
Blender and my fingers to sort of try to
melt down the product and it turned out
to be a rather brightening shade for me
although I did ultimately add a little
bit of benefit erased paste around my
Caverns right here the innermost corners
just because it's not as going to be a
super corrective concealer it might be
better I think on my skin anyway just in
pinpointed areas where I wouldn't have
to use too much wouldn't be streaking a
whole lot over my skin giving myself the
need to blend a lot of stuff out
particularly on this under-eye area
where I feel like product clings more it
can start to look dry as the day
progresses you know I just I know what's
going to happen here I already don't
love the look and it's gonna you know
it's gonna go downhill
now another face thing that's very new
from elfs line are their HD highlighting
powders and I got one of these in the
shade starlight glow I'm not sure why I
chose this particular shade but it
really does at a glance it makes me
think of the balms mary-lou manizer
doesn't it's got that little bit of a
golden a tinge to it personally not a
fan I thought it looked dry and kind of
flaky on the skin I'm looking at myself
really up close and I can see exactly
where the highlighter was laced I mean
not in a way like I applied a really
thick streak of it's just very obvious
it's kind of like sitting on top of the
skin this powder has sort of a dryness
to it and I can just see it sitting
there
despite blending I continue to be a huge
fan of the essence highlight that I
featured in the Emily Awards I think
that's just a really fantastic product
for giving the skin a glow but looking
somewhat undetectable I'm not saying
this can't work and there may be those
of you out there with like the perfect
most smooth skin ever where this does
perform pretty well but on me maybe it's
just all this dry stuff that I've kind
of got going on underneath it shows a
lot but I have worn this on top of other
foundations and coverage products and I
just thought you know I'm just I'm just
seeing makeup I promise things are gonna
start getting better eventually in this
video but here's another thing you guys
I just I it ticks me off a little bit I
got this aqua Beauty aqua primer mist as
this water-based primer mist prep skin
for smooth makeup application in a
radiant look alcohol and silicone free
enriched with purified water cucumber
vitamins B and E leaves the skin looking
dewy and fresh I kind of wondered if
this would be the type of thing that was
similar to my hard candy sheer envy
primer mist which I love so so much and
that's not just a primer mist for me you
know that's something I really primarily
use at the end of my makeup that's where
I use this product too nice construction
here it looks like a nice bottle the
issue is all in the spray with me I feel
like I can't fully take advantage of the
product inside because it's spraying out
like an absolute look at how it's
spraying out quickly and then it get
does this little bonus splash
like who just wants a few random
droplets just kind of sitting there
after the fact that you've got to like
dab over and wipe off knowing what a
nice full fine mist is what I would like
so when I hold it straight you know kind
of at my face like I would most miss
I've got I think too hard of a spray
coming at me and so then I kind of tilt
it upward that's the only way I get some
and then I get that bonus splash which
is just big droplets falling you know
all over and even when I tilt it up that
initial mist is not quite enough it's
like it's coming out a little too
targeted I think you guys get where I'm
going with this I've just got a bunch on
my eyelid there actually it's a huge
part of these setting this is the way
they spray out because you're spraying
liquid on your face you're hoping you
know it has the proper effects to just
kind of set the makeup or give you that
nice little dewy end glow I just I can't
can't get on board with that what I'm
sorry so the light at the end of the
tunnel for this video there are new
flavors of the elf lip exfoliator 's and
I love them all I think these are great
I love elfs lip exfoliater we're talking
like a $3 product it makes me think of a
sugar scrub that's been binded with some
sort of balm and now they've really
branched out you know they had that
original one that's kind of a Brown
sugary thing they had the cherry the
mint they've all continued to work well
for me I find them to be very sturdy
products too because this is the kind of
situation when you're rubbing that
exfoliator over your lips you're going
to apply some pressure it really is
important that it holds up well so I've
not had any durability issues over the
years with these now some people have
said my lips are so so dry that I feel
like I'm not even getting anything out
of the exfoliator and here's my tip on
that you might consider leaving a balm
on your lips for you know several
minutes before you even pull out the
exfoliator and that will start to soften
some of those crusty really really dry
areas and then the exfoliator can really
help you slough them off I think that
might be something to try I know I've
been in a few situations where that was
absolute
necessary and then like I said make sure
once you exfoliate you follow that up
with a ball maybe if this is a nighttime
treatment for you or if you're ready to
jump into your lip product of the day I
think you'll find you have much smoother
lips but the three new cents they came
out what they have rose
they have coconut and they have pink
grapefruit and there you know such
distinct cents each one very different
from the next that coconut love it
really like true coconut doesn't even
make me think of sunscreen or like the
tropics so much as I smell it and I just
think coconut and then the rose I use
the Rose today I think it's so fresh
it's very real like I've just kind of
surprised at how dead-on they got these
scents and then the pink grapefruit
super refreshing that's got to be
someone's morning ritual the pink
grapefruit so leave those were the only
three new ones that came out and I think
yep you're wondering whether those are
worth looking into I think they
certainly are and then the last thing in
this whole that really excited me and
I'm just very pleased to tell you about
is the second version of elfs mad format
palette check it out it's a 10 color
palette I was a pretty big fan of the
original mad format which was just very
basic shades the kinds of colors you
need to sort of build up your matte
shadow collection and here you know
things have gone I think a bit more fun
perhaps you've got about half the
palette that I think is very safe some
borderline rosy colors in there that are
just beautiful this color here in the
middle I mean you're going to glance at
it and think okay they gave us gray no
it's like a blackberry a plummy taupe
very interesting and then the richness
of the shades over here on this end is
just fantastic
love this rose and then this terracotta
kind of orange e color really worked
that into my look today along with the
plum you've got a fantastic brown and a
really impressive matte black in here
also so if you were already a fan of mad
format I think you're going to like this
too
particularly if you like some of those
warm colors you know that are being
offered here I just think it's really
great quality they swatched out well
I've worn them several different ways
you know a couple of very natural looks
that didn't go into the rich colors so
much and I thought hey this is perfectly
usable and then last two days have been
done to look very similar to what I'm
wearing now with that kind of plum on
the lid blending up into the Terracotta
Orange and making this sort of sunset
feeling on the eyes so I'm gonna walk
you through real quick my look that I
did today I applied a primer all over my
lids first and then I use my Sigma e25
brush with the orange e shade just
buffed it all throughout the crease and
then I used the lightest shade in this
palette that cream just right up under
the brow and that can kind of help you
blend out the edge of the orange as well
then I took a flat brush with the plum
patted that all over my lid space left a
little gap on the inner most part but
really got it on the lid and just up
into the crease I love the way that kind
of meets with the orange color and then
my last step for the lid was to just
bring back the cream and brighten up the
inner most part again I did some black
liquid liner across the upper lashline
winged it out a little bit and then I
brought in one of those s de Edit
eyeliners which are the creamiest things
on earth use that Bordeaux color on my
inner rim and I smudged it down below a
bit and then I brought in the Sigma
smudge brush with the plum color and
just continued smudging along just
smudging along that lashline I'm getting
it nice and dark and plumy there I
applied some covergirl super sizer
mascara today I put on some false lashes
which came from my Ardell lash look Bo
think these lashes are the one 13s just
one example just want to show you a
little bit of these colors in action but
I was very pleased so I'd say this was a
pretty clear-cut review for me I mean in
my eyes and for the things that I'll
continue to use the matte format -
palette the new flavors of the lip
exfoliater 's you know the coverage
products like that foundation the
concealer not really my cup of tea and I
think the texture of them had a lot to
do with it the primer mist
almost seems like a defective product
and the highlight you know some people
may love it some people I think
depending on just skin type and skin
texture it
could be the type of thing that looks a
little bit dry but thank you guys so
much for your time and for your interest
in these videos if you didn't check out
my wet and wild video definitely give
that a look because there are some new
products new foundation e-type product
that I was very interested in in that
video so again thank you and I will talk
to you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
