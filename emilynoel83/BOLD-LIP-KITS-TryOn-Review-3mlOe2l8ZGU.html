couple of bold lip kits and one of them
I knew I'd be talking about at some
point here it's the Sephora favorites
give me some bold lip samplers that
there are six products in here it sells
for $28 not everything is full-size I
believe the laura mercier lipstick in
here is and everything else is a little
bit downsized and then I realized bite
has put out yet another set so I already
reviewed their amuse-bouche lipstick set
which I thought really kind of went more
toward a neutral color scheme you know
you did have a really deep shade in
there but you also had three kind of
like light to medium neutrals and with
this set this is their matte cream lip
crayon collection and everything in here
sorry if I'm blinding you there but
every shape in here happens to be kind
of bold this set is $25 you're getting
four lip products in there so I'm going
to kind of chat a little bit about
what's in each of these kids show you
lip swatches of everything maybe talk
about what I think is the better value
but I do think a lot of this is going to
come back to your personal opinion and
how much experimentation you really want
to do if you are into just trying one
really good formula of some bold lip
products and you like that matte finish
too I think you're going to be
interested in the bite set these colors
are really gorgeous but if you want to
step out of the box a little bit more
there are a lot of really great quality
products in the favorites set here from
Sephora favorites every single different
formula may not be 100% up your alley so
I'm gonna start off with the bite and
tell you it first off a little bit about
this formula it's the matte green lip
crayon so what you're getting are kind
of like a skinny stick I do really like
this format because I think it gives you
precision every shade is bright right
you don't really want something big and
thick and totally rounded off and even
as the points of these go down a little
bit I still find them very easy to
control I've had you know several of
these in past sets and continue to use
them and I haven't had an issue with
precision on these now the formula is
not going to be as like moisture-rich as
those amuse-bouche lipsticks are that I
reviewed previously
these you know do go on they have kind
of an instantaneous matte finish you're
not waiting for any sort of dry down
with these they're a cream lipstick
product but the interesting thing is
that even after they've been on your
lips for a while you can kind of press
your lips together move them around a
little bit and you can still feel some
amount of creaminess you don't feel 100%
dried out as you might with certain
liquid lipstick products where if you
rub your lips together chances are you
would prompt some flaking or something
to happen so these feel really nice on
the lips they are matte without being
overly drying and the staying power is
really good all fine you know I have a
very typical staying power we're down
with these obviously it's different for
everybody depending on what you're doing
what you're eating drinking etc but I do
notice the first signs of wear down sort
of in the center of the lip and what I
like about these is that given that they
are more of a lipstick texture touching
up is very easy and a lot of times I
won't even feel the need to touch up the
entire lip the other day I was wearing
like the red velvet shade which is a
nice deep red and the nice thing about
it was I could just go to touch up the
one little place where it seemed like it
was wearing down and that was very easy
to do I didn't feel like I needed to
start fresh because everything else
looked really nice it wasn't bleeding
outside my lips I wasn't having like a
messy sloppy issue and that's another
big point for me and a reason why I
enjoy this kit is that they're giving
you bright colors in a matte finish and
that's really important to me because I
feel like I can wear them with a little
more confidence I can wear this bright
red and I'm not really worried about it
bleeding about it getting sloppy or
greasy or you know just veering outside
of the beaten path so to speak I really
think they made them as nourishing and
comfortable as they probably would have
been capable of doing and a little
packaging note here this is what your
products look like in the tin and you
also have a mirror here as well let's
talk more about the shades this is the
lineup right up here this upper row of
product those are the shades that you're
getting so the first one is called
orchid I think it's very well named this
is the one shade of the bunch that is
limited edition everything else could be
purchased in a full sized individually
but and this sheet is like a bright cool
pink
I do think this is a fun color not the
type of shade I find myself reaching for
every day but it's really well done in
this collection and I think it's fun to
have that pop in here next color is a
phrase and this is the one that I've
been wearing throughout the video it's a
really nice bright red I think there is
you know some warmth than this red just
one of those undeniably glamorous colors
I'm really happy that that was in here
but what's cool is you also have a shade
called red velvet and this is taking it
down a notch in terms of depth a lot of
people might find red velvet to be a
little more wearable at first I thought
I liked red velvet better but now I'm
kind of in a toss-up with these two Reds
I love them both as I look at the
swatches on my hand they do look kind of
close but there's no doubt a lot more
depth and just richness to the red
velvet shading on your list and then
finally you're getting a deep dark color
called truffle and this is a very dark
like black cherry shade it can go on
very full color and look you know have
that kind of near black intensity at a
glance but then you really start looking
at it you're like I can see some berry
you know some tones of plum coming
through that and as it wears down you
will see more and more of that this is
the one that requires the most care and
application to make sure you're getting
it nice and even and even though it is
matte you know it sort of requires the
most care also in where and touch-ups if
you want it to continue to look
perfectly even all across your lips one
tip though with this you could choose to
blot it off right at the start and
instead of having that really dark
intensity you can lighten it up a little
bit right at the get-go and have a very
wearable berry type color so that is
your little bite kit now let's move on
to the Sephora favorites where as I said
you're getting six products in here
different formats there are three liquid
lipsticks two classic lipsticks that are
very creamy and then actually one of
these bite matte cream lip crayons is
included in here as well in a different
shade since every formula is a little
bit different I'll just show you the
color and kind of chat about what I
think of it as we go first off we've got
the tardis lip paint and
in the shade called yes and yeah you
never really hear me say that my channel
I think there's a reason but I think the
best way to describe this color is a
bright lilac you know it's definitely
got a lot less pink in it than the
lightest shade and that bite set does
and I think it's pretty I do also think
that the formula of the tardis lip
paints is maybe not my favorite liquid
lipstick formula but it's up there in
terms of not being as drying tending to
wear off a little more evenly and not
giving you that real flaky issue that
being said it doesn't dry down a hundred
percent so it can still transfer off but
it feels very light and kind of mousse
like as you apply it and I feel like I
get a really even application and with
this shade and also with the next liquid
lip color I'm going to talk about
neither of these really had that issue
that I sometimes notice where after the
dry down it turns into a totally
different shade well maybe not totally
different but a lot of times these
liquid lipsticks dry down and then they
look two or three shades darker than
what they started or what they look like
in the tube and I felt like this one
looked pretty true to color the next one
is from ciate and it is a liquid velvet
lip color in the shade head-over-heels
classic classic hot pink right here it
is matte it also has a very similar
texture to tart and that when I put it
on I feel like it feels light now after
I wear it for a while it's not offering
a lot of extra moisture to my lips
that's for sure but it doesn't totally
suck the life out of my lips one day
when I was wearing this recently I
noticed the typical kind of we're down
pattern for me in the center of the
lower lip and granted I had eaten a lot
of Cheetos that afternoon but touching
up is a little bit more touchy I guess
with these liquid lip colors than it is
with a creamy more lipstick e-type
product but that is a gorgeous shade
that's a stunning hot pink and then
you've got a lipstick from Sephora here
it's the sephora rouge cream and r49 now
this is a formula that feels really
really great it actually kind of reminds
me of those bite amuse-bouche lipsticks
super creamy this is a very true read it
kind of reminds me of a mix of the red
I've got on and the red velvet shade
from the bite set it's like a
got some warmth but just a hair more
depth than what I'm wearing right now
and I do think it's pretty it's ultra
creamy though not my first choice for a
formula to wear in a bold red just
because it is so dang creamy and I would
be a little concerned about it drifting
outside my lips but can't take anything
away from that color it is really
gorgeous next up you are getting one of
these bite matte cream lip crayons this
is in the shade aubergine gorgeous true
classic berry here so everything I
talked about with the formula of what
was in the bite lip kit really continues
to hold true for this I love this color
it's rich it's intense but it doesn't
take you to that near blackened place so
I think a lot of people would find this
very wearable and a super you know fall
and winter appropriate color next from
Laura Mercier we've got a shade that is
really really close to this one from
bite and it's the velour lip color or
velour lover's lip color in the shade
and a fair and this one I think can go
just a little bit darker than the bite
one if you build it up more but it's
very very creamy again it's a formula I
would be a little concerned about
wearing in such a dark shade because it
just has that softness that creaminess
where if I was eating something I'd
really want to watch it sorry I keep
mentioning that but that's just like the
practical thought that goes through my
head when I'm making a lip color
selection you know this formula feels
great this velour lover's it feels so
nice on the lips but it's just a really
dark shade to be wearing like that so I
might want to even blot that one off
before I like went about my day finally
we've got a liquid lipstick from Kat Von
D in damned and this one is dark dark
dark with this in the tube it looks like
an intensely dark brick red but I mean
it can look practically black if you
really apply it to its fullest extent on
the lips I probably went you know 85%
with this on the lips I think I could
have you know even packed on more color
and the dry down just takes it even
darker you can see with the swatch on my
hand here it's not a perfect swatch it's
not 100% even but look at the spots in
it where the color got most heavily
applied and it's
crazy dark this type of formula really
does dry down a lot even more so than
the CIA and the tart I can pull a little
color off of it if I'm really rubbing at
it but it kind of does lock in
definitely the most drying feeling thing
on your lips that I have talked about so
far but if you want that like 95% dry
down that is what you're gonna have to
deal with it's not gonna be a shade
everyone's interested in wearing but you
know it is in here and it does give this
kit some range you know you're going all
the way from that light bright lilac
shade into a shade that's this deep and
dark there's certainly no shortage of
variety in this kit with one exception I
did think the two berry shades were very
very close in here the one from bite and
the one from Laura Mercier so you've
seen it all now you can kind of decide
whether you're gonna go for one you know
solid formula or a sprinkling of
formulas where maybe you'll discover
something brand new in here that you
just absolutely love but this one is
just a few bucks extra and you are
getting six different products my
personal pick like if I was gonna get
this to someone who I knew loved some
bright lips like aka maybe my sister I
would go for the bite kit just because I
know there's total consistency in here I
know I'm not giving something where
somebody might possibly see the formula
as uncomfortable or hard to wear or
difficult to apply this stuff you know
if someone's used to applying a lipstick
that's pretty much what this stuff is
this kit has a few more surprises
happening in there and you know maybe
that's what you want but I just hope
that showing all these colors swatched
out showing them on my lips might give
you just a little more insight on what's
happening with these bold bright lip
kits so thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you soon in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
