bronzer B B's and CC products that are
out there these days I had just
mentioned actually this it cosmetics CC
plus bronzer in my haul video got a lot
of feedback on it a lot of people were
liking the way it looked and also just
some questions about the way it applied
and wore on throughout the day so I
thought this would be a good opportunity
to kind of review this but also in
comparison to a couple of other products
and they're all rather different
different coverage different staying
powers so I remember a long long time
ago I did some big drugstore BB
comparison type videos so now we're
moving on to the BB bronzers I'm just
going to talk about each one first show
you some before and afters and then kind
of give the overall comparison but the
first one I'm going to talk about here
is the NYC smooth skin BB cream 5 and 1
bronzed radiance so they do sell just
regular BB creams in NYC s line but I
have this in the shade light I believe
there were two options in this bronze
version light and medium but this is
very light I would say once I get this
all blended out all over my skin it
takes me just a hair deeper maybe a
little more glow to the skin but it's
definitely the most subtle out of
anything I'm going to talk about and the
least bronzy I think maybe for my skin
tone I could have gone for the medium
and it would have given me more of a
bronzey result and so I squeezed them
out I blend it all over my face for
blending out all of these I'm using my
up-and-up
buffing type foundation brush from
Target I really like that I think it
works well with this consistency of
product just any standard liquid it's
really nice for and I did clean it
between each one because I didn't want
any shimmer or sparkle to like carry
over one to the next but this offers
just the lightest veil of coverage
really and all I can see is that it
might make my skintone look just a
little more radiant this claims to have
a luminous satin finish and you know
looking up close with the swatches
seeing this on my face it definitely is
the least glowy of all the three that
I'm talking about it says it minimizes
the appearance of pores fine lines and
imperfections but
I don't really feel that way about this
product I didn't think that my skin
looked that much better after putting
this on especially looking up close at
it the only thing that may be improved
was a little bit of the overall tone and
things just looked a little more fresh
and revived also this is the only one
I'm going to be talking about that does
not contain any sort of SPF and these
would all be products that I would
consider could double as your
moisturizer you know unless you were
really really dry and you wanted to
maybe go ahead and put a light
moisturizer and underneath so I really
would be relying on this step of my
makeup to have the SPF so definitely has
some marks against it for the no SPF not
adding much if any additional coverage
and just really not adding much bronze
to my skin either now next up we've got
the Maybelline Dream bronze BB and this
says eight and one beauty balm it has
SPF 25 and this is another one where you
can choose kind of according to your
skin tone so I have light - medium
bronze and I think there may have been
like four or five different options to
go with there this claims to illuminate
warm the skin tone even things out veils
imperfections hydrates smooths etc it's
just going to make you look like a
million bucks by the time you put it on
but this has a very different tone as
you see the swatches compared to the NYC
and the it seems to have just a very
traditional bronzed glow to it and when
I put this all over my skin the
consistency is very similar to the NYC
it's pretty liquidy but it's not hard to
work with it's not a struggle to you
know blend out around the face at all
but this definitely kicks up my skin
tone a notch as far as getting a lot
more bronzy I don't think it looks
especially awkward on the skin because
as you blend and get it you know buffed
into your hairline and get it blended
all around the Sheerness of this product
allows it to kind of work you know what
I'm saying
so after applying this I feel like my
skin is much more glowy much more
bronzed although when I look closely at
it or when I see it in the swatch it's
very hard to detect if there's a lot of
shimmer I think I'm able to see a teeny
bit but it's not super intense beyond
the added depth that you can see my skin
taking on I'm not seeing hardly any
additional coverage out of this product
it's very light actually kind of
like this product once I've dressed it
up a little bit you know maybe added
some more concealer to certain areas set
it with a little bit of powder added
some blush into the mix I think it gives
a nice look it's just definitely in the
middle of what I'm talking about in
terms of adding any coverage and kind of
in the middle in terms of staying power
as well the NYC did not last very well
for me even just under very normal you
know inside the house conditions this
one I think if your oil in your t-zone
which I tend to get a little bit that
way otherwise my skin's overall very
normal you know I'll notice getting a
little dewy and those areas by day's end
but still I can tell the products still
with me
finally this it cosmetics CC plus
bronzer this has the granddaddy of them
all in terms of SPF it has SPF 50 really
like the pomp style that this has it
helps you kind of get a consistent
amount of product each time this is the
one that's got the most coverage and the
most glow so the fact that it has
coverage is what saves it for me as I
blend it over my cheek see the
difference like this is actually going
on with a coverage this foundation like
you look up really closely at this you
definitely can see that this has you
know some little particles of shimmer
it's nothing big it's nothing that you
know anybody from across the room would
be like oh my gosh she's wearing glitter
today it's not to that extent whatsoever
but it is very glowy and like I said the
fact that that glow is balanced with
some coverage is what makes me like this
product the thing about this is it's
only available in the one shade which is
bronze so for some people I mean if
you've got a really deep and rich skin
tone this may be lighter than your skin
and then for people who are really fair
it may be too much of a stretch to you
know apply something like this on your
skin and then you know see a very major
difference between your face and your
neck and you're like I don't want to
mess with that I would suggest checking
this out if you've got an Ulta near you
check it out in the store the thought of
any added bronzer to a product or
putting anything on your skin that would
be deeper than your natural skin tone if
that irritates you there is the new CC
plus illumination which I plan to expand
on in a different video
but this is one where you can actually
select your specific skin tone it's
going to be glowy er than the original
CC but no added bronzer in this stuff I
was always a fan of the original CC and
it was really nice to see that they
didn't completely change the product
other than adding more glow and more
bronze it still got the coverage that I
liked kind of like foundation and
bronzer mixed is what this makes me
think of this has more staying power
it's just a more substantial product on
the skin and with any of these you know
you would have the option of maybe
mixing them in with another foundation
to just add a little bit of bronze glow
I really like doing that with this
product because since it has some
coverage I don't think adding it into
another foundation waters it down any
you know what I'm saying if you add some
of this Maybelline for example to
another foundation you will make it more
bronze you will deepen up the tone but
the fact that this is such sheer
coverage you will in a sense water it
down a little bit the NYC I wouldn't
even bother mixing this in with another
foundation because it's so light as it
is so I think the two real contenders
here in this video are the Maybelline
and the it cosmetics and I think you got
to look at your own needs and think do I
really want coverage with a product like
this and honestly the it cosmetics one
is the only one that I think fully
delivers on the claims like when I use
this product in this product alone I do
feel like my skin looks better for it
you know it's got the coverage the glow
it looks a bronzy I mean it's just
really nice this one you know sunkissed
glow Perfector not really you know it
adds the sunkissed glow but it's not
really perfecting my skin I've got to do
quite a few other things to make that
happen but there are a few little tips I
have for wearing any kind of bronzer BB
on your skin and making it still come
off like you've got a natural bronzed
glow
I do think a lightweight liquidy
concealer is a good thing to use to
bring back the dimension to your face
and I say lightweight concealer as
opposed to like a liquid highlight
because I don't think your skin needs
any additional glow really on top of
this so for example I use my Maybelline
better skin concealer just took that
down the nose under the
I area you know anywhere where you're
still noticing maybe any imperfections
on your skin but primarily those places
where you want to bring lift I blended
over that with my round foundation brush
from up and up and I really like what
happens after I do that because I feel
like okay my skin's got some dimension
back again I didn't really need to do a
lot of it for the sake of coverage but
more for brightness and then for staying
powers sake for me I like a little light
dusting of powder I've been using my
Maybelline matte and poreless because
it's something that is lightweight I
don't think it takes away the whole glow
of the product but I just use it lightly
in the t-zone area I don't mask up the
whole face with a bunch of powder but I
do think it enhances the staying power
at least for me I like the feeling that
everything's getting kind of set and
then if you're curious what else is on
my face for this particular look I'm
wearing this color pop blush and
tongue-tied it's a really bright coral
shade and this was in the in bloom
collection on my lips I've got on this
Almay smart shea butter kiss in nude
light just a very low-maintenance balmy
type of lip product and then on the eyes
I am wearing color pop millionaire all
over the lid very very sparkly and then
to just accent that look provides some
contrast I used my Too Faced natural
matte palette so thank you guys so much
for taking time to watch I hope this was
helpful and I will see you again next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
