Holidays I hope you had a good one um
here's what I'm bringing you in this
video I have absolutely nothing on my
face today when I say nothing like just
nothing's been done looking at me you're
thinking wow I'm shocked but this is
what we're gonna be talking about today
it's by Real Techniques I just found
this at Walmart while I was doing
last-minute Christmas Eve shopping I'd
say we've been traveling most of last
week so I needed some stuff need some
essentials and I don't go into Walmart
without just going through the makeup
section even if I don't need anything
you know I just want to see is there
anything new here there it's my duty to
you all isn't it and there was something
in the Real Techniques breasts brush
section that they were teasing they were
teasing it because they had a little
sign and it said coming soon and I swear
that little sign was there for at least
two months well the other day when I was
in there they actually had the product
and it's this Real Techniques prep and
prime set and what this is is basically
a set of precious for your skin care so
it's got something to exfoliate with
it's got a brush for moisturizing and
priming it's got something for under eye
cream it's even got a lip scrub brush so
as soon as I got him I started playing
around with these and I thought I would
share them with you in this video I sort
of discuss whether or not I think these
are worth it because for this whole set
I'm gonna say it was around $20 and it
must be really new I mean it says new
right here but even going to find these
on the Real Techniques website because I
like to see the little videos that Sam
and Nick do to give you a little
background on the product and a few
ideas on how to use it but they didn't
even have stuff on these up yet on their
website so the first thing I'm gonna do
is I sit here I haven't even like washed
my face for the day so I'm going to take
one of my little Garnier that's how
let's hear and I'm just going to run
this all over my face real quick it'll
give my face a little bit of moisture
and also a little bit more of a clean
slate feeling you know go running this
all over the skin and then right after
I'll be using this brush so this is the
one that they call the dry facial brush
use this textured brush to gently
exfoliate for healthy looking skin I was
using this last night and I actually
feel like this did something this is
it's because it's unlike any real
techniques brush you've ever seen
because it's kind of rough it's a little
bit Scratchy
that's like wow we're techniques what
like it actually has a slightly abrasive
texture to it and you see the little
bumpy squash I hope I can zoom in to
where you can see it is not even 6:00
a.m. and I'm Way too excited about this
but see those little bumps not only are
the bristles themselves just a little on
the scratchy side but you've got this
sort of variation in the surface of the
brush with those three little bump ease
so now that I've got that on my skin
I've kind of cleansed so to speak I'm
just renting this around and I wish you
could feel the same thing I'm feeling
but I'm just doing certain little
circular motions buffing this around and
I was doing this last night after
washing my face and I thought while I
was doing it you know I knew there was a
texture thing happening here on my skin
but I couldn't get past the fact that I
was just using a brush to do this and
not like an actual face scrub while I
was doing this I'm just thinking I'm
gonna be so surprised if my skin
actually feels smoother as a result of
this but now I've done it again I swear
if you'll smooth there like there's it's
it's actually doing something
I won't go this far I won't say it's
doing what the dr. Brandt pores no more
microdermabrasion
what was the exact name of that thing
it's not doing exactly what that little
product did because that was absolutely
the finest and most effective exfoliator
I think I've ever used I swear it is
doing something for the smoothness of my
skin because my skin feels softer after
I use that so I actually think they may
be onto something with that now if we
have the pret brush and this says
densely packed firm bristles for mess
free application of moisturizers serums
primers or masks so getting you really
up close with this see how it's kind of
it resembles the shape of a foundation
brush just a flat foundation brush but
it's a little more chunky than that and
the funny thing about these bristles is
they are incredibly slick like yeah
there's a softness that you feel too
when you run your finger like that over
the tapered part of the brush but
they're just like really really slick
I'm going to bust out some of the good
stuff this morning I've got my Charlotte
Tilbury magic cream and I don't feel
good about just taking the brush
dunking it in here I'm just going to
actually put some of the moisturizer
around almost like I would if I were
applying foundation to my skin and then
I'll just blend it in with the brush and
we'll see if that makes any difference
to me whatsoever
last night I used this to put on my
Josie Maran Argan milk stuff and I kind
of thought like oh yeah I don't really
get the point I don't know I I feel like
the blending in of moisturizers is
something the fingers can do pretty
effectively although your your hand does
absorb some and this brush I don't know
it's maybe taken in some product but
it's not really like absorbing it like I
said the bristles are really slick so I
guess one question to ask myself does my
skin feel like it has more products
still on it now having blended it in
with this brush and then what I'm
getting when I just blend it in with my
own hands I think that possibly might be
the case the brush does not feel like
it's really holding much product at all
in fact it seems very like wipe down a
bowl you know what I mean
but maybe I'm crazy I kind of like to
feel the product going on to my skin you
know I kind of like to feel the texture
of the moisturizer that I'm working with
and maybe if I was doing a lot of makeup
on other people it might be kind of nice
to have a brush to do that step so I
didn't feel I don't know
Hansy all over I don't know I just don't
feel like I need me need a brush for
that step now the next thing is the
under-eye Reviver and this says
stationary aluminum ball for cooling
under I massage it says tip used with
favorite under-eye cream
so we're going to do this as we apply
the under-eye cream but this is a
weighty
product here and yet it doesn't move so
it's not like one of those Garnier I
rollers where this is just all like
moving all over the place I've got this
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye cream
this is what I've been using in the
morning so I'm gonna Dan up a little bit
of this around here and just partially
blend it in and then I'll go over it
with the roller and this I was even just
using as soon as I got it like I had
makeup on and I just thought how cooling
does this actually feel even without
applying eye cream with it I thought it
felt really cooling but oh
uh-oh man that is that is relaxing that
is nice I'm a sucker for anything like
kind of cooling and oh nice like that
around the eyes I might bust this thing
out when I've got a migraine errs it
feels so dang good like you think taking
a hard aluminum ball and running it
around your eye area wouldn't be that
big of a deal but my word it's really
cooling now starting to feel slightly
less cooling as I've been doing this for
I don't know 20 30 seconds or so no but
I think this is a great morning step
very nice feeling I dig that
I love cooling stuff I did a whole video
on cooling stuff and whether it work but
that feels really really nice it's kind
of cool like I said the ball is
stationary so you can use it alongside
any eye cream that you like to use and
you're not risking stuff gunking down
under the ball next thing is the lip
exfoliating brush for this they say use
in circular motions with your favorite
lip balm or lip scrub to gently
exfoliate and smooth your lips camera is
really not wanting to be my friend today
and focus but can you tell that this is
a small cylinder cylindrical it's
cylindrical award it's that kind of
shape and with this brush it's a very
very blunt cut all the bristles are the
same length and it also has a slightly
abrasive quality a lot of times I will
use the terms brush hairs and bristles
kind of interchangeably you know just I
don't know those words gotta come out
here or there but these are definitely
bristles so these are really tough I
feel like they are I wouldn't go quite
so far as to say there is tough it's
like a toothbrush bristle but maybe yeah
on some of the softer toothbrushes think
of toothbrush bristles really tightly
packed okay so that's what we're working
with here and I do not like the thoughts
of using a kind of loose lip scrub and
then the scrubby particles get down into
the brush like that bothers me a little
bit but what I realized is that this
still does a good amount of scrubbing
just on its own if you put a little balm
on first to help it kind of work what
I've got right up
here that I'm gonna use to moisturize my
lips a bit with as the EOS I'm minty and
cooled from my eyes to my lips and now
I'm gonna use this and just gonna scrub
around on the lips and I use this last
night too so hence why my lips didn't
really feel like they needed this right
now but I don't feel like this does as
effective of a job as the elf lip
exfoliator you guys know I love that
product it's a stick it's kind of a
balmy stick that has the little scrubby
suspended within the balm I think
there's a good concentration of
scrubbies and it comes in different like
scents flavors whatever and I feel like
it works really well and the difference
between that and this is that I feel
like that covers a broader surface area
so it gets the job done more quickly
this brush I mean look at the size of
this brush the tip of it in comparison
to my lips and I don't have like world's
most massive lips but it takes me some
time to kind of work around them I don't
know but it is giving me a very nice
little abrasive a nicely abrasive
feeling here you know what I mean like I
can tell it's doing some scrubbing
action and my lips do feel softer for
having used it it just takes a little
longer than the other I don't know I
think it's kind of it makes sense to
have something like this in this kit I
will say that
so do I feel like this set is worth it
do we need application tools for more
things is it necessary to buy this stuff
for our skincare and kind of skin prep
steps and I don't think they're
must-haves I think you can definitely
get by without them but are they cool
are they kind of innovative is it sort
of a fun idea yes and I would say my
favorite part of it is the under-eye
Reviver because this feels amazing on
the skin and I also am kind of
fascinated by the dry facial brush
because the thought that you can kind of
run this around your skin and I don't
know just achieve kind of a gentle but
softened up exfoliated feel I think
that's kind of cool
the prep brush this is the kind of thing
where if you didn't feel like you really
needed to use this with moisturizers
serums primers or masks like they say I
think this could possibly transition
into being a makeup at
location brush - I might really enjoy
this for masks though and I haven't yet
used it in that capacity and this brush
it'll scrub your lips it really truly
will not quite as quickly as the elf lip
exfoliator and it legitimately does
scrub my lips it's a tiny little thing
but the bristles are stiff stiff stiff
so they really work so I'm coming away
thinking yeah I'm glad I have the little
set I think it was fun to experiment
with I think this is gonna get absolute
daily use I think I'm gonna get a lot of
use out of this brush - you be the judge
make your own decisions you can
definitely get by in life without those
brushes but you know if you're really
into different little makeup application
techniques and gizmos and whatnot it
might interest you so thank you guys so
much for watching I think this is the
least glam I've ever ended a video but
hey this is this is the content we're
working with right now okay thank you
guys for your time I hope you have a
great day and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
