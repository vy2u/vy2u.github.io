for this video it's a little something
different going on here my friend Brooke
who works at a cosmetology school
contacted me
she works at Lachaise it's in the Quad
Cities area if you're familiar with the
Midwest she watches my videos Thank You
Brooke and thank you to anyone there at
the school who also watches but she had
an idea to send me the kind of makeup
kit that they get and then maybe I could
put together a few looks or ideas for
them on my youtube channel so I thought
that would be super fun not a
professionally trained makeup artist I'm
more of a makeup enthusiast so I've
never had you know a beauty school
experience or a kit exactly like this to
work from so the kit is from brand
called Oh frog gonna be using primarily
this kit and maybe a few extra products
that I have thrown in to create first
off a full face of makeup then for the
eyes we're gonna take it day to night so
I'm going to show you this natural look
then how to make it more dramatic we're
going to work in sort of a plum berry
colored smokey eye that I think is going
to be really flattering on a lot of
different eye colors so really it's
about makeup basics and if you don't
have this exact kit there are plenty of
comparable products out there these are
just really basic products and basic
techniques so I hope it's helpful to you
and let's get started all right so
starting off this kit comes with several
foundation shades I had to mix a couple
of these to find what I believe is the
right shade for me I just did this on my
hand using it you know on my own face
but you could definitely use some kind
of a palette to mix different foundation
shades whenever I'm doing someone else's
makeup it's pretty rare that you know
the shade in just one bottle is just
dead-on perfect for them but if I have
several foundation shades like are in
this kit you know you can mix them
together and get the right look so once
you kind of mix those together I'm going
to dot my finished mixture here all over
my face and then with just my little
spray water bottle I've dampened a
sponge this is just like a generic
Beauty Blender type sponge and I'm going
to use that to Pat in and blend
and this foundation and I've
concentrated most of the foundation in
the center of my face also paying
attention to some areas like under the
eye where there might be discoloration
and this sponge used damp really helps
any foundation have a more natural skin
like appearance and if you want to use
like a wedge type sponge you know you
can buy those in early large packs and
dampen that you can also get a great
look as well see I'm really more than
just rubbing this across my face I'm
really trying to press the foundation
into the skin so we get more of just the
look of perfected even skin as opposed
to the look of you know product just
sitting on top of someone's face also
don't disregard hair lines around the
ear area the jaw everything really needs
to be blended not just on the face but
around it to basically evened out the
skin tone but there's still some things
that you can do still some areas need a
little added brightness or evenness and
the kit has this palette here called the
magic roulette concealer and it's got
some of those corrective shades that you
sometimes see there's actually a lilac
color green I don't tend to gravitate
too much toward those colored correctors
but what I do really like is that
there's some skin tone shades and then a
white and I can tell that both of these
skin tone shades are a little bit dark
for me but I can take one and kind of
blend it on to my hand here and then I
can take some of the white and just like
working with paints you know you start
blending that in and then you get more
of a skin tone match so for this I'm now
gonna dab some of that shade that I just
made and I'm gonna dab it around my eye
a little bit around my nose where I have
some redness broken capillaries and
stuff and then again going in with the
damp sponge because this concealer has
kind of a thick texture to it so we
really want it to blend out and look
very skin-like but the coverage is is
pretty decent so the sponge can really
be your friend in blending that in and I
like the little pointed tip because then
you
just really work it into the eye area
the inner corners right up to the lower
lash line because the discoloration
around eyes tends to get really really
close to the eye itself so we have work
to conceal some areas you know right
under the eye in the inner corner but
really the face looks so natural and
kind of naturally flattered by the light
when you have brightness in this sort of
a triangular shape there under the eye
so I've mixed up an even lighter shade
it just added a little more white and
I'm gonna work in here right on the
sides of the nose still you know
technically under the eye but more you
know this area right here on the front
of the face and I'm just dabbing and
pressing that into the skin and you can
continue with some of that lightness
right up on top of the cheekbone and so
then you're getting a really like well
lit look no matter where you are so now
that the skin is evened out I'm gonna
set it lightly with a little bit of the
skin tone powder and this is the powder
brush that comes with the set and in any
area where I really paid attention to
covering I'm not wanting to really scrub
the brush over those areas so I'm just
doing more of a blotting effect here
remember we did a lot of work around the
eye so we don't want to just wipe off
what we did so I'm kind of blotting in
those areas and then just really lightly
we don't want the look of powder just
sitting on top of the skin we want it to
still look like skin so kind of blot and
use just a very minimal amount of powder
there now you don't want to take up too
much powder on your under eye area but
just to make sure we set it and get a
really nice flawless look there I'm
taking this little brush from ELF this
is the small tapered brush and I'm
dabbing into the white powder which
probably is termed as translucent I'm
not a big believer in actual translucent
powder because I think it can show up as
white but for my skintone I'm dabbing
into the little bit of that and a little
bit of the skin tone so it's going to
end up being just a little bit lighter
than what I put elsewhere on my face and
I'm just dabbing right under the eye
area again on the other side and now
it's really mattified and really even
and flawless right in this whole area
the kit also comes with sort of a mosaic
style bronzer it it has hardly any
shimmer it's very undetectable so I
think this is the type of thing you can
use as a contouring product as well so
with my powder brush first I'm just
going to get a little bit on there I'm
gonna tap off any excess and I'm gonna
kind of go right in here looking for
that hollow of the cheek area and since
we're using such a big brush it's a
little more foolproof there we're not
getting you know some sort of just line
of color but it's very diffused and
we're still getting a little bit of
contrast in that area with this slightly
darker powder another area that's great
to contour is the forehead so with that
you can take your brush get into your
product again and dab it right up into
your hairline even really carefully with
a smaller brush get into that product
and contour the sides of your nose a
little bit more some people with you
know maybe a flatter nose they like to
you know make it stand out a little bit
more seem a little more slim so you can
just carefully go down the sides of your
nose it's not necessarily something you
need to feel like you have to do every
day with your makeup but just an idea of
what that powder can be used for the
thing that this kit does not have that I
think is really important is blush shout
out to Coastal Scents this website has a
ton of great affordable palettes and
this is my 10 blush palette and I think
it's got a lot of great shades that work
for so many skin tones and for this look
I'm gonna go with kind of this classic
pink here and just get a little bit of
that on a blush brush that's a little
bit smaller brush than what I used with
the powder and I'm going to apply this
to the outer part of the apple of my
cheek here you don't want to get too
close to your nose and get that look of
redness going again but right out here
it really just gives a young kind of
flushed look outer part here and then
just blending up all right now you can
see one eye is done one eye isn't and
something I've been liking to do lately
before I get into the eye makeup is
really make sure my brows are done
because I think it's something about a
finished brow it's like you don't
overcompensate
more eye makeup to make up for a messed
up looking eyebrow so if you can get it
done beforehand I think it just puts in
perspective more how your finished look
is actually going to come off so I take
an angle the stiff angled brush and in
the midst of your eye shadows you
actually do have a couple of nice matte
neutrals and so I'm mixing a little bit
of the darkest Brown and kind of a
medium tan type color getting a little
bit on my brush and I've already filled
in my brows somewhat here but I just go
over some areas I have naturally kind of
thick brows but I still find that they
can look a lot more finished when some
of the more sparse areas are just even
now I'm taking an eyelid primer this
one's from ELF it's just a dollar
but I think some sort of base on your
lids before you start applying the eye
makeup really really helps it helps the
shadow cling it helps it stand out more
in a lot of cases primers can help the
shadow last longer throughout the day so
I'm putting that not only on my lid but
through the crease and up under the
brows then I'm taking a flat eyeshadow
brush and one of the light shades in the
palette and again this is just gonna be
basic eye makeup here for this first
step it's something that could work for
any occasion something that just gives
the ice and natural definition but not
too much extra and so that light shade
I'm just patting it all over my lid now
I notice the kit does give you a couple
of eye brushes one is like a really
small detail brush and the other is a
very blunt cut angled brush and this one
I don't find too much use for I don't
love blending with the blunt cut brushes
but this one can be nice if you go to
this lightest color and you want a
little brightness around the inner
corner this is great for getting that
targeted area there so I'm going to the
lightest shade of the eyeshadows and
it's actually a little bit like
iridescent I was sort of surprised when
I first used it so don't go too
overboard with this color or it will
start to look a little bit blue unless
that's what you want which is fine but
just for the purpose of brightening that
area and keep it sort of like that I'm
going to go to
Matt Brown with an even flatter
eyeshadow brush this was the first one I
used and you can see it's flat but it's
still a little bit full this next one is
even a little more targeted for the
application and so with that getting a
little bit of the brown I'm gonna Pat
this on the outer part of my lid I'm
really first putting my brush on the
outer corner that's where the most
product is gonna go is where you first
put your brush so really concentrating
it on the outer corner and as I get less
and less on my brush still I'm working
about half way in on the lid and then
you're getting a blend there so if you
want a little bit more just go back and
build up a little bit more and I want
some definition in the crease as well so
I'm taking a fluffier brush going back
to that same matte Brown and it's gonna
get a more sheer application when you
use these fluffy crease blending brushes
so with this again outer corner first
that's where I want the most
concentration of color and then as less
and less is on my brush I'm pulling it
inward and of course you wouldn't have
to follow this process or this technique
to a tee but it's just an example of a
basic look just to get you know some
definition from the lid a little bit of
brightness and then definition in the
crease that allows the eye to look a
little bit bigger when you sum when you
kind of smoke it out like this and
sometimes when I'm working with dark
shades like this I just want to bring in
a bare brush you know brush with no
product on it so I can really make the
edge of that darker shadow look seamless
you know I don't want anybody to be able
to see a distinct cutoff underneath the
eye I love using smudge brushes because
I feel like they give a really softly
defined look to the eye it never looks
too harsh going back to the matte Brown
the shades gonna be your best friend and
I'm just smudging here starting on the
outer corner not even going back for any
extra product but just lightly bringing
it in and whatever still on the brush is
there but primarily we're getting
definition as you can see over here it's
mainly on the outer portion
the liner that comes with this kit is a
shade cult smoke and it's kind of a dark
charcoal color it's really close to
black but not quite black black with
this I'm going to go across my upper
lash line one of the hardest things I've
found when doing eyeliner on other
people particularly with pencils is that
it can be hard to get right up in their
lash line you don't want any kind of gap
between the lash line and your eyeliner
so don't be afraid to get right up in
there practically feel like you're
putting this on in between the lashes it
really will help with the finished
effect there we are you can see all
across the upper lash line to give it an
even softer effect back to the matte
Brown and the smudge brush and I'm just
topping it off here it just gives it an
even softer look blurs the border of
that pencil a little bit and I'm gonna
just curl my lashes I like to hold it
for about 15 seconds or so this is
actually a heated lash curler that I'm
kind of obsessed with right now from
Ally beauty and it just my lashes
naturally want to point down so this
really gives them lift and then I put
some mascara on top and bottom lashes
this is covergirl clump crusher I find
that the brush is a really nice size
it's just very easy to manage when
you're getting the mascara on there I
like to get right at the base then kind
of wiggle it up through and that helps
to separate the lashes the
water-resistant kind actually I love it
because you don't have to worry about it
smudging off of you or flaking off of
you but at the same time it's not
terrible to remove I hate taking off
mascara and seeing some lashes come off
with it so this is a good one
now the lipsticks and this kit can be a
little bit dry but I'm going to take a
couple of them again you could use you
know palette and the one shade called
amethyst and it's a light pink and then
I'm going to put on this shade called
mulberry which is sort of a reddish
berry color I've prepped my lips with a
little bit of lip balm then I
taking my two shades that I'm mixing
here to get the perfect pinky berry that
I want and using a lip brush to apply
this all over the lips sometimes when
you're using a lip brush you can really
be precise with it and in a lot of cases
you're eliminating your need for a
separate lip liner because you are
really just following very carefully the
line of your lips
okay rollers out now this is you know
the finished look that we came up with
for kind of a natural everyday look of
course not every day has to be a full
face of foundation there are tons of
products out there you know that can
give you a more sheer look a lighter
look and you may not use so much
concealer or whatever but if you're
going for pretty much you know even
canvas type of face makeup and then eyes
that have some definition but aren't too
deep and dark this could be kind of a
go-to for you now here are a few fun
tricks to take the eye look and make it
even more dramatic for like a night time
going out type look okay
nighttime eye daytime eye really smokey
working in plum and pink you'll see we
changed the lip as well um I'll just go
ahead and tell you what we did there I
took off the pink lip and I use this
shade called mimosa it's just kind of a
neutral I really lightly dab that on my
lips with my finger for a nice sheer
application and then I topped it off
with this Revlon gloss in Bellini this
is the color burst gloss so it gives a
nice like your lips just a little bit
shinier nice and even doubt and
everything we're gonna take the small
brush that comes with this kit and go to
the shimmery mauve color everything was
light here now it's gonna get just a
little bit deeper on the lid that's
where I'm gonna concentrate that mauve
then we're taking that flat brush that
is really great for packing on product
and I'm gonna go into the dark plum with
that I'm gonna dab that on the outer
part of the lid so this kind of takes us
almost a little bit darker than that
dark Brown was getting us here so right
in here then a technique I like to use
when I really want lots of depth
the crease flip the brush over and we're
going to almost get it wedged right in
your crease right there in the socket
and then really gently pull upward and
as a result we're getting deep purple
right in the crease taking it most of
the way in with that technique well
we're still on the dark purple shade I'm
going to go ahead and take my smudger
brush and go into the plum and we're
taking that right under the eye and
we're going all the way in this time so
you may have to go back for some more
product and drag it all the way in not
totally surrounding the tear duct but
pretty close to it so there's our smudgy
smokey lower liner then with a fluffier
brush we're gonna do sort of this
transitional pink shade and with that
I'm going to the really bright magenta
get a little bit on the brush tap off
the excess and go right on the border of
your purple everybody's got varying
amounts of space between their eyebrow
and their crease or their brow bone so
just go up as high as you feel
comfortable but what's gonna give you
the most effect is when your eyes are
open and you can see this little you
know faded look just above pink is super
buildable so if you want more of a pink
look go back for more and just top it
off then a bear brush I'm just blending
out the border of that same concepts
apply for a natural makeup and dramatic
makeup I mean with this kind of a smoky
look you don't want harsh edges some
looks maybe like a real high-fashion
look you know you do want some kind of
bold edge but here we're just keeping
that part really blended just as far as
talking about basic makeup adding
a little more plumb and blending it out
but the nice thing about this technique
is you can plug in other shades you
could do this as a navy eye you could
plug in forest green or any shade you
really want to work with we can do all
Browns and intensify what we did earlier
but it's just a matter of knowing you
know depth in the crease and then use
those fun mid-tone shades up in this
area got some false lashes that's always
fun I'm gonna take a liquid liner I
think it's really important when you're
placing false eyelashes on the lash line
to put them on a fairly thick line of
eyeliners so the band that the lashes
are on kind of disappears and people
can't see you like oh there's something
glued to your eyelid way I have a really
comprehensive false lash video it's
called false eyelashes 101 it goes from
picking out the lashes putting them on
taking them off cleaning them reusing
and stuff like that so it really
addresses everything if you're
interested but I'm taking this Milani
color play felt tip pen it's in black
line any black liner it doesn't have to
be liquid but I just think liquid it's
really quick and these pins are just
super easy so I'm just drawing that all
the way across the upper lash line if
you're feeling fancy you could wing out
the liner at the end I'm just gonna sort
of come to a stopping point here I kind
of thicken it out a bit but I'm not
necessarily winging it out my lashes are
from I wore their number 107 they look
like this they're a little bit longer on
the outsides shorter on the insides and
that that's what gives you that kind of
flared out almost like cat eyed look
love using Revlon precision lash glue
because it has the wand it doesn't take
forever to dry and you just really have
tons of control with the amount of
product going on the lash fan now the
key when you're applying false lashes is
once you get that glue on you want to
let it get a little bit tacky for this
kind of glue and for most kinds I
usually wait a good 45 seconds so
so then when I go to put them on my eye
they really cling to the eye and I can
kind of work with them as opposed to the
glue being so wet that they literally
just fall back off so give it a little
bit of time to get tacky don't get in
the habit of blowing on the lashes to
dry them off because I don't think
clients want to see you blowing on
something that's going to go on their
eye I'm gonna hold the lashes here in
the center of the lash not touching the
band but I'm just holding the lashes
itself or themselves and then I'm going
to align that with the center of my eye
here focusing first on getting that
first part put down then I go to the
ends and I make sure that the innermost
corner gets attached and then the outer
corner and you're using that eyeliner as
your guide you want to place it not on
your own lashes but on the liner
extremely close to the natural lashes so
once you get that on and you can see
you're probably seeing some glue that
dries and disappears if you ever feel
like once it's dry it does not disappear
you can go over the liner again I mean
it's no big deal sometimes like to kind
of blink onto my finger and it ensures
that these lashes are going to dry
they're still kind of in a drying phase
now on to my eye and I want them to be
definitely turned up and not down if
your lashes are kind of pointing
themselves just a little bit down it'll
actually make your eye look smaller
it'll cut your eye off a little bit and
once you do feel like they've gotten
most of the way dry I take a little more
mascara and just focusing at the base of
the lash not raking it all the way
through I just dab it here and it kind
of ensures that the real lashes and your
fake lashes are kind of bonded together
and if we hadn't already done that first
look I would still let's say you were
doing this look fresh from the start I
would still put mascara on first then
the lashes then top it off with one more
coat because I feel like that initial
coat of mascara gets your lashes in that
upturned
fashion that they need to be to even
begin to blend with these to begin with
that's just my personal strategy also
just because this is a little bit
smokier and a little more dramatic I am
applying another coat of mascara to the
lower lashes q-tips are your friend I
almost forgot I would have done this
probably before the false lashes but I'm
taking that smoke liner again and
putting that in my inner rim here so I'm
just gently ever so gently pulling down
and just running this liner all the way
across my inner rim and that just I
don't know something about that looks
extra smoky if you're working on someone
with super small eyes this will make the
eye look a little bit smaller so it may
not be a technique you choose to use on
everyone but I think when we're going
for dark and dramatic it really creates
a contrast from the way the eyes were
before so I hope you enjoyed this look
thank you so much for watching Brooke
thank you for sending me the beauty
school palette I had so much fun with it
it really has a nice array of different
eye shadows actually nicely large sized
eyeshadows and the concealer palette too
was pretty cool so I really appreciate
it thank you all for taking time to
watch and have a great day fine
