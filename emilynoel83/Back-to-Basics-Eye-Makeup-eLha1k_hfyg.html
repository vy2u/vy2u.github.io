for this video because it is my goal to
make this video the most beginner most
basic level eye tutorial I've ever seen
on YouTube because I get so many
questions about you know can you just do
something on which brushes to use or you
know just basic eyeshadow application or
I'm going to school and I'm going to be
making wearing makeup for the first time
this year how do I do it and I mean this
is applicable for all age levels all of
the ability levels because this is going
to be basic eyeshadow application how to
put it on but also why we do the things
that we do with eyeshadow it'll help you
understand it and you know not just know
how to use the palette I happen to use
in this video but take those quads and
those trios that you might have stashed
in your drawer and help you better
understand how to use other shadows as
well not just going to be how to put it
on your eye but how to pick it up right
out of the palette I mean I'm talking it
detailed descriptions nothing is left
out nothing is glossed over of course
there are tons of shadows tons of
combinations tons of different looks you
can come up with with your own
creativity I mean you can do smoky eyes
you can do bright colored eyes and
things like that video I am using my
Sigma Barre palette thought this is a
great palette that gives you some matte
options so you can really tell what I'm
doing with this look it'll show up
nicely on camera and so if you do have
this one you know feel free to follow
along with these exact colors otherwise
just use something similar or even you
know just varying tones of any colors
you want so if you want to see how it
all comes together keep watching
we're gonna begin with a matte shade
here called elope I'm gonna be using a
flat eyeshadow brush like this take that
shade and we're just going to use a
patting motion with this just patting
that onto the inner part of our lids you
a really dense application of the
products in a light shade there really
brightens this part of the eye and opens
it up so it's a great place to put any
light shade you have in the palette
you're using that same brush I'm going
to a shade called hid cheap to medium
color Brown and it is also matte patting
it on the outer part of the eyelid and
just kind of overlap and you're doing
any you know sort of an outer V or
deepening up the shade in the outer
corner I mean you'll find this really
will work in with any crease color you
put in so it won't be such a stark
confident you can use that same brush in
the same color and we really want to
target the deepest shade right in our
crease that shadow kind of on the tip of
this brush and I'm using this brush
almost like a wedge to really get to as
you can see the deepest part of the
crease we want our deepest color to be
there and then we want to kind of fade
out from that pulling the brush up
really getting that darkest shade right
there in the crease using a fluffier
bear brush I'm just gonna blend that out
this would be you know kind of just a
supernatural look that we could go with
we could end there I am going to apply a
highlight I'm going to use the shade
called approach this one has just a
touch of maybe a pearly color to us take
that right under your eyebrow we're
gonna deepen it up just a little bit to
show you what to do with the outer
because the brush we were using sort of
that flat brush to pack the shadow on
I'm using an even flatter brush now this
one's a little bit smaller you have a
little more control with it and you can
really target where that deepest
products gonna go so we're gonna go
right into this with some matte black
the shade called control here and just
get a little bit on the tip of the brush
and then I'm going to sort of overlap
the outermost corner of this look with
that shade putting it on the lid I'm
getting in the crease
I'm kind of just pulling it out just a
bit you've kind of got to let yourself
apply that shadow even though you think
oh well this doesn't look blended yet oh
my goodness you know you've got to just
kind of go ahead and put it on there and
realize okay I mean I can go back and
blend this out some more but I've got to
get the shadow right where I want it
first we just take our fluffy brush
blend it out a pencil brush is another
good thing to have with this particular
palette it comes with a double-ended
pencil brush and this great crease brush
also that can work for you know getting
just that soft wash of color and the
crease there's nothing on it right now
but I'm just saying you can use that for
your crease area too
but I'm going to use the pencil part of
this brush going into the black just
dipping it straight in and you can
totally use shadows as liner to what I'm
doing here I'm taking off from where we
where we left off there and just really
smudging it and you get this nice soft
look as you're kind of looking at your
finished shadow look you know sometimes
I'll go in and I'll reassess I'll look
at what's going on and say what do I
need more of I like this shade called
hitch remember this was our initial
shade that we kind of put in our crease
and on our outer half of our lid taking
this you know a slightly smaller crease
brush and just popping a little bit more
of that right in here you know if you
just want that little more intensity or
a little more blended look usually there
are lots of forms of eyeliner you can
use but a lot of people struggle with
liquid liner that's what I get a lot of
questions about if you can find
something in sort of a pin form you'll
find you have a lot more control this
one's called the eye booster hold it you
know right about in the middle so I've
got some room to work and see what I'm
doing I start in the inner corner I'm
aiming not so much on the skin but I'm
kind of aiming for the inner inner
corner when I start here so it looks
very natural like there's not some kind
of jump off or starting point that
anyone could detect what I will
sometimes do is take my liquid liner
draw it straight across see how there's
a little gap there and then I just fill
that in
you know it's okay to not have the
perfect line the first time but you can
go back in and straighten it out and
fill it in and then really get in close
get right in between those lash I'm
gonna go from the highest point and
instead of throwing down I'm gonna go
straight out okay so I went kind of a
line out as opposed to OOP down and then
they come out from my from the lower
corner of my eye bring that out fill in
your little triangle and you've got just
the slightest wink so fine you can kind
of just get a little bit of a start
going on lower liner if that's something
you want to do you don't have to but as
you can see I can really get in there
and get close to the lash line with this
very pointed tip then after that you can
take your pencil brush take some more of
the black shadow and just kind of go
over that area and it'll look like
there's less of an edge next up take
your eyelash curler I'm going to curl my
lashes 5 to 10 second squeeze at one
part like closest to the base and then
you know release and sort of move it up
just a little bit and then you're going
to get more of a curve as opposed to
just a single print I'm going to be
using L'Oreal van voluminous carbon
black for this looks are as close to the
actual lash line as possible
wiggle and then pull through and then
sometimes if you look trying to get
these inner lashes you kind of just go
in with the tip on my lower lashes I'm
using the mascara with a very small
brush and one that I find doesn't smudge
on me at all down there and this is
maybelline lash discovery so it's great
for getting you know these areas and I
did the same sort of technique I get
right in to the base and wiggle it on
through
so I hope this video helped you again
feel free to grab any eyeshadow palette
you have take a look at it and think how
might I use this you know light shades
on the lids and on you know the high
light medium shades can build like outer
half of the of the eyelid and then
deeper shades for this lifted outer
corner look you can definitely use
shadows as liner and you can definitely
switch around any of those steps I gave
you going very dark next to the eye
giving yourself a smoky look so it's all
about creativity I urge you to
experiment that this look is just meant
to give you some basic ideas where
brushes are concerned and different
shades are concerned how to give you a
basic eye look thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
