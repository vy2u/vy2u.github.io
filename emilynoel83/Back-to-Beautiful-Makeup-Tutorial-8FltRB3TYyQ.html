requests for back-to-school makeup
tutorials and these are the primary
things you've asked for really natural
really quick easy and drugstore makeup
and I have all of that covered in this
video the look is not overly glamorous
overly dolled up it is just a polished
look that you can totally customize to
the way you need it I'm going to go
through foundation concealer and powder
but you can eliminate any of those steps
depending on what you need we'll also go
through a great multi-purpose product
that's going to work on our cheeks and
our eyes and a lip product that's going
to bring the whole look together and
make the face pop and I don't want you
to think this is exclusively for going
to school this is totally it's something
that moms who are in a hurry to get
ready in the morning can throw this look
together or if you've got to get out the
door real quick for work you can use
this too so I hope it helps you out and
keep on watching so first I'm just gonna
take a regular makeup sponge spritz it
with some water and we're gonna take
Rimmel lasting finish foundation I
choose this foundation because I feel
like it works great for multiple skin
types and it just creates a really
natural finish but it does wear a long
time kind of dotted around on your face
you're not gonna really blend it in
right now now because we have that damp
sponge this is going to give us like the
most natural finish possible and plus
sponges are really easy to blend with
and I like to not put the product
directly on the sponge because the
sponge will kind of drink up a lot of
the foundation so you put on the amount
you think you'll need on your face to
begin with and then just use the sponge
as your blending tour any areas left
that you need to conceal I'm going to be
using my Revlon Photoready concealer
comes in a handy little stick here and
is really quick for just going over
those spots so I'm gonna go around the
under-eye area take care of any
discoloration there a little bit around
the nose
and you know if you have any blemishes
let's just use the warmth of your finger
press it into the skin or anyone who
says I don't like doing liquid
foundation this is a step you could
substitute in for that or if you want
you know a little more full coverage for
a particular day use this step and just
continue it on top of the past two steps
I did with foundation and concealer this
is the Milani multitasker powder and my
shade is medium here so this is just a
really nice coverage face powder
basically it may not be the powder you
want to take in your purse to touch up
with throughout the day because it is
more coverage lot it over certain areas
I'm not gonna go all over my face I'm
just gonna go I'm kind of kind of set
that concealer around the under eye area
go around my nose chin and forehead
because this is where I know I'm gonna
get oily throughout the day you're gonna
amp up our skin tone a little bit with
some bronzer this is the elf warm
bronzer so it's got kind of four
different hues we're just gonna take a
big Brush and just swirl them all
together and then swirl that all over
our face this is pretty matte I'm just
gonna take this all over my face just to
warm up my skin tone as a whole because
sometimes you wake up in the morning
just think gosh where's the color in my
face next totally optional but if you
want to give your cheekbones a little
extra pop take a blush brush go to this
shade right in the lower corner that has
the elf stamp on it and just use that
one color just under the cheekbones a
little bit it's matte it's gonna provide
a slightly deeper tone right there then
for a super subtle highlight you can
take the shade right next to it
and focus that in on the tops of your
cheekbones with our blush why not go
with something that gives you a
beautiful glow
I'm gonna take my Milani baked blush in
Dolce pink it's a gorgeous color for the
apple of the cheek and kind of swirl it
right around here kind of starting small
and then enlarging your circles for a
really pretty blended out look for eyes
it might just seem like one extra thing
to do but I promise it will help you in
the long run with your staying power
throughout the day I'm gonna use my NYX
HD eyeshadow base inexpensive and works
really well put a little dot of that on
each lid and then just kind of blend
that all over and then I pull it up
through the crease this is kind of your
crease protection we're gonna go back to
our warm bronzer I'm gonna be using this
lightest shade here with a flat
eyeshadow brush tap off the excess and
just dab that all over the lids next you
can take a fluffy brush use a little bit
of that just under the brows we're gonna
go to the deepest shade right here in
the corner with that fluffy crease brush
look down into your mirror so you've
exposed the whole eye area and go right
for the crease using a bronzer as a
crease shade is about one of the most
natural ways to get definition eyeliner
I'm taking my NYX slide-on liner this
shade is called brown perfection and I'm
just gonna go from inner to outer corner
here if you want you can hit your lower
lash line kind of right in between the
lashes just a little bit and I take my
pinky finger right over that about kind
of connecting your liner at the outer
corner there and curl the lashes and I'm
applying a drugstore mascara that is
really in my book a great one for not
smudging and flaking off and it's
covergirl LashBlast or the one I have is
LashBlast fusion I feel like they both
operate really similarly so just kind of
wiggle that the base of your lashes and
pull it up through you're going to get
nice definition if you need to go over
any areas with your brows a really no
fuss no muss product is revlon colorstay
brow enhancer go on top of your existing
eyebrow the wax enos kind of holds it in
place to keep you from that last step of
using a separate gym I'm gonna take a
gloss that has some pink punch to it and
this is raspberry splash L'Oreal lick
locks and I love the scent of this gloss
I love the color it puts on and brighten
the whole face and really tie the look
together well there you go guys there's
the super quick natural easy and cheap
look for back-to-school wouldn't have to
your everyday look you can get creative
do your eyes up differently do your
cheeks or lips up differently that's the
fun of makeup but it's also good to have
one of these go to quick looks knock it
out fast if you're running behind and
you end up still looking polished and
fabulous so thanks for watching have an
awesome day and a great school year she
at your time and talk to you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
