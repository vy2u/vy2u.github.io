joining me for this video this is going
to be a Twitter talk video at the end so
basically what that means I've done one
of their video like this before but when
I started videotaping this little video
I'm doing I put a little call out on my
Twitter and I said you know let me know
if you have any questions now and your
questions may get answered in my next
video I'll just try to get to as many as
I can so I've got my laptop sitting
right over here and we'll see you know
how many tweets come in and i'll i will
answer just randomly off the top of my
head whatever they might be i'm not
really gonna look at him in advance so
that'll be fun but first how about back
to school yay no I really was not a big
fan of back to school when I was in high
school I just hated it when like halfway
through the summer you would see all
these big back-to-school signs showing
up in the stores and I was like no I
still want it to be summer and I just
was not too enthused about it but
something that might kind of get you in
the spirit of back-to-school is a
special section that I found at target
when i was there a few days ago and you
know they have elf now and target at
least my target does and i think most
targets do sorry I think my camera's
little not the street here we go okay no
but my elvez target and they sell like
some of the studio stuff and some of the
one dollar regular line stuff but I saw
this special section and it appeared to
me to be like a back to school zone and
so they had like some items for one
dollar it was really clearly marked just
like at Christmas time remember I did
that Christmas video and I was telling
you about all these like slightly
different repackaged redone items that
were there just for Christmas time well
it's like that very same thing but back
to school they had the one dollar three
dollar five dollar even some larger kits
for like ten dollars so I kind of got to
thinking well I need to try some of this
so I can tell my subscribers about it
I'm glad I did because I'm pretty happy
with what I picked up I got a couple of
these three dollar pallets and just real
quickly by the way they had like lip
glosses that appeared to be maybe a
limited edition shade they had liners
that were repackaged and things packed
in like groups of three were three
dollar items and it get kind of varied
from there but i'll get show you first
these pallets i got the room boxes like
this and they said three dollars on them
with the little apple sticker that's how
you can tell it's back to school and the
first one is a neutral shadows palette
and it looks like this and it has six
shades in it and i just saw it and I
thought that's very appealing to me I
just like the idea of you know getting
more than a few shades in a palette and
this is very travel friendly too
sometimes you know i love using out of
the big palettes but when i go to work
and i want to take something to touch up
with I don't want to take a big palette
so this was nice I used for my look
today I actually used this shade in the
shade kind of a matte black and then the
shimmery sort of like champagne gold you
can see they're really pigmented and
what I also like is that there's a
variety of textures there like I've got
a matte shade there is shimmery shade
nice really dark shade and the staying
power is actually really good I used
those and then I took a pinky color and
kind of blended out that darker shade at
the top but very impressed with the
staying power and like I said you get a
couple of matte colors a few shimmers
and a dark shade so that's the palette
labeled neutrals and that was only three
dollars when you think about three
dollars for six colors in the palette it
does come with a little brush but I
really don't think it's going to be to
user friendly it's really tiny so anyway
use your own brushes are just even a
regular sponge tip applicator might have
even been a little more functional than
that tiny precious but I like that
neutral palette and then I went ahead
and got the smoky one as well um see I
don't know why I'm confused about how
this opens it opens like everything else
it looks like this and it's kind of like
smoky but it gives you a pretty plum
shade in there as well going across the
top you get like a white shade the
center shade is kind of like a really
light gray and then a spark more sparkly
silver your black shade has some sparkle
to it as well and then um this purple is
super pretty love that here's a look at
the black I mean the black is very black
the purple is purpley there's like a
pretty lilac shade as well with a little
shimmer so nicely pigmented colors I
think this would be a lot of fun to play
with and you know if you're a parent
watching this I mean maybe you want to
get your kid a little more excited about
going back to school or you know kind of
getting in that transitional mode of
okay it's going to be soon be time to
get up and you know get your button gear
and get ready every morning so maybe
something like this could be fun a fun
way that you know you and your kid could
bond a little bit and learn how to use
the makeup and then they could have
something new to start their school year
because it is like a time when I always
thought about it is like every new
school year I wanted to do something
different i like wanted to have a little
different haircut or I just wanted you
course new back-to-school clothes but
you kind of want to reinvent yourself
almost and I mean make up if you're you
have the appropriate age I mean makeup
is a great way to do that I remember
like going from junior high to high
school that was a big time for me I
really wanted to you know kind of
reinvent my look for high school but
another really cool thing that they have
are the five dollars so these were each
three dollars and then for five dollars
they have these beauty books and my
target was almost clearly sold out of
these they only had the smoky ones left
and lip ones they had lips I think they
had neutrals smoky and you'll have to
check to see if there's anything
different but you may have seen the
beauty encyclopedia things on the elf
website these are kind of like that but
not exactly the layout of these isn't
the same and i think the like um the
other palace had like a couple of
different colors in there or something
so you
kind of look and see what's at target
and compared to the website but it is
still five dollars these little things
are called Beauty encyclopedias on the
website and they're five bucks so five
bucks at target to I got the smoky one
but to tell you the truth it's seems
like a total multi-purpose palette when
you see these colors that you get here
here we go if I can hold it up there for
you yeah you've got a bunch of neutrals
but as you can see looking across the
top you've got great options for smokey
you go from white which is basically a
matte white shade and then you've got
like a sparkly deep silver a black
lighter silver and so there's your
classic smokey look right across the top
but down below you've got a lot of other
shades some of these are more pigmented
than others I mean there are a couple
shades in here where I'm kind of like
and why did they need like you know um
sorry I don't want my stuff to fall out
of there but like why did they need both
these two shades and these two they
seemed a lot alike but they kind of have
there are a few of these do you have
out-and-out glitter in them it's like a
little bit of a sparkly shade and I
don't really mind it but just keep that
in mind sometimes some of these that
look Matt aren't necessarily met but
there are a couple that are genuinely
mad I assure you um but then there's a
couple colors down here in the very
bottom these two which I think are just
phenomenal really unique I really like
the shades there's this one that's kind
of like a it's like a taupe with a hint
of purple and gray it's like really
interesting and then I love the softness
of this kind of reminds me of that
would wink shade by Mac down there in
the corner but it also gives you a mini
brightening eye liner which is the
pencil eyeliner that's like the one
dollar stuff from ELF so they give you
one of those and they give you a double
ended sponge tip applicator there there
are also some suggested instructions
over here on this side this is like a
little flap I bet you could cut that off
if you didn't like it but I just haven't
cut it off yet but that little flap goes
over the only thing I didn't really like
is how this was taped all the way around
and now
leaves some kind of sticky residue at
the bottom but overall this is really
cool and I just think how great that
would be 12 eyeshadows I mean how much
fun to play with if I were back in high
school and they had this stuff out in
the stores I would have been all over it
but they're just worn a lot of pallets
like this out when I was going to school
I mean it was like you had to get the
classic little you know three or four
colors in it in a palette and that was
all you got but this would be fun to
play with and I think you get a lot of
good out of it so that's just like a
taste of what's there at the elf in the
elf area at target so if you have any
questions I mean just check out your
local store and see what they have and
some of this stuff like these these are
not like regular line elf items so if
you want them you may have to get them
now as part of this back-to-school
promotion that I guess they're let's do
some Twitter talk i am looking now to
see what questions I have
I do have to wake up really early i get
up at one thirty AM to do my job which
is I anchor a morning newscast so yeah
it's a really weird schedule and I go to
bed at probably around seven o'clock
central time 6 30 or seven and that
doesn't always get me a full eight hours
but I mean what you're going to do like
I want to have a little time where I can
see Tyler after he gets back from work
Tyler's my husband um so that kind of
works for us I guess but I really would
like to be able to see him more at the
end of the day but and I like having a
job too
I guess I started using makeup when I
was and I think later on just a little
bit like later on in junior high like
maybe a little bit in seventh and eighth
grade um but I wasn't super into it then
I think it was just really curious about
it and it wasn't till you know half way
through high school when I really
decided like okay I'm having a lot of
fun with this and I love trying stuff
from the drugstore and fortunately my
mom was willing to let me experiment
with drug store stuff and see what I
liked and I mean that was a key like
kind of formative time for me i was
reading a lot of magazines and that's
where i got a lot of my ideas from was
forming like teen and 17 and like you
see them recommend a product and it's
like oh I gotta get that now
oh my gosh I really don't like you I
could ask this question because you guys
know I use from so many different brands
and I would have to say oh my gosh I
don't know if I've ever successfully
answered this question with only one
brand but I love makeup from the
drugstore because I think it's so
accessible and it's so much fun because
you can experiment and not feel not feel
like you're breaking the bank by doing
so but then there are some more
expensive brands that I absolutely love
the quality the packaging of and
different stuff and I'd say on the high
end scale I really am a fan of brands
such as two-faced and Mac I would say
those brands have not disappointed me
very much if at all in terms of the
things that I have tried from those
brands i really enjoy them and in the
drugstore I like Revlon a lot there are
a lot of great products from Revlon and
I have a lot of favorites from covergirl
as well oh my gosh i mean i could go on
there I seriously have something I have
likes and dislikes from almost every
brand in the drugstore
I have been asked this and I'm really
not like on a timeline like I want to
have kids by this time but I do want to
have kids so I guess the answer is yes i
want to but i'm not exactly sure one
I am exactly five feet tall I am NOT a
tall person at all I wear a lot of shoes
with heels so I might appear to be a few
inches taller than that but standing
flat-footed i am 5 feet tall and tyler
is 66 or 67 he's really tall he's one of
those two I mean he guy people in high
school were like oh my gosh you're so
tall or you're so short and he's so tall
thank you so much Kevin and by the way
this was my two year anniversary at the
station not at the station working on
the morning show I've been there for
coming up on four years in August but
it'll be two years on the morning show
and Kevin is my co-anchor and he is
awesome he's so easy to work with he is
just really funny and fun to be around
so thank you Kevin for a wonderful two
years on the morning show and for
participating in my Twitter talk so
anyway that's all the questions I can
get to right at this moment but thank
you so much for participating in that
everyone and I will make sure to do it
again in the near future have a great
day and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
