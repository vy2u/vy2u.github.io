and whether you're in high school or
college or maybe you're a teacher just
preparing for the new school year
there's a lot of back to school shopping
involved but in this video it's gonna be
all those things that are generally I
would say left off of most school supply
lists but they're really important
things I think you know those little
things to just make your day go more
smoothly to make you feel like when you
open up your locker and look in the
mirror mid day you don't feel like your
look has completely fallen apart and I
know I always looked at going back to
school whether I was in high school or
college you know sometimes it was a time
to reinvent myself sometimes it was just
like I want to polish up my look I want
to kind of go in there and make people
think hey she looks good you know maybe
you're just starting high school maybe
you're just starting college and you
want to give people a good impression
and so I think you know a few key beauty
products are great having some things
that you can tote around with you in
your backpack are good too these are
just suggestions some people may take
more some may take less this is not the
full makeup routine that you might sit
in front of your mirror and do before
the start of the day if you want to see
you know a basic kind of fresh natural
back-to-school look let me know and I'll
do that but these are just some things
that you can kind of touch-up with or
have as your like school emergency
really affordable inexpensive things and
I'm also gonna pass along just a couple
of quick hit morning hair tips it might
just streamline the hair process at the
start of the day that you might not have
already thought about so for starters
let's open up the bag see what's inside
this is just a bag that came with a
Mallee kit that I got but definitely use
whatever just works for you
interestingly enough these are a lot of
things that like I take with me to work
too so if you're not going back to
school but you're just you know going to
work day to day and want to think of
some things that are important to have
on you I always make sure I have a
couple of bobby pins so whatever my
style is you know if I'm out in the heat
one day reporting on a story or you know
maybe you just got done with the gym
class and and the hair had changed for
you you know just clipping back some of
your hair having a couple pins to do
that with and have a
an elastic band or two I mean you'll
also save your friends if you're
prepared you know be the prepared one
and they'll be like Oh does anybody have
a hair tie and you know then you've got
them so an impromptu ponytail no shame
in it just be prepared also along with
that something that I think is great to
keep in your bag or your workout bag or
whatever you've got going on is the
Tresemme it's the tray two hairspray
level four these are often sold in these
small cans you'll find them in like the
Travel section of Walmart with all those
little toiletry supplies this is the
best hairspray a ginormous can of this
in my bathroom and I always do and so
it's great to have the little one as
well for touch-ups also a little bitty
hairbrush I've had this one for so long
this is from goody and I think they
still sell these mini brushes again in
that Travel section of your Target or
Walmart or whatever easy to help you
pull your hair up into those ponytails
or buns or whatever you need no I talked
about this in my makeup touch-ups video
definitely check that out for like some
quick help on how to touch up your
makeup midday but q-tips you don't even
need a full like travel thingy of them
just make sure you've got a few thrown
into your bag this is key for helping
with any eye makeup smudges because if
you are active or you've got just a
little time to kind of freshen up
between the end of school and an after
school activity or event the q-tip is
just a really cheap and easy way to keep
things touched up along with that
another helpful thing to have would be
one of these makeup remover pins elf
makes one from their Studio line $3 eyes
lips face comm your target might have
them as well but what this is is just
like a marker loaded with makeup remover
so if you've got a smudge I recommend
you know maybe taking this under your
eye if you feel like things are
traveling on you a bit take your little
q-tip and get rid of any excess moisture
that's the thing I almost wish like this
came with a little receptacle with
q-tips because they work hand in hand
you don't want to have any leftover eye
makeup remover on that area or
is just gonna cause more and more things
to smudge I also think it's just good to
have a liner with me it doesn't always
need to be touched up but it's kind of
like just there just in case it's small
it doesn't take up much space anyway so
it's just you might as well have it I
like the Maybelline master drama liners
because they don't need to be sharpened
and they are very long wearing chances
are if you started your day with this on
your eyes you may not even need a
touch-up but I know we're all you know
different activity levels out there and
that may be something you want to touch
up so I think a liner is good to have I
get a lot of questions about what's a
good pressed powder something that can
not look cakey maybe provide a little
coverage and also help control the shine
and one of my favorites and has been for
some time is the L'Oreal True Match
powder comes in a little thing like this
there's your pressed powder there is a
sponge on the other side
that's something great also if you're if
you want to spring for this it's a
little more high-end a little more
expensive but the Mallee poreless face
defender this is like one of those clear
like gel like products it's lasting me
forever it doesn't take much when you
use it but basically with this product
it kind of mattifies the skin gives it
sort of a satin like finish kind of
blurs the flaws and the pores and
whatever has you know decided to rear
its head throughout the day but you just
blot this all over your face real
quickly and you've got kind of a
flawless finish
so that or if you're more of a powder
girl and you want to have that powder
with you
I love true madmen there's also the
thought well maybe you want a little
extra blush you know bronzer if chances
are if your powders faded maybe those
things have faded too I recommended this
to no end it's the elf contouring blush
and bronzer bronzer on one side blush on
the other kind of a universal shade a
little bit of sparkle in there but that
can give you the same glow and kind of
double is almost like a highlighter type
glow so you're thinking well how do I
put that on the travel brush this is the
travel face brush if you have nothing
else this is from Ecotools and this is a
retractable kabuki it's a really nice
dense soft brush and you could use this
to put on your powder you could
definitely use this for the blush and
the bronzer
what's nice about this is you're not
just throwing a brush into your makeup
bag and then getting it all messed up it
stays really nice for you in that little
container so I mean that's a drugstore
item it's a great brush whether you're
using it at home or taking it with you
you don't like to touch up the lips as
well I remember never being without a
lip balm when I was walking around the
halls of high school and something that
I think is great for when you don't have
a mirror to apply are the Maybelline
Baby Lips I also like Neutrogena 'he's
got a great tinted lip balm
Palladio I mean there are different
brands that have really nice ones and
they're nice because they're putting a
little color on your lips they're making
you look like you got something going on
but it's not over the top and again you
don't need the mirror what I've got on
now is the baby lips and I believe
cherry me it's called cherry me and it's
just a great sheer read I mean it's
perfect if you just want to have a
little bit of like popsicle red lips
that's what that is
another one that I like is the peach is
called peach kiss super natural kind of
a golden a glowy look on your lips
finally where fragrance is concerned you
know if you feel like you need to grab a
deodorant or maybe a body spray or
cologne or something to take with you
you know what you like you know what you
need but one thing that I would really
highly recommend are the little pocket
back things from Bath and Body Works
this one is in pairs are almost always
really really fragrant and so just
putting some of this hand sanitizer on
your hand you're helping you know guard
against germs and whatnot but I don't
know how many stories I've gone out on
you know shaking hands in some cases
hugging somebody and being told oh you
smell good and I'm thinking what did I
put on the hand sanitizer you know
that's it so it's kind of funny how that
really affects like your overall scent
to someone who's you know just meeting
you or you're just super cheap like one
is a dollar fifty you can get them and
you know bundles of them for you know
five dollars I think those are just some
tips for those of you wanting to build
sort of an on-the-go beauty bag what
should I take in my backpack throughout
the day and if you want a tutorial
that's more like step by step getting
ready I would be happy to do that as
well just kind of point me in the
direction of what kinds of things you'd
like to see
they're now a couple tips for hair don't
always have a lot of time to get ready I
think a lot of people think oh rollers I
don't want to take that kind of time
well rollers I've always said hot
rollers are a really quick way to go
because you pop them in your hair and
you are really done all you have to do
is take them out and like run your hands
through your hair and you're good this
is a little set from Conair these are
really jumbo sized rollers that are
going to provide a lot of volume these
come with a big clip that has those
little combs so you don't get the dent
in your hair from like harder clips or
pins or whatever we might think what do
you do with five rollers well you can
just put like say two up top one here
one here and then one two three on the
rest of your hair and it's like you've
got suddenly a sleek turned under style
got tons and tons of hair it may not be
enough for you I've got long hair but
it's kind of fine so I can actually do
this and put all these in and then just
have a really sleek style it's not a
super curly style but it's a little bit
of volume up here and then everything
down here is kind of sleek and turned
under so that's just something to keep
in mind because all you have to do is
get these in and then go about your
business do your makeup find your outfit
pack your lunch
you do whatever finish your homework
whatever you need to do and you've got
these just working on your style as you
do stuff and then take them out you know
brush through it you know pin some back
put it in a ponytail even you've got
kind of a finished sort of turn under or
flipped out style depending on what you
want to do so I just wanted to give a
shout out to those because there's
something I've passed through in the
store quite a bit and thought what do
you you how do you make those work and
really it's pretty easy I can do a
tutorial on that too one hair other hair
tip that I do have a tutorial on is
doing a bun when it really sleek and
kind of polished bun there's a very easy
way to do it
Conair has something called the bun
maker and I have like I said a video on
how I do this but it comes with this
little mesh sort of donut type thing and
some pins and basically it's a matter of
pulling your hair into a ponytail you
loop your hair through the little mesh
donut and then you wrap your hair
around it and you've got the bun so you
could do a high bun or a side bun you
can make it a little Messier or
texturized if you want to keep your hair
kind of curly when you do this but it is
so fast and easy you'll see from that
video you can also just buy the little
donut thing at like a Sally's for super
cheap like I said you're pulling your
hair through it like a ponytail wrapping
your hair around if you're thinking well
why add that in you know a lot of us
might have kind of a shrimpy bun without
it you know I feel like if I pull my
hair back tight and wrap it into a bun
it's not real big but you put it around
one of these and you're like oh hey nice
bun so anyway it's just my little tip
there it's really really quick once you
get the hang of it and a little
hairspray to finish it off and you will
be good to go so I hope these tips
helped you as you prepare for back to
school there's probably a lot on your
shopping list where the academics are
concerned and that's what's really
important these are just a few you know
little things inexpensive things that
can sort of enhance your look and make
you feel a little more confident with
going back to class so so much for
watching have a great school year to
everybody going back to school the
teachers too who are watching thank you
for watching I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
