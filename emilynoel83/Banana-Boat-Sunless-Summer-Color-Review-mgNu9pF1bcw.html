gonna be a review today on a sunless
tanner that I love so much and I am
really really excited to tell you about
this
it's from Banana Boat and it's called
summer color self-tanning lotion I have
deep dark color it's the only one that
was sold in my store although I believe
they sell a light to medium at least
their website says they do but this is
the only one I've seen in stores but
that's okay
don't get freaked out by this yet if
you're really fair
it says self adjusting color for a
natural looking tan streak free for all
skin tones ok so this is the product and
I'm really really excited to tell you
about this I have used this on my legs
this week for three straight days and so
a little bit I'll show you my legs that
sounds weird I will show you sort of the
results that I've gotten there but the
beautiful thing about this is is you can
use this on your face as well this is
oil free so that's awesome and what I
like about this the most if I could sum
this up you know in just a one line it
would be that this is the combination of
one of those great gradual Tanner's
that's like lotion paired with a
traditional sunless tanner it is so
awesome so when you open it up first off
you're getting this much I I'm really
bad about remembering to tell you guys
how much is in the things I'm talking
about but this is six blue ounces so a
good size here and this is retailing on
say drugstore calm obviously prices vary
by location depending on what store you
get this at but on drugstore comm it's
like $6.99 I think so that's not a bad
price at all and you open it up and what
you get out of this is a sort of a
tinted cream that is not a gel that
you're looking at there that is a cream
and it feels like lotion when you get it
out it feels definitely like a lotion
and when you get it on your skin you
feel moisturized as if you've just put
and put on a lotion so I love that part
of it that's what really reminds me of
the gradual tanners
also you when you put it on it's it's I
feel like that moisturizing aspect of it
helps you get it on really evenly too
and so in about two minutes in the
morning I put this on my legs and I'm
done like I'm not trying that hard I'm
not being like super paranoid about
getting it all even and all that I mean
I just put it on I try to keep my
fingers together when I apply it and I
just rub it on as if I were going to put
on a regular lotion on my leg just a
plain lotion so you get a lot of
moisturizing aspects it goes on very
evenly it does say streak free and I've
used this on my arms before I've used it
on my face and I do not get streaks I
haven't used it on my face just recently
but I have four there was a string of a
few days there where I did just to make
sure it didn't like break me out it does
not break me out at all
I noticed really no difference in my
skin after I've used this a few times
that's not for me that's not a guarantee
to you that it will absolutely work the
same way for you obviously with any of
my reviews it's my experience and then
you can take that information and do
what you want with it but just to read
the description here it says it gives
you a radiant deep summer tan all year
long the self-adjusting color formula
lets you control the shade of your tan
and allows you to achieve the deepest
tan available to your skin tone so the
more often you apply the deeper your tan
will become the lotion is oil-free
enriched with aloe vera and vitamin E to
nourish your skin and tinted so you can
see where you've applied for a
streak-free tan so the tinted aspect of
that really helps that's kind of why it
reminds me of a regular sunless tanner
and what I mean by that it's like
L'Oreal sublime bronze make some that
are just your traditional sunless
tanners that aren't really attempting to
give you gradual color but you just put
them on their stuff from tan wise from
Sally Beauty Supply that's more of the
you know this is your sunless tanner
we're not really claiming to build up
your tan to a certain color you put it
on and you're going to be tan and a lot
of that stuff tends to be tinted and a
lot of the gradual tanners are not so I
like that aspect because not only are
you getting a little bit
color initially that kind of makes you
feel confident if you put it on right
before you walk out the door it's like
okay your legs aren't completely you
know as light as as they were you know
when you started you get a little
instant color there and it also does
help you see where you've put it I like
to just put it on in front of a mirror
and kind of turn around as I do it and
just make sure it's all blended in it's
no big deal a lot of times just an
application tip here before you do this
before you kind of start doing this say
you're going to spend a week and you
want to use this daily or every other
day I would suggest before you start
your sunless tanning regimen to kind of
get in the shower and use a scrub use
some sort of exfoliating agent whether
that's a loofah or something and really
make sure that the parts of your skin
that are traditionally very dry do get
exfoliated because that way you will get
even more even color on your knees feet
ankles elbows things like that so do be
aware of that but the neat part about
this is why I think this could work for
everybody is because it's really just a
matter of how often you apply it as to
how dark you will be I have applied this
for three days straight and I think I'm
about the color I would want to be and
so to maintain that I will put it on
then every couple of days from now on if
you only like what one application gives
you then go with that wait a couple days
and then do it again just to keep it up
but like I said this is really great
because it can work on your face and
your entire body even after you apply it
like say I applied this you know when I
left for work in the morning and now I'm
home and my skin still feels you know
moisturized it doesn't feel like you
know okay I put this on and now it's
dried up a lot of like say the foam
sunless tanners where it feels really
liquidy and then you put it on your skin
but once that's absorbed your skin feels
really pretty dry again and sometimes
the tan doesn't look so good either
your skin ends up looking so much better
when it's hydrated like this and it's
not like you put the tan on and okay now
it's dry and it looks funny so I think
you guys know where I'm going with that
but in terms of drying time when you put
this on you aren't going to want to
instantly put your clothes on right
after you do this
so three sorry about that but as I was
saying you're not going to want to
immediately put your clothes on I think
if you've got like you know a skirt that
you're wearing or wearing shorts and you
just want to put this on your legs you
know obviously you're fine if that's
what you're going for but if you want to
put this on and then you still plan on
wearing pants or long sleeves or
something like that wait a little while
it's suggest waiting
it just says wait till allow it to
completely dry before dressing this is
the one kind of tricky part about this
because because it's so moisturizing
your skin doesn't necessarily feel like
dry as a bone
like I think you're going to know when
it's you know when it's dry enough
because you can touch it and kind of
tell okay I feel like everything's fine
now but I wouldn't recommend putting
this on before you go to bed hopping in
the sheets and then you've got this
tinted stuff on your legs that you
really want that to dry so I would say
give it a couple hours if you want to do
this before bed make sure it really
dries and if you're doing it in the
daytime before you go to work and you do
put pants on over it give it time to dry
there as well that's just an aspect of
this that's kind of unavoidable um I
have tried spray tan air tanners and
stuff like that in the past and I like
those but I do feel like they're more
time consuming for me to put on because
I really feel like okay I gotta get this
even and I'm looking and I'm checking
and sometimes it's just harder to get it
everywhere when you're just putting on a
lotion there's something so simple about
that and I feel like if it's something I
can I mean you guys know I go to work
and I have to be at work at 3:30 in the
morning so what I'm getting ready
between 1:30 and 3:00
I mean I have literally I have the two
minutes that I'm able to spend on this
and I don't have much more than that so
I'm not willing to put out a lot of time
to get this pan I just want to have some
color you know for the season so this is
what I really recommend to you guys if
again it says deep dark color but even
if deep dark is not what you're after I
still think you're going to be able to
work with this just don't apply it as
often that's really where the color
intensity comes in if you are into the
gradual Tanner's if you really don't
want anything tinted
and you you don't want as accelerated of
colors this is going to give you this is
going to get you a little darker the
name gradual Tanner will as you will see
there but add of energy glow and there's
a Nivea firming sunless tanner those are
really good for as far as the gradual
Tanner's go because they are basically
like a white lotion II cream you put
them on and you do get that gradual tan
those I mean are very once again easy to
use this one just steps it up a notch
with it being tinted and giving you a
little more color out of it alright guys
I am still in my work clothes here I
don't just like sit around the house of
this I just got home from work but to
just kind of show you how this looks on
my legs basically I just like I said
three days straight put it on I feel
like it applied evenly you know all over
and I didn't think it just gave a nice
kind of an intense enough color that I'm
looking for thanks so much guys for
tuning in for this video and I will see
you next time have a great day guys one
extra tip about sunless tanners one of
the annoying things about them can be
that sometimes they're out of stock when
you want them like say they may not
carry them all year round or maybe they
don't even bring them back the next
season when it's spring and summer time
so if you likes if you find a sunless
tanner you like regardless of the brand
I would encourage you to maybe stock up
if you figure out it's what you want I'm
definitely going to go back and
repurchase those once maybe twice
because I don't want to be without it
and I'm you know always concerned that
maybe it's one of those things they
won't keep year-round so just to
remember that thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
