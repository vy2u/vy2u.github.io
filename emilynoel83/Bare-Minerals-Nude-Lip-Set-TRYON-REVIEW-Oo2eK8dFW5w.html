for you I wanted to tell you about this
lip kit that I've gotten recently to try
out ahead of the holiday season and it
is so good this is a total
recommendation I think a total win for
people who like nude lip colors but a
range of them I think of it as modern
nudes everything going from the nudes
you would expect and they're really soft
and light colors all the way into your
caramel e-type nudes deeper rosy nudes
that kind of thing these are for the
people who like creamy lipsticks no
shimmer but a really really balm like
feel on the lips they feel like kind of
lip treatments even after they wear off
they're not really built for long wear
but I find that even once these products
are gone from my lips after I've been
wearing one my lips still have this
feeling like oh they feel kind of soft
they feel better for having worn them
you're getting eight of the mini gen
nude radiant lipstick and you're getting
actual shades that exist in their line
so nothing is limited-edition if you
fall in love with one of the colors
you're not just like out of luck after
trying this set because you could
purchase a full size in any one of these
so I love when it's a sampler that
actually feeds into their regular line
35 bucks 8 mini lipsticks if you've got
a friend who you know it's like a nude
lip where I think they would love this
wardrobe or if that's you you would
probably enjoy this a lot I've been so
pleasantly surprised with the gen nude
products that I have used the only other
thing I had was a little duo it's like a
try me set of their butter cream or
their lip lip gloss cream type thing and
also they have a matte lip cream which
is quite good as well as far as the
scope of matte lip creams go so I was
really excited to try these radiant
lipsticks and realize okay these are
top-notch quality also and the kit is
called jankis is on my list hella notes
baby I recently talked about a smaller
lip set from bite I would say those are
very full colored lip products more
toward a classic lipstick these I think
are plenty colorful as well I mean I
don't really find myself having to build
up a lot of color with these but the
finish is more shiny and there's just
more of a lightweight bomb like feel to
these lip products regardless of shade
like I noticed that throughout the
entire line so when you get them they
come in this box it's a pullout tray and
there's no real rhyme or reason to the
fact that each one some are in a matte
black tube and some are in this like
soft golden tube I think it's just for
visual effect here because it's all like
the same formula I'm going to try all of
these on my lips for you so you can see
exactly what shade you're getting
personally I do notice the subtle
differences between every shade I mean I
don't feel like there's anything
doubling up here I can really tell that
you know one shade might be warmer one
might be cooler what might be lighter
darker um stop talking just show the
swatches first off bubbles is your
lightest color and I really I was
debating on whether to wear this shade
with my smoky I actually had this on for
a little while beforehand really pretty
shade doesn't take a lot you're gonna be
tempted just because they feel good to
apply to play like ring around the lips
a few times you don't need to because
you can't develop a streaky look if you
apply too much of the colors so just
keep that 9 nudists is the shade you've
seen on my lips throughout this video
and this has a little more peachy nough
stew it I thought it played nicely with
the warm aspects of my eye look and my
cheeks and I love this color and I think
I may want that one in the full-size
then with the shade called kitty we're
getting even peach year I'm not
necessarily a whole lot darker but
definitely more peachy in tone again the
shine the softness is there with all of
these shades next color is called heaven
and this is your soft soft dusty rose so
instead of being so peach there's a
little more pink in this shade I think
it's beautiful
I think about anybody could get away
with wearing that color now let's sexpot
we take a turn and we're going more
toward a little bit of a soft brownish
nude very very soft like Tanny Brown and
I think this is pretty this is not my
favorite of the kit by any means but I
could warm up to wearing this shade you
know
honeyBun very well named this is like
your caramel e nude it's kind of like
the shade I've been wearing on my lips
throughout the video I'm nudists but a
little bit deeper take on that type
she and then definitely getting off the
beaten path of quote-unquote nudes but
still super wearable colors here with
xox this is that pretty rose that you're
going to want to pull out when you wake
up feeling like death and your face
needs a lot of help that day this brings
so much life to the face it's a gorgeous
rose last but not least you get a deep
color called Queen and this is so so
pretty deep rich berry not toward a
purpley berry more towards a brick-red
earthy type berry and I really like this
color I do think you're going to want to
be careful with this dark shade that has
so much shine just staying power wise
throughout the day not saying I've
noticed any of these kind of drifting
outside my lips but this is the one I
would really watch for that and I might
do a little bit of a blot actually to
get rid of some of the shine and
moisture before I take off and go about
my business but just looking at the full
lineup of swatches every shade truly
once you see it on your lips you can
tell they've got their own special
unique little quality to them no shimmer
in any of these just straight up creamy
lip colors that do deliver a good amount
of shine to the lips but also a lot of
hydration as well formula feels
exceptionally comfortable and like I
said I can't stress it enough the
temptation is there and I even had to
hold myself back sometimes in the demos
you want to just kind of keep putting it
on did you ever get that way with lip
balm like you just slather on way more
than you need keep in mind that while
these feel like lip balms there is color
there so if you apply way way too much
of it you can get a streaky ur look so
just kind of go once maybe twice around
the lips and that's plenty for any of
these so this is definitely not the last
of the holiday lip set reviews I've got
a few more that I definitely want to
swatch out for you and talk about in the
future but just wanted to put this out
there it's a great little gym and I got
mine at Ulta so thank you for watching
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
