gonna be a little tutorial using the
bareMinerals happy play squad I just
love this quad and this was my Emily
Award winner for best high end small
palette and I was wearing this look in
my Emily Awards eyes video and many of
you asked for a tutorial on it so it's
kind of been on my to-do list
ever since I love this look because
these are neutrals but it's kind of a
different take on neutrals because
you're using this great peachy kind of
almost rose gold type shade the plum
they combined beautifully they look
beautiful just side by side on the eye
and you're able to anchor that look with
a couple of great matte classic shades
as well alright first step I'm gonna
take my itty bitty one that I'm using
currently my bare minerals prime time
eyelid primer and just apply that all
over my lid and up into the crease you
can see it kind of neutralizes some of
the funky colors your eyelid naturally
takes on so that's good then I'm using
this light matte color here it's like a
really really light beige and I'm just
going to apply that around the inner
corner when you go all over the lid with
this peachy shade and I'm getting this
all over the lid because I want to do a
little overlapping toward the outermost
part so we just want to kind of lay down
this nice peachy base all over then I'm
just sticking with my same brush this is
a very all-purpose brush the Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush and I'm gonna
go into the plum and I'm just going to
dab this shade on the outer part of my
lid and I do that mainly because I just
really love how this looks side-by-side
with the peach just focusing on that
outer third of the lid patting that
shadow right there and these shadows are
so easy to blend I'm really gonna form
exactly the way I want my outer shape to
look here and then we'll just blend it
out and make it nice and soft so I'm
flipping my brush over a little bit and
just pulling it upward and outward a
little bit from my crease and just pull
it a little
but inward but we're gonna take care of
that was a different shade in a second
it's amazing how much you can get done
really with just one brush next up I'm
going to shear that out a bit with a
fluffier brush just getting the brush
right in the crease pulling the shadow
inward without adding any extra shadow
then I'm gonna take another bear brush
this fluffy brush and this time I'm
focusing on the outer edge of the purple
see how much this can be softened it's
really easy to work with so I'm just
taking that right along the outer edge
until I get it as soft as I want it next
I want to do a little bit more with the
crease and with a non shimmery shade so
I'm going to use this matte kind of
greyish taupe color and I'm just using a
small almost pencil type brush and I'm
just lightly taking this shade to the
inner most part of my crease and just
pulling it inward until it starts to
meet up with the plum oops got a hair in
there again just take a bear brush and
make sure that's as soft as you want it
to be now something I love doing with
this quad and I think it just makes it
so special this next little step is to
go back into the peach color and I'm
using a really small wispy brush this is
my e36 blending brush from Sigma and I'm
just going to carry this right over the
edge of the crease shade and it gives
this beautiful like it's The X Factor of
this look you know it just gives the
prettiest warmth bordering that plum and
then to really finish it off going back
to the light matte shade and that's
what's gonna come closest to the brow
and then that will border the peach now
on the under part of the eye I'm going
to start with the waterline and I'm
using my Too Faced perfect eyes eye
liner here it's a really nice rich black
and I'm just going to gently pull down
on the waterline and take that all the
way from left to right and then on the
outer part here I'm just kind of gonna
dot this liner
right in between my lashes so I'm
actually getting this you know on the
skin how soft it looks down there below
the waterline so I'm going to take my
smudge brush and I'm gonna grab a little
bit of the purple on that brush and then
while that liner is nice and smudge able
still I'm gonna go right over the top of
it and we're gonna get this really nice
like soft smokey look underneath and
then I'm gonna go kind of all over that
area with the matte taupe really soft
edges is what we're going for next I'm
gonna line my upper lash line with a
black liner that I'm using my NYX
two-timer
it's got a pencil on one end and a
liquid on the other I always open the
right hand first here's what the liquid
tip looks like this will be something
I'll be reviewing at some point but I'm
just going to take that all across my
upper lash line I'm just bringing it
right down to the outer corner of my eye
next I'm gonna curl my lashes and I'm
applying my essence I love extreme crazy
volume mascara to my upper lashes and
then for a really a guaranteed smudge
free look I'm taking my covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant mascara and I'm
gonna put probably like two coats of
this on the lower lash and these lashes
that I'm using are very similar to the
red cherry number 43 they were actually
a lot longer left to right so I trimmed
them up a little bit to make them fit my
eyes a little bit better but I don't
remember the exact style but if you've
got the number 43 they're very very
similar to this and I've got a full
false lash tutorial if you want to see a
really detailed step-by-step like for
beginners type lash video I've got that
and I'll link to that below it's called
false eyelashes 101 but for now I'm just
gonna get my glue on here let it get
tacky a little bit and then place them
right on my upper lash line so there's
the finished look again this was pretty
much the exact look I was sporting in
the Emily awards video for eyes and for
some reason something I really enjoy
about this look is how soft and blended
the shadow is but how rich and dark the
black liner looks paired with that
something about it I really like the
contrast that it create went with a
great blush from the balm this is called
hot mama and as you can see it's really
rocking that kind of rose gold
peachy type vibe so I've got that glow
happening on the cheeks there my lips I
really wanted to keep them very soft
almost like a nude lip but still with a
little peach tone so I'm using the NYX
butter gloss in creme brulee there if
you're looking to pick up a bare
minerals quad I really really love this
one but as with any tutorial if you can
dig up similar shades in your collection
I think this look could totally be
recreated with other shadows as well
I'm just particularly a fan of the way
these blend I think they're just super
easy to work with so thanks a lot for
watching guys I hope you like the look
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
