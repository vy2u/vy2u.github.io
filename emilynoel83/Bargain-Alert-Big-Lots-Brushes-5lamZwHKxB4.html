this video first off just want to say if
you've been wondering where the videos
are there aren't as many or they're not
being posted as regularly as they had
been in the past I'm sorry I'm still
really getting adjusted to the schedule
that I'm on but can you expect more
tutorials yes I will have more tutorials
and reviews and features with Tyler and
and different things I promise you i
will i am still thinking about ways to
work it into my schedule but i believe
that i have found a way so i think
you're going to be kind of happy with
the things that i have to come but for
now I just want to tell you briefly
about several brushes that I picked up
from big lots I want to give you a
little disclaimer here I have not used
the brushes yet this is kind of my
initial reaction of them I really like
them and I wanted to tell you about him
before Big Lots gets them out of stock
because I know if I wait too long to do
this you may be getting this hearing
this and then you don't see them at all
and you've missed the boat entirely and
it also may be the case that my big lots
has these brushes and yours does not
because as many of you probably know as
well not all big lots carry the same
items so I just take this with a grain
of salt maybe you will find these
elsewhere you could even do a search for
them but i would give away at these for
one of them was two dollars the other
two were only a dollar apiece at big
lots and i think they're really good
quality looking forward to using them
and just wanted to pass the deal along
to you so the first one is an angle
blush brush as you can see the the brand
is essential tools and it's got kind of
a brushed gold a handle black shiny
black right here and look at the
thickness of that brush I mean it's just
so dense soft and well-made you know you
can rough it up it's not shedding
whatsoever this part from the ferrule to
the handle is not loose like so many you
will initially by it isn't that a bummer
you just buy a new brush you just get it
out and you're like oh this is loose
this wasn't made well
well this one is made well it's soft on
the face that angle is wonderfully well
and I was comparing it to a just a
second ago to my elf bronzing brush look
at the size of this ok not bad you know
it's just a skinny little brush it's
kind of dinky when you look at it
compared to this one ok look at them
size-wise like this you know this this
one can handle the product it will it
will blend your blush and your bronzer
very well its got tapered bristles and
by taper I don't mean like the slant
that it has here but I mean by the how
they're shorter bristles on the sides
and then they work up to being longer
here that's very helpful for blending so
this is a very nice brush and this is
the packaging that this brush and the
next one I'm going to show you comes in
it's been like a little too okay it says
essential tools right here it's in like
a little see how it's like a kind of a
little tube it comes down in only a
dollar and it also put down in there is
this a little pamphlet and it tells you
you open it up and you can get tips on
how to apply and things like that so
that can be very helpful for person is
trying a new brush that they've never
used before so the next one that I got
really loved it never seen anything like
this before it's a double-ended
concealer and setting powder brush this
is really neat this one this end if you
look at it right here would you not
think this is probably the same product
as the essence of beauty brush that I
have over here I mean it it's like the
same basic thing it feels the same it's
the same size same softness good size
for fitting in right in there around
your eye those small areas that you want
to get the concealer in but you don't
necessarily want to use your
there to do it so that's a very very
nice brush their dense enough yet
flexible enough soft enough I think it
will handle creamy products well but the
other end is what I've really never seen
before and it is this this fluffy very
unusual size I've never seen a brush
this size because you may think that
looks like a fluffy eye contour brush
well here is the biggest fluffy eye
contour brush I have it's from Smashbox
and that's pretty big this is still
bigger okay and as opposed to this one
being wound all the way around the base
of the bristles this one is flattened
see how it's flatter right there and
that makes the bristles flare flare out
a little more and that makes it almost
more of a Khloe's it's like a mini mini
face brush and what this is so neat for
is you know that's a great size that's a
really unusual but really awesome size
for getting that powder in there to set
over your concealer and not make it cake
okay because I so often use another
concealer brush that is flat for my
powder and it does fortunately i'm not
using products that have a tendency to
cake but you realize you can get that
when you're using that flat brush that
provides lots and lots of coverage this
is less coverage lighter and that's kind
of what you want when you're setting
concealer around that area where people
tend to have wrinkles under their eyes
and around the corners of their eyes so
very unusual that it's two-in-one I've
never seen anything like this and also
you know if you're new to make up new to
this all the steps that you go through
this is neat to have this end here that
you'll probably remember and then you
won't forget to set it because you've
got this brush on the other side a
dollar isn't that cool a dollar for that
brush go get that I hope you guys have
it in your store now the other brush
that I got was also a dollar and I don't
have the packaging for it different
brand than the other two
this is from it's really tiny diamond
cosmetics it's a professional brow and
brush comb and this is something I
already had but I can't keep these from
breaking even the top breaks off or the
Pharaoh breaks off from the from the
handle and I don't know what the deal is
I'm not saying this is anything more
outstanding than any others that I've
seen but I just needed a new one so I
picked this up I think they had other um
like eye shadow brushes smaller I shadow
brushes in this same wine but this was
just what I needed I used this end
mainly the stiff bristles for my eyebrow
but you guys never noticed that how
these are really hard to keep they break
a lot and especially if you have to haul
one around in your makeup bag so anyway
just want to give you heads up there's
some good things at Big Lots these days
that I think you should check out these
brushes are like my top picks two
dollars here one dollar for this and
they also had other bigger you know
power brushes and different eye brushes
things like that so if you're in need of
some new brushes or you're just starting
out i would say check this out for only
a dollar or two it's definitely worth
trying so thank you guys very much for
tuning in what for more videos to come
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
