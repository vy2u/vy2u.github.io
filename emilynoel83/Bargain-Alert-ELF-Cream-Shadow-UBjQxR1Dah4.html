day today um I just got in from scooping
some snow so excuse the hair makeup
smudging or whatever's going on right
now I just wanted to go ahead and do a
bargain alert video on a product that
I've been wanting to talk about for
quite some time but hadn't just gotten
around to it and this is a product that
is to be used as an eyeshadow base I
mean it's actually called a duo
eyeshadow cream it's by elf but I am
suggesting you use it as a color base to
your powder shadows not to just be used
alone but anyway it's one dollar on eyes
lips face calm there's a lot of
different shades and I'll show you the
shades I have in a minute but um it's a
really really inexpensive but I think
much better quality than what is than
what they're being charged for and it's
just a good way to you say you put what
out the way I would use these as I would
put on my Mary Kay eye primer and then
put on on one of these duo shadow creams
and then go ahead and put on my my
powder shadow over that and it really
works wonderfully well I've been so
happy with the results I've had the long
wearing results with this if you have
used these in and have had problems a
couple suggestions I would have would be
make sure you're using a primer
underneath make sure you're not putting
too much of the cream shadow on and just
again make sure you're setting that with
some sort of powder shadow and I think
you'll have a very long-lasting look but
another reason why I like these is that
it seems like a lot of times sometimes
with cream shadows you're getting a lot
of light shades well this gives you kind
of a mix of light and dark options to
use which can be really helpful if
you're going for that darker look on
your lids so i'll go ahead and show you
the ones that i have and they may give
you an idea of what you want to purchase
but i know there are a few other shades
out there but again it's one dollar
apiece at eyes lips face calm just look
under the eyes section but um this one
is in
black licorice would help if I took the
cap off maybe and it's kind of a creamy
I silver and black and I've used this
silver shade a lot as a base and then
this charcoal black is awesome because
you don't see a lot of nice like black
cream shadows like that so there's what
those shades look like there you can see
the silver one has a little more gleam
to it but the black is just a nice like
that shiny sort of black so just a
second I gotta wipe my finger obvious um
another one i have is in all of I think
it is and it's a green greenish duo you
get a sort of a deep kind of old gold
shade kind of a dark khaki and then you
get this pretty nice like spring green
that comes with it I'll do a swatch of
that one too so I just findings to be so
pigmented and they kind of remind me and
texture wise when I touch them of the
NYX jumbo pencils just really easy to
work with and blend you just like use
one swipe of a minute blank Wow so
there's what those two look like the one
there is there's the gleam and then that
kind of golden and shade is right there
beside it so that's really really pretty
and that duo was called olive I've got
two more here to show you this is
probably my favorite one it's butter
pecan this is the one that kind of got
me going on and I had only gotten one at
first and this was it and it again had
sort of that golden shade although this
one is a little bit lighter than the one
that comes with olive and then you get
this pretty kind of pearly light peach
shade show you those
this peach shade might kind of blend
with my skin tone but it's got some
gorgeous gold undertones I really like
it this is gold yeah this gold might
have just a little bit of a warmer tone
to it almost like a light brown there's
those two there's that light peach and
there is the sort of gold goldish Brown
and that duo is called butter pecan
great for new toilets there and then the
last one I have is very mix go I just
hold it up there at the cap on for you
but you get a nice deep plum and a light
lavender so again it's really cool how
they give you these nice dark shades so
I'll show you this plum shades really
pretty keep having to wipe off my finger
this one I haven't used a lot actually I
just recently got this one really like
that lilac shade okay so there are those
seem right here there's the lilac oops
and then that kind of plum so there's
all those colors you can see how library
they are I mean they just see if I can
get them in any better light for you
here you can see they have some it's
like it's always like the lighter one
has a metallic finish and then the other
one is just sort of a creamy matte shade
but not even Matt just kind of just just
creamy you know no real shimmer heavy
shimmer to it but um i would just
totally recommend these if you're having
like i said if you're having issues with
these just you it's a type of thing that
you can't really over use you um you
shouldn't you shouldn't really load your
eye down with it if you think i'll put a
lot on and then my eyeshadow i put over
that's really going to stand out it's
probably not a good idea you just want a
nice spin application and you can use
your finger or
you can use like something I used here
is like this was a fine concealer brush
from essence of beauty but just a little
flat brush that can sometimes help you
blend it out but you can do it with your
fingers really easily too and just
feeling the texture of this this NYX
pencil that I have done a lot of people
use that as a base and these are maybe
like as I apply it that's maybe just a
little bit drier in texture than these
elf creams are but I just like them so
much and I like how you get two shades
in there and it's only a dollar so I
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this gives you a new idea of
something to get if you're on the elf
website so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
