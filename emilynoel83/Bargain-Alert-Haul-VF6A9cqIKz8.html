haul video just a few things that I've
picked up fairly recently here it's all
some affordable stuff so if you really
like to look out for the good deals in
your drug stores as some of the stuff
might appeal to you but I'm going to
start with what I got from walgreens and
this was such a funny thing because I
got a I went in there with the purpose
to get a mascara and I needed some clear
nail polish and mascara was from l'oreal
and the clear nail polish was from sally
hansen and i went up there to the cat
registering the ladies like oh you do
know that the L'Oreal stuff is buy one
get one free and I was like no I didn't
know that because you know it wasn't
marked anywhere in the store and so I
because I would totally pick up on it
you know if you see a buy one get one
you're gonna you know you're gonna go
for it but this was not marked anywhere
in the in the area there near the
L'Oreal stuff sounds like okay if you
say so lady so I went back and got
something and then she's like and I
still had that nail polish with me she's
like well you do know that Sally
Hansen's buy one get one too it's like
no that was no marks either but I will
go back and find something so anyway I
wound up with double the products for
you know not paying anything extra so
that was really cool it was nice of her
to go ahead and tell me that but it's
still kind of weird that nothing was
marked so anyone on with the story here
so I went ahead and got um a mascara
that I tried quite a while back and sort
of forgotten about and I was looking for
something lengthening and so I went
ahead and tried this again it is the
lash out mascara from l'oreal kind of
old-school it's kind of been around for
quite some time but really is
lengthening and I really like what it
does i got the curved brush and it's
kind of one of those thick brushes that
sort of remind you a little bit of like
it's not quite like the voluminous but
you know it's sort of along those lines
it's not one of those really skinny
rubber brush mascaras but it really
reminds me a lot of another mascara i
used very very early on lass getting
into makeup and it was from
babbling and it was called illegal
lengths did anybody ever try that I used
to I went through multiple tubes of that
seven I thought was great and it got
discontinued and trying this I ever
kinda reminds me that I like this one
because it was a lot like that one so um
anyway a couple of coke I think it's
really really lengthening not super
volumizing but it still provides a lot
of nice length so I just went ahead and
picked that up and then for my bow go
with that I got a lipstick it was one of
the nude ones where they've got the the
different actresses faces they're the
different L'Oreal spokeswomen I guess
you'd say and this shade is organza and
it's a really pretty um kind of pinky
bronzy nude shade it's really pretty I
liked it a lot you were a couple times
in it it's just the type of color that
really kind of works with any I look you
got going on and I just I like it a lot
it's very neutral but yet it still gives
you a nice finished look so that's the
their lipstick in organza from l'oreal
in the like golden e tube and so then I
went in and got one of my all-time
favorite clear nail polishes since I've
run out and it is the sally hansen mega
shine and this not only is it super
shiny but it dries like none other as
far as speed goes for me i mean and i'm
not like just telling you you know it
dries like it gets tacky quickly this
actually dries to a solid like to where
you can touch it and touch other things
and it's not going to come off i mean
you are going to be if you have not
tried this i challenge you to find a
nail polish that works that dries
quicker than this as far as it clear
coat does i think also the website to
reaffirm this for you the website
totalbeauty.com it's that site that kind
of compiles a lot of blogs and it does
reviews and and some different articles
and things and it counted down some of
the i think was best and worst Sally
Hansen items and this was the best so I
recommend it
definitely it's just I mean you can't do
without as far as I'm concerned a clear
nail polish so if you are running out
you need a new one I would suggest
getting the sally hansen mega shine it's
in the mirror e2 and a bottle Wow yeah
and um then I got for my free one they
had a new selling Hanson had a new nail
polish out called insta-dry and it's
actually what I have on now I was
watching The Today Show and they were
saying how like this year it's not all
about the black nails it's like white
and light colored nails and so I got
this beige blast shade which is just
kind of why I mean it looks pretty white
almost like color of a pearl sort of and
I put it on my nails and I was really
happy with what it did because if you
can see this here it's almost like this
is two coats and it gave a little bit of
transparency but it gives you almost the
look of like a French manicure because
you can still see your tips through it a
little bit and so I really like that
just a different look and a lot less
obviously care you don't have to take as
much care to just do you know a couple
of coats of nail polish as you would
with a full-on French manicure but you
but I kind of liked how I could sort of
still see my natural nail through it I
mean I'm sure one more coat and I
probably wouldn't be able to but I kind
of like that look so that's the color is
beige blast and it's insta-dry and i
must say that i noticed it instantly it
did dry very quickly on my first coat
and then and you would think well okay
if that's totally dry than your second
coat should be kind of starting off
fresh you know and that should dry
equally fast but for some reason the
second coat just didn't rise quickly but
it's still very pretty fast i mean
compared to some other polishes i've
tried it dries pretty fast but like i
said if you just wanted to do one coat
which maybe with some of the more
colorful shades you could get away with
here it definitely did drive very fast
so that was my other folk 0 items air
from Walden and then I went to CBS
actually just today and they have a
bunch of makeup at my store that is
marked with the fifty percent
off and seventy-five percent off
stickers so I just had to pick up a few
things at my store again this is just
they may not be marked the same way at
yours but the sunset duo's that I talked
so much about the one I gave the bronzer
award to in my beauty awards video well
they those are all marked fifty percent
off i don't know if this is a good thing
or a bad thing good now because i didn't
pay much for it but anytime I see Markov
suggest certain segments of the makeup I
wonder are they just continuing that you
know so um it was very sporadic it
wasn't like a big bin of stuff it was
like just within the display you would
see you know a few shades marked down or
like one section of this or that mark
down but anyway I got the one in sunset
glow which is really it looks more like
a duo blush than a bronzer really
because I had two of these already one
was like a really deep bronzer well as a
medium bronzer that I've been using a
lot and now I have this one sort of a
mommy colored blush with a light peach
blush on top so that was half off so
good deal there and then I got um also
Milani um I got one of their glossy
tubes in smoothie and this is kind of a
Coralie a golden e Coralie shade with
some pink in it and it has that nice
applicator where you just squeeze it out
and it's kind of like a felt tip there
so that was just looked really pretty
and that was also fifty percent off and
then my lat the last fifty percent off
item I got was from Neutrogena it was
one of their moisture moisture showing
glasses in spritz and it's just kind of
a neutral um I don't know even how it
kind of a deep bronze shade with some
gold in it and this these were the
glosses i really liked before i got into
the revlon super lustrous um i guess i
just once i got those i didn't really
come back and we purchase a lot of these
but i noticed they were half off so i
remember you know this is some good
stuff so i went back to the old days
with that one so and then lastly here i
got a few things that i ordered from
Sally
beauty supply I have a sally beauty
supply store in my town but they didn't
have some of the products that I wanted
there some self-tanning products sunless
tanner stuff and these are some
recommendations that i got from one of
them i noticed on the blog of one of the
people i kind of correspond with on my
blog there and she had posted her own
blog about this and i'll put a link over
on the side so you can look at that and
see what she had to say about it but
it's the tan wise airbrush self tanning
spray and she likens this to like a
mystic tan and i'm all for the set the
self-tanner the non tanning bed stuff
because you don't want to get into that
premature aging but like i said i
haven't tried this I this literally just
came in the mail so I'm eager to test it
out but this is just a tanning spray I
guess you'd get more kind of like the
instant tan look as opposed to the
gradual tan that you get with a lot of
products these days so this is a spray
and the brand is tan lines and I also
got this was just on my own curiosity
that I got these the tan wise self
tanning cloths it has aloe and vitamin E
and I guess you just rub them on I don't
know what's a good i haven't tried it i
just got him in so i got those and then
this is another thing that she
recommended its skin drench daily
radiance facial glow and i think it's
kind of like a nice facial moisturizer
with self tanners that can kind of it
says exclusive skin aging defense system
antioxidant rich formula so it's like a
self-tanner for your face that is from
when i get somewhat gradual and it also
kind of delivers some nice moisturizing
benefits besides just being a self
tanner so anyway that looks like this
comes in this nice little thing here and
one of those things i spent less because
i used my beauty club card so to give
you an idea on the prices this facial
glow stuff was um let me see I'm trying
to understand this here
i got it for 599 with my Sally's card
the tan cloth I got for 379 with my
Sally's card and this big spray here I
got for 595 so a good deal and the stuff
came so fast I mean I just placed the
order a couple days ago so that was
really cool that it came so quickly and
another quick announcement on this video
I am have been keeping in touch with one
of my friends here on YouTube who had
started up her own makeup line it's
called heartbreaker cosmetics and
mineral makeup a lot of really cool
eyeshadows I've been playing around with
them and trying out new looks so just
something you guys could have to look
forward to I'm going to be doing a
tutorial using those I just think it's
so great to see somebody who has you
know been sharing their passion for
makeup here on YouTube but taking it a
step further and doing something like
this I think that's so exciting and I'm
just really eager to share that with you
guys so what that'll be the next thing I
do is a video showing you how i used it
and maybe you guys can check it out as
well so thanks so much for watching this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
