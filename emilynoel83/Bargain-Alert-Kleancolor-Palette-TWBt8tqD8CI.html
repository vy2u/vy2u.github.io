video I know some of you are probably
saying man it's been a little while
since we've had a video and that's
because of course the Thanksgiving
holiday has come and gone and I've been
back home for that and had a really nice
break I had a little kind of like a
three-day weekend thing going on there
so I hadn't been able to make any videos
this past weekend but I will get to the
new question the week and all that stuff
so um anyway thanks for still watching
videos and commenting and I have a real
backlog of messages in my inbox and
comments I want to respond to so please
just be patient with me right now as I
kind of get caught up again but anyway I
do want to tell you about a review that
I have about something that I kind of
realized I really liked after I traveled
with it it's a good travel product it's
an eyeshadow palette from clean color
and this is available on at cherry
culture calm and I actually think it
it's you know not it's less than five
dollars I'm pretty sure probably quite a
bit less I really should have probably
checked the exact price for you but you
can check it on their website and what
this is is the nine color eye palette
I'm trying to get a good angle on the
colors here but they have these in some
different colors this one it doesn't
have an exact shade like name but the
item number is 278 and you'll know if
there's only a few options so you'll
kind of know it as I describe it here to
you so they have this one and this is
the one that I'm kind of doing the
review on the one that I'm recommending
but they also have kind of a more wild
colored one for those you can really
like color they got some greens and
purples and reds and stuff and I can't
use that one as much for obvious reasons
but I do think it's fun and the colors
are really nice and pigmented but anyway
back to this one this is 278 this is the
one that I'm reviewing and if you look
across going up from side to side here
you can see you've got a white a nice
gray that has a little shimmer in
and then a nice matte black so there's
kind of like your smokey colors and then
you've got a cream sort of a medium
taupe kind of champagne color and then a
deep brown and then across the bottom
you've got a few kind of different
colors to play with sort of a rusty red
a gold shade and kind of a little bit
pinky purple shading those three are all
shimmery what else is shimmering this
one is right here in the middle and this
one is kind of pearly that silver one is
but it's as you can see as you look at
that and you probably realize what I've
realized is I've traveled with this is
this is a great thing to take with you
this was really the only eye shadow that
I took with me when I was gone for a few
days visiting back home and it really
just had everything I needed if I wanted
to do a little darker look with my eye I
had the smoky colors more natural just
everyday you've got the Browns and then
you can you know switch it up any way
you want to you know combining maybe you
know like the cream color and the
purpley color or you know there's just
so many options and I love things that
seem like they kind of have multiple
uses to them and can give you a lot to
work with and I apologize if the colors
are not showing up quite as well as they
appear to here but I think this may have
been included in one of my earlier
cherry culture haul videos I think not
for certain on that but it's just a
really really versatile kit to have and
I just think the fact that what I say
can't travel it's good for travel as of
course it travels better than I mean I
never want to take one of my big pallets
with me because I don't a I don't want
anything to happen to it and be I know
I'm not going to need that much stuff
you know a lot of times when you travel
maybe you don't have the time that you
usually have to get ready either and so
this is just you know they're really
little they're about the size um how
many coins up here but I'd say they're
about the size of the of a dime maybe
they're about the size of like the
little shades if you have one of the
Coastal Scents palettes like the 80
eight shade palettes adventure to say
those are probably the same size as
these and it's just you know it's just a
nice amount of color the color does come
off really well you'll see if I just put
my finger in the black there I just
dabbed it in and you know it's covered
in black the gold is a really pretty
shade too it's right here on this finger
um it's just they're very easy to when
that's that nice rusty red there on my
pinky and same with the lighter shades
too though they're awesome to use I
haven't had issues with creasing or
staying power and um I just think this
is just an all-around great palette if
you're gonna be traveling somewhere and
want to have a few options but don't
want to take a whole big kit and I'm
just gonna wipe off my fingers here but
it's very compact I mean you can see the
whole thing is you know this big it's no
it's not much bigger than any powder
compact you would have the only thing I
found with it is that this doesn't
really I mean that doesn't it has a
little bit of a snap there but it
doesn't stay shut will well but I mean
as long as you're not like tossing it
around you'll be probably well would be
fine don't like I said if you want to
explore some of the other color options
that you have some fun kind of crazy
colors but this just struck me as one of
those things that I ought to share with
you guys because you're just I mean the
fact that you could do a neutral eye a
smoky eye or a colorful eye all in one
palette nine colors and its small enough
um I just thought what a great travel
tip so thank you guys so much for
watching and continue to look for more
videos and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
