great day I have a bargain alert to tell
you about today it is a really cool fine
that you can get at your local dollar
store probably or you can also get it
online I believe at Cherry culture calm
I found this at Dollar General it is the
LA Colors 12 color eyeshadow palette in
traditional and what this is is a bunch
of awesome neutral colors that you can
use on a daily basis I know there are
people out there and I got this for 99
cents there are people that like to just
do more natural looks and this is a
great everyday palette for that and
another reason reason why I wanted to
bring it up is because on Coastal Scents
calm they're getting in these really
great palettes that have tons of
different colors in them and one of them
is a neutral palette you may have seen
some other youtubers talking about and
it's got dozens literally dozens of
neutral shades and when I saw what
colors those were and then I saw this I
was like this is just a condensed
version of that with just the colors you
might need to do a neutral look and just
it's just good to have on hand to have
in your collection to have a nice set of
neutrals and we've got great
highlighters in here some of them are
have a little shimmer to them some of
them don't um there's some nice
pinky Brown some real deep dark Browns
and I did the look on my eyes today with
this palette I used done I use this
white shade up here and then I use this
kind of what it is is like a smoky plum
brown
I really wish my camera would do these
colors justice because it's such a neat
palette and I just kind of like smoked
it out a little bit out here but it's
you know nice and subtle but yet there
are some dark colors that you could be
more dramatic with with this palette so
I just want to go ahead and show it to
you up close so here we are I'm hoping
lighting wise we can make this look how
it really looks there's probably the
best representation I can give you the
only thing this isn't really showing
it's how some of these colors are smoky
and some of them I mean some are sparkly
and shimmery and others are more matte
but it's just a really nice neutral
palette to have you got a series of nice
highlighter shades
you've also got some shades there in
that second column over that are pretty
kind of plummy Browns and then some nice
mid-tones and then exactly what you
would need to do a dark brown a smoky
eye so I'm really excited about this and
the fact that it's only $0.99 and the
color payoff is good with them as I'll
show you in a second with my swatches
but like I said this is I mean for those
of you who have seen the palette the
neutral palette on Coastal Scents calm
it's so popular right now but this is
like I mean I think you'll find this is
just a condensed version of that and so
to show you the swatches on my hand
these are just a few of those shades and
there's and this is with a a primer a
base on here and I haven't tried super
hard to get the color to come off either
I mean this is what it is there's a nice
nice pre white shade and there's kind of
that purpley Brown which I have on my
ize is the second shade kind of a nice
warm reddish-brown and then a deep
chocolate kind of brown so these colors
are really nice and some of them are
shimmery some of them aren't this is 99
cents you're not going to really be
losing out by getting this but I can
imagine you know a lot of people but are
going to work and go into the office
I've been asked about you know what's
good for office appropriate makeup well
oftentimes that has to be your neutral
eyeshadows and this is just a nice
palette too it's very portable you know
you can just take this with with you
real easily and like I said this they do
have other colors too in this they these
palettes these twelve color eyeshadow
palettes I may go back and try the other
kinds that they had because I believe
they had some that incorporated greens
and blues and stuff but this the color
is traditional here and just a nice
little portable palette to take with you
I think you guys will enjoy it if you
try it and thank you for watching this
little review this bargain alert if you
will today and hope you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
