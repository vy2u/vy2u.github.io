second to do a quick bargain alert video
for you on something that I found at my
local Dollar General Store and I really
liked it and so I thought you know I'm
not sure if this is gonna be sold
everywhere but I just wanted to make you
aware that if you are out browsing your
local Dollar General or that type of
store they might have these in stock so
what it is it's called la colors Art
Deco nail art lacquer and this was only
a dollar by the way and it comes in a
little a little bottle like this with
the little turquoise top and what you
get with it I have it in both black and
white and I think they also had it in
like a gold glittery shade but what you
get is this awesome little fine tip on
the brush it's not anything like a
normal nail brush it's like a can you
see there it's like a little tiny fine
tip okay and some of you had asked about
my nails and I actually used that for
the first time a couple of days ago when
I made these little like I don't know
maybe I can shadow it a little bit these
little like clusters of dots on my nails
and I thought wow that was really easy
to do with this because you know I'm not
like a really advanced nail person and
I'm also not very coordinated when it
comes to like using my left hand to do
something on my right but if you just
want to do like little dots or like a
little star design you're like on my
thumb I did like a little and if you see
I did like a little look it almost looks
like a little snowflake or a star oops I
can't like turn my hand around but it's
on there and just some dots around it
but it's really easy because she have a
lot of control with this little tip and
I just I like how you know you have two
colors I haven't tried the black yet let
me get that out I mean I assume the
textures yeah pretty similar it's just
you know got that really nice fine tip
it reminds me of like liquid eyeliner
that's what via if only you could have
like that
much liquid eyeliner in your container
so that one looks like that cell but the
applicator is totally comparable to the
brush tip on a liquid eyeliner I would
say and yeah for 99 cents a piece I saw
these and I thought wow that could be
really fun just to experiment and see if
I can do you know some fun things to my
nails and just the little dots like that
was really really easy to do also like I
said I'm only used the white but it
dried really fast when I used it I was
able to within probably I don't say less
than five minutes I was able to take a
topcoat like a my clear topcoat I used
Sally Hansen mega shine it's in like the
mirror looking bottle and I just topped
it off with that and I haven't had any
issues with staying power or anything
like that and I just really am happy
with the way it turned out so yeah if
you are out and about at your local
Dollar General check for these they are
the LA Colors Art Deco nail art lacquer
they may even have more colors but they
did in my store have the white the black
and a gold shade which I did not get it
was just kind of glittery and I wasn't
sure how concentrated you know you would
have to get but oh another thing I this
is also one coat - I didn't go over I
didn't go over the dots like a second
time or anything it was just you know
one dot and you got it so I hope this
was helpful to you hope maybe you can
wind up finding these at your local
store but thanks for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
