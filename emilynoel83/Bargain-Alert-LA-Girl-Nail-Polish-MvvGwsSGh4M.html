this bargain alert to you about some
products from la girls they are really
really inexpensive I know prices may
vary from product to product and I'll
put the exact price from cherry culture
calm on the side but these are nail
polishes from LA girls and there's a
couple of kinds I wanted to focus on
here that I've tried the disco brights
and the rockstar nail polish so I'll
start with the Rockstar this is a like
they're kind of like dark sort of you
know that glams sort of rocker colours
and this one is like if you can see when
the light catches it this is a really
really deep purple with some sparkle to
it I had this on my nails and some
videos as like makeup tutorials and
stuff just that really dark purple shade
this was it and I really really liked it
it goes on so thick like I mean you put
it on and you could seriously go with
one coat like this is not that kind of
thing you know hard to apply it goes on
really thick and smooth and one coat
could work two coats will be like
definitely great for you so I really
really enjoyed that so that's nice if
you kind of want that darker look but my
ultimate favorite right now is oh and in
terms of staying power this stays like I
mean it didn't it wasn't getting all
chipped off on me and stuff like that
now a true test of staying power I feel
like is when the product really stays on
your toes because you know like you can
be out walking around and you're wearing
these oh I'm wearing open-toed shoes
like constantly like every single day
now and I have had this polish on this
disco brights nail polish which is
actually like I guess really glows under
under a blacklight that I haven't really
been under I actually was yeah I can
vouch for that it does like kind of glow
and get really bright under black light
but I had this cool awesome like mint
green shade I have it on my toes right
now and it has not chipped at all I've
worn it for a week and it still looks
great you know it's it's worked really
really well
it's very like just solid it's even if
you I had a pink shade I have a pink
shade here that I wore on my nails and
it just is so like it gives your nails a
real strengthened feeling and one coat
can be really good again it's kind of
the same with the other one you know you
could get by with one coat if you were
in a rush I went ahead and did two coats
on my toes and I was like man this step
is it just has this solid slick finish
I'm just so impressed with it so this
shade I don't know if I've been telling
you the shades okay the Rockstar one
this is groupie
that's that pretty pretty purple this
shade which is one of my favorites is
vinyl record it's that kind of mint
green and this one is platforms bright
pink awesome and then I have another one
that I haven't tried yet in this purple
shade called hustle so yeah all these
are just really creamy and pretty and
then they've got like dark sparkly
shades so just really it was so
impressed by the quality of these I
think some times we think like oh okay
to get a good nail polisher to think
it's not gonna chip or anything we have
to spend a lot of money but if you have
access to the use in a store where you
live or if you're making a cherry
culture order go ahead and try out one
of these because I think you're gonna be
really pleasantly surprised or I guess
maybe not surprised after you watch this
video and how well they work so thank
you guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
