I feel like I absolutely have to share
with you and I don't usually talk a-hole
out a whole lot about nail products but
I have something that has helped me stop
biting my nails so I'm going to tell you
about that so keep watching if you want
to hear that but I also want to say
thank you real quick to everybody that
is subscribed left so many great helpful
wonderful comments on my videos it has
just been wonderful and amazing to see
all that it's kind of stuff and I'm just
so glad you guys are enjoying the videos
feel like you're learning something or
are at least somewhat entertained by
them that really makes me feel happy so
thank you and also I've been getting a
lot of requests lately and sometimes I
will read them in the width in the
comments and then go back and look for
them again and I have trouble finding
them so if you have a request go ahead
and send it to me in a message and I
know not everybody's gonna even maybe
even watch this video or recognize that
I'm saying this but it would really help
a lot if it's something you'd like me to
do a video on I'd be more than happy to
but it helps me remember what they are
and keeps it a little more organized if
you could just send it to me in like a
personal message rather than a comment
so that would be hugely helpful thank
you but anyway this review is on the
Sally girl nail polishes at Sally Beauty
Supply and they are okay they didn't
break a promise they are like these
little bit
um well polishes there's like this big
they're many okay they cost 99 cents
apiece if you have a salad card they
cost a nine cents apiece so amazing deal
there they have a big big range of
colors to choose from and part of why
I'd say they helped me stop biting my
nails is because one of the reasons why
I would sometimes bite my nails is
because I have them all polish and then
a couple days passed and it starts
chipping off and then I start picking at
it well this nail polish lasts so long
like even on especially on my toenails
like I had like two coats on my toenails
and if I hadn't changed it I would show
you I have a different brand on there at
the moment but now I've gotten gotten
more styling stuff so I'll probably be
wearing them most of the time but anyway
it did not chip at all it like just
stayed so wonderful so smooth a really
professional look look like you know any
professional nail polish job I mean I
got comments on it like wow you're no
partial it's really good and it was like
you know it kept me not wanting to bite
my nails because they look so nice all
the time and most of the time you know
that can be your downfall the polish
starts looking bad and you start being
like ah this is never gonna look good
but as you can see my nails have grown
out a little bit so yeah they're not
like super long or anything but they're
you know like keys in it you can tap on
stuff now oh my god anyway I want to
show you the colors I got that I like
and
there's only one of them that I've used
so far and there's any but there's a lot
of great colors that I haven't even
tried now to show you what I have to
give you an idea of what's out there
this one is called angel baby and it is
a very very light lavender and I got a
slightly darker oh here it is a slightly
darker lavender the color is his loss
it's just a little bit darker lavender
then got a light pink the color is
spanked all of the names this one is
called genie it's like a golden e P CH
and then I got like a super-duper bright
pink the color is way cool it's not
always showing up as bright as it really
is I'm not sure but this is really
really really bright there I don't know
if you're even seeing that but it's like
fluorescent paint and then I got this
kind of shimmery red and the color is
sassy so you know there's a question
right there like I said 99 cents apiece
if you have a salad card it's only 89
cents apiece you can still get I mean I
know they're little but you can get
quite a few uses out of that I mean
you're not using this stuff up and fast
as you would say lipgloss or something
like that but I just wanted to give
everybody a heads up because my finds a
deal as good as that that is that good
quality I cannot keep quiet about it for
very long especially because it's you
know made a difference in the food it's
so long wearing that it just works great
so if you're looking for like a new
color to try and you're just
experimenting you can't get a better
yield on this as far as I'm concerned
and like I said two coats was what I
believe it was two coats yeah that I
used and it stayed for a really long
time on my fingernails my toenails great
stuff so if you're out shopping at Sally
Beauty Supply
next time you're there check this stuff
out all right thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
