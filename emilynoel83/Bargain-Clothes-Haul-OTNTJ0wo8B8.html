recently and I came out with you know
groceries typical around the house stuff
if you watched my blog kind of a grocery
haul you know he came out with but on
top of the typical Walmart purchases I
got quite a few clothing items and I've
got to say I haven't really browsed the
clothes section of Walmart in a while
but I recently stumbled upon it was
either a blog post or a picture from
Tanya she has a great blog love a family
at home and she showed a couple pics of
some really cute Walmart dresses and I
thought oh maybe it's time to rethink
you know looking around in the Walmart
clothes section and so I came out with
quite a few really cute thing every
clothing item I'm looking at my receipt
it's all under ten dollars which i think
is really great and I was just kind of
looking to add to my spring wardrobe
some things that maybe could work for
work but also could be really great
casual item just say I have his address
this was $9.88 it's a great little kind
of hits you at the knee type dress it
has a really plunging v-neck that you
could fill in you know with some sort of
tank top if you wanted to de-stress and
one other one they're both small and
they're 95% polyester 5% spandex they
have a kind of soft feel it's real
comfortable and I could see this being
sort of like a swimsuit cover-up type
thing or you know just that great casual
dress I wore these with some wedge heels
I consider this to be kind of a light
coral and a really dark brown and I also
threw on with that a belt so kind of a
wide belt that came with another dress I
got last year and I feel like that
defines my waist even more me wrong it's
cute without the belt but I think the
belt makes it even more of a look I
guess you'd say off this black and teal
one with kind of a cute little pattern
going on there exact same fit and
everything I paired this with a black
belt and just kind of a wider sort of a
last
stretchy black belt and some flip-flops
that kind of around a little bit of a
platform and it they're just so easy to
wear and something else I really like
about these tops is the sleeve because
I'm not gonna lie but I do have some
guns on me and I got those through
cheerleading and tumbling and they
really just haven't gone away and I mean
I don't have a lot of use for that
muscle these days but it's there
nonetheless and it my arms tend to look
a lot better in tops that don't have a
real binding sleeve so these are a
little bit loose certainly a fan of
these dresses and for less than ten
dollars I think it's a great deal I also
got a couple of cute tops
um I guess these were from the juniors
section of Walmart and they are like a
little sort of baby doll type top here
and that's very very cute I wasn't quite
sure what to think when I saw it on the
hanger but then when I put it on I
realized that it was really nice and I
love this little print I love that
old-school kind of rose print but it's
made a lot more modern with the bright
color it's not kind of that deeper V um
and the sleeves are you know not
obnoxiously tied around my arms so I
could work with that I have this in a
size media almost like shapes you with
this wider waistband here and then it
comes down rather along other one I got
is more based in black and it's just a
really fun bright floral with some blues
magentas and I mean this could be cute
with black could be cute with jeans and
this is the very same 100% polyester on
it really cute I love this kind of face
of brightening type color is what these
make me think next I got something that
I actually wore to work today I thought
this was pretty cute it makes me think
of something that I should be out on a
boat wearing bra this in a small and
it's a three-quarter sleeve on this with
white print on navy it's got a nice wide
kind of cute neckline which is something
I always look for for the news because
I'm always being seen like from here up
so and it's got a little you'll notice
the white right down underneath there
that's actually built in so you don't
have the added thickness and layering of
bulking up and putting you know stuff
under
but it's super cute and I worked with
some white pants today and some sandals
that have a little white detail on by
the way the top I'm wearing today is
just like a random v-neck from Old Navy
I guess I should have thought this out
better and actually worn something here
that I had on but I wanted to be able to
lift it up and really show you this top
that I'm gonna show you this was even
less this was for 88 for this camisole
and I thought Walmart had a really great
selection of both the spaghetti-strap
kind and regular tank tops they had tons
and less than five bucks it's great you
know it's like the price of meal going
out to McDonald's or something but this
was a cute I love this floral kind of
rose print on its white on kind of a tan
beige color and I thought this could be
cute like under a denim jacket or
something but the way I'm showing you
this top is actually with the cute
little forever 21 vest that I showed in
my last haul I've kind of just loose
easy really looks great with the the tan
and this tank top but there are lots of
ways you could wear this obviously wear
it with a little white blazer that would
look really fresh with a perigee always
looking for layering pieces I'm looking
for inexpensive things that can kind of
extend my wardrobe this could be worn on
air this could be worn just for fun and
Walmart is just really something to look
into all about shopping with kind of
that critical eye on thinking you know
what can I hear this with how can I
create an outfit out of this or that and
you'll find some real diamonds in the
rough and that's what I've always been
about with makeup so I'm kind of getting
into that even more with clothes now and
just bargain shopping and trying to find
those great bits and pieces to make
outfit so you know if you come up with
any great bargain finds whether they're
from Walmart or somewhere else I'd love
to hear about them I'll talk to you guys
again in the next video see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
