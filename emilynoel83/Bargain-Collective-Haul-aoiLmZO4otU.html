time for a whole video which I haven't
really done one of these in a while just
as far as stuff that I've kind of bought
over time a lot of people call them a
collective haul so I just wanted to go
through and show you some of the things
that I've purchased over actually quite
a while like I would say this is maybe
like a month or so um so but first I
have to show you the shirt I picked up
today I love makeup I got it like four I
think it was is it the Steven berries
and where I live there having like some
sort of close out sale or something and
the stuff was like two for eight dollars
so i guess this would be like a four
dollar shirt and i've been eyeing it for
a while but I was like had I know and
then today it was like down to four
dollars i was like i have to break down
and get this i said look like my YouTube
friends will appreciate this so anyway I
want to go ahead and show you some
things that I have recently picked up
first off um there is something
available that I believe now and
probably a few weeks ago back when I've
got it at walgreens it's a set of three
of the jane be pure mineral lip balms
and the set comes with i believe to
tinted ones and one clear one so i have
clear wintergreen as you can see just
like a clear lip balm and um it's kind
of like I don't know it's it feels good
on and it smells just like wintergreen
gum so if you like that I mean it's good
I don't know what I noticed anything
like super outstanding about it and I do
like the tinted ones which I have in
white pearl which is sort of a nude
shade though it doesn't show up a whole
lot on your lips and then the other one
is deep amber and that's kind of a nice
neutral sort of MA be a nude shade if
that makes any sense and these are a
little more slick than the clear one is
I like the texture of the clear one
actually better than the tinted ones
they're just a little slippery like I
wish they'd just kind of clung to the
lips a little more see this is kind of
the benefit of doing the whole video
collective hulls after you've had the
stuff for a little while because then I
can kind of review some some of the
things that I've tried to but these are
kind of cool i mean it might be a good
gift thing for somebody who is in need
of some lip balms and is really into the
tinted boehm thing I mean I think if you
if you prefer a really light feel on
your lips that's kind of what these give
you I sometimes what something just a
little bit tacky or just to feel like
it's a little more long-lasting so just
be aware that it is a really good deal
and I think it was maybe around six
dollars for all of these or maybe even
less than that i'm not quite sure but um
have a good deal and they are cool and
hip flex sort of this metal it feels
like a metal um finish on the lip balms
so they're cute packaging and you know
would be nice to have you can maybe keep
one or give one away or something like
that so maybe a little gift idea is
there um another thing I picked up not
too long ago is one of these 99-cent
wet'n'wild lipsticks that I actually
turned out to really like I was wanting
just sort of a natural light pink shade
and so the one I wound up with here is
510 a so these don't have real names
they're just numbered but as you can see
this is pretty accurate of what the
color is may I can do a little swatch
here for you it's kind of it just a
natural pink shade with maybe a little
bit peach and a little bit of shimmer to
it as well and I like it I like it quite
a bit even without a gloss or anything
over it um you know if you're looking to
just kind of test out a new color which
was what i was looking to do you know
for ninety-nine cents it's not quite as
much of a risk so anyway that is 510 a
from wet and wild and it's one of their
99 cent lipstick so just kind of wanted
to try a new color there so i like that
um another purchase i noticed that at
least in my walgreens there are a lot of
things that are being marked down i
don't know if it's because they're being
continued or just trying to get a new
shipment in and get rid of what's on the
shelves right now but one of those
things that was taken down from what
might originally be around four dollars
down to like a dollar and some change is
the Jane liquid liners this is Jane
endless eyes and the color is earth it's
just a deep brown shade it's actually
not the darkest brown ever it's sort of
like just like a true a true brown and
it's got a little like a long brush tip
there and I thought I was gonna like
this but I don't know it really on one
of my eyes it's stung a little bit when
I put it on and I know I wasn't getting
it in my eye I mean I put it where I
always put liquid liner so I found that
to be a little off-putting I've only
used this once so take it with a grain
of salt I mean maybe of my eyes were
just having a weird day although one
thing I can tell you for sure is that
the color goes on a little thin like if
you've ever used a liquid liner that was
not the best quality sometimes have to
go over it again and I don't really like
to do that because with some of the ones
i have like revlon colorstay i never
have to do that so i know that there is
you know high-quality liquid liners out
there this just does not have maybe
happen to be one of them so the endless
eyes liquid eyeliner in earth I'm not
getting it to higher marks but you know
maybe I should use a little more play
with it some more but initially the
initial reaction is not so hot there um
another lip gloss that I got a while
back from Revlon they have it says it's
a new shade and it's called life's a
peach it's one of their super lustrous
lip glosses which as you know I really
like they have a great texture they stay
on well they've got a nice range of
colors and this if you can see here is
kind of like a golden e um nude shade so
for those of you who enjoy nude glosses
you'll like that um don't know if you
can see the shade that i've swatched
there it's right under
the little streak of liner but really
does pick up the light beautifully and
it has a nice peach undertone so I think
that's going to be flattering on a lot
of skin tones even if maybe you have
really light skin and you think I don't
really wear nude shades that well but
this one I think could be pretty pretty
nice on most anyone so moving on kind of
a bargain alert here for those of you
who like to shop at sally beauty supply
and if you've been fans of like these
little eye shadows that they have four
ninety-nine cents well you may notice
some more things that they are offering
in that area and they have some trios of
eyeshadows they have some highlighters
bronzers and blush for between one and
two dollars and of course if you have
important note that I should have made
on both sat last Sally's video I did is
that if you have that card you can get a
really nice discount on some things like
knees instead of being a dollar they're
like 89 cents i believe so the the
discounts really add up um if you do
have that Sally's card which i believe
is like five dollars a year and you just
pay that amount upfront and then you can
just have them swipe the card whenever
you buy something so it's nice but this
is a like an example of the bronzing
powder it's like a matte bronzer this
one is in espresso and um it's got a
nice texture it's not so loosely milled
but you end up getting a dirty look on
your face it goes on sheer enough but
yet the matte matte bronzer is a
wonderful thing for a natural look and
then i got these shimmer stripes and
this is kind of the pinky toned one the
color is called LOL and you could i've
also used these individually as shadows
too so it's pretty it's kind of the like
I said the pinky huge kit and then I
just found this set really appealing
this is an example of one of the trio's
they have and this one is called high
life and it's got a plum and navy and
sort of a charcoal color / like an olive
green I tell you what if you guys saw
NYX Lake lost video this is just like
the colors in lake moss and I haven't
used it yet to be able to tell you if
it's as good a quality but if you want
something fast to duplicate that look
and you do have access to a Sally's the
trio and high life is very very similar
to those colors so I did the tutorial on
that and you could probably buy this and
try to use it for that so and another
thing that I got here is of course the
Max Factor 2000 calorie mascara it's
something I've used before and then kind
of tried a few different mascaras here
in the meantime and thought oh you know
I remember that one being really good
and it is it is very good at last a long
time without flaking gives good you know
body still lashes I like this brush it's
not huge but it's more of the
traditional brush which I think overall
I like better than the rubber brush but
that's just me so anyway thank you guys
so much for watching this haul video and
let me know if you have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
