is going great this is going to be kind
of an unexpected video I wasn't really
planning to stumble across the things
that I'm going to talk about in this
video but I'm really glad I found them
um there's a new store in my area called
five below I don't know how many of you
have one of those in your town but the
concept is that everything in the store
is five dollars or less so I was going
into it thinking it would be more like
kind of a Dollar General type experience
you know just a little bit of everything
in there and I really went in there to
see if they had any sort of selection of
beauty products so I did find some of
that stuff but on the whole I found it
to be a store that I think is really
geared toward kids and really the kinds
of things that I would classify as
impulse buys you know like they had a
small issue booty section they had a lot
of summery
outdoor type stuff we had a section of
like crafts and do-it-yourself kind of
home craft kits I guess some electronic
type things were in there a nice
selection of candy in fact I don't know
how long the jr. caramels or jr.
caramels have been around but these are
awesome um definitely a success but now
that we are out in our pool again I
definitely wanted to pick up some of the
awesome floaty type things they had they
had for five bucks this donut inner tube
which I absolutely had to have they had
them with pink or chocolate frosting and
also an inflatable unicorn inner tube
that was great we have already been
getting some good out of those items I
got some new goggles because I love
swimming laps that's like my favorite
form of exercise with some good stuff
and then as far as the beauty aisle
um I remembered seeing like a bunch of
sort of hair accessories hair brushes
like a massive amount of hair brushes
and actually I picked up a couple of
Clips these were gosh these are probably
just a dollar and like always clipping
my hair up into a bun and I'm using a
clip like this size it's always falling
down like what am I going to learn that
I need a bigger clip so I've had a
couple of bigger Clips Tyler actually
asked me to pick up a face wash but they
didn't have like a full skin care line
there was just you know a few face
scrubs here and there but it wasn't like
a full-on you know drugstore type
section of products if you know what I
mean but these for three dollars I
thought were so cute they're the Chapuys
Revo brand but these are miniature I
thought they were so cute they are in
watermelon strawberry and sherry and I
know I like the watermelon flavor of
these but I thought you know I don't
need these but I thought I might like
keep them in a guest bathroom at our
house or something that somebody might
want to use them again with the impulse
buys it's hard to resist pardon me one
second I've got to have the coffee this
morning and by the way you guys would
enjoy this shirt coffee blaze for makeup
they had the full selection of wet and
wild products they also had quite a few
different profusion palettes like those
are the palettes that you see in at
Walgreens usually around the holidays
they'll have some different ones and I
recognized some of those like they have
some naked ish type palettes in that
line and so some of those were there and
then I ran across city color and as soon
as I saw it I thought haven't I seen you
know some youtubers talking about this
like Bailey from making up the Midwest
and what I found was not the full line
of City colors I didn't see any lip
products but they had some different
face palettes and eye palettes so I just
picked up a few different things it's
not like a huge beauty haul here but I
was just excited about this stuff and I
wanted to share it with you and it's
probably the tip of the iceberg for what
I want to end up ultimately trying from
this brand first thing I don't know if
you've caught a glimpse of my swatches
here but it's a palette that is a whole
leg of a lot like the Naked palette
let's show the palette first
it's called barely exposed you can see
this has totally been fashioned after
the Naked palette it's got the same
amount of shades a lot of the same tones
in there these colors are definitely
smaller I think yeah
then my Naked palette I have my Naked
palette handy here by the way so you can
see the size comparison but you know
there are a couple of matte shades and
here some shimmery shades a couple of
shades with some sparkle and i swatched
the city color palette here on top so
you can see these actually have some
decent pigmentation I wasn't super
impressed with the match
which are here and here into a little
work for building up on the eyes but I
found the metallic and shimmery shades
to be quite soft actually and I think we
might have a few shade for shade dupes
here but I think it's the thought that
the overall color scheme if you got this
palette you would pretty much be able to
pull off the same kind of looks that you
would get with the Naked palette one
thing definitely that's lacking in this
city color palette is a really good
shade for half-baked which half-baked is
a great metallic gold and the one in the
city color palette right here is
definitely more sheer and I really was
not expecting to find shades that were
that pigmented so I was happy with that
and I'm wearing this on my eyes today
including a super dramatic laughs I
think these are my Coco lashes in Misha
I've worn these before but I didn't
remember him being quite this big but
I've got a little bit of this super
shimmery shade like on the inner part of
the lid what else did I do I put this
kind of metallic taupey color all over
the rest of the lid some of this darkest
shade on my outer corner blended a
little bit of the matte Brown where's
that right here in my crease I also
smudged a lot of this shade and the
darkest shade on the lower lash line as
well but you know totally workable look
these shades were really pretty easy to
work with
like I said would like to have seen a
little bit more out of the matte so
really it would be fun to do like one
eye with Naked palette one eye with this
and see if you guys could tell the
difference another thing they had is
this massive bronzer blush and highlight
palette it's called Sunkist trio and I
have it in bronzed peach and they had
quite a few different color options here
just to show you how big this is like I
find certain wet-and-wild palettes to be
kind of large but this is definitely
bigger than that and I appreciate that
in a palette like this because if you're
using a larger brush with your bronzer
let's say you can totally fit it in
there no problem so I am wearing this
today and allow me to quickly remove
some swatches so I can swatch these
products you've got the peach blush
which comes off kind of matte and then a
satiny finish here with the bronzer and
a highlight that's definitely pretty
glowy but there's a wonderful softness
to these colors pertick
the bronzer and the highlight I was
really impressed with those and the
bronzer is kind of warm as you can see
so it's definitely the kind of thing I'm
using as a true bronzer you know kind of
lightly all over the face to give my
skin a little extra glow and I like it
that way
nice bronzer for the body as well gives
a nice kind of natural tan a little bit
glowy look but not too much so did I say
I am only wearing the bronzer and the
highlight from this kit and then I
wanted to try out the matte blushes boom
they had even more of these than the
ones I picked up I'm totally wanting to
go back for more not that I need any
more blush but I mean these were awesome
I went with one shade that I thought
looked kind of subtle and you know I
wasn't sure what I would end up getting
out of it and then one that looked
really bright to kind of see what this
blush line was made of so this bright
one is called dragon fruit and very
smooth not a bit of shimmer in this just
a totally bright cool pink blush and
then the one I'm wearing today is this
shade called black berry and this seemed
rather cool to me as well almost verging
on a neutral type of blush and here's a
swatch of that and I think it still
looks pretty you know true to the color
and the pan just in that swatch but on
my cheeks I thought it really warmed up
quite a bit more this is the shade I'm
wearing today and it seemed a lot more
like warm and rosy than I was expecting
so this color sheared out is a little
bit different experience than what
you're looking at here just in the solid
product overall these are so soft you
know such bright bold types of blushes
they had a lot of pretty coral shades
definitely some other tones I would be
interested in just really pleased with
everything I picked up from city color
that really prompted me to want to hop
on and just share this video with you if
you've got a five below store you might
want to check them out because none of
this stuff was over five dollars I have
looked at the city color website as well
and some of these things are selling
they like the same stuff for example
this palette was selling on the website
for more expensive than I got it at the
five below store but thank you guys so
much for watching this video just a
little heads up on some of my latest
finds my
video will probably be a best in beauty
for the month so some current favorite
products so stay tuned for that thank
you so much and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
