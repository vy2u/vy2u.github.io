I am just enjoying this day so much so
far beautiful blue skies out my window
the birds are chirping spring is coming
I think this time and oh I just wanted
to tell you guys thank you so much for
the super super kind amazing response to
my last video Tyler and I are just so
excited and I mean I said it on my blog
I know I have the nicest viewers ever
but serious just so kind I mean your
comments just make me want to give you a
big big hug you have no idea so thank
you so much and as for this video you
guys know I love finding those diamonds
in the rough in the drugstore I mean
that is probably the most exciting thing
about makeup to me it has been since
back in the day and it continues to be
that way like I love just discovering
some little product here there that
works amazing and is at a really really
cheap price on this haul I've got some
elf some NYC some random stuff but
nothing's over $5 which i think is
really fun part of what spurred this on
with some of the NYC stuff I had is that
I ran across this video I'm going to
link to it below but randomly found this
video on YouTube of a girl doing a
gorgeous eye tutorial with one of these
individualized pallets from NYC now I
swear you I remember getting these like
years ago when they first came out and
these were probably my most hated like
eye makeup product in my collection
there's cream stuff in here like a cream
base that was so dry like you couldn't
get product off of it and in fact it was
so dry like the pan just the product
itself like fell out every time I opened
it the shadows were not pigmented it all
really chalky and then I randomly run
across this girl doing a tutorial with
this palette and I'm like that looks
like a different product if she is you
know it's looking gorgeous and I had a
hunch that maybe some NYC stuff was
getting reformulated because I had
gotten more recently a couple of trios
that I had been pretty impressed with
after seeing the video with this I just
knew I had to give it a second shot I
didn't even have the
old ones that I started out with I mean
I chucked him I didn't want to even give
those to anybody I did not think they
were good at all but I can definitely
see some differences in these that's my
whole point of this whole big long brand
boy I want to show you the ones that I
got and I'll cut to some close-ups and
swatches but the one that was used in
that video I said I found was the one in
Union Square and these will say like
created for brown eyes blue eyes
whatever hazel eyes I think anybody can
use anything I've always thought that
with these different combos but this one
has your primer like a cream illuminator
and then your shadows are a matte cream
a matte medium brown a bronze and a plum
really surprised by how nicely they go
on I mean I don't find them to be as
intense as a wet and wild shadow but
they're very much more pigmented than I
ever remember them being and in the
picture you're seeing the swatch is not
on top of the base I just wanted to show
you how these powders are as is there's
also a smokey selection I got the smokey
ones for brown eyes and it's just called
smoky Brown your black kind of a grayish
plum color which I did a one shadow look
with not too long ago really like that
sort of the silvery taupe and then a
real true like silver color and again
with the highlight and the primer
there's little trays that sit over these
when you buy them too and it points out
where to put them on your eyes but
there's also a little graphic on the
back I'm really excited to try these
some more and just really glad that
they've made some improvements to those
products and making plans for an NYC one
brand tutorial in the future so that
explains some of these other things that
I picked up - I got the mosaic face
powder color wheel in the all-over
bronze glow and really from NYC you know
I really like the NYC sunny that's kind
of a light matte bronzer from this line
but I never tried this one and it is
much deeper I used it today for you know
a little bit of a contour here and there
and I really enjoy it totally matte but
definitely darker than sunny so that was
good to try and then one that I haven't
worn yet and this seems to be a new one
in the line is this color wheel and
bronzed pink and there are some of these
that are blushes this one seems to be
like something that's probably a
very neutral blush if at all it might
just come off like a light bronzer I'm
not sure have like some of the blush
tones of these that I have there's a
rosy one and a pink one so I'm excited
to try that about another product that I
really kind of resented from NYC for a
while these cheek glows with the
exception of like one or two limited
edition ones that came out and I thought
were exceptionally nice these I had
never really had a thing for but again
it had been years since I bought one so
I picked up a couple of these at least
in the line seemed to be very cold like
all the colors seemed pretty muted so I
have Riverside rose and that's the one
that I am wearing on my cheeks today and
I think you can probably pick up on some
of the color that's there but it's a
very very soft shade and I think on
deeper skin I don't think it would come
off very well it might just look kind of
chalky and light but like even on a
swatch on my finger it barely shows so
that blush is kind of I think along the
lines of what I remembered these to be
you know they show up a little but not
super pigmented and then the other one I
got is Westside wine and this one if you
watch Beauty broadcasts live last week I
did a half-and-half comparison of this
and benefits Dallas on my other side
this is kind of like a neutrally plummy
but like soft plum blush if any of that
makes sense and I like the appearance of
this I think this is really pretty and
it's not a shade that I would glance at
and be like oh that's gonna be stunning
you know I really think that one comes
off nicely so if I had to go between the
two I think I like the west side wine a
little bit better a few other things
real quickly I picked up one of the
smooth skin and liquid makeups with
vitamins A and E I've used this a couple
times since getting it
one thing with it is it's one of those
thick like creamy foundations so yeah
don't freak out but nothing's gonna be
rolling out of there anytime soon so I
got to go in there with like a q-tip or
a little spatula to get some out don't
love this foundation because I don't
think it gives the flawless coverage
that says on the bottle but I do like it
leaps and bounds more than the one
that's in the squeezy tube that I've had
whoa just lust the skin matching one I
did not like the way this looked on my
skin at all it's like it's set on top of
the skin it looks super visible it
didn't like blend in nicely so this I do
like better than that other one says for
all skin types oil-free so more testing
will be done on that another face
product is this concealer stick and it's
set on the packaging with vitamin E and
yeah it just seems like a classic
concealer stick but it's much much
creamier than I remembered this being
this was another one of those products
that like seriously way back in the day
I remembered using and it's much
smoother creamier I mean I applying
hardly any pressure I'm getting a lot of
creamy product off of there and the only
shade that I saw of this in Target was
light and so I used it today I used it
like a brightener though under eye area
down the nose kind of like a
highlighting type thing but you know
it's not shiny by any means but yeah
that'll be something to work into a one
brand tutorial or a review also this lip
color they've got some new lipsticks and
this is the expert last lip color in air
kiss and I believe they are all packaged
with this color and so this one does
happen to like exactly match the
lipstick but I think they're all pink on
the bottom and this is what the shade
looks like it's really a bright bold
pink there's no shimmer in it this is
the look that it gave me on my lips this
was one pass over my lips so I was
pretty pleased with how nicely it was
gliding on it was going very full color
right away and it doesn't feel super
drying I've only had this on for maybe
an hour and a half so far and I still
feel like there's some moisture there on
my lips but it's not something that
shows up with a ton of shine so just be
aware of that but I would totally like
to try some more shades of this I live
from this NYC batch I got one of these
Sparkle I dusts this is not the first
one of these that I've tried and I felt
kind of silly getting another one
because the one that I had before it was
a gorgeous shade like kind of a topi
purple lilac kind of color it was
beautiful but Syria
when I would unscrew the top the little
particles of the powder would go
airborne and this one does that a little
bit too so I don't know what I was
expecting like it's the same kind of
product just a different shade it's
probably gonna do the same thing but it
is so pretty and the other one's really
pretty too this is the golden champagne
and so while I don't love like maybe the
packaging method or the way it comes out
I do really like the way it looks I mean
I just dabbed it on my eye and then I
used my finger to like blend it out that
was it and then I put in my crease this
matte Brown from this compact could not
be easier
like easiest I look ever I love it also
got some things from ELF that I want to
share with you so nothing over five
dollars wait oh there might be these
things that are actually priced at $6
but I use the elf Studio like there was
a half off thing on elf studio products
so I technically got them for three but
I'll mention them in this video because
I have been asked about some of this
stuff but first off these pressed
mineral blushes love these did a full
review on the Express channel I have
Cabo cabana which is a kind of a little
bit deeper peach shade with a little bit
of golden shimmer in there but overall
like on the cheeks I think it comes off
kind of matte and really fabulous smooth
textures on these like I'm so impressed
and I really like the mineral press
eyeshadows that they're doing - but this
is jetsedder kind of a classic rose
there are only four shades in the line
but these two are definitely like kind
of the middle of the road you know not
too bright very natural seaming colors
so I love these I love love love them oh
boy I also picked up the smudge pots
I remember when an elf like Instagram
the day these were coming out and there
was so much excitement about them and I
guess they're elfs take on like a long
wearing cream shadow and I've not yet
worn these on my eyes but I'm very
excited to do so soon and judging by my
swatches they seem to set to an
absolutely like you can't rub them off
type of finish except for one the one
that seems to like it does set but it's
just not as long wearing and it's like
it's got maybe a little more like
sparkly filler in it is
this pink one that I have this is called
ain't that sweet that's the name and
it's a light shimmery pink so that's
been the one that I've identified a bit
of a thing with but I've got to wear
them on my eyes before I can really say
much but I got that one I got back to
basics which is like a gold everything
so gold any bronze brownie points is
this pretty like Capri shade it's like
the color of an old penny I guess that
doesn't sound too great when it gets out
of my mouth but I mean it does remind me
of a pin and then this taupe shade is
called cruisin chic and that's you know
your classic tote so I am totally gonna
be using this some more and doing a
review for ya I was gonna say Anya but
for for you on me it's very similar new
things and you can always check if you
want to see what's new from ELF they
have a new tab on the website and it
seems like there is continuously
something new other things I got were
the waterproof eyeliner pins love to
test out a pen form liner and I feel
like I have run across some good ones
from the drugstore but I got them in
black and midnight so black you guessed
it it's black and then midnight is a
navy blue and when I've used these the
navy is much more saturated and rich and
deep than the black is the black comes
out a little watery for me and I've been
storing them just kind of flat you know
the same way I store most things like
this but the midnight I'm really liking
and that's what I'm wearing is my liner
today the one thing about it is if you
expect a lot of blue out of that Navy
you you don't get a ton of blue it's one
of those really close to black navy blue
tight colors another new thing are the
loose eyeshadows something I've seen
from different brands here and there I
think I have something from Malley like
this but it's like a spring loaded
applicator that goes down into the
product so here's your product now on
the bottom of this cap and this twists
in and it stays there and picks up some
product and as your product goes down
because this is kind of on a spring this
will continue to be able to pick up
product as you
but I'm pretty impressed with the
quality of these actual with shadow for
being kind of a loose shadow pressed
down in there I love how non flaky these
are I've gotten some really cute looks
with this one which is kind of like a
silvery taupe color that's called rock
candy but my favorite one that I have is
pair those two together is like a really
pretty fresh look and the third one I
got is peach pie and that's a you know
kind of a copper shade but there's a
question for me though is will the
packaging hold up because do you see
what's happening already with this one
this was like the first time I twisted
it on maybe you can't see but it's
cracked totally cracked like the first
time I twisted it back in you know my
Popeye powers kicked in and I just broke
the thing so I hope my other ones don't
break because if that all snaps off then
this isn't gonna all hold together so we
will see I'll review those when I feel
like I know what they're gonna do and
then just a quick mention for those
things that are technically six dollars
but I got him half off so we'll give him
a shout-out here it's the elf
moisturizing foundation stick I've had
so many questions about this since it
came out I got it
in natural it's a dead-on skin tone
match for me I'm so excited I'm not
always very good at picking out my tone
from elfs website but this works really
well for me and the reason why this
product was so exciting to me is because
I love the daily moisture stick which is
a colorless just like moisture booster
type product that you can use throughout
the day on your skin and this has not
all but some of the same ingredients
that are listed it has shea vitamin E
cocoa grape avocado macadamia aloe and
it's got pretty good coverage I'm still
trying to get a feel for the staying
power of it but it's very creamy and
really easy to blend in so excited about
that hydrating face primer it's from the
studio line it says fills in lines
moisturizes and nourishes so can't
really say much about this yet haven't
used it but I definitely will soon and
then drumroll this cool thing that they
came out with is this blush palette and
I got it in light and dark guess what
the
Dark One came completely shattered like
made a total mess in the bag just
keeping my fingers crossed when I saw
that nest that they weren't both damaged
and the light one no problems here so I
haven't used these yet but look at the
shades we've got it looks like three
matte colors right here and this one has
a little bit of sparkle so coral bright
pink light pink kind of a gold any more
bronzy tone color but these do pop out
let me see if I can successfully do that
do they pop out yes okay they do so I'm
not sure if they're gonna be selling
these in singles so you can start doing
some mix-and-match types - I love that
the shades are like so concentrated they
seem really nice and bright and
pigmented and like I said not a lot of
shimmer involved in these which is fun
to see and a great big mirror there too
which is nice so that's my big old
bargain haul guys definitely reviews
tutorials coming with some of this stuff
but I wanted to give you a heads up on
what I've got and it's just always fun
to have a good cheap poll every so often
so thank you for watching I will see you
again soon and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
