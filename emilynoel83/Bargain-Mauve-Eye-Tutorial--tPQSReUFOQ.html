you how to do a really wearable mauve
look so mob is just a kind of toned down
pinky shade kind of with some Browns
involved as well I'm going to be using a
very inexpensive palette from wet and
wild so if you're interested in seeing
how to achieve this I look keep watching
okay first step we're going to prime our
eyelid with the primer of your choice I
want to give this shadow that I'm
putting on my lid a little extra help to
kind of stand out and be light and
shimmery so I'm going to use this shadow
magnet from be luscious and my shade
that I have it in is light and so I'm
just going to put a really light layer
of that all over my lid and just blend
whatever excess that's on your lid kind
of blend it up into the crease okay next
step we're going to grab our wet and
wild mega eyes trio okay so they look
like this they have these little mirrors
that pop out on the side like that so
that's kind of cool um this shade set is
I believe it's Mojave moves so mobs
generally if you're not real familiar
with what that kind of shade is you know
it's just kind of like a dusty sort of
dirty pink shade kind of and I'm going
to use this top shade which is like a
light shimmery pink in this set and i'm
taking my ELF I shadow brush and I'm
just packing that on top of the primer
they're just giving ourselves a nice
light base to work off of just like so
keep building it to be the intensity you
want it to be okay alright next I'm
going to grab my Sonia Kashuk medium
shadow brush and I'm going to use this
pretty taupe shade down here at the
bottom it's maybe got a little you know
it's kind of like a brownish with hints
of gray to it and I'm going to just dip
into that which is it's a really nice
soft shade it's not like chalky it's
really kind of nicely pigmented actually
and so then I'm just going to apply that
right there in my crease
this is maybe one of my favorite taupe
shade surprisingly so just pack it right
there into your crease and you've got a
nice like that could be your stopping
point if you didn't want to go any
darker oftentimes you know mum my looks
that I do on my eyes are kind of like
that you know if it's too intense for
you and you look at the finished look
you know go back watch the video and see
okay could I just take it to that point
for daytime and that would be you know
just fine although I think this whole
look it would be appropriate for a
daytime daytime look with like a little
bit of a glamorous touch if you want to
add the false lashes then i'm taking my
sephora rounded crease brush and just
blending it out this is a bear brush
like I kind of blogged about how these
you know just using a bear blending
brush gonna be a great key to getting
you know blending out harsh edges so now
we've just deepened that subtly and the
next step taking my um this is my fine
crease brush form essence of beauty and
I'm going to go in for this deep mall
art from deep mob it's really more of a
maroonish mob shade here and I'm just
gonna pack that on my brush you don't to
work too hard because this really does
show up rather well and just start
working that into your crease it's kind
of like we're going between the taupe
and the light pink and just really
warming warming that whole area up there
and we're going to really subtly work it
out to an outer V here just kind of
working off of the corner of the eye the
top of the crease and move it out just
like that okay next step if you want to
go over that again with your rounded
crease brush or you may not necessarily
have the rounded crease brush but
whatever fluffy blending brush you have
and then just take that light pink that
will serve as our highlight once again
so you've really got everything you need
kind of nicely contained in this palette
you don't for this particular look you
don't really have to look any further in
terms of the shades
that you have and that's the shadow for
the liner I'm going to go ahead and use
this Revlon Colorstay liquid I pin which
still seems to be doing fairly well
again it's not quite the the darkness
level of the Revlon Colorstay regular
traditional liquid liner but you have to
kind of like go over your line just a
bit but really it's lasted me a long
time so I'm kind of impressed with it
it's easy to control like I've said in
the past so so there's your basic line
but for this we're going to go and glam
it up just a little bit and wing this
out just slightly by thickening the line
and just going out past our traditional
lash line there
ok and now once you look at that and you
see if you want to adjust your eyeshadow
based on that line because that's sort
of like we've created a new into our I
there so I might want to go back with
that darkest maroon shade we used in the
corner of this palette and sort of go
off of that a little bit more for that
darkest shade you know what I mean makes
it look a little more like that fits in
ok next for lower line are going to take
my revlon colorstay pencil liner in
blackberry just a tone sort of a plummy
burgundy tone that works out nicely with
this set of eyeshadow shades and we're
just kind of flicking it up to blend
with our liquid liner there that we
apply and then applying it just all the
way around our lower lash line next you
may want to kind of blend that out just
a bit to keep it to having sort of that
soft effect so I'm just taking a little
sponge tip smudger tip thing and then
I'm going to use my tackle on liner
brush angled liner brush from Coastal
Scents dip into that mauve color again
and you sort of use this as your top off
shade I think I might coin that term
your top off shade the shade that you
put over any lower liner to kind of set
it and finish that look and there you go
now we're going to move on to mascara
this looks going by really quickly it
tends to do that when all your stuffs
coming from one little manageable
palette I'm going to curl my eyelashes
hold it there for 15 seconds all right
for mascara I'm going to be using my
L'Oreal hit mascara on my top lashes and
then once i'm done with this this is
just kind of getting them ready for the
false lashes
um I'm going to use my Too Faced lash
injection on the bottom just because I
love the fact that you can wear that on
the bottom and it doesn't smudge
whatsoever very reliable in that respect
so I'm going to go ahead and apply that
and apply my lashes which will be the
Revlon fantasy lengths in defining it's
the less intense of the two that I have
and I'm going to be using glue to put
them on so it may take me a little bit
longer do that but I will because I've
used them several times with the
self-adhesive um so I'm going to go
ahead and apply those and then I'll join
you back here with the finish here's my
finished look it's just a really
wearable mom look that you could do just
about anything with I mean you can dress
it up with some false eyelashes like I
did or you could stop Midway and kind of
keep the darker tones out of it but it's
still just a really wearable really
really inexpensive look now if you're
wondering what's on my lips um scanning
my little table for it here we go um I
first put on my lips I use the volume XL
seduction plumping lip color you know
how I like the gloss and now i have the
lip color in in the nude number 6 20 so
it's a shade that looks like that I put
it all over and you can really feel the
tingle on that so if you're not a fan of
the tingle you know you can be aware you
can definitely feel that and then I
grabbed my Coastal Scents 32 color lip
palette and I used a couple of shades to
kind of top it off and sort of recreate
the mob look with this and they were
these two right here so this one's a
little more pinky or wait these two I
don't know if I pointed to the right
ones but this is a little more pinky and
this one's just a little darker that I
used kind of on the outer parts so um I
hope you guys like this look again very
easy to recreate and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
