to show you the basics of mineral makeup
application so I got some questions
about how do you you know apply this
step or that step and so I'm going to be
using um all bare minerals products but
you'll notice that like when you're plum
applying the powder foundation or a
bronzer type thing you know various
lines have those same sorts of products
and with bare minerals I happen to have
like concealers and bronzers and blush
so I just thought we'll just use all
that line and then you can kind of use
your own products or maybe if you have
these products it'll give you some ideas
on techniques of how to apply them so
right now I just have a moisturizer on
that said I know I'm on any eye or lip
makeup on because I usually go ahead and
do my face first so I'm going to start
out I have to bare minerals foundation
shades one is in medium and one is
medium beige so I'm going to go ahead
and start off I do use both of the
colors because I think they both work I
think medium is maybe a little bit has a
little bit more of a I don't want to say
rose because it's really not rosy but um
medium beige is more golden than medium
is so I tend to use that all over my
face and I want to use their flawless
face brush this would be a step where
you could use a big kabuki brush as well
and I just kept some into my lid and I'm
going to swirl it around and I didn't
tap a whole lot as you can see I tapped
whatever I could pick up with my brush
and then I'm just going
I swirl this around all over my face I'm
not really paying any attention to one
area in particular right now I'm just
trying to get it all over and I'm going
to repeat that step a couple times so I
can build up my coverage and if you can
see that's about how much I've tapped
out you don't want to go too overboard
because um you'll find if you are laying
on too much mental makeup your face will
start to feel oily as the day goes on so
just be aware of that you know just use
what you feel like you need to get the
coverage you want and so I go all over
with that with this flawless application
brush and then I'm going to go ahead and
switch over to my medium shade because I
feel like it's maybe just a hair lighter
on me and then do the same technique I'm
just going to tap a little bit out and
I'm going to use my handy Buki brush and
this is just a a more dense kabuki okay
like it's if you have you know a kabuki
brush what you can actually do is if
you're you if you have one you can
almost hold it so the you know the
bristles are a little more dense but
anyway I'm gonna do some a swirl it get
all that product worked up in my brush
and then I target some places where I
want more coverage because any time
basically keep in mind the smaller the
brush you use basically the more
coverage you're going to get with it so
you can see I'm really getting around my
eyes and around my nose just trying to
even out areas where there might be a
little
redness or anything like that not
necessarily going all over my face I'm
going to go back and do one more layer
that and get right in here areas tend to
have darkness or anything like I said if
this is the slightly lighter foundation
shade and that's one thing I like about
bare minerals is when you get it they
will give you two foundation shades like
if you get the kit and so that gives you
a little bit more freedom when you're
mixing and doing things like that so
okay next I'm going to move on to bisque
and bisque or summer bisque I have both
I'm just going to go ahead and use
bisque right now this is what they call
their multitasking minerals and this is
great as a concealer on a minute just
tap a little bit off into my lid here to
show you I'm not sure how well you can
see this but oh cause it's all like
shifting as I turn it but the little
particles in this are not as fine as in
the foundation so that means when you
put this on your face you're going to
get more coverage with it so that's why
it's works so great as concealer I'm
going to take my concealer brush my bare
minerals concealer brush I'm just gonna
pack some on there and I'm going to
really target my under eye area you will
be amazed at the coverage you can get
with this like for people who say you
know I like bare minerals but it's not
enough coverage I really wish they just
made bisque part of the you know the
actual kit because the coverage I mean
you can see what what's starting to take
shape here as I work it in under my eye
and kind of right
top of my cheek here you can see the
difference kind of in both in both eyes
I'm going to go to the other side now
and as you can see I'm just kind of
patting it in and and blending not
really sticking to any sort of circular
motion idea here but but working in
around the corner I had to ride up to
under my lashes because you can be have
sort of a different coloring all the way
to that point and also this works on the
broken capillaries hit that any little
blemishes you've got
so um really a great great product that
bear bear essential pads is the best so
if you have your full kit you're kind of
wanting something more out of it I would
suggest using that ok so then after I've
used that this is just me this is not
something that is like has to be done
obviously there aren't really rules here
but um what I would do next is go over
my face once more with my median beige
um Foundation shape just to pull all the
colors together since I've been using
several different shades on my face
already um this will kind of just like I
said pull it together and make the look
a little more consistent
okay so now the foundation application
is complete and we're going to move on
to a product that is pretty much
exclusively bare minerals um but it it
is something that you could find in
other lines but they call it warmth and
it's a little unique kind of bronzer
because it's a very deep color actually
for anyone who looked at it it may not
be a color you would typically picture
yourself wearing but you really use it
sparingly and it can be a great thing
for anyone so once again using my
flawless face brush and I'm just
starting right up in my hairline you'll
see I'm like right bordering on my hair
there because we don't want to look like
we're wearing a mask and if I had my
hair pulled back like this and I was out
on a summer day that's where the Sun
would start hitting me so we're just
going to go right down the nose and I
like to just work this color all over my
face but lightly
only place I really trying not to get it
is too much like right under my eye but
everywhere else is fair game for that
and then next I'm going to take a
product called so tan and this is
technically their bronzer this is quite
dark and it has a little bit of sparkle
in it
unlike warmth warmth is does not have
any sparkle to it I'm going to use my
soft focus face brush it's got like a
kind of a dual fibre brush and just get
it in there and then I'm going to once
again target areas where I would
normally apply bronzer and this can be a
great thing for contouring as well it is
on top of the cheeks brow bone is a
great spot for a product like this and
also kind of work it down in here if
you're wanting to sort of draw in your
cheeks kind of slim the face a little
bit you can do that as well
alright so there's that all-over face
color and then another thing you can do
is apply blush and they have soft focus
Glee is sort of a blush shade that they
have is just kind of a nice neutral rosy
shade just really a healthy look and I
just apply that with my soft focus rush
the apples of my cheeks just like so and
then after that I'm just have one more
step and that's to apply my mineral veil
so this is a one of my favorite products
because it just makes everything you
vend your face look extremely pulled
together and I just tapped some of my
lid buff it around my face and there you
go that's all for a mineral makeup
application it's really natural but it's
definitely a great look for somebody
that wants to keep their skin healthy
and very natural Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
