me for my valentines tutorial um this
year I wanted to do something extremely
feminine that didn't really necessarily
make your significant other at least
this is the vision I have it doesn't
make them see you and just think wow
that's some really intricate eyeshadow
or really point to just one thing but
just make you look pretty I'm using a
palette that I really really love it's
the Urban Decay feminine palette and
this palette can do a lot of things
we're keeping it really really simple
with the eyeshadow really honing in on
this pink color which i think is
gorgeous not a complicated eyeshadow
look at all where you are rocking some
great liner and lashes with a fun little
trick that I've added in and I hope you
enjoy the look I'm going to take my put
a lid on it I primer and this is a new
product from the balm it's got a real um
kind of super silky texture to it so
it's a little bit different than some of
my other eye primers so I've been kind
of testing that out lately liking how it
works so far then i'm using this pinky
shade in the Urban Decay feminine
palette it's called bordello I'm patting
this all over my lid from the very inner
corner all the way across here I feel
like when this shade catches the light
it seems lighter and brighter but and if
it's in a more shaded area it can seem a
little bit more like a mid toned color
so we're going to play with that fact
and take a little more of that shade and
pull it up into our crease just a little
bit and it's just going to create a
natural shadow effect here then take a
fluffy brush and just blend that out
next I'm going to this shape called
skimp with another fluffy brush and this
is going to be our under the brow
highlight so just kind of follow the
brow and give it a little bit of
brightness there then using skimp again
we're just going to pop this on the
center of the list would naturally kind
of catch the light and so we're going to
brighten that up even more just with a
little bit of that pearl ey to come back
to shadows in a minute but first going
to move on to eyeliner and i'm using
this Milani ultrafine liquid eyeliner in
black vinyl really like this new
eyeliner from Milani it's got a nice
fine tip but it's definitely something
that does not smudge away or fade away
I'm going to take that from my inner
corner once we get to the outer edge
here as you can see when you look at the
finish side we're doing a slightly
dramatic wing I mean it could be bigger
and the the big lashes kind of make it
fit in to the whole look a little bit
more but we are going to go out just a
little ways here so basically i'm going
to start and just kind of go outward and
get my initial line that's about how far
out we're going then i go from the very
very corner of my eye okay right in the
corner draw up to that end result is
kind of like a little triangle and then
you just want to fill it in next I'm
going to line my waterline with
Maybelline master drama midnight masters
gently go all the way in that inner rim
and then also try to get right in
between the outer lashes we're focusing
just on the outer corner and kind of
smudge it a little bit before it sets
next we're going to bring in some more
shadow but use it in a little different
way I'm going down here to gunmetal some
of that up with an angled liner brush
we're going to go about to our midway
point here where our liner is and going
to draw right on top of that with this
gray of course the liquid is dry now and
then we're going to go right under it so
you can see why we're using a precise
angled brush for the gives it a little
different look than just the classic you
know black wing that we're used to
seeing continue that gray right under
the eye overlapping where we did that
liner smudge and take it about halfway
in lean out the brush a little bit and
then
hang up some of the bordello that's that
pink and kind of coming in to meet it
from the inside next I'm just curling my
lashes lying some of this colossal cat
eyes mascara not exactly wild about this
mascara but I do like the shortness of
the bristles on this brush and it's just
real easy to maneuver and i'm doing
maybelline lash discovery mascara on the
lower lashes lashes i'm using are the
salon perfect demi-wedge feet i've
applied some revlon precision lash glue
to the band you can see it there it's
had about 30 to 45 seconds to get a
little bit tacky and now i'm just going
to hold these right in the middle and
align them with the center of my eye
right on the lash line right along that
liquid eyeliner that we first applied so
we're just going to set those on here
and then we sort of a fix the outside
and right in here as well and then
you're just going to gently press make
sure the entire band is it basically in
touch with some skin there and then I
like to kind of blink on to my finger
and you make sure those lashes dry in a
nice upright way then just a little more
mascara not much just I practically blot
it on just to blend the real and the
fake lashes so I hope you like to look
I've always been a fan of just in
clothing kind of like how I'm wearing
today you know pink and then black and
charcoal gray I love the pairing of a
really you know sweet innocent color
with something a little bit deepest for
what I did on my cheeks I actually
contour it a little bit with this
covergirl cheekers color and Sierra
sands and then I used my down boy blush
from the balm which i think is a really
nice fresh pink color with the lips the
shade I used is one of the color
whispers and it's lust for blood I
wanted to make the lips look you know
kind of soft and kissable not an
approachable or loaded with goop or
anything like that so this does feel
really soft and light on the lips but to
give the lips a little more of a pop and
a look of fullness I took my mary-lou
manizer
highlight from the bomb it's a really
highly shimmery highlight when you apply
it very concentrated and I put it right
here above the Cupid's bow really easy
trick to make the lips look even more
kind of Russian full thank you so much
for watching I hope you have a happy
Valentine's Day whether you're
celebrating it with someone or with
yourself I think it's still fun to get
glammed up no matter what so have a
great day and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
