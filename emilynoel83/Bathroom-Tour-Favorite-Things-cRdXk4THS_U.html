having a good day I was going to do a
shopping list ideas video today and I
wanted to base it all off of products in
my bathroom like from my shower or you
know different bath or hair products
that I really liked and then I thought
well why not just kind of do that but do
it like a bathroom tour as well so I'll
kind of go through the tour and point
out some of my favorite products hope
you'll join me as we enter the bathroom
alright here is my bathroom
it's actually an unusually long bathroom
as you walk in there's kind of a lot of
space here I really like it this is the
master bathroom in our house so as you
come in off the bedroom this is kind of
your view so kind of starting over here
just the windows and everything like
that I was really happy with the window
and also the shower treatments here they
came from JCPenney so I thought it was
just a really cute design so I have two
windows in here one over the tub here
and so it looks kind of dark you know
when you've got some light coming
through it like that but the brightness
over there kind of shows that they are a
true red color I also have these mats
that I amazingly found at Walmart that
are the right color of red and they also
have like some little golden flecks in
there too other decorations of note this
adorable little clock that I found at
Hobby Lobby I have a larger version of
this actually in my kit kind of in my
kitchen slash living room area but I
really really thought that was cute in
here and it just kind of fits the whole
decor I've also got above the bath this
is kind of my little bath product area
here I also got this little guy at Hobby
Lobby and something that I really like
there but the top is from be luscious
and they are the relaxing mineral salts
for the bath they just smell really
good kind of toss him in the bath and
yeah they just give off a really nice
relaxing aroma there so I keep some of
that stuff there these little candles
and mines those are actually flameless
candles from Target and that's where
those stands came from as well so I
really like those um as for the baths
everybody has to have a rubber ducky by
their bath right I also like a vino
stuff as you will definitely figure out
by the end of this video so I've gotten
a vino stress relief foaming bath there
again this towel thing also a Hobby
Lobby product and right and here this
door just off the bathroom area I have
done a video on my closet before but
just to show you real quick I've got all
my shoes in here it's got a lot of space
which is a nice deviation from the
apartment I was in before but I'm able
to keep all my jewelry you know tights
and leggings and different things down
in these drawers I've got some sweaters
up here jackets for work you know
anchoring and stuff and basically all my
shirts just in color order there I've
got dresses over here and kind of belts
accessories and more necklaces right on
the back so if you want more detail on
this kind of stuff there is a separate
video for that but I really love this
closet and the ability to just spread
things out I mean it was something I
really never had before this moving into
this house for the closet if you turn
back this way kind of towards the main
door there's this real little skinny
door that actually can be like a nice
little linen closet here for the
bathroom but Tyler and I kind of call
this the drugstore because we also use
this space to just store you know any
unopened products you know stuff comes
in a two pack or a three pack and
there's something you haven't used yet
so toilet paper cotton balls random
stuff like that just keep that in here
and
got towels and washcloths and stuff up
there one thing I especially wanted to
point out something that is really one
of my favorite things for the bathroom
are these little towels and they are
called the Turbie twist and basically
you know how you put a towel on and you
you know wrap it wrap your hair up in it
this is way less bulky than you know
regular towel might be you can see it's
kind of oddly shaped it looks like a
little hood actually I'm having trouble
shooting it but basically you just put
this on and you twist the top part
around it goes through this little hole
there and I mean it really helps in the
drying process for your hair I like to
use those before you know I when I get
out of the shower before I go to bed
I've got like three of them in there and
some robes and other stuff yeah my heap
robe so hot I know but anyway that's a
little storage area and then over here
we had this big kind of expanse of bare
area here on this wall and before you
get to the sink and stuff and so I think
this may have been an area where someone
could have had a vanity or you know
something like that but since I've got
the makeup room going on I didn't really
need that so we have this super tall as
taller than me I think it's probably a 6
mm 6 feet tall or more and it's pretty
wide here but this is a fantastic
storage cabinet for basically all our
other stuff like hair stuff medicine
everything I'll kind of go through this
with you but this is what we the way we
arranged it you can set these shelves up
to be different heights if you want them
to be but I set it up so there are 1 2
so there are 8 different little areas
here and then I've kind of divided them
up with other organizers so these little
drawers that you might use for makeup
you know they work great in here as well
I've got this is kind of like the
medicines area or you know I can't I
just can't get Tyler
using these Hello Kitty band-aids I
don't know that just random you know
tylenol and stuff flossers and teeth
related stuff up top contacts and ice
stuff there on the bottom so down here
is where Tyler's got some of his cologne
stuff and I've got some of mine down
here I really like the Juicy Couture
scent because it reminds me it has a
really like lilac kind of smell so I
really like that I've got just a ton of
body sprays and right now for Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works the summer Vanilla's I
realized we may be getting out of that
season a little bit sometime soon but I
love the lemon I also like the forever
sunshine scent I've got some country
apple that I got in an outlet because I
understand that's not really being sold
much anymore and this is kind of neat
this is a cooling mist that was also
from a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works outlet store
and I've got a bunch of lotion and
different stuff there but those are a
few of my favorites right up front then
I've got this box just sort of sitting
on one of the shelves and if you pull it
out you can see a ton of styling tools
in here daily I used my Revlon
blow-dryer let's see it's the 1875 ionic
I don't know I don't usually blow dry my
hair a whole lot because I will
especially with my schedule I shower
before bed it cuts out some of the hair
drying time in the next morning so I
just kind of dry it real quick to get it
you know a little more body or whatever
and then I you know I'm ready to go this
curling iron I like a lot it's the it's
hot tools Helen of Troy I got it from
Sally's I think it was between 30 and 40
bucks and it's not a real wide one how
big is that I'm not sure maybe about an
inch yeah probably about an inch curling
iron and I like that just for the
day-to-day curling iron tasks and the
other thing I wanted to mention was any
neighbors straightener that I picked up
from Ulta it is the Bed Head
eco trip it's a really skinny one so I
can use that to straighten if I want to
or it's really really
it's prefer Li small and use it to like
curl the hair with the straightener as
well so I'm still not quite sure exactly
what I think about it I mean I've only
used it like twice so I don't really
want to tell you guys awesome or it
sucks yeah but I like it so far and I'll
probably tell you more about it later
down here I've got rollers I've got a
few different roller sets hot rollers
and clips and stuff you know I love the
velcro rollers so I got some of those in
there this is kind of my little velcro
roller caddy you know the clips and the
different sizes of rollers that's
probably what I use the most
although these hot rollers are nice as
well if you can you really have the time
to leave them in a long time that's kind
of my issue every now and then so that's
that side over here is where I've got my
hair stuff another one of these larger
three drawer things I've got some of
those goody things like you know the
spin pins and several different things I
actually still need to try those simple
styles like there's an updo tool and
stuff like that
I've got larger clips in this drawer
this little bitty clips and stuff in
this one up here I have bobby pins
elastic bands and down here are Clips
like that I'm not used with rollers also
just you know the flat clips that can
keep your hair from getting a dent in it
some some little flowers for your hair
and brushes and stuff like that on top
level I've got basically just a lot of
hair products and some of the things
that I'm really liking right now what I
mentioned in a previous shopping list
ideas video this guardian-angel heat
protectant blow out lotion is really
great before you blow-dry your hair this
is my favorite hairspray and I will
probably always have a big can of this
around from Tresemme the tray to spray
extra hold it just works really well
gives a nice fine mist I've got
different kinds of hairspray different
mousses and volumizing products and heat
protectant products also like products
for shine I've really enjoyed the john
frieda brilliant brunette
stuff also like this heat protectant
from beyond the zone available at
Sally's that turn up the heat spray down
here some skin things although I do use
a lot of my skincare products in my
makeup room but something I really like
and if you followed me on dailybooth
I'll have a link down in the sidebar to
that and lots of stuff but the Biore
Pore strips I do like those when I use
them every now and then I am actually
really pleased with the end result
these airbrush the salon airbrush legs
deep glow I really like those they're
nice especially if you're kind of like
you've got a had some sunless tanner on
and it's kind of like flaking off but
it's like or you know you just have
maybe some patchy areas for one reason
or another that really smoothes it out
and makes your legs look good
the Aveeno skin relief moisturizing
lotion if you have eczema I mean this
has worked well for me I'm not gonna say
it's gonna work well for everyone
obviously I mean that's like a medical
condition with severely dry skin but
this has worked well just in terms of
sensitive skin you want a good
moisturizing lotion that's been good for
me down here I've got a ton of sunless
tanning products other kinds of lotions
and yeah just this and that but a new
face sunless tanner that I've been
liking is from Lancome it's the flash
bronzer it's oil-free I got this not too
long ago wanted to try it out and I
really liked it um it has kind of a
actually like a creamy if I can show you
here sort of a creamy consistency there
but you can put it on before bed just
give it enough time to soak in I give it
a you know a couple hours before I go to
bed and you know you wake up you've got
a little more of a glow going on if you
like gradual tanning I'm enjoying the
Jergens natural glow foam I always think
that's a good one I also like the
L'Oreal sublime bronze tinted
self-tanning lotion I get the deep
because I think it just does more and I
like
it ok that's basically wraps up my big
storage cabinet there and then we move
over this way this is our sink area
that's Tyler sink over there this is the
one I use we've got this great bright
light that we got at Lowe's it actually
has kind of a dark wood finish there on
the back and it really does almost
simulate what the lighting is like at
the station when I'm getting ready there
so anyway got my Aveeno ultra calming
moisturizing cream cleanser first thing
I will wash my face with when I get up
small accessories here toothpastes are
using right now great to maintain white
teeth in between white strips or even if
you don't want to mess with the Wyss
white strips good whitening toothpaste
the crest 3d white um let's see yeah in
here what's in here nothing too exciting
spray bottles it said um cleaning stuff
down under that side in this top drawer
I use this quite a bit my deodorant of
choice is the secret send expressions
cocoa butter kiss smells great works
great for me okay
big big question lots of people ask
what's the best way to take off your
makeup or your eye makeup for me it is a
one step thing I take off my makeup with
the old lady daily facials cleansing
cloths I happen to have the ones for
sensitive skin because ever since eczema
issues you know I wanted to really use
sensitive stuff otherwise I usually
would use the oily to combo however they
also have dried and normal too but these
are really great little cloths keep them
in a little box like that that you know
sometimes they come with if you
initially buy them but they really suds
up they get rid of all my eye makeup
without irritating my eyes and I've
tried a bunch of generic kinds and I
seem to always have an issue with them
you know making my eyes burn so those
don't so I have used them religiously
for years
I love them going over here here's our
little scale our window the toilet is
actually gets its own special room
itself yeah nothing too awesome and
exciting in there it's just basically a
little extra room off the bathroom and
this is the shower it is clearly
separate from the bathtub and so yeah
just kind of a stand-up shower here okay
something that is awesome and something
one of my viewers she blogged about this
she's got a new blog and I will post a
link down below but she got me on to
this morning burst in shower facial I
use it Tyler uses it I tell you what it
looks about like peanut butter I can get
it out here okay it looks kind of like
peanut butter but it is a phenomenal
scrub you leave it on your skin for a
minute while you're in the shower the
warmth the heat the steam from the
shower
really activates it before you wash it
off after that minute you scrub a little
bit wash this off and your skin will
feel amazing I love that stuff I'm so
glad she recommended that and I like I
said links in this in the bottom info
bar Summa Tyler stuffs on my stuff this
L'Oreal vivre Pro glossy volume and not
especially loving that so I won't really
recommend it to you right now but the
Aveeno positively nourishing smoothing
body wash pomegranate and rice got nice
scrub it's not one of those super dense
scrubs like as dense as that morning
burst thing is but it does have kind of
a nice of balance because it gets foamy
and lathery but it also has that's you
know the little bit of grittiness in
there to kind of slough off dead skin
cells I've got a bunch hair stuff here
you know I love the Aussie 3 minute
miracle use that a couple times a week I
think I talked about this the last time
I did a what's in my shower and it's the
dial clean and soft soy and almond milk
such a soft slightly sweet but delicious
scent there I really
of that stuff so my razor choice is the
Schick intuition for sensitive skin does
a great job shaving my legs without
breaking me out or anything and this
little guy stands up here I got this
from Walmart pretty good a little stand
for if you do have one of these single
showers and you don't have tons of other
places to put things and got a couple
but you guys know me I gotta have a lot
of products everywhere so yeah anyway
yeah guys this is my bathroom it is one
of my favorite rooms in my house and I
hope you enjoyed this little tour if you
want if you have any questions about it
I mean let me know but I was happy to
show you around and I hope you enjoyed
some of my favorite products have a
great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
