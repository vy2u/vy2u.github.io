in for this video this one's going to be
kind of different because it's sort of
it's practically like a craft project
that relates to beauty and it's
something that I think all of us on
YouTube that actively like to watch or
make videos can really appreciate and I
want to just kind of preface it by
saying um as you many of you know I wake
up very early in the morning to do my
job which is the anchor of a morning
news program and I have to basically
wake up at one thirty in the morning and
that's when I start the very first thing
i do you after I get out of bed I take a
shower the night before to kind of
streamline things but then my god bed
wash my face and everything the first
thing I do is I sit down and do my
makeup and at one thirty in the morning
when the only thing on is the courtroom
shows and and you hear you know not a
lot of sounds around and you really feel
like you know on a weeknight that 130
you really like one of the only people
awake in the world that's at least the
way you feel anyway um because it is
very strange to be like starting your
day at that time of night so and anyway
when I sit down and I do my makeup it's
kind of hard I found it specially
starting out it's kind of hard to get
that feeling of you know even though I
love makeup and I always love doing
makeup at that time of the day I kind of
struggle that it's kind of like sitting
down here like my gosh you know this is
so early I really you know cannot get
into this can't get excited about it I
thought there's something wrong with
that you know um got great products here
a great collection um you know I'm going
on TV with this look you know I want to
be excited about it and I want to really
you know use my creativity to use my
creativity as best I can and you know
not let these sort of the hours and all
that craziness get to me so I created
what I call my beauty board and what
it is is basically a bulletin board mine
happens to be half bulletin board half
like dry-erase board and I put it right
up above my makeup mirror area and it's
just something that I have their kind of
for motivation I put you know my my
dry-erase side is kind of like a to-do
list of the videos that I'm doing so
kind of to keep track of my youtube
channel but the bulletin board side you
know I see a picture in a magazine that
really kind of inspires me or a look
that I want to try to do down the road
or just you know a nice picture that
kind of gets me in the thought of you
know where I want to go with my look I
have it on there just different tips or
I just think that I've accumulated over
time pertaining to make up you know and
i'll keep changing this and that's
what's fun about it is that this isn't
permanent it all changes with time and
um so I I would like to first before i
show you though challenge you guys after
you see this to make your own beauty
board and i can tell you you can get a
bulletin board for pretty cheap you can
get it for ten dollars or less at a
store like Target or Walmart or
something like that and just put it you
know hopefully you have some wall space
but you go just put it in a room where
it doesn't have to be the room where you
do your makeup but just a room where you
will see that in the morning when you
get up and it just really i don't know
kind of get you in the mode of makeup in
it it just helps you get excited about
what you're about to do when you have
that when you have that motivation and
you have the inspiration really to do it
and so i challenge you to get your
bulletin board put it together how you
want to do it and then what would be
really really awesome if you posted it
as a video response to this video and
then people could check it out and see
what we're all doing with our boards
it's kind of different and then you know
you could either you know just post some
pictures or something and kind of put
them in video form or you can just take
video of it and explain it to people I
just
that this would be a really fun thing
and I think it would be awesome if lots
of people got involved in it because I
think how fun would that be you know I
would really totally be into looking at
other people's things that they created
so let me go ahead and show you mine
here real quick this is what my board
looks like from a distance here as you
can see the left half is bulletin board
and the right half is kind of my I
bought this one from target and it has
like a little dry erase board side
that's also magnetic but to show you the
bulletin board side basically like I
love reading Allure magazine because it
has a lot of articles about makeup and
hair and beauty and things like that so
ok found this little article about
different kinds of brick red blush at
top one there is Revlon cream blush one
that I like to use but I really like
those shades so I mean like if you see
products that you think you want to buy
in the future you can snip it out and
and like I love that I look right there
I think like Carrie Underwood is I
always loved her makeup whenever I see
it in any of the magazines love this
girl's hair do whatever model that is
just different celebrities that share
you know what they do with their makeup
and I do I mean I just feel like like
what about how awesome is that smokey
eye you know like how fun it would it be
to recreate some of these and then you
could you know put a picture up do a
look and then say hey everybody this is
you know the look that I'm going after I
got my everyday minerals color chart
there it tells you the step-by-step way
to do the Mary Kay miracle said oh this
was a fun fact that I found 10 meant
that's the amount of minutes it took to
finish one I with the first eyelash
curler in 1923 so I remember that I look
up there whenever I curl my eyelashes
for 15 seconds and think what a holdup
man is taken forever can you believe
that somebody actually spent 10 minutes
per I but anyway that's just kind of my
bulletin board
side and then this other side just kind
of helps me keep track of what videos I
do I mean I do I have my building your
collection series question of the week
shopping list ideas and then I I keep
track of the request that sewn you guys
have put down and my writing isn't the
neatest on here but it's really cool
this one because it's got like these
little got magnets so you can put stuff
on I put up a little free sample of
something that came in the magazine
there too so i hope this gives you guys
some ideas of where you can go with this
and sort of what I'm talking about and I
hope this inspires you to do the same I
think you'll find you have a much more
fun experience when you're doing your
makeup when you have something like this
to to be there to motivate you so thanks
so much for watching and I hope you
