day this is gonna be an empties video I
haven't done an empties it feels like in
a really long time thank you Kristen for
this amazing bin I think of her every
time I put something in it and it's
always tricky because sometimes I'm just
in a rush and I know I inadvertently
throw something away that I meant to
save him the empties bin but I still got
a lot of things in here I think and it
was just something I wanted to get in
there before starting the Emily Awards
which will be starting very soon I do
those every January usually about mid
month or so I start working on them
after the holidays and they really take
a lot of time they especially take a lot
of strategic planning with a little one
around but you can plan to see those
very soon thank you to everybody who's
been interested and who's been asking
about them and this year I'm going to do
them with a little different twist
there's gonna be just something a little
bit different in the way I conveyed the
information to you I hope it makes it
even more like clean-cut and informative
and enjoyable anyway on with the empties
first thing I have here is actually an
empty pack of the salon perfect number
53 lashes and it was so funny I took
this full pack of 53 lashes to my
sister-in-law Amy's wedding I was doing
her makeup of course that was the plan
and then I ended up helping a few others
as well some people wanted help with
just their eyes or some lashes or
whatever and Amy had actually brought
like one pair of lashes she thought she
might want to use I had this style and
another style and it was like the whole
group kind of came around as I was like
sort of just placing them on there
without the glue to see how is it gonna
look and everybody was like weighing in
like whoo I like those no I like those
better and then this was the one it was
like I had a full panel of people
standing around saying oh yeah we like
the 53's the vest and these are actually
a really nice natural lash they're a
very good starter lash if you don't wear
a lot of false eyelashes because I think
they do add a little bit of length and
they have a little added length at the
outside and so I think while the girls
were looking at a me with these lashes
on it was like her eyes just look more
glamorous but you couldn't like pinpoint
like okay that's why they look so good
she has big beautiful blue eyes anyway
but these really framed the nice
and I think came off great in pictures
too needless to say by the end of that
little wedding makeup session all three
of the other scents got used on other
people as well so that was really fun
and I just thought I'd share that about
those um I have gone through another
covergirl super sizer mascara I talk
about this all the time probably doesn't
need much description but I do think it
is my current best mascara for my lashes
it really helps them hold the curl
builds length nicely and does so really
quickly as well this isn't a mascara
that I go back for coat after coat with
I really seem to be content with like
one coat on my lashes it really does a
lot of good things and I have a couple
of these they're my covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant that is my
favorite thing to wear on the lower lash
line it really does not move you can
definitely trust it there on your lower
lashes if that's a smudgy problem area
for you and I feel like these empties
have been maybe a full season in the
making I don't even know exactly how
many months it's been that I've been
collecting some things in here but like
I said then I've missed some stuff so
it's hard to be real accurate another
makeup thing that I feel like I go
through every couple months is a lash
glue so I have two of the Revlon
precision lash adhesive switch always
get a little gunky around the top if
you're not careful and I have a black
toned one as well and recently I had
gotten the duo glue I had mentioned the
duo glue with the wand and it's really
thin I can definitely tell the
difference between that and the Revlon
it doesn't dry as fast it doesn't go on
the lash band as evenly so I made a
point to repurchase like three of the
Revlon precision lash adhesives off of
drugstore.com
everybody's like I can't find that glue
anywhere and I'm having trouble finding
it like in my local drugstores too but
if you go to drugstore comm they always
have it there I have finished a NYX
control freak brow gel really great a
gel for hold so if you're using maybe a
pencil or a pomade or whatever it might
be that doesn't tend to keep help keep
your brows in place you put a little bit
of this on and it's like boom they're
set for the day and not everybody has
really like unruly brow hairs that want
to go everywhere but I do so that is
great great product for me you got this
elf waterproof eyeliner pen and I think
it
of the it's in black it was maybe one of
the lower costs I'm thinking two dollar
products off of elfs website and it just
dried up on me way way too fast like I
don't know what the deal was I stored it
in different ways I try to generally
store these pins flat because that was a
recommendation once given with the
Milani pens and it works great for most
pens that I have but this one just I
don't know what it is it just dried up
way too quick just not enough juice in
that pen I suppose I've gone through
another one of my liquid liners that I
love it's so loved there's no label on
it this is a Jordana color and the
liquid liner in black Envy just a very
simple traditional black liquid liner
what I love about it is that it's
waterproof it has a very fine tip it's a
little bitty brush but the brush hairs
don't like go out everywhere and cause
problems for you that way so it's a nice
quality brush it's really rich in black
and I've just gotten a real feel for it
like I can apply it so quickly with no
trouble that's actually another thing
I've ordered in multiples off of the
Jordana website because I just got
attached to it and I couldn't find it
anymore in the stores I went through an
itty-bitty benefit they're real mascara
this is the rubber wand mascara that has
if you look at the tip it's got like
little rubber Nubby's going everywhere
like in all directions right at the tip
and sometimes I feel like mini mascaras
can be as good as the full size but
other times I notice a big difference
and with this one I feel like the mini
is just not as good as the full-size I
think it's because this brush is so big
not entirely sure what the cause is
but I feel like this brush never picked
up as much product on it as the
full-size would another little mini that
I have had in my travel bag for a long
time and just recently drained it it's
the benefit Porefessional I like to just
keep some small size items in my travel
makeup bag so I don't have to think
about repacking every little thing every
time so as far as primer goes I can just
keep that in there and this is the kind
of primer and this has some thickness to
it I don't always feel the need to apply
it everywhere but kind of around the
nose area t-zone I do think it helps the
appearance of pores and also the
longevity of your makeup
in those places this is maybe not really
well definitely not makeup related but
this is my lansinoh HPA lanolin this is
for sword crack nipples breastfeeding
mamas you know what I'm talking about
I actually am still nursing bill I felt
very triumphant when we hit the year
mark because that was like a mental goal
and then we just kind of kept going
although it has lessened quite a bit
it's not nearly as frequent as it used
to be obviously when that was her sole
source of nutrition but a few times a
day it's still happening and definitely
early on in the breastfeeding days I use
this a lot and it doesn't really always
take a lot but I remember when things
were very sore and I was looking up some
information about this online and it
advised to use it very generous amount
to help the healing and it really did
work so definitely a nursing mom must
have this could also double as lip balm
if you want it to and it's completely
hypoallergenic and natural so you don't
have to remove it prior to breastfeeding
also I've got several of these things
that I've held onto coz I've gone
through these well little cotton pads
and this is completely thanks to my
friend Norma who watches me here on
YouTube and she's from Canada hi Norma
and she has sent me so many neat
Canadian Beauty goodies but these cotton
pads whoa these cotton pads are super
super soft and I'll use them sometimes
with my micellar waters like first thing
in the morning if I don't wash my face
in the sink I can easily use those
cleansing waters with one of these but
she also gave me this awesome little
holder which looks so cute here on my
vanity area I also used up a thing of
these Bioderma it says 25 makeup
removing wipes for sensitive skin so I
guess it's that Bioderma liquid format
just saturated onto some makeup wipes
and these worked really well and this
was another thing that I felt like I
could kind of use at the start of the
day to give my skin a clean slate I
didn't use them a lot for makeup removal
but the few times I did I really liked
how they didn't irritate my eyes at all
I still don't like wipes over my old
lady Lee facials cleansing gloss that's
just my personal preference because I
feel like those always take everything
off quicker easier just no problem but
as far as wipes go these were really
nice and something I don't have in here
to show you I have gone through
countless boxes of my equate hydrating
face wash cloths or the Olay version and
I wanted to let you know something I saw
something repackaged in at Walmart I
think it was Olay had their boxes of the
face wash cloths the kind that I talked
about where you get water on them and
they suds up they start dry though and I
think they had the sensitive version
maybe the hydrating or dry skin version
and then they had a new look to one of
the packages and it said something about
deep pore cleansing cloths so I picked
those up just to try them and see if
they were anything different and just in
case you're wondering they are the same
style of cloth as the kind that Olay
makes for oily to combo skin okay so
they look like they've got teeny tiny
blue dots on there and one side is a bit
more smooth and one side has some more
texture to it so in case you're all
about these kinds of cloths and you're
like me and thought oh I want to see
what those are like if you've tried the
kind for oily to combo skin it's the
same thing they do just have a more
intense scrubbing action maybe a little
bit more of like an exfoliating action
to these cloths than the sensitive ones
definitely more than the sensitive ones
and more than the hydrating ones we have
finished off one of these suave naturals
almond verbena two-in-one shampoo and
conditioners I love this this was the
product that brought my hair back from
that oddly and I think it might have
been a hormonal issue but my scalp was
getting very oily and I felt like
nothing I put on it I used all these
really clarifying things and I think I
definitely took my hair to the point
where I was stripping it too much and it
was over producing oil at one point and
then I don't know what it was but I just
decided I'm just gonna go with the
two-in-one it was almost a little
counterintuitive but this was cheap and
I was up for anything at the time and
this worked so well it brought back that
really nice and clean feeling to my hair
it smells amazing I really love this
product but I recently tried that
finesse that I talked about in the
Kardashian video the finesse two-in-one
moisturizing shampoo and conditioner
that I would say is an even richer
there I really love the just the
experience of putting it on and I might
like that one even better just this time
of year because everything's skin hair
nails that all kind of dries out a
little bit in the dry air but I really
like them both if you're looking for a
good like two-in-one shampoo conditioner
this one's awesome it's the almond
verbena I had tried an orange one that
they have in the two-in-one and it did
not perform the same on my hair I don't
know what the deal is this one says
infused with almond oil and vitamin E
and they don't all say that so I love
this one in particular we went through
one of these st. Ives even and bright
this is the pink lemon and mandarin
orange scrub for me I didn't love this
scrub it was the kind of face scrub
where I felt like there wasn't really
enough scrubbing action happening with
it and it has a little exfoliation
factor here on the back it puts it at
moderate I don't know it smelled good
really smells like invigorating and
sweet and fresh but it was the kind of
thing that I just kind of stopped using
after a while and Tyler basically took
it over and drained the thing another
thing that I keep in my travel bag that
I finally used up is this little elf
makeup remover pen this is basically
like a marker of makeup remover so if
you get a little speck of eyeliner
somewhere it shouldn't be or your
mascaras smudging you know you can just
use this really in pinpointed areas and
it removes the problem so I keep this
and some q-tips because I find this does
leave a little moisture on your skin so
you want to maybe dab over that area
with a q-tip or a tissue or something
just to pick up the excess moisture so
you don't end up with more smudges but I
do have some backups of this I think
it's a really nifty little product I
finished a couple of these Burt's Bees
lip shimmers now I'm not exactly sure
how old these are I don't know but I
just was looking at him recently and I'm
like it's time to go like they're
basically used up at one point in time I
guess I was just using these a whole lot
because I can see you know there's a
gaping hole and this one called nutmeg
which is kind of like a warm bronzy
color and then I also have this fig
which is kind of a deep mauve I think in
the past I was into using shimmery lip
products a little more than I
now although the nice thing about these
was that they weren't too terribly
frosty they're actually really pigmented
and I like that kind of slim design and
so I'm sure I took these with me on the
go a lot just because they are a very
easy quick application but it's time to
go and that is it that's all I have to
share right now with my empties thank
you so much for watching I am going to
get to work on the Emily awards and I
will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
