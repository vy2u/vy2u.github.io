this video is going to be kind of my
all-encompassing
holiday favorites type videos so I know
I have done a lot of individual product
reviews on the different holiday
palettes and sets here over the past
couple of months but I know what's
really helpful is when you start to get
right down to it and get your shopping
done you want to know which one of those
things was better than this other thing
so comparisons I do think really matter
if there continues to be holiday kits
here and there that I have missed in
this video on things that I still decide
I want to try I'm not gonna like refuse
to try them after this video I do want
to say to little announcements here for
things to come the things that won't be
in this video that will probably be
included in future videos number one NYX
has released a bunch of large pallets I
have them all I feel really good about a
lot of them actually but I haven't
gotten to actually try them and play
with them yet those will be talked about
in the future video also makeup
revolution I have a bunch of makeup
revolution pallets so that will be a
future video as well not included in
this video
I'm gonna jump in gonna try to keep my
descriptions quick because I know a lot
of these I have talked about before some
of them I haven't though and in the
second half of this video I will focus
on some under $25 favorites as well but
this first section like kind of my high
end favorites I'm gonna be recommending
them basically in the order that I like
them so number one number two really my
number one gift pick and it's so funny
because I think this was the first
holiday item I reviewed this year on my
channel it's from the balm and it's
called the in the balm of your hand
palette I set it in my review video and
I still stand by it I think this is one
of the best pallets the bulb has put out
in years basically what they're doing
here is making a pallet chock-full of
all kinds of things that already exist
in their lines so classic items like hot
mama blush and insane blush Vanna boy
blush Bahama Mama bronzer a couple of
their cream products you've got a cream
lipstick and something from the how
about them apples palette and then key
eyeshadows from like the Shady Lady
palettes the nude tude palette the Bon
Jovi palette it's great
like these are really awesome shades
also mary-lou manizer is in here as well
well the blushes are smaller than
full-size I still feel like they're
totally generously sized I love the
particulars shades that they've put in
here I really love that you've got like
a rose gold a dark plum kind of an army
green this can be I shadow or highlight
if you want it to be it's really
streamlined the packaging is adorable I
love that it includes like the Front's
of all kinds of classic products from
the balm the quality also from the
original products has not been watered
down to this palette it's all just
top-notch as with all of this stuff I
will link to the products below I will
link to any related review videos or
tutorials that I have below but this is
a total winner if you're a fan of the
balm and you already own a lot of these
things it's a great way to kind of have
it as a travel palette or if you're
trying to introduce somebody to this
awesome brand it would be a really nice
gift
another one of my tip top favorites you
guys probably could have guessed this
since I referenced it in so many videos
it's the Too Faced stardust palette by
Vegas nay this is an amazing palette I
know it's not part of Too Faced
technical holiday collection but spoiler
alert here there is nothing from that
collection in this video this is I think
the prize from Too Faced for this year
the quality of the shadows is great the
configuration of the shadows is amazing
it's a really well-thought-out palette I
don't feel like anything in here is
overly flakey hard to work with there's
no dud shades as I think I did find in
some of their holiday kits really hot
shades up here I know people love the
peachy like warm Brown thing that's in
here so you can really anchor your look
with those shades fun pops of purple
bronze gold there's a burgundy it's just
like my kind of shades in here I think
what also makes this special and highly
giftable is that this is basically a kit
so it comes with these really neat
little cards that give you ideas for
different looks you can do they are
shown in like step by step form so it
really makes it easy and that's
something I've totally used as I've
played with this palette and this is
like a $45 thing with more extras added
in you've got this nude beam glamour
dust which is super shimmery I hadn't
messed with this for the longest time
that I don't miss palette and is
gorgeous you've also got a shadow
insurance and a better
sex mascara so your eye look is pretty
much covered with this palette I love it
the other thing that's really right up
there for me with the Vegas name palette
in terms of eyeshadow is my lorac mega
Pro 2 I also have a full video on this
puppy this did not disappoint
at all I loved what's in here I love the
color selection you've got of course
your top two rows that are all matte
your bottom two rows they're all shimmer
some really unique shades thrown in here
I love the melon and tangerine and the
forest green that are going on in the
top row you've got really classic nice
light brown crease shades as well
lavender purple come to mama
I love those shades and then down in the
bottom some really neat things happening
with this olivine shade I did a tutorial
with that I loved it I was blown away by
that color for my metallic like bronzy
gold lover's penny is to die for I mean
the textures in here are great if you
love your lorac Pro palette and you
really want to expand your color
selection this I think is a must now
there is a neat little face palette that
really stood out to me as I was trying
different things this season and it's
the Beca afterglow palette this is so
nice for mixing and matching you got
your three shimmering skin perfectors
aka highlights you've got moonstone rose
golden topaz and then two of their
mineral blushes this is wild honey and
flower child everything in here in my
eyes is a winner like it's all usable
it's all able to be layered one on top
of the next you can get different looks
all the time no these are not huge pans
of product they are the size of like
their ombre Rouge or ombre nudes
eyeshadow palettes but I have not had
any problem getting a blush brush or a
highlight brush into these wild honey
will surprise you and knock your socks
off that is great with either of these
layered over the top I kind of look at
it this way this is my pure highlight
shade and these are kind of my blush
layering type colors and you can layer
these two blushes a lot of times what
I'll do is blend pure honey like all
over the cheek and then give flower
child as my little like fresh air kind
of pop on the cheek like I've just been
outside put it right on the Apple now my
lip kit I would say this is my lip kit
of the year this is from colour-pop and
this is the
Vixen lippie stix collection the lippie
stix
are really fun because when you get
these collections generally they give
you a variety of finishes to play with
so you've got that you've also got a
spectrum of shades and I will tell you
at first when i swatched all these down
on my hands when I first got them I
wasn't so sure
like I knew there were a couple that I
liked but the others were like okay I'll
have to see how those look on my lips
turns out I love them all today for my
look I really combined the lightest in
the darkest shades I used last call
which is a cream formula and this is
just sort of a soft pink a soft mauve
type shade really light though so I use
that all over the lips and then I
blended plastics which is this matte
shade really deep rich berry that's what
ends up giving me this slightly kind of
purply tone look to the lips and I love
that just to run you through the shades
individually last call as I said that
soft mob it's not like that little hint
of greyish look I don't want to say
there's gray in the color but you know
what I mean it's like more of a muted
mob it's not so like springy pink next
shade is ruffle the best way I could
describe that is a caramel color that's
a matte finish night owl is a cream
formula a really vivid like party
fuchsia type shade jingle they're giving
your red in here and they're giving it
to you in matte form love it very very
classic red really enjoy that shade 54
is a really rich berry and it's
pearlized in the finish and I love this
because I like getting to wear a little
bit of sparkle on my lips when it
doesn't come off completely frosty
looking or something where the whole lip
color is gonna wear off and I'm left
with glitter on my lips this isn't like
that sparkle is so fine and I think it
really makes this lip color appear even
more brilliant on the lips I really like
that actually that surprised me and then
plastics a matte formula thank you for
giving us matte on the darkest shade I
appreciate that and this is going to be
your purpley deep berry and I do think
these sets are kind of a nice
presentation there's where your products
that you also get a mirror and then they
just magnetized shut like that so that
is the Vixen set a little disclaimer for
this set would be if you're giving this
to someone who generally always likes to
stay
in the same kind of color family like
always where's nudes or always wears
like light pink or something like that
this may throw them out of their comfort
zone a little bit that may be a good
thing or a bad thing everybody's got
different preferences this one really
hit the adventurous color sweet spot for
me because I tried and reviewed the Kat
Von D studded kiss lips set which I
think went white on the other side for
me it was like a little too out there I
didn't see myself really getting a lot
of use out of those shades and then
there were a bunch of other lip kits
that bored the crap out of me so this
one really was the nice happy medium
here's a little something that just like
totally snuck into this video and after
seeing them and after trying them I'm
like yep this is a gift pic for sure
these new Sonia Kashuk brushes these are
from Target are these not the most
brilliantly designed brushes out there
oh love the gold listen the ferrule the
ferrule is wrapped in gold rings and
then on the handles you might be seeing
all these itty-bitty tiny gold stars but
there's no texture it's completely
smooth and then you've got this nice
like kind of end cap here with the SK
logo on the bottom this is just the four
piece brush set it's $29.99 there is a
larger set and I didn't love the handle
design as much I thought they looked
just a little bit cheaper they felt more
lightweight and I didn't find the whole
set to actually be as versatile even
though there were more precious in the
set I didn't like all of those brushes
as much as I liked 100% all four of
these and I will also point out that
there is a little brush cup as well same
design on here this is less than $20 it
might be a nice way to round out a gift
but that's what those look like sitting
in there now these do come too clean
I've been using these that's why they
look dirty um but this one great powder
brush bronzer is probably my favorite
way to use it I'm really kind of liking
a fuller brush now for bronzers and this
just makes it very easy really nice to
get on the body to down the neck this
brush to look at it you're gonna think
that's gonna be something really light
and fluffy this is dense as heck and I
think they called this like the tapered
foundation brush and I did use this for
my foundation all over my face today
it's so dense it's
so soft compare that to my up and up
round foundation brush see the size on
this this is like jumbo I could see
people just using this over their
concealer even using it as a contour all
of these brushes can go multiple
directions for you this one is my
favorite if this looks familiar
it's a lot like a brush from Tarte that
I have raved about it's kind of like a
flat brush it gets pinched in right here
at the ferrule so you turn it sideways
see how they kind of tip back like that
but there's all this surface area and
I've loved the Tarte brush for either
blending out concealer particularly
liquidy concealers or really liquidy
foundations this is a great brush to
just kind of stamp it all out really
maintain maximum coverage this is super
soft it's only a little bit smaller than
the Tarte ones so I love that that's in
here and then a brush unlike anything I
own this little guy this is a contour
brush and I did use this to sculpt out
my cheekbones today you could use it for
powder you could use it for cream you
could work it down the nose cheekbones
it's different it's fun it's not just
like that classic face brush set where
it's like okay you got your powder your
foundation blah blah blah like
everything in here is a little different
twist
maybe with exception of your full powder
brush all these others are really kind
of interesting and different and I have
one other little thing here that I want
to mention along the lines of a high-end
gift for someone I wanted to include
this because I thought it could really
be a nice gift for anyone and it's from
glossier and it's the moisturizing moon
mask this is my favorite mask it's so
cooling if you like your mask to be an
actual experience you just don't want to
feel like okay I currently have
something goopy on my face and I'm just
waiting to take it off before my skin
can feel good no your skin feels good
the entire time you're wearing this and
then even after you take it off more
moisturized skin smoother skin again it
feels very cooled and refreshed I was
talking about this in my favorites how
this could be a nighttime ritual or a
really nice morning ritual I think
prepping skin for makeup if you had a
big special occasion and you really
wanted your skin to be top-notch before
makeup this
would be a nice thing to put on first
did I even say the brand yet it's glossy
a glossier is the brand that makes this
it just looks like I don't know Cool
Whip in there if you wanted to grab
something else from the site I love the
rose water mist that looks like this
this is my favorite kind of rosy face
mist those two together would be awesome
plus I was just browsing the website the
other day and they have a little mask
gift set I think they put the masks in
individual pods and they give you a
certain amount of this kind of mask and
their other mask which is like the green
galaxy galaxy greens or something like
that that mask is okay
I really don't like it as well as this
one other people might experiment with
them and decide differently but this is
my baby right here and I do think these
two together would be an awesome little
skin care gift for anyone regardless of
their you know skincare routine who
can't use a really luxurious pampering
mask and a rose mist now I promise I
won't take too much more of your time
but I do want to mention some great
under $25 things one thing I mentioned
recently in my haul which i think is
great is this little set from Nivea
$8.99 you're getting two bombs in here
the kiss of moisture the kiss of care
and color which is a berry shade those
are full-size lip balms by the way so
that's a lot in there for just $8.99
great great stocking stuffers also
Revlon has some neat little sets that
are out they've put their matte bombs
into this set along with a mirror I love
the revlon matte bombs these are jumbo
sticks and they just look beautiful on
the lips I don't think they over dry I
love the colors you get three shades in
here that look distinctly different from
one another
elusive is your soft pink passionate as
your pinky berry and then fiery is kind
of like a brownish neutral and that
little mirror has like a regular side
and a magnified side so a totally great
purse product there like I said I've got
some super new NYX things coming in a
future video but a couple of the things
that I've tried a little bit longer that
I want to mention in this video the
tricks of the trade travel kit awesome
gift for anybody that you want a gift
like some makeup basics too but like not
your average makeup products give this
to someone who's starting to get into
makeup a little bit more who maybe wants
to step up their game with some new
you're getting stuff like the poor
killer primer a liquid illuminator a
setting miss there's this really nice
all-purpose like wear it all over argan
balm HD finishing powder blush and
bronzer creme brulee butter gloss which
is a total winner and of course you can
take that inner packaging out and you're
left with a really nice clear zipper
round bag
I was also extremely impressed with
their latest button Naked palette which
is the butt naked underneath it all love
these tones they really took it in a
much more colorful direction than the
original one really great rest color in
there deep teal got gold silver and then
just when you're really impressed with
the top part of the palette the bottom
drops down and you've got four blushes
and three different tones of highlights
so light almost white shimmer a little
bit more golden and more pinky toned
everything in here is really nicely
pigmented great quality I think it's a
very impressive value for $24.99 for
around that price tag you might see like
massive generic sets and at Walmart
let's say go for something like this
it's not a massive huge sprawling kit
but it's the kind of compact thing that
someone's gonna continue to take with
them and use and plus it's got this
absolutely practical and wonderful
mirror right here another couple of
things from NYX that I was so happy with
I've got the unraveled kit and the end
Bloom kit I am wearing the in bloom
palette on my eyes today yesterday I was
playing around with this kit and I was
looking at the bat how beautiful is that
I look with the olive on the lids and
the pop of like copper on the lower lash
line very very impressed with this small
palette and then they give you a matte
lipstick this is in the shade siren
you've got the NYX jumbo pencil in black
bean these jumbo pencils can make great
bases they just don't totally set so I
wouldn't advise wearing those without
topping them off with a powder shadow
and they give you a black liquid liner
so this is my favorite of these two I
was really I don't know even more
excited about the way my look turned out
with this just the whole combination of
products I thought was awesome but I do
want to show you this is the end bloom
kit burgundy shadows
Gould's you get the matte nude lipstick
which is a very light peachy nude it's
not a shade that I would wear as is I
would definitely want to use a lip liner
or maybe a gloss to kind of I don't know
soften up that shade make it a little
more wearable the jumbo pencil here is
in yoghurt which is kind of a shimmery
pink tone shade and then the liquid
liner in copper this is what that sample
look looks like there so I think a lot
of people would like these shades as
well but this is just the one that
really knocked my socks off so I wanted
to give you a couple mini reviews on
those so I really hope that gave you
some ideas and maybe makes your holiday
shopping a little bit easier depending
on your price range depending on the
kinds of things you like to buy either
for yourself or for somebody else and I
know many of you guys know this but I
just want to put it out there I never
like digging for something to talk about
in this kind of a video just for the
sake of having a holiday favorite or
whatever this I genuinely had a lot of
things to talk about and I was excluding
things as I was trying to narrow down my
list for like the best of the best thank
you for watching I love it if you give
this video a thumbs up if it was useful
or share it with a friend who's trying
to figure out what to buy for you and
I'll see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
