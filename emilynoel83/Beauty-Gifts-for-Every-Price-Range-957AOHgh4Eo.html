holiday gift idea video your way I have
a little dry erase board here in my room
and I'm just checking off the different
ones that I wanted to do I did one on
some really great lip kits I did one on
all the different new makeup kits and
palettes that are coming out and this
one is going to be makeup or beauty
gifts technically four different price
ranges so we've got gifts for
twenty-five dollars or less sort of a
thirty to fifty dollar range so
something right in the middle and then
for people who are looking for that big
special gift for somebody one hundred
dollars and up I've got several ideas
there as well I am still planning to do
like a stocking stuffer type video so
that'll be some more low-cost options
and if you guys want to see it again
I've done two already the past two
Christmases but if you want to see
another drugstore makeup gift bag just
kind of some really drugstore favorite
type items put into a neat little bag
for a pretty low cost to get everything
I can put that together as well so just
let me know start off with the $25 or
less gift category and my first idea is
a beauty book um because when I think
back to like being in high school how
much I would have loved having one of
these books to continually refer to I
mean it's not just a one-time readable
my current favorites and they I guess
one of them has been for a while but
Scott Barnes about face is a great one
also Bobby Brown makeup manual I found
mine on Barnes &amp;amp; Noble calm but I mean
we're talking $12 paperback for this one
at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and $13 paperback for
this but I like both of these books this
one is really great about lots of
different before and after shots you get
to see a lot of different
transformations in action all different
ages skin tones I mean it's just really
instructional and it gives you a lot of
insight into just being a makeup artist
and sort of the routine one would go
through if they were doing makeovers on
a bunch of different people you get a
ton of inspiration for different
looks in here just a really great book
for Bobby Brown makeup manual I really
feel like you could put this in the
hands of a beginner to someone who is
just the total makeup enthusiast and
they would get something out if they
visuals in here are just phenomenal
you're going to get ideas for things
like any certain you know makeup
scenario Bridal makeup TV mate I love
the insight on just being a makeup
artist and how she packs her kit and I
mean Bobby Brown she's just got some
great books out there but I feel like
this is one of the most comprehensive
another idea that's pretty affordable is
a Z palette and these run for a large
pallet like around twenty dollars and
then I think it's 14 for a smaller Z
pounds our palettes that are sold to you
empty and they are magnetic so you can
fill them with the pans of various I
shadows and it's really a space saver
this is the kind of gift I would think
of for a person I mean if you know that
person's really into beauty and they
probably have a lot of makeup in their
collection this is a nice way to
downsize and get you know you can take
the little pans out of all those little
eye shadow quads and everything like
that you know if it's a little trio like
this you can pop these out put them in
here and save space and this was this
idea was kind of fresh in my mind
because I'm planning to do that in the
coming months here really take a lot of
my itty bitty you know trios and things
like that and consolidate into something
like this here I've got just a bunch of
Coastal Scents hot pots in here but this
gives you an idea of what it might be
like to hold a bunch of mac eyeshadows I
mean the storage capacity is really
great with these so they're nice and
strong good for travel I love it I mean
fun prints on certain ones and different
colors so I mean you could even be extra
generous and give them a Z palette and
just get them started with like a few
eyeshadows in there so just a fun gift
for the for the makeup lover on your
list another great great thing and I
know I mentioned this last year but I'm
sure not everyone's seen that video and
this
is something that's so special to me and
I think that it would just knock
somebody's socks off but it is a
high-end engraved lipstick I don't know
if you can see here but that says emily
on it my friend and a makeup artist his
name is David and he sent this to me and
I just thought this was the most
fantastic thing I had never thought
about engraving a makeup product but
this is an estee lauder pure color
lipstick my shade is lavish pink here
but I mean it's just i will never i will
never get rid of this tube you think of
all the makeup you end up tossing out
throwing away this is something that
because of the sentimental value of the
fact it has my name engraved on it like
this will stay with me forever and I
think a lot of people would feel that
way about this kind of a gift
first thing is something I have
mentioned before and love and did a
giveaway on on my blog congratulations
to the lovely lady from New York who won
these is the lorry grineer set of two
quilted makeup bags and lori greiner if
you're familiar with her at all she's on
QVC often with a lot of like
organizational ideas these two bags are
really something special because you can
store so much and there's so much
separation within the bags and it's just
a really great size for travel I mean
this fits great into your suitcase great
into a big tote bag if you know it's
like an overnight trip I always this has
been my thing that I take with me you
got this little guy that could be a
totally separate makeup gift for
somebody but when I've gone and done
makeup on people I use this is like my
little storage area for like tools and
q-tips and lip brushes and sponges and
things like that so there's quite a bit
you can house in there as well that no
quality complaints where these are
concerned so it's a great set of two
makeup bags I think they come in like
six different patterns and it's at QVC
calm I wanted to put something Bath and
Body oriented in this video and if
someone were to ask me like what kind of
bad stuff you know what's the best brand
for that philosophy all the way I love
the philosophy products the sense of
their three-in-one shower gels which are
like shower gel bubble bath and shampoo
and I have used them as shampoo here
lately and I like those a lot but this
particular set is something I'm asking
for I got a similar set last year the
home for the holiday set its $38 and
it's four of those three in one gels and
then you get for lip shines as well and
the sensor sparkling cranberry have a
cherry Christmas peppermint bark which I
have tried and cinnamon buns which I
also tried and love love lies wise this
is one from last year I mean it's a
substantial amount of product love
philosophies lip shines as well Emily
award winner amazing shiny scent is so
incredibly dead-on and realistic with
these products so nice because you give
them to someone and maybe they keep one
in
shower one in you know the guest shower
one in their travel bag if there's so
much that can be done and it's all just
delicious and notice also i haven't
Riemann Denny of like the kits and
pallets from my holiday gift set review
video I just felt like you know those
those had their time I want to talk
about some different things but this set
if I had it sooner it probably would
have gotten into that video and it is
from it cosmetics and it's the holiday
airbrush I gotta get this the name right
here holiday airbrush blush stain trio
you get three of these and they come in
this great little silver box like this
it's all got a bow on it and everything
and they're laid out nicely in there if
you're familiar with like the texture of
those HD finishing powders whether it be
elf or make up forever or it cosmetics
has their bye bye pores this is that
kind of a texture here but in a blush a
very pigmented blush but it goes on
light as air all the shades are super
wearable I think every woman needs to be
wearing blush so I feel like this is
truly a universal gift color is so true
and it lasts and so the three shades
you're getting I'll show you here one is
sweet cheeks and that's kind of your
more peachy tone Rose glow and it's a
great classic pan then you get love
story which in comparison to Rose flow
is even just a little more vivid I feel
it this one's just like a little bit
juicier of a cow's aren't loaded down
with a bunch of shimmer and sparkle but
they do give just a really great glow to
that shaped like these are going to last
me so long this is a lot of product in
here for as little as it takes to do the
job and it's gorgeous color I've been so
impressed with it cosmetics i love the
vitality lip flush and lipsticks which i
talked about in my lip video but um
these are a great great blush
I know that there are people out there
who are looking for the big gift for
somebody the big special item so I've
got three ideas here that I really am
passionate about I mean these are three
things in my collection that I really
would not want to be without any of the
first thing is a brush kit from sigma
and it's called the essential kit and
this is the kit that I steer people
toward a lot when they asked me what's
the best brushes from sigma i feel like
the essential kit is what i use the most
it has just the great basic brushes your
ability is great softness quality I mean
it's just really fantastic and they are
sort of modeled after a lot of mac
brushes but these are Sigma and they are
less expensive you're able to get a
large quantity of brushes for a hundred
and twenty dollars including the
container so that you can just get the
essential kit but my recommendation is
to get one of the kits and there's like
three different colors and then a black
that come with this sort of a holder it
unsnaps and then you've got your brushes
here I've got a few other things in here
but this is great because you can take
some out you can you know store these
out on your vanity in the different
holders and have brush storage sitting
there but also it becomes an immediate
on-the-go thing when you put them all
together and pop the top back on thing I
want to mention is my malli
twenty-four/seven gel nail kit no
regular nail polish has been on my nails
since this past summer I get right now
love it this is what's great about this
in a nutshell is that you can put this
on your nails and your nails will be
good for two weeks probably three weeks
the only thing that makes you end up
taking this step off is that your nails
grow out a little booze is an LED light
so you're going to cure your nails in
here and it comes with the set of
absolutely everything you need you will
not need to go out and buy one more
piece because you get a little tray with
like all the pieces and parts and
everything you can continue to buy more
nail colors which I have done
for example my shade today is this
krewella color a couple months back I
did use the nailin sensational for a
couple weeks just to test it and compare
I think that's like 60 bucks at walmart
and it did not have as many steps in the
procedure to you know do your nails all
these different you know little steps
here and there but it also didn't last
as long like the staying power was not
comparable in my opinion to what I get
here with my malli I mean this is
hardcore you don't have to worry about
it i mean i have had red nails with
absolutely no shipping for going on
three weeks now to keep using something
that was not working for me this is a
hundred and sixty four dollars and
eighty eight cents and now it's 17
pieces it comes with a travel bag now
which i would love to have because when
I got it it just came with you know all
the various parts in a box but you get I
think you get an extra polish you get
like four different polishes total you
get an extra remover than the initial
set that I got you're giving this to a
person who loves to change their nails
all the time like multiple times a week
this may not be for them because this is
going to be on there for a while and I
like to use the foil method for taking
them off I won't get into that now but
you can youtube that there's videos on
it but they will be on you know for a
while so i am a person who doesn't like
to always be touching up my nails or
redoing my nails so if i can spend 40
minutes what i'll do is i'll grab like a
cup of hot chocolate or maybe some wine
and i get out my nail stuff i turn on
some youtube videos i want to catch up
on and it becomes a nice 40-minute
relaxing nice session in the day you
know and so I enjoy that and then I'm
good for weeks so I just I cannot say
enough about this kit that she's got
great like light really soft colors
there's a French manicure kit that you
can get and do in jail gel nail form is
totally worth it if you're one who's
getting your nails done at a salon I
mean this will save you I have not run
out of a single thing here and like i
said i've been using it nonce my final
gift and this is a real biggie is my
vanity girl hollywood starlet van
mirror and that is what is sitting here
in front of me is where I do my makeup
every day the lights there's a little
knob where you can adjust the brightness
of these lights so I'll show you that
here like you can go kind of dim to
really bright I've had this for a couple
of years now and this was my big gift
from Tyler and it is just not failed me
at all I haven't even had to replace a
bulb on this thing yet it's a
fantastically large mirror where if this
was also your hair station or whatever
like tons of space here to see and do
whatever you need to do in days I
usually shoot you know I've got my
window here and I've got natural
lighting through the window some days
that's not enough so I turned this on
and it gives me you know just to like a
medium setting and it gives me a nice
amount of light there I mean that just a
total game changer for your makeup world
this is an investment and I realize that
but I am so glad to have this now I mean
it has just been a wonderful wonderful
asset for my makeup life in not just
lighting and helping with my videos but
also for you know just doing makeup on a
day-to-day basis so thank you so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed some of
these different beauty related gift
ideas there's definitely more that I
could have gone into but hopefully this
helps you along as you finish or
continue your Christmas shopping I know
I still have a lot more left to do so
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
