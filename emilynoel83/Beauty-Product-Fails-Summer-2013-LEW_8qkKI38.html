happening just a really weird experience
pungent smell that makes me think of
these won't stay this is a kind of a
thing I want to see some lunch yeah I
just can't handle it hey everybody
thanks so much for joining me you guys
know I love sharing my favorite products
with you but I gotta say over the course
of the past probably like late spring
and into summer I have discovered some
things that I am NOT such a fan of some
things I really don't like so I thought
I would share those sort of product
fails with you but just keep in mind
those are fails for me and some of these
things you personally might like and
that's great if they work for you you
know that's good I hope is that in this
video I'll explain it well enough to
where you know oh that's something that
I actually would like or that suits my
preferences or I like things that work
that way not good for me may or may not
be good for you just keep that in mind
but the first thing I want to talk about
is this la colors ombre DIY nail kit I
just picked this up without really
thinking much about it it was only three
dollars and fifty cents from one of my
local dollar stores and I just thought
wow you know that looks like a pretty
cool idea it's gonna give you that nice
like a different shade on each nail it
kind of shows you back here what its
gonna be like but I got new story huh
this is just not the right selection of
colors to give you a real ombre look
because these two shades end up looking
exactly the same on your nails these two
shades pretty much look the same and
then you've got a fuchsia I mean it just
doesn't like when you get it all on your
nails you don't get that like gradual
color fade type of effect so I really
wasn't a fan of it and then I went into
my own collection of pinks to try to
create the ombre like topping off some
of these colors and it really didn't I
remember trying to explain to Tyler you
know what this is supposed to look like
he's like that doesn't look that way at
all anyways I thought these shades were
a little hit and miss certain ones had
more full color others were more sheer
so if you're just wanting a selection of
pink nail colors that's one thing but if
you really want these to be the shades
that create an ombre effect I don't
think they really do I think kind of a
disappointment with this little kit of
glosses from forever 21 you might be
thinking you're relying on forever21 for
great makeup but I mean I really have
had great luck with some of the
forever21
I shadows there was a great neutral
palette a while back that had so many
you know naked and naked 2 palette dupes
it was great in really nice quality so I
thought maybe that carries over to the
lip gloss and there's this cute little
trios box stuff like this these are what
the glosses look like and I was really
hoping that they would turn out to be
these shades like you would see a
difference but unfortunately they're all
just super sheer like hardly any color
in them they're basically like clear lip
glosses texture wise they're not too bad
I mean there's a little tackiness to
them but I would wear them if they had
more color but there they are there and
once they get on my lips I can't even
see a difference between these and they
all just show up and it's called natural
shades from forever 21 this one's a
fairly new product it's from two-faced
and it's called lip injection color balm
and it's like a jumbo pencil type thing
I thought this shade would be really
pretty it's called bigger berry and
there's the color it really does look
pretty on my lips I love the color but
the feeling on my lips once I put this
on it's actually pretty painful like I
don't see any major plumping results out
of this but the feeling that you get on
your lips it just stings it's not so
much a tingle but it really feels like a
sting and I found it to be very
uncomfortable and I thought for all the
other products that are out there from
Revlon and Jordana they're selling you
know similar jumbo sticks that we
actually mimic this color it doesn't
last for the entire time it's on my lips
that feeling does fade but I just
thought this was an outstandingly
painful the product that I don't really
what are you I'm really jumping around
all over the place I'm just pulling out
products here but a couple of
wet-and-wild mascaras that I thought did
absolutely nothing for my lashes or the
mega protein and the mega vault and I
really can't tell much of a difference
between these two as to what they're
doing on my lashes they're both just
equally very average to below average I
don't notice a lot of clumping with
these mascaras which might be a good
thing if you're a naturally super thick
lash girl but I want
to see some lash you know once I get the
mascara on and it just doesn't do much
so here's the brush on the mega protein
and it is a traditional bristle wand and
I don't know how much you can tell there
but it's like the bristles are spiraled
up around the brush and then with the
mega volume I held the brushes
side-by-side it might just be a little
bit bigger but it's basically the same
brush and like I said these formulas
perform a lot the same for me so if
you're someone who has naturally
straight not the fullest lashes in the
world these might be a couple of
mascaras that you just better off
skipping while I'm on a bit of a wet and
wild rant here and you guys know I love
the wet and wild eyes shadows and
different products from the line I think
are great but this mega last liquid lip
color I so dislike this this goes on my
lips and it's supposed to be like one of
those really long wearing lip colors
like a liquid lip color so it comes out
with the wand you painted on your lips
and you know how when you're using like
covergirl outlast or the maybelline
superstay they're the same kind of
concept where you paint it on your lips
and it gets to a like completely dry
finish you know like there's no moisture
to it anymore and so they supply you
with a little lip balm or lip gloss that
you can put over the top and things look
pretty and it feels more comfortable on
with this I don't feel like it gets
quite to that dryness level but you
still don't have anything to put on top
of it and when I go like that with my
lips I'm not wearing it right now but if
I like press my lips together they will
almost feel like they're sticking
together I pull them apart it's like
little bits of this formula are like
clinging together and then patches are
either coming off and clinging to either
the top or the bottom like what I'm
trying to say with this is it's trying
to be one of those long wearing lip
colors but it's not quite getting to
that super long wearing point it's
maintaining that little bit of tackiness
which i think makes it feel very
uncomfortable on the lip in this color
rose to the occasion I think this would
be as such a pretty color they've got
some gorgeous looking shades but the
whole way the formula feels I just can't
handle it oh speaking of uncomfortable
lip products I've been trying some more
things from Jordana lately
they've got a bunch of great like new
products coming out and they had some
nice blushes
and when I found this line when I was at
a Kmart recently they had some lipsticks
so I thought hey I'll try one of those
lipsticks this shade is Hollywood red
and you twist it up like that and okay
it looks fairly normal right it has the
smell of a pungent smell that makes me
think of crayons or some sort of art
supplies oh it's so like overwhelmingly
strong and I'm not one who's normally
that sensitive to scent but it's so
overpowering and then you try to put
this on your lips in it like skips like
it doesn't really glide the lipstick
it's sticking swatched it here again not
a bad shade but my finger is like
clinging to it when you try to glide it
over your lips it like skips it just
doesn't glide on that being a pretty
shade there's just nothing I like about
this lip brush okay the benefit stay
flawless 15-hour primer this is one of
those products where I felt like I gave
it a ton of like testing time you know I
worked with it in a lot of different
ways I know they say - like patch it
over certain areas of your face first
and you're just supposed to be able to
like rub it on from the stick and then
apply your foundation and it's like the
two become one and become a very long
wearing thing going on on your face and
I felt like when I did that I could see
the product on my face more I don't know
that I was seeing this but I think I was
seeing foundation clinging to this and
it was looking thicker than foundation
looks on top of other primers yes the
product did stay on my face for a good
long while but it wasn't looking smooth
and skin like for that point I decided
I'm just gonna put this all over my face
rub it in to kind of smooth out the
texture of this first and then put my
foundation on top it was a little bit
better that way but still I felt like
even as the day wore on I didn't feel
like my foundation was looking any
better in fact I thought it was looking
thicker there was just more product on
this it's not one of those things you
put on your skin and it just feels like
silky nothingness you there is a
definite texture to this and a thickness
- I feel like I've just used a decent
amount of this product and given it a
lot of trial and error and I just didn't
love the
way it looked and I didn't think it did
anything that amazing for staying pal
the Black Radiance line I've talked
about you saw my hidden gems of the
drugstore video I talked about some
great 8 pan pallets that Black Radiance
has and they're just like wet and wild
basically both brands are kind of under
mark wins
so same label basically as making both
of them but anyway I decided I would try
this quad and I thought maybe the Black
Radiance quads are also really great
just like those 8 pans are but no sadly
this is a different formula these are
not shadows with much pigmentation this
quad here is called desert clay and I've
got some swatches there on my hand just
all equally sheer sheer shades and
compared to the really opaque wonderful
quality in those 8 pan palettes I
thought this is a kind of a face it's
another drugstore product where I'm
thinking I'm probably gonna figure out a
way that I like to use this but right
now I mean in the intended way that they
show in commercials and they show in the
ads to use it it just doesn't work that
way so I thought I needed to mention it
and it's the master smokey by Maybelline
eye studio a master drama liners that I
love so much so I thought oh my gosh a
really long wearing jumbo stick great I
have it in emerald fury you've got a
jumbo stick type thing on one end and
you've got a smudger here on the other
stick is a very long wearing product I
will give it that like I feel like if I
draw a line with it you know it gets to
that really smudge free point but it
sets so quickly that you've got the
smudger here's to be able to work that
into some kind of big smoky look all
over the lid like a shadow stick you can
really blend out sets so quickly that
when you bring this smudger out it kind
of like litt starts lifting up product
and basically just sheers it out but it
doesn't really blend it and you can't
really get much further than that you're
thinking this is going to be one of
those things that's going to double as
eyeshadow and really glide on all over
the lid and be easily smudged and then
set yeah it will eventually set but it's
like it it's not mobile enough it just
can't smudge out very smoothly it's a
product from flower beauty and then
take this and my finger is actually
holding something in there they make
these they're called petite floors and
it's got three different segments of
color here I have it in the concealer
form so they have three shades of
concealer and one little cut thought in
the past I think I've talked about it
before is being such a cool little
innovative thing so I picked up one for
lips and they've of course got it all
completely packaged up in the store you
could never get into it or try it or see
how it works which I don't think people
should be busting into products in the
store but once I got it home it's like
do you think it won't stay in if you've
got these falling out in your purse you
know what kind of mess you're gonna have
and it happens with like all the little
bits and so what you're supposed to be
able to do is push that in and I'm
holding it in now and then you take one
up and then you push it in there and see
how it won't these won't stay
frustrating because these are actually a
pretty decent lip product this is kind
of a Coralie bunch of shades and I love
the thought that you get three in there
and it's like you're not having to haul
around a palette of some sort you've
just got this stick but I couldn't feel
like I could go anywhere with this if
the little thingies don't stay up in the
tubes I don't know if this was a flaw
with just my product or if this has
happened with any of yours my concealer
is not like this at all but the lip
products they it's the very same style
of packaging but the things just won't
stay in there's only I have a hair
product fail and it is from kms
California it's called hair stay anti
anti humidity seal and I got this as
part of the allure fall beauty box just
a ton of different beauty products in
there to try and so this sounded really
good to me 24-hour weather proofing for
finished looks and the humidity we're
having right now I thought wow that'd be
perfect and I've used this a couple
times the first time I was so baffled by
it I like had to try it another time
just to make sure what was really
happening there but this is like a
performs like a regular hairspray and I
remembered putting it on my hair and
just spraying it on there and then maybe
moving it around a little bit and then
noticing my hair looking so greasy on
freshly clean hair this spray
went instant stringiness and greasiness
and heaviness I'm not wearing it today I
don't know why I'm like gesturing do I
hear right now but I put it in this area
so it was very obvious that it was just
loading the hair down so then another
day when I was thinking man was it there
just something wrong with that day you
know what happened I put some more on
and started kind of styling my hair back
like this and then immediately I could
tell it's looking so wet
and stringy and I just don't get it the
real issue too is that I'm noticing it
getting stringy and greasy looking from
the get-go
I haven't even ventured outside out of
the air-conditioning yet today I used
this before leaving the house I just
decided it's a hat day like I needed to
cover it up so not a fan of this alright
everyone so those are the failed
products I've tried over the course of
pretty much this past summer again they
may be things that you like or that work
for you soap I explained everything well
enough to wear you know whether or not
you might have a similar feeling like me
or you might actually like it it might
work for your skin type or preference or
whatever last time I did a video like
this it was probably in January right
after the Emily awards so I probably
need to be doing something like this
more often
so instead of people telling me Emily
you made me buy this maybe you can tell
me Emily you kept me from buying it so
thanks for watching guys I will see you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
