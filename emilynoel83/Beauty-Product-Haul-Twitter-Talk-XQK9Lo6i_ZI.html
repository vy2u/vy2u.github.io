in for this video I am finally feeling
better I've been kind of out of
commission for about two days now having
some bad strep throat symptoms and just
I'm on antibiotics now and I'm feeling a
lot better my voice was really hindered
through this whole thing over the past
few days and I wasn't able to do the
news for a couple days there and it just
really I hate that I hate to just
feeling like I can't do things I
normally do and especially the news than
the videos and things like that so
feeling a lot better my voice is you
know returning to its normal state so
that's good I hope many of you who also
said you're dealing with the same thing
start feeling better too and if it's an
unusual a sore throat now you know maybe
see a doctor and get that checked out
because i usually get a sore throat
leading into a cold but this was so much
worse and i was having other symptoms
along with it so yeah definitely get it
checked out by a doctor if you feel like
it's something really unusual event the
twitter talk video so i've been asking
for your questions and i'll be answering
those at the end of the video i don't
look at him really in advance so we it's
always a surprise whatever i get so
today was the first day our newscast
went HD no it was actually a win HD
yesterday i missed the very first day so
it was might the first day for me today
and it was really cool and i'm happy
with how it's going so far but i'll keep
you posted on any adjustments i'm making
to sort of make sure I look okay a
little hole here that I wanted to pass
along didn't pick up all this stuff at
once but I just wanted to share it all
with you one thinks I got from Walmart
was this Revlon precision lash adhesive
I've talked about this before and
reviewed it and this is my by far my
favorite lash glue basically the cat
twists off and it's like a wand
applicator you just put it right there
on your lashes it gets tacky very
quickly you never get too much on the
lashes which has always been kind of a
something I've fought with with putting
on false eyelashes but this makes it so
quick and easy I never want to run out
and so that's why I made sure I got more
this is from walmart I know lots of
people are talking about this mascara
it's the voluminous million lashes um
yeah like you can see it on that
metallic tube but um I am wearing this
today I'm also wearing false eyelashes
today though so don't really take that
as much of an indication of what this
does but this is a rubber brush mascara
all the regular other voluminous ones
are not so just my mini review or my
initial reaction to this is that I think
it really does separate separate the
lashes really well in a very clump
freeway but I'm still not sure if I like
it better than my voluminous carbon
black I mean the carbon black is just
phenomenal and I don't know I don't know
if anything is quite matched up to the
amount of all you might get we went to
Sally's where I got another mascara this
is from the femme couture line that's a
line of mineral makeup sold at Sally's
and I noticed they had this mascara
called monster lash super volume mascara
so that's what it looks like there and I
just couldn't turn it down and looking
at the brush it's a brush looks very
similar to a lot of other things I've
tried here just kind of was typical like
spiraled around the brush type mascara
wands there so it's not not a rubber
bristle brush but um I haven't really
tried this yet so I'm just kind of like
I put it on over something couldn't
really tell how it worked yet so I will
report back on that as well but I'm
expecting a lot if it's called monster I
got some of these toenails I didn't know
Sally's even sold these the brand is
pretty woman and you can see these toes
are kind of like a subtle french tip
which I hadn't really seen anywhere
before but it's like the really soft
pink shade and so I like that and I
wanted to try them they come with some
glue and so I thought why not there were
pretty good prices I remember pretty
similar to what other drug stores charge
for that kind of some of these tan wise
self-tanning cloths which were
discounted to 299 you get only two in
the package which isn't that great and
I've tried these before but honestly I
couldn't really remember if I liked it
or not and so I just thought in
time maybe I do you know try out some of
their kind of self tanner and I thought
it would try them again and this time
remember whether or not another thing I
got that I'm really really pleased with
from Sally's is from palladio and it is
the herbal lips licks ultra shiny lip
gloss crayon and the shade is in go
naked it looks like that and then you
take the cap off it's just like a fat
pencil and i love that your schooling so
easy and smooth and i like how you can
get the definition but you don't have to
be as careful as you are like with a lip
liner so when I saw these from palladio
I thought I might give it a go and they
really are like um they're not dry they
are very they feel moisturizing almost
on your lips and this is a really good
shape Shea in particular this go naked
color in terms of kind of like giving
your lips that bear canvas or you could
just wear it for a nude lip look but I'm
definitely going to try some other
colors of these because I think this is
a really good by step I picked up a
couple things on the recommendation of
someone who is frequently on my the
beauty broadcast facebook page her name
is lindsay and she also has a youtube
channel which is really good and i got
this idea from her i think it was her
September favorites so i'll put the link
to her channel down below but she's
really sweet and she has some great
ideas some nice tutorials and stuff so i
really think you should check her out
but anyway and you're also missing out
if you're not on the beauty broadcast
facebook page because there's a lot of
tips sharing and advising in people
sharing up just a lot of information
there and I'm just glad I've gotten
acquainted with so many people that are
so passionate about makeup and
interested in learning new things it's
just been really nice and educational
for me as well as a lot of other people
i think but anyway in her September
favorites video she mentioned a few
things and I was inspired to pick them
up she mentioned the wet slicks fruit
spritzers in lemon splash and so she
mentioned like this was a lemon lip
gloss and that she liked these and I
like these two I think these are great
little lip glosses
but I didn't even know there was a lemon
flavor and i love that lemon EOS lip
balm you know in the little little
spherical lip balm container there and
so I was like you know I really want to
try that because i love that lemon so
much so I like this a lot too and it
does have a pretty light kind of golden
II should also recommend it I believe
this was a moisturizer she was talking
about it's a Garnier nutritionist
moisture rescue light UV lotion so it
has an SPF 15 and kind of why I wanted
to try a new skin care product was
because um you remember I think I
mentioned this like every other video I
had eczema you know issues on my face at
one point in time and so the eczema is
cleared up basically and I kind of want
to see if anything but the aveeno will
work for me now and I thought the scene
blight and you know nothing too heavy
and it does have the SPF so I've uses a
couple days I think it smells phenomenal
and I really like the feel of it so far
and I've even had Tyler using this a
little bit because he has more skin
that's more on the oil east side I think
even more so than mine so I thought this
would be really nice for him so I'll
kind of keep trying this and let you
know what I think but I'm thinking that
it for those of you who have say I have
oily skin and I want a good skin care
option this might really be a good also
from seeing this in the magazines the
moisture rescue refreshing gel cream I
thought this might be maybe a little bit
heavier than this one so I try using
this one at night because it's also
doesn't have the SPF in it and I like
this too so they both feel really good
on your skin and there once again very
very low for now we're going to turn it
over to Twitter talk
remove UT 5 says what is your favorite
highlighter for your face and why um I'm
gonna go with physicians formula shimmer
strips they are pretty shimmery but I
the reason why I like it as my
highlighter is because you can use the
lighter shades toward the top of the
palette you know it's like strips going
across and you use the lighter shades
and it's like there you have a
highlighter but you also have a bronzer
with the lower ones so it's kind of a
multi-purpose thing and they make nice I
shadows too and I've just always been
happy with the kind of the glow that
that palette has given me so that's
probably my favorite plus it's a
drugstore product so that's always
quickstep cute gingerbread says what are
your basic makeup products that you use
when running late oh my gosh me running
late in the morning before a newscast
and now that we're in high definition
it's kind of a nightmare so I'm thinking
about what I would use if I were running
late um I still have a lot of things
that I feel the need to do and then I
would probably like kind of finish up
doing once I got to work and got throw
my scripts and everything but things
that I feel like I could not do without
I would need to do foundation and
under-eye concealer so I mean I use a
variety of foundations under-eye
concealer lately has been the maybelline
dream mousse I feel like it's done a
great job of concealing under-eye
circles for me good coverage good
pigmentation can't do without blush and
bronzer um I am under some very bright
lights and you need that to bring your
skin to life under those lights
basically so the too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer not only does that
bronzer smell terrific and I don't think
you'll hear a lot of people talking
about how great their bronzer smells but
that is fantastic it's a nice contour
and it's just a really good bronzer but
it's a little bit on the darker side and
then a blush like Milani minerals in my
time wearing it today love it love is so
those two products and combination or
great gotta have eyeliner and mascara
like if I didn't have the time to
with eye shadow and all that I would
really want to line my eyes probably
with some sort of liquid liner on top
and pop on like my L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black and whip on some lipstick
real quick there were some lip gloss if
I was going more minimal on my face I
would want a lipstick or lip gloss that
had some color to it so something is
sort of a reddish berry color it would
probably be what I do so good question
land and you says any advice for those
wanting to make their own videos um wow
I could probably make a video on this
topic or write a blog about it um I gosh
if you want to make videos here's a big
thing that you should think about before
you even start are you ready to take
criticism from people and sometimes it's
not even criticism it's like all out
just kind of me and sometimes people
just you know are talking off the top of
their head and people get a lot of guts
being behind a computer screen and I get
the feeling some people say some things
that they wouldn't say to your face if
they were right in front of you but
behind their computer they'll do it so
you just gotta be ready for some
comments and be ready to let them roll
right off your back and not worry about
it so um that's something to think about
kind of mentally prepare yourself for
you know are you ready to deal with that
um what else I think you need to
definitely have some ideas ready to go
and be ready to make a lot of videos
before necessarily you feel like a lot
of people have noticed you you know what
I mean you've kind of got to be willing
to put a lot out there and just know
that eventually people will catch on but
you've got to you've got to keep doing
that you can't expect some kind of
instant overnight following or or base
of people that watches your videos
without doing it for a while so that's
something to think about as well one
more tip would be when you're doing your
videos you know do things that you are
that you feel strongly about you know
don't just see like okay everybody
always does monthly favourites videos so
that means that's something I'll have to
do if I want to be in
in youtube you know beauty community no
you don't have to do that if you don't
like doing that then pick something else
you know I am all about people taking a
new idea or a new approach to things
because there are so many people doing
these beauty videos on YouTube we've got
have some other material coming in here
so try to really use your own creativity
think about what you would want to watch
and put that out there to everyone to
see the preserve it says oh wait I know
what I wanted to ask you do you have any
video of you cheering in college that
you could post oh my gosh I know my dad
has shot a lot of video from when I was
cheering in college of games
competitions things like that I don't
have that video here I'm bet I could go
home and dig up some of that and get it
onto my computer and eventually share it
with you so I will try to remember that
the next time i'm home but i do have if
you're friends with me on facebook and
you can be if you want to friend me on i
have a photo album of some college
cheerleading pictures on there if you're
curious smoke x 187 hey this is a guy
question from a guy hello what do you
use to clean your face your skin is
flawless thank you it's not fall is
actually but um something i use on my
face every day to actually get every all
the stuff you see here off would be the
LA Daily facials cleansing cloths Tyler
has used these as well and they're
really good about getting every last bit
of you know dirt oil off your skin and
it also has kind of like a one side is
usually softer to the cloth and the
other side is has more of a scrubbing
nature exfoliating side and I think that
has helped and I've used those four
years now used it all through college
and yeah for a really long time and so
they have worked well for me
consistently and they've come for
different skin types normal to dry
sensitive and combination oily alright
guys well that's about all the questions
I can get to for now for this Twitter
talk but thank you so much for asking i
always feel like there are good
questions in this segment that's why i
want to keep on doing it and so thanks
again for taking parts thank you for
watching and i hope
all have a great weekend and thank you
so much to those who sent me some get
well wishes over the past few days they
were much appreciate have a great day
and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
