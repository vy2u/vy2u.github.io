wonderful Thanksgiving I had a good one
I went back and saw my family this past
weekend so there's a NEMS world on that
if you haven't seen it yet with tons of
yummy food that I kind of wish I was
having right now again but yeah I had
fun on Thanksgiving and this video is
gonna be all about gift ideas I know I
did my big kind of gift guide video with
some larger gifts a lot of high-end
items and so this is gonna be my
stocking stuffers video and it doesn't
mean you literally have to be stuffing a
stocking for somebody to give them these
gifts but they would work great in a
stocking or just as maybe like a smaller
addition to another gift a lot of this
stuff it's inexpensive
most of it is drugstore like sometimes
people get in this mindset of it has to
be a certain you know thing packaged
like a gift set or something like that
to give to someone when really if you
can use your own creativity and maybe
put together a couple of small things
you've got a really nice well-rounded
gift and in this video it's things that
I truly love like not just some cutesy
package thing that I thought oh that
make a great gift let's show it no these
are like tried-and-true things that I
like so I'm excited to show it to you so
let's get started
I love using ribbons to decorate you'll
notice I've taken most of this stuff and
put some kind of cute ribbon around it
and that's really just to kind of make
it look cute or in some cases hold it
all together you don't have to do all
that or you could just decorate it with
like a Christmas bow but I think there
are so many cute ribbons in like the
craft sections of different stores and
so I've just had a lot of this on hand
so what this is is one of my favorite
hair items and it's called a Turbie
twist and I don't know if you guys have
used these hair towels before but they
are fantastic for like putting on right
after you get out of the shower and
absorbing a lot of the moisture before
you start blow drying and styling and
that kind of thing or if you're having
some kind of like you know a spa day
with yourself or a friend or something
you can just kind of keep your hair back
and really nicely with it so it floats
out it looks like this and again you
just kind of tip your head over you wrap
it up and the little end actually sticks
through this elastic bands so it's all
perfectly out of your face and not heavy
or falling off or anything so love the
Turbie twist but why not give that and
give it with something that I use hand
in hand with the Turbie twist which is
like a deep conditioner one that I love
is from Neutrogena it's the triple
moisture silk touch in silk touch
leave-in cream and so like I'll get out
of the shower you know towel dry my hair
a little bit comb through it
put some leave-in conditioner on and
then put it up in the Turbie twist and
it really kind of helps to I think lock
in the product and really help it be
more effective and then you can throw in
some of these things that you can find
it like the dollar store that you can
put in your fridge it's got like a gel
in there it's sort of like a soothing
eye mask type thing so if you wake up
puffy stuff morning you can put that on
or if you're just trying to pamper
yourself but you know that's a nice
little bundle you just roll
and so excited about this okay this is
all from ELF what this is is basically a
cream blush a conditioning lip balm and
an eye liner and I got them all
separately I had these on hand and I was
thinking how cute it would be if those
were stacked like presents and then you
just take a ribbon and wrap it around
and it just looks like the cutest little
miniature stack of gifts and I think the
cream blush is actually a really good
product it's super pigmented and has
kind of a unique texture it's not quite
as light as maybelline dream mousse
products for example but it's got a lot
of pigmentation and can look really
pretty on the cheeks and so the shade I
have in that is what's it called its
called seductress so that's the one that
I've actually tried and enjoy it's got
the conditioning little shade is mellow
melon and then I put a cream eyeliner on
not necessarily my favorite cream
eyeliner of all time but it is super
creamy it just takes a little more doing
to get like the deepest darkest line but
overall I mean none of these things are
bad and I think that they're all
actually for the price quite good
you'll notice the packaging I know I've
reviewed the blushes before but the
packaging is very large but for this
purpose I think it makes an adorable
gift and I just put a little tape a
little scotch tape under each one to
hold it all together but yeah just take
a small ribbon and put it around there
and it looks like a little package
this is something that I personally
would love to receive and it's some
false eyelashes but not only that but
the glue to put them on and like I said
I wanted this stuff to be functional
something that could actually be put to
use I mean you go giving people false
eyelashes what if they've never worn
them before but they want to try but
then they have to find the glue this is
my all-time favorite glue I'm not like
this about a lot of products but it's
the only glue I use you know as Revlon
precision lash glue and then I'll or
eyelashes excuse me are a favorite kind
that I have I also like Revlon I like
Ardell I'll use sew-on perfect from
Walmart whichever but I just kind of
take these together and then put a cute
bow around them and I mean have fun to
find that in a stocking or maybe you
just had that given in addition to some
great palette idea I had involves a
brush cleaner and it's maybe not the
first thing that pops into your head
when you think oh Christmas gift brush
cleaner but this actually could be a
really great gift especially if you're
giving to multiple people because I
weigh way back I made a brush cleanser
recipe
basically that encore created encore is
makeup artists here on YouTube as well
and like back in the day I created this
and I put it in little spray bottles
like this so I could put the brush brush
cleaner in here spritz it on like a
Kleenex or a paper towel or something
and do like quick little brush cleanings
just to get product off of something and
you know it takes several different
ingredients it's not super pricey to
make it I will post a link so you can
see how to make that but think if you
had multiple people to give gifts to and
you could make it up and I put like a
little label on mine brush cleaner spray
but you could make quite a few of these
little spray bottles give them to
someone and maybe give them with a
couple of your favorite brushes two of
my favorite eye brushes are actually um
they're each a dollar one is the flat
eyeshadow brush and one is the little
crease brush that can be kind of a
smudger as well but just you don't
bundle that together
I love the sex from Ecotools I actually
just recently reviewed the cute little
for kabuki brush set but I don't have
the packaging anymore so I was having a
hard time figuring out how to do that in
this video but another great thing
that's super cool that anybody can use
is this great brow grooming set you get
a mirror you get some scissors some
tweezers a cute little angled brush a
like kind of a bear mascara wand type
thing you can brush through with so it's
only five dollars I got this thing for
five dollars from I believe it was Ulta
maybe and you know again pop a bow on it
it looks cute and festive and it's
something that anybody can use and
probably should use because everybody
needs to you know be doing something
with their brows whether it's just you
know keeping them looking nice and neat
or just brushing them into place another
couple of really quick ideas if you're
going for a hike you Tannis factor with
your gifts this is a great little thing
this is the Fox in a box blush from hard
candy and it looks like a cute little
gift box on its own but look how
adorable it is if you just put a ribbon
on it so I'll just show you the box and
this is this comes in multiple shades
and you know you can use that and just
use it as a blush your kind of a
highlight type thing but they're really
really cute and they just strike me as a
great little giftie item but if you put
the bow on it it's totally a good
it's kind of a high-end item but if you
split it up you can make it go a lot of
different ways and they are the
alpha-beta globe has their what the
garbage alpha-beta glow pads from dr.
Dennis gross and I've talked about these
in a video in the past but what these
are are like a self-tanning little towel
but it actually has ingredients in there
like anti-aging ingredient works so well
gives such a natural yet noticeable tan
so if you think somebody might want to
try those I have a big box of like 50 of
them and so I packaged like five of
these together and you know that could
be tossed in someone's stocking another
great thing to do is maybe just put
together a nice little duo of nail
polish and a great topcoat one of my
favorite top coats that I feel like
helps my polish lasts longer gets hard
as a rock very quickly and a super shiny
is the Sally Hansen mega shine and then
maybe give that with one of your
personal favorite nail polishes so I
love the I great red is the China Glaze
salsa so I mean it's kind of nice for
the holidays to have a great red nail
polish as well
and a final idea something I'm really
kind of proud of it I thought of this
and I think this would be fun again if
you've got groups of people to give with
a group of friends cute little bags I
this one actually was a gift to me from
someone so I'm thinking maybe you could
find these in sort of a gift supply type
area of a store but what I've done here
is put in a bunch of different little
makeup tools that you could buy in
bigger chunks and then you could split
them up and give these to each person on
your list but I've got like some
double-ended q-tips I've got some little
sponge tip applicator --zz these are
some individual mascara wands and some
little lip brushes and you can find all
that kind of stuff at like Sally Beauty
Supply or just you know check the
cosmetics section of whatever store
you're in but what a fun little
accessory to throw in if you're already
giving somebody a makeup type gift and
just add that to it so that wraps up my
stocking stuffer video guys I hope you
enjoyed this I've spent several days
kind of planning this and having fun
with it and trying to put some together
some creative ideas for you still have
my drugstore makeup gift bag video
coming so keep an eye out for that
because that's gonna be kind of a nice
compilation makeup gift bag for someone
that you can really customize to your
price range so keep an eye out for that
thanks so much for watching and have a
great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
