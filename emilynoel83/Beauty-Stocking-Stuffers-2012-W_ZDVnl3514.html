in this video and I am dressed very
festively I don't know if that's a word
very festive for the occasion so
basically this video I've put together
some little ideas for small gifts I
think they could be stocking stuffers I
think they could be cute little
additions like tacked on to another gift
you're already giving or they could be
like party favor type things um the
first thing I want to mention is a
little lip butter bundle I think this is
so cute all you got to do is come up
with a couple of lip butters tack them
together like I literally taped them
together and then I put this cute little
like sparkly bow on there how great
would this be in a little stocking or
you could attach it on to another
present the two colors that I love
together that I think are very holiday
are red velvet which is kind of a deep
rich red and cherry tart which is a
little brighter red I love wearing them
to get other options there's like a real
light pink called strawberry shortcake
and you can pair that with one of the
deeper colors like raspberry pie all the
names are mouth watering for all these
there's a nude called creme brulee you
could put that together with fig jam for
more of a neutral light colored lip but
whatever you do I mean they can't go
wrong they don't all have to be worn
together they just get such a pretty
shiny appearance on the lips and so I
thought that would be a cute way to
present those to someone a little bundle
idea if you're into that would be doing
something for eyes I thought how about
my two favorite mascaras plus some
remover so here I stuck on a cute little
zebra print bow and I put on here my owl
may get up and grow which is one of my
favorite drugstore mascaras along with
Maybelline lash discovery which I love
for the bottom lashes and you can
totally explain this to whoever you give
it to you know like this was recommended
and then I put to get that together with
these Almay oil free eye makeup remover
wipes these come in just a little
canister their little Browns these are
actually really nice whether it's just
removing residue the day after when you
know we all find that they're from time
to time or just to remove everything
completely you kind of hold them over
the eye let it start to break down the
product a little bit wiggle it back and
forth and remove
these are also great for removing
product off of your false eyelashes I
mean these are just nice to have around
and then a couple of great mascara now
they're a little bundled idea a red lip
in the champagne or wine glass or you
know you could use another kind of glass
if you're not a the adult beverage
drinking age but I love this I get tuck
in some tissue paper I could also see
like some glitter or sparkly ribbon down
in here and then tuck in three elements
for a red lip one is your lip liner I
put in this two-faced imperfect red but
you could totally use Rimmel exaggerate
lip liner in ravish great drugstore red
lip liner I just tossed it out with my
empties also this lipstick from wet and
wild this is one of the mega shields
which is really really comfortable on on
the lips and it's in a current affair
it's a beautiful kind of deep red you
can also put a lip butter in here one of
the ones I mentioned and then maybe a
gloss this is one of those Victoria's
Secret beauty rush glosses and juice
berry but I mean you could do any little
combo you want I think a red lip is fun
because it's festive and you know what
if you had you know your your pals over
and had dinner and then everybody went
out and they all wore red that meets
socialization and partying I think it
would be so fun for people to sit down
and you know this is at their place at
the table or something that would be
really sort of a small beauty gift in
itself that you can run out and get real
easily at target is the Sonia Kashuk ion
dazzling palette it like for really
sparkly shades and then like satin or
shimmery shades on either side some
jewel tones I think they would fit well
with anybody's collection what they
currently have but then this little trap
door over here
not exactly a trap door but you know it
pulls out and you've got three different
looks and you just lift up the little
card and you get different ideas for how
to use this stuff so that's super handy
because you know you're not just putting
it in someone's hands and they're like
okay now what you know you've got some
ideas to work with other gifts that I
think could totally go solo or as part
of something else or as a party favor is
this great little mirror this is from my
sister
Cafe Press shop where her amazing
watercolor artwork is being placed on
different pieces whether they are mugs
or shirts or these adorable little
mirrors so you've got two sides here to
the mirror but then great jewels
actually there's like a dragonfly and
some really pretty stuff got multiple
different things to choose from but I
think this one with the jewels just
makes me think very girly very feminine
so I think any woman would love to have
this and carry it in in her purse and
then you pop it out and people are like
ooh what's that that's gorgeous I know I
talked about a lot of great palettes in
my gift palette video for makeup kits
and all those new things that come out
for the holidays if you were looking for
some little thing to tack on to that
cute little to face brush set it's Too
Faced shadow brushes essential
three-piece set made with luxurious
teddy bear hair it says it comes in this
great little like capsule and I can so
see this going in a stocking but you get
three really useful brushes and I
wouldn't recommend this if I didn't
think they were totally like OnPoint
great to use they're all really
excellent sizes none are oversized which
I think contributes to messy eye looks
when you're using a brush that's too big
for your eyes one that's a nice little
flat brush so that would be to pack on
your shadow
you get one liner or smudge or brush you
can still be really precise with this
you can go around your inner corner you
can smudge out your lower lash line it's
it's great these are densely I can't get
over how soft and then you've got a
crease or a blender brush here and that
is comes kind of to a tapered point
again nice and soft great for blending
out this area applying some shadow to
the crease you do a total look just with
these I'm very confident in that because
I've done it several times keep it just
out on my makeup area open because I
think it's so darn cute and then you pop
the top on and there's your tribal eye
brushes as well so love that guys I hope
this was helpful for you these stocking
stuffers / mini gift ideas I've done a
lot of gift idea videos so far it seems
like this year but I have some
years passed - if you want to check them
out so I hope everybody's having a good
time getting ready for the holidays and
thank you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
