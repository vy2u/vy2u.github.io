think you're gonna enjoy this video
because this is kind of gonna be a
combination of both I got this thing
from QVC it's called the new Beauty test
tube and basically what happens with
this is they send you this little tube
and it's filled with beauty products and
you know all the different things that
you're going to be getting so they are
like basically doing a presentation on
this on QVC and they say you're going to
get this this this and this it's a total
of 10 things including new Beauty
magazine so you get the magazine and you
get the products and it's really neat
because it gives you the chance to try
out so many different things and kind of
decide what I want this in the full-size
or whatever so what my review is going
to tell you today is maybe whether or
not the Beauty test tube is something
you want or maybe a particular item I
talked about will spark some interest or
maybe you'll think yeah I don't want so
I have two products in this that I
haven't tried I have three products that
I've tried and I'm pretty sure I'm not
going to repurchase again two products
that I'm kind of like on the fence about
and then three products that I
absolutely love and and most likely
going to get full sizes of it's also
nice is you get this great little sort
of like a mini magazine and there's
information full info on each product
that you get there so that's kind of
nice to have some background you don't
just get this one little random thing
and think what do I do it I haven't
tried are the pro advanced fluoride nail
strengthener this is from pro strong I
just haven't had the chance to use that
yet so it says develop strong nails in
just four weeks so that's something I
still need to check out and also the
boar Keys I'm not sure how to pronounce
this one but it's the fango Delicato
it's active mud for delicate dry skin so
basically like kind of like a mud mask
I'm guessing yeah cleansing mud mask so
that'll be something fun to try just
haven't had the opportunity yet so those
things I can't give any a pin
I want to talk about the three things
that I'm kind of like no I don't think I
would probably purchase them again and
one is actually new Beauty magazine now
it's actually a nice big magazine it's
kind of expensive it's about ten dollars
I believe and you might think Oh Beauty
magazine there's gonna be tons about
makeup but really there's mostly
information about skincare related
things so if that interests you and it's
a lot of high-end skincare I find as
well you might be interested in this
there are some cool articles about like
new technology new products kind of some
cutting-edge things but overall this is
probably not a magazine I would
subscribe to I'm more into like allure
and things that really give a lot of
interesting makeup related advice so
just my two cents on the mag it's from
Pacifica it's the Hawaiian Ruby guava
solid perfume and I believe you could
get different different sensor colors on
some of these different things and this
is one of those where you might not end
up with this one if you got the test
tube now it smells amazing and it's just
a really nice fresh fruity scent and I
do like it but I just don't find myself
probably using this up very quickly
because it is a solid perfume and also I
just kind of prefer the spray another
cool item is from Dalton and this is the
color cream lip gloss and there are a
couple different shades that I actually
got this in because and I wanted to make
note of this I got this little note and
it said dear loyal customer we'd like to
extend our sincere thanks to blah blah
blah this letter is to inform you that
one of the products and the test tube
may have superficial scratches on its
outside packaging and so they're
including an additional product so this
is the way this came you can see a few
little scratches other than that this
product is fine and they gave me another
one so that's kind of cool but anyway
this shade is called Patty's pout and
it's a really pretty neutral lip gloss
it has a nice scent to it but I mean
overall is just not super unique so it's
still kind of in my you know I'm
probably not gonna spend the money to
repurchase this because you know these
are nice this one's a little more pinky
this is called
liesl ooh and this one is actually a lot
more you can see it's a little more
goopy I guess it's not quite as solid as
the other one but they're nice and I
like them and I think it'll take me a
while to use them up again so I may not
need to repurchase them anytime soon but
also they're just not that is when okay
you get I was this is one of the main
reasons why I want to try this test tube
was for the win cleansing conditioner if
you've seen anything about win on QVC
they talk about how lather is not good
for your hair and it's stripping your
hair stripping your hair of color as
well if you have color treated hair so I
got the kind in cucumber aloe again I
didn't choose this I think you were just
gonna get whatever you ended up with and
I have been using this for I don't know
about a week I'd say a little over a
week and I've used up quite a bit
because it takes in multiple pumps it
takes like 12 pumps to get me to get
what I need and it gives you the
instructions on that on the back but I
like it it softens my hair I mean my
hair feels really nice but I'm just not
like sure if I need to switch over to
this entirely it is more expensive so
I'm kind of on the fence please tell me
what you know about when and what you
like about it if it's if you think it's
something worth getting the full size of
the other thing that I'm kind of still
thinking about is from Tarte and it's
the pure maracuja oil this is so cute
you get this and I actually already had
a little one of these that came with a
different Tarte purchase I had made so I
have been using this it's extremely skin
softening they say before bed rub it in
your hands and then rub it on your face
and some people might be thinking oil on
your face oh my goodness but it's very
softening I mean I feel like my skin is
in good shape but it's something that
I'm kind of still thinking you know is
this right for me do I want to continue
with this sort of in my skincare regimen
so
you posted on that not 100% sold on it
yet I do have three things that I am
just in love with and one is from dr.
Dennis gross skincare and they are the
alpha beta globin Spacek allah these are
anti-aging pads of sunless tanner for
your face and I'm loving them I'm loving
the natural color I've been getting with
ten I have one two three four five six
left so I've used four so far so kind of
what you're seeing I've used them every
other day or once every couple days they
look like this and like I said you can
get all over your face with them and
still have plenty to get your neck and
decollete area but I like the thought
that what I'm putting on my skin is
anti-aging so you can kind of put it on
I've been using it after I shower before
bed giving it you know maybe an hour or
so to dry I don't know if you need to do
that but I don't like the thought of
just hopping in bed with this still kind
of moist on my face and then possibly
getting some streaks but I have seen no
streaks I've seen natural color I'm
really really pleased with this it's
just awesome and I think the full-size
comes with 50s park lights camera lashes
mascara again I had tried a little
sample of this before I think the brush
is fantastic that's one of the best
things about this is the brush it's a
good size it's dense and thick with
bristles and it really manages to grab
each lash and highlight each and every
line other thing that I just love
love-love-love is the philosophy inner
grace it's the shampoo bath and shower
gel all-in-one and this is quite
possibly my favorite philosophy scent I
mean I have smelled amazing grace and
all the other inner grace is the one
that I love the most
ever since I've had this this has been
the only thing I have used in terms of a
shower gel because it just smells so
good it's kind of just it's very not
it's not overpowering it's not one of
those sense where you think oh I'm
smelling lots of floral or lots of sweet
it's just so warm and comforting and
that's all I can think I would love
to have the perfume in this set or a
body spray or something like that
because it's really really great
hopefully let's give you some insight on
the beauty test you think this does
change over time the selection they have
so this costs I think it's down to
twenty nine sixteen right now but
initially it was like thirty two dollars
so something to keep an eye out for
maybe just one of these particular
products caught your eye but hope you
enjoyed this review slash little haul
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
