introduce you to a brand of makeup
called be royal products and the makeup
sector of that brand is actually be
luscious and so I'm going to show you
some of the different I products that i
have and sort of review them as I go
along and do this tutorial it's several
different things from I shadow 2i
primers to lash primers in mascara I'm
going to cover all those things in this
video I have a very high opinion of all
of them and i'm also going to have the
details in the description box as well
as i'll tell you what's on my lips to
which has been asked about in some other
videos and i'll clear that all up for
you in this in this video here today
another thing is i have done a Q&amp;amp;A
session with a representative from be
royal products on my blog it covers a
lot of the questions i had when i
started using this brand and things that
I just thought you guys might be curious
to know to do they test on animals what
is you know what does the B&amp;amp;B royal
really mean for this brand and just
different things like that so it's kind
of like a little interview it's on my
blog if you haven't checked that out yet
please go there and learn more um and
just hope you like this tutorial and
review thanks for let skit started as
you can see I went more the smoky route
with this palette it's definitely one
that you can go on a variety of ways
with it's from the be luscious part of
the royal products and as you can see
it's an all matte palette you get a
light champagne shade and medium to
light brown a dark smoky charcoal black
shade and then a deep burgundy and in in
the past I've found matte shades to be a
little more difficult to blend with but
these are just so soft and so easy to
blend with your going to see as you
watch that it's really not hard to
create a you know a nice look with these
and I even like just these top two
together can create a nice look that's
really natural but you start working in
more of these on the bottom and you can
really achieve a smokier look like what
I have now
so just for the purposes of having fun
and you know showing you everything this
can do I'm going to go ahead and and
show you that part but first i'm going
to use another product from be luscious
called shadow magnet and i have it in
light it looks like butter and it feels
like better only a little stickier and
basically this is going to work as our
base on our lid and it's so light i tend
to eat to use lighter colors on my lids
so it doesn't bother me that this is
like lighter than my skin tone I don't
feel that it has to match although it
might be nice to go back at another
point in time and get something that I
can you know take further up because I
don't necessarily want my crease to be
this light so I'm not taking it up to my
crease I take my eyeshadow brush dip
into this nice matte white shade and
just Pat this shade all over my lid gosh
i love i love the way this shade works
with the whole with the whole look here
because it's just so um creamy and it's
just refreshing not to have the shimmer
in one of these looks because in most
most times you know you do have that you
know large amount of shimmer somewhere
and this really doesn't have that so so
i've got that all over my lid and then
i'm going to do is take a crease brush
this is from essence of beauty it's not
my fine crease brush it's just a little
bit bigger than that and i'm going to
use this medium to light brown shade and
i'm just going to use that in my crease
i'm going to give myself kind of a wash
of color and you'll be able to see here
that this you know this color isn't just
messing around you know it is pigmented
and you could work with you know these
two colors as i said alone and have some
contour going on there i'm going to use
that same brush and go into for the
burgundy shade again this is matt as
well and i'm going to work this in a
little more on the
half and start developing that outer V
shape that we generally go for and so
with that I'm just kind of going from
the outer corner up towards the corner
of my brow and then kind of blending it
over so now we've got the burgundy shade
worked in there you could stop here and
have a great look but we're going to
work in the black as well which is I
love this shade I really really love it
because like I said I've had Matt blacks
before that are just a real pain to work
with and this one is not by any means so
there it is there's the color and i'm
going to use actually my fine crease
brush for this because we want to define
the crease even more here so i'm going
over that same territory i went over
with the burgundy and i'm going over it
with this darker shade makes that making
it even easier to blend when you're
going one color on top of the other
getting it a little bit on just the
outer part of the lid and also up you
can see this is not taking a great deal
of effort to pull this little outer V
off here and you're still looking at
right now it's probably looking a little
lighter than this side that's because
after we get our liner done and sort of
wing it out a little bit we're going to
go back and be able to intensify certain
areas more because basically when you do
that winged liner you're changing the
shape of your eye so you want your
eyeshadow look to sort of follow that
low changing shape you have there so I'm
only kind of going halfway with my
intensity here and then I'll go back and
kind of fill in more but for now just to
keep blending it out i'm going to go
back for the burgundy and i'm going to
use a fluffier brush my rounded crease
brush from Sephora and with a light
touch go over the border of everything
that we've done here so far
just really softening it up getting a
nice fade as we go up and then to the
light brown again and then to the white
as a highlight all right so i don't have
a be luscious liner so i'm using my
revlon colorstay in black and this is my
liquid that i'm going to be using to
line the top lash line here which is
starting from the very very inner corner
and i'll be working my way to the outer
corner
and then I'm just winging it out a
little bit like I said not majorly but
it's more a matter of just thickening
the line as you get towards your outer
corner here and then we're going to take
I'm going to take my revlon colorstay
pencil liner in black and we're going to
go underneath and sort of blend here at
the corner a little bit and that'll
begin to make more sense to you probably
once we do that just kind of flicking it
in an upward motion here so you can see
it's blending in more and it will blend
even more once we go over it with some
powder powder shadow that is and then
just get it right up in that lower lash
line to what I was saying about once
we've done this liner where we sort of
altered the shape of our I want to go
back and adjust our I shadow to fit that
so I'm going to go back to this black
shade with my fine crease brush and I'm
just going to work right off of that tip
that very very outer corner and I'm just
going to adjust and sort of blend down
you also want to blend over that liner
on the corner here too so I'm going
right from the corner of my eye outward
and this little sort of flicking up
motion and just blending it out for our
lashes I'm going to be using a product
from be luscious and this is called
their lash thickener it's a primer it
looks like it might be black but it's
actually white and I was just really
looking when I got this I was looking
for something that could really kind of
pump up some of those soso mascaras that
I have something that could thing them
up and just make them work a little
better so I'm going to be using this in
applying one coat of it I've just curled
my lashes actually so I'm going to put a
coat of this
on and you'll be probably seeing my
lashes looking a little white here and
after that we'll add some mascara on top
um and see what it does for it i've used
this several times before and really the
only flaw about this i really like the
end result like what it does for your
lashes but it does take kind of a while
to dry so you know at this point in time
if you wanted to go do your brows or
anything else on your face go ahead and
do that just wait for it to get good and
drive safe this mascara is really cool
this is um be luscious HD mascara in
carbon black and get ready yeah look at
that brush it's so tiny it actually
spirals all the way around the brush and
it's just really really little and I was
looking at this thinking okay this is
one of those mascaras that kind of just
doesn't really do anything or you know
just I really wasn't sure what to expect
but I was really pleasantly surprised
when i use this first and foremost for
how easy it is to get to every little
wash I mean these little inner lashes
are incredibly easy to get to if this
wasn't called HD mascara i would suggest
the company name it the lash detector
because i found some eyelashes i didn't
know i had here the first time i use
this and that's really what you want if
you do not have a really lush mane of
eyelashes there you want something that
can highlight each and every one and
make you look like you've got more and
that's what this does it also lengthens
and it really darkens them up it's a
very rich black shade none of that like
you know cakey looking lighter colored
you know mascara this is really nice and
dark and I love love the fact that this
tiny brush can give me really nice
length and I can also get two really
little little bitty lashes there so
definitely
enjoy the HD mascara they're less add a
little more drama to this look I'm going
to be putting on some false lashes they
are ardell fashion lashes in 106 so I'm
going to put those on real quick and
I'll join you know sighs that is our
finished look using the be luscious I
make up a really really wonderful quad
of matte colors in naturalist and it's
just really really easy to use and great
great ease in lending not only for a
natural look for a smokey look as well
so I really enjoy that I think these
products are very high quality
definitely high end but if you're the
type of person that really prides
themselves in using natural products
products that are good for your skin and
just a line of makeup that is can
definitely rival you know any of your
other high-end brands definitely look
into this and I wanted to tell you guys
what's on my lips I had this on my lips
in i think it was a question of the week
video on my mac stuff and i got some
questions what is that on your lips well
its abolition it is their liquid lustre
lip gloss and pink champagne and the
color is like a really pretty pinky nude
very very light but I love the look it
gives especially with an i like this so
definitely love the texture it goes on
really smooth it has a nice light kind
of light little scent to it that is just
a little bit sweet but not overboard or
anything like that and just really like
it so far this will be what I have in my
purse tonight so thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial let you know if you have any
questions and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
