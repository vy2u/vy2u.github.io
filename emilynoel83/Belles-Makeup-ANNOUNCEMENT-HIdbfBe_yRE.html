bit different kind of makeup video today
or should I say we the morning have we
mean instead of real products my girl
Belle and I are talking about fake
makeup pretend makeup play makeup
whatever you want to call it and while
the packaging really looks and feels
just like any random makeup product the
quote makeup it seems to be made from a
very dense foam material it does seem to
be super durable I mean Belle has had
her set for months she uses it daily and
that stuff is still intact I've had lots
of questions though about the different
brands we've tried and I would say the
favorite is this baby face makeup
it's an Etsy brand it's based in Canada
I believe and there are lots of bright
colors fun textures actually it's been a
great way for her to learn cutler's
what's that color and yeah and Belle
likes to apply it to anyone or anything
she can get her hands on pretty much and
I've been donated a few brushes and
sponges to her kids
oh really little ones I would say you
might just want to be aware of the
hinges and potentially breakable mirrors
in some of the products but overall I
have found these products to be more
durable than other lines that we've
tried so I think Belle's message that
she'd liked me to pass along is that she
is a big fan of her baby face makeup Hey
missing one of these I found it
downstairs
yes it's true we are expecting baby
number two I am pregnant Bell does not
have her own makeup line that's not with
that little reveal that's about but that
was just for fun just to get our point
across the baby is due in January we
don't know boy or girl yet but won't for
a little while we do plan to find out
and we will have all sorts of details on
the vlog Channel that's Beauty blog cast
and I'm gonna continue to do pregnancy
the logs on there but might appear in
some of those every so often but I was
just kind of fun from the last pregnancy
and I think it'll be neat to look back
on this time around as well oh thank you
thank you for sharing your brushes
where's where's the baby where's the
other baby holders thank you your
speaker can you ever think you're going
to get it over the end Oh doctor thank
you guys so much for watching and we
will see again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
