day in today's video we're talking about
erase paste okay you know if you've been
with my channel for a while this is like
the top dog concealer in my life this is
a corrective kind of peachy colored
concealer it's really great for
under-eye circles it's really great for
any kind of age spots sun spot as my
type discoloration you might have on
your skin it's a very creamy concealer
and the older I get the drier I get the
more I like this stuff
the darker my circles get and the less
sleep I get the more I like this stuff
so you might feel the anxiety it would
creep up in me a little bit when I heard
that they're taking this away well the
good news is is that they haven't
totally taken it away they have
repackaged it and renamed it and this
product still does exist out there but
there are definitely some things that I
think you need to know about the way
it's changed now this is what erase
paste is going to look like if you want
to buy it you're going to be looking for
the boying
brightening concealer now benefit has
already had a concealer called boying in
the past and I always thought of that as
their skin tone concealer very full
coverage kind of on the dry side like
it's definitely not something I would
want to put up under my eye area
I've not repurchased that one recently
in this new packaging but this boying
idea is now the label on like all of
their concealers so they're boying
industrial-strength concealer and that's
going to be the equivalent to the
original boeing' that was once out
they've also come out with an airbrush
concealer which I'll touch on in this
video from what I understand this is a
new formula and then the brightening
concealer is the erase paste equivalent
and on benefits website it says formerly
known as erase paste same shades same
great formula we're going to be digging
into some ingredients in this video
things are close but not identical so I
will be touching on that also things
have changed with the shades and so I
was always a user of the shade called
number two medium in the original erase
paste and so if you want to buy more of
the
as in their new version what do you look
for because I got number two and number
two is a match for this they may not
look exactly identical here in the pots
but swatched out geese two are the same
shade number two medium in the original
and number two in the new but in this
new version number two is actually
referred to as light medium so you're
going to be looking for number two light
medium if you used to use number two
medium in the original now since I was
confused on this and I wasn't sure what
I would be i went ahead and also
purchased the one called medium and that
is now number three in the new version
and it is considerably darker than the
original array space that I was using so
I guess if you're trying to match up go
by number not necessarily by name they
also have an even lighter version than
both of these and that is called zero
one light no matter what number you're
getting they are still going to have an
element of peach eNOS to them it's just
a matter of how deep you want to go and
talking a little bit more about the
formula of array space what always made
this unique to me was how amoliant this
concealer seemed to be you know there
was more moisture in a race pace than
just about anything but even when I got
it like kind of blended out on my skin
it wasn't sticky and there is a
stickiness to some concealers the first
one that comes to mind is it cosmetics
bye bye under-eye there's just a tacky
element to that concealer not saying
it's a bad concealer but without a doubt
I would set that stuff and I tend to
like to set my erase paste as well but
this is a concealer in a pot where if
you put your finger in it and lift up
it creates peaks in the product so
there's a real richness and creaminess
and so I was really wondering if the new
version would have that same quality and
it really does seem to have it now when
it's brand-new and you unscrew this pot
is going to look just completely flat
it's going to look like maybe the
texture of any random pot concealer that
you swirl your finger into it you work
it up a little bit and you can tell yes
it does have that same texture that same
feel and consistency as the original
also just blending them out on the skin
they do have the very same feel I wanted
to show you what it looks like as I
apply this new
at Boeing brightening concealer number
two on my under-eye area you know I've
got some dark circle I've got some sort
of melasma areas peeking through after
spending some time in the Sun and this
does a great job of covering it it
really covers just as much as the
regular erase paste because it really is
the same consistency of product it's
that same creaminess level really love
that about the old and I'm so glad that
I see that still in the new kind it's
like I said the only thing kind of
tripping me up on this was the shade so
you'll have to kind of watch that and it
might be useful to see these in person
too and swatch them out in the store if
you've never tried these and just FYI I
can wear the number 3 as well if you
have deep dark like melasma type
discoloration you may even want to go
for this deepest version it doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to have a
lot deeper skin to wear this but one
with deeper discoloration may benefit
from a deeper corrector too so just try
it out if you can swatch it in a store I
think that would probably be really
helpful another thing to note you're
getting the same amount is 0.15 ounces
in the new and it's point one five
ounces in the old erase paste also and
as far as the ingredients list I
compared both of them and we're looking
at a lot of similarities here definitely
it's the same first four ingredients
however on the new version there are a
couple of ingredients that were part of
the old but have just jumped up the list
of ingredients a little bit and the way
ingredients will work the products that
are listed first have the most content
in that product and then less and less
and less as the list goes on so both
concealers the old and the new have the
same first four ingredients but in the
new kind propyl paraben and retinol
palmitate jumped the list like by about
three ingredients they jumped up so what
are those things why would the new kind
contain more of those well propyl
paraben is a preservative
I know chemists or scientists here but
this is something that from what I
understand naturally occurs in plants
but that it is chemically or
synthetically created for cosmetics
products as a preservative now the old
erased paste did contain this but the
way the ingredients list lays out it
would appear the new kind contains a
little bit more
I'm not sure exactly how much because
they're not giving the specific recipe
here but they are just giving an
ingredients list some people try to stay
away from parabens at all costs however
there are also people on the other side
I think of Paula's choice that's a very
well-respected skincare line and also
you know you can go on the Paula's
Choice website look up tons of reviews
on products and things like that they
say and I'm going to quote the Polish
toys website here as it turns out
according to published research and
global cosmetics regulatory
organizations from the US Canada to
Europe and Asia
parabens especially in the small amounts
present in personal care products are
not a problem it's that simple they go
on to say although many cosmetics
companies have opted to avoid parabens
those who continue to preserve their
products with them are not making a
mistake parabens are among the most
effective and safest preservatives
around so bottom line there I'm not sure
what the bottom line is there are
differing views on parabens you're going
to have to make your own decision on
what products you choose to use don't
just take it from me make your own
decision the other ingredient that was a
little higher on the list with the new
version of the erase paste is retinol
palmitate so I looked into that and that
is basically a milder form of vitamin A
and as studies show that that's an
effective antioxidant so I don't think
there's much concern surrounding that
particular ingredient but whatever
changes were made in the content of
certain ingredients I mean just the
overall product truly seems to be
performing the same way the original
erase pasted it's going on the same
notes but applying and blending out in
the same manner it's covering the same
it's the same amount of like peachy
pigment and tone in it the things
confusing to me I think is the the
numbering and naming system because
while names are different numbers seem
to be the same on a day to day basis I'm
going to probably continue to get the
most use out of the number two shade
which corresponds with what I used to
use but the number three you know if I
have a discoloration that gets much
darker you know say on top of my cheeks
or really dark under-eye circles this
could still be a useful shade also just
the way this stuff wears throughout the
day I love it so now for me I can
breathe that sigh of relief on a race
paste you know you're looking at buying
a brightening concealer now but it
really seems to be the same
now another little tidbit here I did try
this airbrush concealer as you can see
packaging it's a different thing going
on here getting 0.15 ounces here here
you're getting just point zero five
ounces of the airbrush concealer I got
this in the shade number one this is
going to be more of a skin tone color
range and I got this light one because I
just thought it might be brightening and
something I could maybe use hand in hand
with the boying brightening concealer on
the outer box of my boy it says like
full coverage brightening concealer this
one and the details on the website this
airbrush concealer
they say this is sheer to medium
coverage and they describe it as your
real life retouch soft focus lightweight
concealer covers imperfections all over
the face with a flawless finish that's
virtually undetectable and it comes in
0-1 light which I have here also a two
light medium and three medium so what
I've noticed about this so far it seems
to be a little less rich compared to
this concealer like when I get a little
bit of this and rub it between my
fingers it just goes to this sort of
more lightweight place I feel like it
still covers quite a bit you know this
is one of those very rare cases where I
think it might be a little bit under
sold coverage wise because I thought it
actually did pretty darn good in terms
of coverage but it just doesn't have
that same really like juicy texture that
the erase paste has it's a little bit
softer and lighter and the thing I
noticed immediately about this is on
contact with the skin and even as I just
get a little bit on my finger and swatch
it it has a little bit of a cooling feel
and they don't even really address that
I don't think they mentioned it at all
in their claims which surprised me but
it feels like instantly cooling when you
put it on the skin and so what I've been
doing I applied the erase paste and then
I use a little bit of this just to kind
of brighten like right on the the very
tops of my cheek area like on the top of
the apple of my cheek anywhere else on
the face that I want to brighten up I've
applied this too and it plays so well
with the erase paste like seriously I've
gotten in trouble recently like applying
too much of the best amaz'd sticks and I
explained that in my review video how
you can only layer up so much of that
product and with some things you'll find
some products really have their limits
as to how much you can wear
still look good with them on your skin
but the other day I was so impressed
wearing both concealers layered one on
top of the other and my under eye looks
so smooth so flawless I was like yes I
have really hit on something good here
I'm not saying that erase taste demands
to have an additional concealer put on
top of it you really don't have to but
if you're interested and just kind of
playing with tone a little bit or I
don't know maybe you have the need for a
skin tone concealer on other parts of
your face whether it's just for
brightening purposes or to cover like
blemishes or spots or redness if you do
go pairing this on top of this you're
not going to be like a hot mess by noon
and the last thing I think I'll address
with these concealers is do you need to
set them and I would say it's not an
absolute requirement I think if you have
really dry under eyes and you're using
this your brace paste on that area you
might not feel like you even want to set
that at all but I think most people may
want a little light dusting of some
setting powder there I absolutely love
the Laura Mercier loose powder and I
know that's like if you've never tried
any of those stuff you're like okay
that's yet another high-end purchase
here but it really is I think so far for
me an incomparable lightweight loose
setting powder you could bake with that
stuff or you can apply it just very very
lightly or you might be interested in
trying to erase paste and waiting on any
sort of setting powder and trying some
other powders that you might already
have on hand and seeing what kind of
effects you get with wear but all I'm
going to say is the other day it was
this and this a little bit of the laura
mercier and boom I was good for the day
and everything looked so nice and smooth
just as smooth as it did after I applied
it and there are not a lot of things I
can say that about so guys I think
that's it that is my full roundup on the
new boying brightening concealer versus
the old erase paste very happy to see
that there are so many similarities with
this but you are just going to kind of
have to watch it a little bit as you
choose your shade but thank you guys so
much for your time I hope this was
useful and I will see you soon in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
