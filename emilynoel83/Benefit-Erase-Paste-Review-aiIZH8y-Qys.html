this video this is a review of the
benefit erase paste so this is a
concealer it can be used all over the
face although I kind of got it for the
purpose of concealing under-eye circles
I have had kind of I have kind of a high
standard for under-eye concealers
because I have tried the Bobbi Brown
creamy concealer kit and the corrector
and they are just amazing
so knowing I really liked those I
definitely could have gone back and
tried those again but I kind of wanted
to test the market a little bit and see
what else was out there because I like
to review products that I don't really
love trying the same thing over and over
again I like to discover new items and
how well they work so and this is yeah
definitely a high-end item you're going
to pay a little bit more for this
product but it is very similar to me in
my opinion to the Bobbi Brown corrector
that I had and the shade was called
bisque and it was kind of this peachy
tone much like this my shade is number
two medium and so as you can see I've
kind of gotten in there and used some of
the product in terms of the amount you
get in here what is the amount it is
0.15 ounces so um it looks kind of a lot
like a little lip gloss tub really but
it's full of concealer and you also get
with the product it comes in a little
box like this and you also get a little
bitty spatula and you get some
instructions for using it there's some
helpful tips here in terms of how to
conceal your under eye area they talked
about the marionette grooves right in
here if you have that that you've
contend with they talked about how to
conceal those areas and also blemishes
so like I said for me my main objective
was under-eye and I found that I first
did what they said I scooped out a
little bit with this and I found that it
was way too much I cannot stress enough
what a tiny amount you need just even to
do both eyes like so you know after that
time I was like I don't want to waste
the product and so I just kind of DAB my
finger in or if you don't want to use
your finger you could
even just dab a q-tip in just to get a
little bit on there or just maybe I
don't know don't really scoop a lot out
just get some on the product you know
what I mean just get what you need so
you don't end up wasting but you get a
little bit on your skin and it is just
so creamy and that was what bobbi brown
looks like as well but I mean you kind
of need something that adds that little
bit of extra moisture to the under eye
area so you don't get that crepey dry
look even if you're young and your skin
can still tend to look especially this
time of year can still tend to look dry
you know around your eye area and it's
not necessarily you've got wrinkles but
you've got dry skin and that skin there
is very thin and it really needs
hydration so a creamier concealer like
this is going to be a really good bet
for that so basically what I did I will
apply it right out here
I will dot it right on the inside and
I'll also get right up to under the lash
line that was a technique that when I
was watching Bobbi Brown on QVC she
really stressed that no it's like that's
what I'm not doing when I first watched
her and so ever since I've been putting
concealer all the way up to there
because you can have discoloration all
the way up to you know your lashline
it's true so anyway that's how I use
this and I think it works really well I
think if people are struggling with this
product it may be that you're using too
much possibly because I feel like it
covers very well what I would recommend
is setting this with some sort of powder
and I mean you could use some kind of
translucent powder or just something
light that you have I know a lot of
people like like the benefit powder
flage I haven't tried that but I've got
kind of a cracked product here but it's
the maybelline mineral power finishing
veil that's another super sheer powder
and if you're wondering what's best to
apply it with I mean if you have any
kind of a let me just dig something out
here like a fluffy eyeshadow brush even
you know that can be perfect for that
kind of product right around the eye
area just to get it lightly there or a
concealer brush that you just kind of
reserved for dry product but just make
sure you're not packing on
the idea is just to kind of set it and
you know if it is the least bit tacky it
doesn't feel tacky anymore so I love the
fact that it doesn't take a lot of this
product to work and to cover the circles
the fact that it is that salmony color
that is the color we need to be going
for if we want to conceal any sort of
like a blue based under-eye circles so
for me I think medium was definitely the
right choice for color and like I said
it reminds me a lot of bisque and color
and texture from Bobby Brown
product that I loved it's nice that they
do give you some tips in there they
mentioned like even just running your
hands under warm water to warm up your
fingers when you apply this I think
fingers are really good to apply
concealer around the eye because it does
force that product to really melt into
the skin and not have any it doesn't
have the appearance of makeup you know
once it's on your skin it's just like
it's kind of becomes one with your skin
you know I mean so um yeah bottom line
this product works really well for me I
can't stress enough how sparingly one
should use it and that may be something
I should demonstrate in an upcoming
video just kind of how I go about
putting it on there so you're more aware
um but it really it really is a great
great concealer glad i found something
similar to bobby brown without even
setting out to necessarily find a
product like that but I mean the
downside is that it is kind of pricey
and I haven't found a lot of drugstore
concealers that are this creamy and also
have that that peachy salmony tone but
something I noticed being mentioned on
my Beauty broadcast Facebook page I
should say our Beauty broadcast Facebook
page because it's such a group
participation forum type thing but
people mentioning you know drugstore
makeup has come a long way so I would
not be surprised if there is a brand
that comes out with something like this
fairly soon I just wouldn't be too
surprised by that there are some creamy
concealers but they're just not
necessarily this shade that we really
need so at least I haven't found them
yet if you found in place
tell me in the comments below but thanks
a lot for watching
yeah very positive review on the benefit
erased paste would be interesting
interested to hear your experiences as
well so thanks a lot for watching guys
and I'll see you next time
okay Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
