you
today's review / tutorial is going to be
on d how to look the best at everything
kit from benefit this is adorable it
looks like a little book you can put it
on your bookshelf it would fit right in
it comes in light medium and deep I have
the medium kit and basically what this
is is everything you need for face
makeup it's going to be your primer
foundation concealer and palette just
for a little description first when you
open it up you get a little tips and
tricks card that actually folds out and
points out exactly how to use the
products so I'm not really showing you a
tutorial today because I think a
tutorial is so necessary for this but if
you're considering picking it up you
probably want to know how it works so
anyway it's going to be step-by-step how
to use the products up here down here
are the products you're getting for it's
the pore fessional that is the pro bone
for minimizing pores that can be your
primer or you can use it later on over
your makeup you're getting the hello
flawless oxygen Wow foundation you're
getting the Boyne concealer in two
shades and also the hello flawless
powder my face makeup today it's just
this kit all of those steps so here's a
look at how I did first step after you
moisturize is to use the pore fessional
and this is the pro balm to reduce the
appearance of your pores so you just
take a little bit of that I feel like
this kind of works as a primer it
smooths out the surface of your skin
as far as minimizing the look of pores
um I don't notice a huge difference
however I have heard from some people
who have major pore issues like pores
are their problem area they say that
this has helped you know minimize them a
little bit late and the respect of using
this as a primer I love the way it feels
it goes on really really smooth and you
just feel like everything the whole
texture of your skin is super evened out
for your foundation now the foundation
you get with this kit is the hello
flawless oxygen Wow foundation it says
oil-free SPF 25 brightening makeup and
if you have the medium kit you're going
to get this in the shade honey getting
0.23 ounces of this for this small
and I just pump out a couple pumps and
just dot this all over my face I use my
Sigma f80 brush to just buff that in and
it's said to be a brightening foundation
I can see that it kind of does brighten
up my skin tone but the coverage is
definitely medium as a whole I mean it's
not going to single-handedly cover up
your under-eye circles or your sunspots
or whatever it may be that you're
dealing with or your blemishes have got
a little blemish up you're going to feel
like you kind of need a concealer for
some of those targeted areas so with
this foundation I wore this on a couple
of really hot days and I wasn't
incredibly impressed with the staying
power but then the other day you know it
was just kind of a normal day I wasn't
outside doing any strenuous activity and
the staying power was actually really
nice and it does feel really lightweight
on the skin kind depend on your skin
type if you're really oily or sweating a
lot it's going to break down a little
faster but if you're kind of keeping
yourself cool and dry I think it's going
to be fine now you also get a couple of
shades of the Boyne concealer you get
two and three if you're medium here so
that's what those look like one is a
little more of like a peachy pinky tone
and one this has a little bit more of
that yellowish undertone and so I think
it's great that they give you two shades
because you can mix those and get just
the right shade you actually feel like
you're getting quite a bit of product in
each I think this is part like one of
the best values of this whole kit so I
kind of take the lighter shade mainly
and around my eye area just kind of dot
that on um if I were to compare this to
say benefits erase paste concealer this
is a little bit more dry not quite as
creamy as this is a little bit more dry
I feel like using my finger helps it
sort of melt into the skin a bit better
as you can see pretty good coverage
there just able to really cover up you
know sun spots I've got some redness
around my nose that this tackles pretty
easily limit up here no problem I mean
for my like light to medium skin I feel
like the this is a really appropriate
color match to her next thing you get is
the hello flawless powder
and this is one of my favorite parts of
the kit as well because the coverage is
so the shade for medium is I'm cute as a
bunny honey and it comes with a little
brush too it's almost like a little bit
creamy feeling powder if you know what I
mean it's not chalky at all it's not a
dusty or it doesn't have that feeling
like it's just powder sitting on top of
your skin it really makes an impact
coverage wise and it is just so nice and
smooth I love it one of those things
that I'm really considering buying the
full size of after trying it in this I
don't really like using the brush
because it just is so skinny you know
and I just don't feel like the blend
ability is as good but you have that
option I like to use like a big powder
brush with it and just sweep this over I
feel like this powder mattifies it still
looks really really nice and natural so
I am a huge fan of that palette cow if
even like lightly topping off your under
eye area with that powder it gives it a
completely matte look and makes it look
even more flawless on the under eye I
think sometimes concealers leave you
looking just a little bit shiny there
they reflect the light and your circles
still show so here I think the more
matte you can make it the more flawless
it looks so as you look at the impact of
this kit before and after you can see
there's more coverage here the spots the
under-eye circles the blemishes are
covered up the complexion as a whole is
brightened up and I would kind of call
the overall finish with that powder like
a natural matte finish as far as the kit
goes I mean no they're not full size
products but you're also not paying for
a bunch of full-size products the price
is at a good point where you can kind of
experiment with a few different things
if there were a couple you were really
interested in you can see okay do I
really like this before you go out and
purchase the full side I don't really
feel like there was a product I was
totally disappointed with in this kit at
all it's really just a matter of you
know what did I think really perform
better than the rest I think the
professional is nice and I've heard
varying reviews across the board I see
kind of a maybe moderate difference but
overall the best quality of this in my
eyes is the fact that it smoothes your
skin so much
makes it such an even canvas for your
foundation so I do like it as a primer
as far as the foundation goes you know
it's going to be medium coverage if
you're looking for a full coverage
foundation that's not what you're
getting here it's something that's going
to feel light on the skin it does kind
of brighten your complexion up a bit I
think it's important that you have the
right shade though I think for medium
this is probably a pretty good pick to
put in the medium concealer probably one
of my favorite aspects of this you can
lift it out of the kit and you've got
two really good size concealers I mean
for the amount you use you're going to
have this for a while and you've got two
colors so you can get it just right on
your own skin and give you good coverage
you can count on it for under eye areas
blemishes marks spots whatever I love
love love the powder here I think it's a
really kind of unique finish because it
is matte but not unnaturally so it still
keeps your skin looking like normal skin
may consider you know skipping the
foundation just go concealer and powder
for a quick one thing that I don't like
packaging wise about this is the fact
that all the products do lift out but
the powder doesn't it would be really
cool if you could pop the powder out as
well but I do like that at least for
most of this you could just pop this in
your purse or you could just take the
primer if you wanted to touch up with
the professional you know later in the
day because you can use that on top of
your make like someone could pick this
kit up who didn't know anything about
makeup and the instructions would really
cover how to do it so I think it's
really kind of a teachable kit I think
it's great for anyone who's interested
in any of these products and just wants
to try them in so smaller sizes and I'm
really happy with the look I mean I
don't have flawless skin but this was
able to kind of make me look more
flawless by the end if you've tried this
kit if you've tried it in the other
color families you know let me know how
that worked for you I feel like these
shades were pretty right on for my skin
tone in the medium kit but I'd love to
hear your feedback on this as well thank
you so much for taking time to watch and
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
