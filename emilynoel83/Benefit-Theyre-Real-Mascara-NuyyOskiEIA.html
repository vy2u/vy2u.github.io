mascaras lately and one that I've really
been specifically focusing on for the
past couple of weeks and I actually
purchased it maybe about a month or so
ago is benefits they're real message
mascara he's gotten so much hype online
and just so many people want to know if
it's really worth the 22 dollar price
tag at Sephora or Ulta or wherever so I
wanted to try it and give you my
thoughts on this video you will see my
lash cam where you will see the
application actually in progress
packaging is really cool it's kind of a
gunmetal gray look to it and the brush
now watch this I just pulled the brush
out of the tube and as you can see there
are some spikes there but there's also a
lot of product protruding from the end
there so it's very important if you want
to take advantage of the little spikes
that are coming off of the end of the
brush you've got to clean that off and I
will expand more on why this kind of
frustrates me coming up but basically we
are looking at than a rubber brush
mascara it's got kind of a thick rather
large sized wand and then right at the
end there are some little tips coming as
far as the formula goes it's not an
overly wet mascara but I wouldn't call
it dry either in the spectrum of wet to
dry I would put it somewhere in the
middle it's very creamy and it's very
very black and I don't notice the
blackness of the mascara fading at all
as you wear it throughout the day I feel
like sometimes mascaras can start out
looking really slick and shiny and they
dry to a less than vibrant looking you
know black color so this I haven't
noticed any change in the shade of it as
you wear it and I also have not had
issues with flaking which is fortunate
because this is a mascara that is adding
substantial length to your lash the
number one best quality about this
mascara is that you can build length
with it you can apply multiple coats I
applied three coats to my lashes
and notice that it just continued
building lengths you know with each one
I didn't let it get totally dry between
each coat and I think that helped
however as you put on more coats you
will notice a little more clumpiness
happening I mean it doesn't just
flawlessly pill three coats and it looks
like nothing I mean you are gonna kind
of notice it and as you look at some of
my close-ups you know when you get
really close you can see that there is
you know some mascara on those lashes
terms of volume and giving me the look
of a lot of lashes or in other words
highlighting every lash that I have did
a pretty good job it's not without
clumps but it's not I mean sometimes the
ends when you apply mascaras you know
multiple coats the ends look like
they're like pointing off in other
directions it's like it's a finger
that's going like this you know it does
not make sense but some mascaras do that
I didn't notice this really with this
mascara but here's the flaw I think with
this mascara and I wasn't like searching
searching oh my gosh there must be a
flaw but they've come up with this tip
which I was really excited about but you
honestly can't pull that mascara out of
there without cleaning the tip off
because okay what is what is a tip like
that gonna be designed to do for a
mascara all those little little bitty
ends there that's gonna be designed to
find you know those inner corner lashes
or your little lower lashes and stuff
you know that's kind of hard to get to
and what are the eyelashes that can't
handle too much product those very areas
you know right on the inside your lowers
you know anything that is just tiny and
hard to get to it can't take that much
product so you must clean this off and I
seriously when I was applying I mean I
was spending a decent amount of time
really getting the product off of the
end of this because I mean it's those
small areas that can't be overloaded and
this is what I'm seeing with a lot of
different mascaras now you're seeing
more of those cone-shaped mascaras that
really taper at the tip and you pull
them out of the packaging that's what's
going to get those tiny lashes that's
what the packaging says
and that's the part of the wand that is
overloaded with product so you have to
you know and they're not telling you
this but you have to spend some time
cleaning it off and you know your rim is
inevitably getting kind of goopy at that
point but I mean it's just something you
have to think about before you apply it
so ultimate question at the end of the
day is what I again repeatedly pay $22
to repurchase this mascara and I would
not as much as I like the length I don't
think this length is unique to just this
mascara it reminded me lengthwise of
what I get from a drugstore mascara
called L'Oreal double extend carbon
black this is a really great mascara
considering I applied three coats here
with this I would apply one coat of the
white let that dry and then say two
coats of the black and it's that nice
long length you know really lengthened
black mascara well I'd I tried this I'm
glad I could pass along this review to
you and it will be a mascara that I
continue to use while I have know that
when I use it I'm gonna get good length
I'm gonna get great length actually and
be able to build and build and build on
top of itself but I also know that that
little end isn't necessarily you know
God's gift to mascara also you do have
to clean it off and even then it's not
you know the most amazing little thing
ever that I thought it was going to be
well there's a good idea there while
there's an innovative concept I think
manufacturers of these products need to
continue to work on how to get that get
it so you can pull that out and have a
clean tip on these tapered or unusual
ended mascara wand I know I'm real picky
on the mascaras and if you've watched my
last few reviews maybe you're wondering
now well what mascaras does this girl
like well I have a mascara favorites
video that will sort out some of my
favorites both high-end and drugstore so
check that out if you want also check
out my blog beauty broadcast net where I
do have that post labeled mascara
Palooza where you can see what all
mascaras I'm really testing right now
I've still got a few more to try out
that I'll be posting
use on so thank you so much for watching
and have a great day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
