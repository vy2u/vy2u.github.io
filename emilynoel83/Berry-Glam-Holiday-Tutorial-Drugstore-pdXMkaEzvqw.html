holidays I've got my little tree up back
there I just love all the great festive
holiday makeup looks that go along with
the season and I love incorporating a
great red lip I mean I think that looks
good in so many different situations but
for this video I thought what about the
deep berry lip that I think can look so
great with you know just a simple black
outfit like what I have on today or you
know any kind of jewel tone yes so in
this video I'm going to show you how to
kind of coordinate your lips cheeks and
eyes to create something that works and
it's a 100% drugstore look so I'm really
excited about that some of the key
products on the eyes are by elf and I
love them so much it's really easy look
to put together but it really offers a
little something special so I hope you
like it gonna actually start the
tutorial part of this with lips because
I feel like when I'm doing a look that
incorporates a more dramatic lip color
it helps to do that first and then you
can kind of adjust the eyes and the
cheeks
according but to start off with Revlon's
lip butter in sugarplum and it's a
really great plum berry color and I'm
just gonna put that on all over my lips
and that leaves you with a really great
plum color but to make it even a little
more edgy I'm going to use my NYX jumbo
lip pencil and the shade is called
Narcisse and this is a really really
deep berry and so I'm just going to use
this not all over my lips but just on
portions of it for example right around
here kind of applying more pressure on
the outer parts of the lips and here on
the bottom I'm not gonna even fill in
the inner most part so now we've got
that nice shine in the center that the
lip butter gives us and a little bit of
depth on the outside first thing I'm
going to do for eyes is take my ELF
eyelid primer I believe this is just the
one dollar one
I got it targeted and just kind of blend
that all over your lid first and then
pull whatever's left up to the eyebrow
next I'm using my cool palette and I'm
going down to this matte cream shade
right in the corner and I'm going to
pick some of that up with my flat
eyeshadow
brush and I'm first gonna dab that right
around my innermost corner here it's
gonna really brighten things up this is
a pretty pigmented opaque sort of shadow
and then I'm going to Pat that on about
the inner half of my eyelid next I'm
going to go to this kind of plummy brown
shade right here it does have a little
bit of shimmer to it with the same brush
I'm going to Pat that on the outer half
of my eyelid here and you can kind of
work that up into the crease a little
bit as well with this brush then I'm
just gonna grab a blending brush and
sort of buff out that deeper color a
little bit and then I'm gonna take this
shade right here it's kind of like a
taupe with a little bit of a rose tone
to it right at the top of the panel like
up some of that and just kind of lightly
blend that through the crease and it
just sort of fuses everything together
that we've done so far then I'm going to
this light pink shade with a blending
brush and that is going to go just under
our brow bone it's just got a little bit
more of a pink tint to it than the light
shade that we put in the inner corner
had next is the really fun step I'm
going to take this long-lasting lustrous
eyeshadow and I'll have to double check
the shade name on this but it is a
gorgeous kind of rosy metallic shade and
it's got a nice amount of sparkle and
that's that sparkle that's kind of
coming through right here on the eye Cup
a little bit of this it's kind of like a
mousse like texture it's really
interesting it's like lighter than your
average cream but it's still quite
creamy and I'm just gonna dab that on
the outer half of my lid so that nice
metallic Sparkle is gonna be the accent
on this look so as you can see I'm kind
of bringing it outward now think of it
as you're almost forming a little bit of
an outer V with this and we're just
blotting it on and maybe take a bear
finger as you get to this inner part
because we don't want to go over that
whole light
area in here so just take a bear finger
and then kind of start blending a little
bit there so you don't go too far the
more you add the more colored you're
gonna have and the more Sparkle you're
gonna have so some people might just
want a small amount of sparkle here some
people might want more you can just
build it up to however much you want
next I'm taking my wet and wild mega
liner this is just a great classic black
liquid liner and I'm gonna go all the
way across my upper lash line and once
we get to the outside here we're going
to create kind of a wing as you can see
you've got that going on right there
so think about going to the highest
point of the curve of your eye so right
here and then like draw a line
practically straight out from that
highest point just like so and then draw
a line from the very corner of your eye
and connect and then you have your wing
and you just fill that in next you're
going to want to grab a liner brush and
we're going to go to this black shade
right here
classic matte black I am basically just
going to start lining my lower lash line
mainly we're just sticking to the outer
part of the lower lash line we're not
wanting to go in too far maybe just 1/3
to 1/2 of the way but what's important
here is making kind of a connection
there with that winged liner that we've
got going on on top so basically just
kind of like go to that point and then
draw inward next I'm going to curl my
lashes then I'm gonna take my covergirl
clump crusher mascara and apply some of
that to my upper lashes and I'm using my
Maybelline lash discovery on my lower
lashes here next I'm just gonna apply
some false lashes for just an added glam
effect and these are my salon perfect
demi whispies my lash glue is still
drying there a little bit but I'm gonna
take a pinky toned blush this is my wet
and wild color icon blush in Heather
silk and it's a matte blush but it gives
really nice pigmentation and color and I
think with a look like this where we
really are using lots of berries and
some pinky
tones a pink just really works well to
sort of create harmony out of this whole
look I would rather use that with this
look than say a peach or a really golden
blood I'm just gonna take this on the
outer part of my cheeks and blend upward
toward the hairline I love blush it just
suddenly gives life back to the face and
we're done I hope you like the look this
was so much fun for me to put together I
just love berry tones and I think it's
fun to sort of decide first what you're
gonna do on the lips and then let
everything else on the face kind of
follow suit and everything else on my
face is drugstore all the foundation
powder and all that I've listed that
below in the information box you know
what kind of holiday looks you like the
best there's actually a discussion going
on on the Beauty broadcast Facebook page
about the best ways to make your look
more festive so thank you so much for
watching and I hope everybody's having a
great holiday season so far tonight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
