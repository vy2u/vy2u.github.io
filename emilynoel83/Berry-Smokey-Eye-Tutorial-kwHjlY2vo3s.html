felt compelled to do a smoky eye I
thought hey I'll just shoot a tutorial
with it because I am using a new palette
today it's the revealed 2 from Coastal
Scents I just recently ordered this and
got it in and have been playing around
with some different looks and I
absolutely love the pink and berry
shades that are in here there's 20
different colors different finishes so
lots of opportunities for variety there
to need to play with this some more I'll
probably do a review as well in the near
future but for now the look we're
working with today is just a really
sultry berry type smokey eye so I hope
you like it
alright so step one I'm going to lay
down a little bit of a base I'm using my
Maybelline Color tattoo and inked in
pink just getting a little bit of that
on my finger and then blending it across
my lids I'm starting with my crease
color because I want what I put on my
lid to pop out a little bit more and I'm
using this mauve shade it's a matte
color down in the corner using the Sigma
e25 brush I'm applying that throughout
my entire crease area from the inner
most part to the outer part and my idea
with this is to not just confine it to
the deepest part of the crease but you
know I want it to show a little bit just
above the crease as well so a brush this
size works nicely for that next I'm
going to another matte shade just a
couple of colors over it's this matte
deep burgundy berry color and then I'm
just going to Pat on the outer part of
my eyelid here really the outer half and
I'm going to flip my brush over and also
start getting that up into my crease as
well so as you can see we're gradually
building up a little more darkness I'm
going to go one shade darker here as
well to this color that reminds me so
much of Mac's beauty mark and this I'm
confining to just the outside corner and
I've been using my Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush by the way for these
steps it works really well when you want
to place your shadow in just the right
spot so the outer corner both on the lid
and into the crease is where I put that
and then I'm just blending over the edge
of everything with a bear brush on the
lid I've just grabbed a fresh brush this
is my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
and I'm using this shimmery shade right
here it almost looks like a rosy taupe
and that's what I'm going to pack right
here on the innermost part of the lid
just for a little bit of a shiny pop
amid all the mats that are going on then
I'm going to use this pearly white shade
in just a small detail brush to go
around my tear duct area right here just
right in that up a little also going to
do a couple of finishing steps on the
top part of my eye before I move to the
bottom one of those is just taking some
more of this matte kind of mush shade
and I'm using my little Sigma e30 six
brush absolutely love this brush for
this purpose I use it this way all the
time and it's just kind of irreplaceable
to me and so I'm just going on the
border of the look bringing that color
up even more lightly than the e25 was
applying it and still leaving a gap
between you know the shadow and my
eyebrow but definitely pulling that
color upward more then under my brow for
a highlight I'm using this matte soft
pinky shade just dusting that over the
border of the last shade I applied and
also right under my eyebrow next up for
my upper liner I'm using my Jordana
color and the liquid liner I just
recently reviewed this on my Express
channel shade is black envy and it's
just got a very fine tip I think it's
very easy to use taking this all across
my upper lash line I'm also going to
just wing it out slightly to help better
define what my shadow is doing there on
the outside and then we're going to do a
very smudgy smoky lower lash line so
first off I'm going to the black in this
palette there's just a nice matte black
included I'm using an angled eyeliner
brush first thing I want to do is just
kind of make
connection right there to that black
liquid liner just on the outside then
with a smudge brush I'm going to use
this matte berry shade again and I'm
just going over the black and smudging
inward you can see we're keeping some
continuity by using some of the same
shades we used on the upper part of the
eye on the lower part here and then the
rest of the way in I'm going to that
rosy taupe and that's going to basically
cover the rest of the under eye portion
here and for a lot of smoky eye looks I
tend to go dark on my inner rim but for
something a little different this time I
thought I'd go lighter I'm using my
Rimmel scandaleyes eyeliner in nude and
I'm just going to apply that to my inner
rim next I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply some mascara to my upper and lower
lashes
and then these are the false lashes I'm
applying they're the aisle or number 117
textured lashes and they are a little
bit flared out at the ends
so just to point out a few other little
finishing touches of the look I'm using
my hot mama blush from the balm today
and that's what's giving me this kind of
Coralie golden look on the cheeks as
well as the glow that you might be
picking up on that's coming from this
product I love that blush on my lips I'm
wearing this L'Oreal color riche it's
one of those like kind of balm type
lipsticks and it's in the shade rose
taffeta and it's just a really pretty
kind of classic pinky shade but not too
terribly bright I really wanted to keep
it a little more on the neutral side
with this eye look and I added a little
bit of my Too Faced perfect lips lip
liner and perfect spice just to neutral
it down even more I just had a lot of
fun with this look again I'll be
reviewing the revealed palette soon so
keep an eye on my Beauty broadcast
Xpress channel for more and thank you so
much for watching
bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
