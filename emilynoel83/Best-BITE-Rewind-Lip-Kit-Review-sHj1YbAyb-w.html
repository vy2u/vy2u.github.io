about Holliday palette time are probably
the holiday lip kit and this time of
year bite which is one of my favorite
favorite lip product brands puts out a
really good deal and it tends to be a
little tin of four different colors
doesn't seem to stay in stock for a
super long time so that's why I'm
putting this review out a little bit
early in the scope of my holiday makeup
reviews this year the set is called on
Best Buy rewind and it's a set of
they're matte cream lip crayons so last
year the set contained on four of these
high pigment lip pencils that had you
know a little bit of shine they're kind
of like a creamy lipstick put into a
jumbo pencil format and this year it's
all about the matte lip pencils so the
tin is just a little bit longer than the
one was last year and when you open it
up there's a nice little mirror here
they've been kind of nicely formed to a
point which of course you know that may
not last depending on how you like to
apply them as you twist it all the way
up that's how much is in each one before
we talk really specifically about colors
I'll just let you know I'm pretty pumped
about this formula the matte lip creams
I've had a couple of these already and
they're really cool because they go on
you got that precision of having you
know the slimmer stick but I think they
feel like a really nourishing cream
lipstick going on but they just managed
to still have that matte finish anytime
I put on a matte lip I've noticed this
like if you put it on your top lip let's
say and then you press your lips
together and that color can transfer
down to your lower lip then I think
you've really got a matte lip color that
with some moisture in it and all of
these do that I find them to be really
long wearing even the lighter shades
without drying me out they just don't
feel like that tight mask of a matte lip
product on your lips nobody out there is
probably shocked that I enjoy this
formula I'm a huge fan of the luminous
cream lipsticks from by those just feel
so buttery on the lips they usually have
like a little hint of shine because
they're just is so much moisture in
those lip products these you know are
scaled back a little bit in that way
because they still give you the matte
finish but nonetheless they feel so
creamy going on
they don't tug at all and I mean for 25
bucks to get four shades that are super
pigmented and each one completely
different from the next personally I'm
super happy with it and I know this is
going to be one of my favorite lip kits
of the season now it's interesting
because I looked at the configuration of
colors that were in last year's kit and
it's like you have kind of a soft moody
shade you have your really wearable rose
a reddish color and then a deeper berry
and that really is the format that they
followed here as well so while I feel
like I'm getting kind of a similar shade
range this year I've still got a totally
different finish so let's go through
shade by shade I tried these all on for
you the lightest one is called cafe this
is kind of like a soft pinky nude and if
you've maybe got a lot of tones like
this in your makeup collection but not a
lot of them show up very opaque on your
lips
this one just completely you know blanks
out your lips you're not gonna see your
own lip color through it there's nothing
sheer about it but I think it's really
fresh and pretty and it's kind of a fun
mix or shade with some of these others
that's another thing you know you don't
have to just wear them one at a time
next up you've got tort and this would
be I think the classic wearable pinky
rose like the every woman type lip color
you know I think it flatters every
complexion it just gives you a boost
when you put on a shade like this you
know if you go from not wearing a lip
product to putting this on you just look
more alive and throughout this video
what you've been seeing on my lips i've
put tort all over and then i've put cafe
just here in the center of the lower lip
and i feel like it gave so much added
fullness it's still on that effect
because i would normally do that kind of
thing with like a shiny shimmery gloss
but i really like the effect with the
light matte shade kind of in the center
of a deeper color next you've got coulis
and this is a reddish berry and
definitely heavier on the red than i
thought it would be who's looking at it
in the packaging I thought it would be
more of a berry but it came off quite
reddish on the lips and it's very very
close to pomegranate if you love the
color of bites luminous cream lipstick
or high pigment lip pencil in
pomegranate this is close to that just
has a tinge more berry to it but it's a
gorgeous shade a super holiday
appropriate shade very festive I love it
lastly we have arbors
gene which is your nice deep classic
fall berry a lot of purple coming into
this shade it's gonna look so beautiful
with your simple eye looks or I'm
picturing this looking awesome alongside
a bronzy eye or also you know a cool
kind of gray silvery eye so I was
looking up these colors just as far as
individually sold matte lipcream pencils
and the only one that's available
individually is this one the aubergine I
didn't mention it in this video I know
I've talked about it in others but the
ingredients in their lip products are
like food grade quality so known to be
very replenishing for the lips these are
things you can really feel good about
having on your lips and they just also
feel good on the lips and for a matte
lip product I think you're gonna be
really happy with these there are little
kits that they put out in these tins
every season they seem to be $25 I
always feel like for the quality of
their lip products you're getting a lot
for your money and it makes it just a
nice little giftable thing you know for
that small gift that you need to give
somebody I mean who wouldn't love these
shades so thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I will see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
