me for this video I have so much to talk
about in this video so I'm gonna have to
get started right away I'm talking all
about golden e bronze eyeshadows because
these kinds of eyeshadows can be totally
multi-purpose you only need like one
shade to do the job like so in this
video I'm going to be showing you a
tutorial on how I got this whole eye
look with this one color I'm also going
to give you a bunch of product
recommendations for other shades that
are similar to this that can give you
the same kind of look or a little deeper
or a little lighter depending on what
you like I will show you what other face
products work well with this kind of a
look so yeah tutorials reviews product
recommendations the whole shebang in
this videos off what I'll show you is a
step-by-step tutorial using this shade
from Maybelline
it's called cinnamon spice and this is
kind of like the classic shade of what
I'm talking about you can see it's
bronze it's kind of what light brownish
and it can do everything for you on your
eyes
so I just applied a primer to this lid I
used the pixie eye bright primer just
trying that one out and then I'm going
to take one of my favorite bronzy
colored brownish shadows and this is
from Maybelline and it's called cinnamon
spice so you look at it you think yeah
that's pretty but this is a little
powerhouse of an eyeshadow because it
can be your lid your crease it can fade
up and practically become a highlight so
I'm just gonna use the sponge tip that
comes with it and we are going to pack
this on our eyelid see it's okay to use
the sponge tips you don't have to throw
out the sponge tips they can be very
functional for you and as you can see
this shadow has a little bit of a
shimmery metallic quality to it it's not
overly overly sparked and you'll see the
light kind of catching it just in the
right place see how on this eye it looks
deeper here in the crease because that's
where things are starting to recede and
so you are going to get more of a
natural shadow created and then here on
the lid where it's catching the light we
have a little more of a pop going on
same shade only using this one shade in
this tutorial so pack it all over the
lid then I'm going to take a sort of
medium sized crease brush it's my SS 217
this is from the Sigma premium kit and
I'm just going to get a little bit of
that product on there and just take this
right in the crease what's really nice
about using not so super dark shades in
your crease is that they're a little
more forgiving you know when you're if
you're reaching in for black you know
you can't be quite as carefree with the
application but with a shade like this
you can kind of do what you want so what
I'm doing this brush is kind of pinched
at the top if you can see that so I'm
kind of using it like you go you can go
back and forth or you can turn it a
little bit and help you get that outer V
practically effortlessly and then it
also helps you take it just on top of
the brow bone there see that beautiful
look that was effortless and then I'm
taking a Fuller Brush SS 220 for nothing
on it we're not even going to use a
highlight shade we're just going to
blend this
it blends to nothingness just gonna
blend right up to our skin tone there
you get actually trying out these liners
from Nicks
they are the slide on glide on stay on
and definitely a turn on waterproof
extreme shine eyeliners so this shade is
golden bronze and I just thought for
this look it would be perfect to take
this under my lower lash line so we'll
continue with our bronze II theme here
then I'm going to use my Sonia Kashuk
this is my smudge brush
guess what back to the same eyeshadow
and we're just going to top off that
liner and make it a really like smudgy
smokey look down here you're not going
to really even be able to tell that
there's a line of eyeliner as you can
see it's just kind of deep a little bit
smoky I'm just loving how one shadow can
do this much then I'm applying the jet
black eyeliner to my waterline it's
really rich in black and I'm also gonna
do that on my upper lash line staying
really really close to the lash line I'm
going in about 3/4 of the way then hey
okay guess what Simmons spice back in
the picture and I'm going to use the
smudger brush again and I'm just going
to top off that black with this shade
and what that's going to kind of turn
this black into is like a shimmery dark
brown I'm going to curl my eyelashes I'm
going to apply the mascara of the day
which happens to be telescopic explosion
carbon black and then I will join you
with the finished look
other products you can use on your face
that can kind of complement a look like
this
I think bronzer is a great thing because
it's just gonna play off of the very
tone you're wearing on your eyelids so
what I like to do is kind of layer a
matte bronzer like NYC sunny put that
all over your face and then for a little
added glow take a bronzer that has some
shimmer Milani has some amazing baked
bronzers right now this one is darkest
one it's called golden and it might look
a little intimidating but you know just
use it lightly kind of use it like
almost where you would use a highlight
and it's going to give you instead a
bronzy more sunkissed tile I'd recommend
like a peachy colored blush today I used
this one from Tarte and it's called
glisten for your lips
um I kept it pretty neutral I mean I
kept it sort of in that bronze family I
used a shade from L'Oreal called dune
and this is what that looks like as you
can see kind of a just neutral um gosh I
can't even think of how to describe this
it's got a little bit of shimmer to it
but it's kind of like a sort of a
bronzey shade a light neutral bronze and
then I line my lips with a little bit
deeper color it's epic
it's Rimmel exaggerate lip liner in epic
mmm and it reminds me a lot of NYX in
mahogany if you don't have access to NYX
now I want to tell you about a few other
shadow options that you have both
drugstore high-end
some are individual shades some are
little our shades found within different
palettes so first off of course we have
the one that I've been centering this
tutorial around another suggestion is
from Revlon this is a satin color and
this is called polished bronze this is
going to be a little bit lighter so I'll
just swatch that for you on my hand here
you can see it's a little more taupe
another great one oh my gosh this shade
is from Victoria's Secret it's the
beauty brush shadow in bronzing err this
can be a real stunner applied wet as
well but just look at that color there
this is the second one this is going to
be a little bit deeper this is a super
buildable shade so if you want even a
smoky look using only one shadow that's
a really good one to try I have some
small like little palettes that also if
you want you know that other shade to
use alongside it just some good options
here hard candies rush hour here you're
getting the perfect bronzy brown color
and also a little coppery tone sorry my
this one finger my nail polish is
chipping off but that's really pretty
that's gonna give you a more metallic
and also love this trio as you can see
this is much loved this is my covergirl
trio in golden sunset this bronze shade
is very nice and metallic this would be
a perfect bronzy brown that could you
know do all things all over your eye if
you want to the cheapest thing that I
have to mention today is the elf quad
and butternut because this color right
here another one it can do it all and
you're still getting three other shell
you girls with the Naked palette yes
this is perfect for a game this kind of
a look especially these shades right
here this is smog oops sorry
this shade right here is smog this shade
is darkhorse
so if you wanted a deeper twist on this
whole thing you could just use Dark
Horse or just use smog for a really low
maintenance
super easy hope you guys enjoyed the
quick to tour
and the product suggestions I think this
is just a terrific shade to have in your
collection for summer it's so easy to be
able to get an entire eye look just
using one color and it's also very
flattering on different eye colors I
think it looks great on brown eyes blue
eyes green eyes I mean it's gonna make
your eye color pop but it's gonna be
super easy and it doesn't look too fussy
either I mean what I did with my shadow
here today it's one quick easy step you
know enhance it with whatever liners and
mascaras and falsies that you like to
use but I hope this gave you some ideas
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
