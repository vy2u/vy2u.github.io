for this video I was really excited to
put together a video that would sort of
be informative for you in terms of
drugstore eyeshadow palettes because
there is so much to choose from and
sometimes honestly some of them really
aren't all that great so I thought I
would kind of weed through them and pick
out some of the best for the different
looks you might be going for and real
quickly before I get started though I
think that drugstore eye palettes if you
find good ones they can be such an asset
to you if a you're a beginner and you're
not sure what colors to pair with each
other or be you know you're trying to
expand your collection and maybe get
some looks that you can put together
quickly because with an eye palette I
mean you grab one you know these colors
coordinate and you're able to use that
if you're in a hurry you're not
searching around for lots of different
individual shadows so it's nice for that
purpose and hopefully after you see this
video you'll see how maybe you can
broaden your horizons a little more
still using these palettes still making
it easy for yourself to do your makeup
but maybe you'll try a smoky look or a
colorful look based on the ones that I
recommend here so let's get started the
first one I want to tell you about is my
favorite drugstore palette for smokey
eyes and it's from covergirl and it's a
quad called drama eyes and the colors
you get in it are kind of a rich
burgundy shade a silvery shade that's a
little bit shimmery a black and a white
and these are so great I mean I am so
impressed with how covergirl eyeshadows
have improved not so long ago I mean
they really I wasn't too wild about a
lot of covergirl shadows but lately
they've been coming out with some new
quads and some new sort of mixes of
their shades and I'm really really
liking them I love the fact that they
give you a burgundy here because this
can warm up any look if you're doing it
smoky kind of in the outer corner and
then kind of do the burgundy around here
it can be so so pretty and I tell you
these shades are truly really nicely
pigmented for covergirl I mean for any
brand really and
that's what I like about this so if
you're looking for a smokey eye look
that is my favorite smokey eye palette
so definitely couldn't skip from telling
you about that if you like brown eyes um
brown eyes or a brown eye shadow I would
recommend the palette from Maybelline
and chai latte a lot of you have spoken
out in favor of this in the past and
I've mentioned it or used it this is
nice because as you can see just by
looking you're getting varying textures
here you've got um the the lighter shade
here this is kind of a semi shimmery
sort of pearly shade these two are matte
and then you've got a shimmery shade up
here it also tells you exactly where
they go it's kind of imprinted on each
of these and whether they go on the lid
or wherever so I really like these
shades for brown eyes it's nice to have
some matte colors in there you know
sometimes you're just overloaded with
nothing but shimmer and a lot of
drugstore palettes and sometimes that
shimmer is just a bunch of filler really
you know it's not giving you that great
pigment it's just filling in so I like
that you're gonna get you know some nice
matte shades in here that's that kind of
rich black it's just it's really velvety
and I'm really impressed by those
textures so if you do like doing a
really unnatural brown eye I think that
quad is gonna really work well for you
from Maybelline now if you like a
neutral eye but maybe you don't
especially like a dark smokey look and
you don't want to use straight-up Browns
I love this palette from Revlon
Colorstay in nude elements it's called
now each of these colors have a little
bit of shimmer to them they're not
overly shimmery though I would say
almost there more pearly and what you're
getting here is a light pearl shade a
sort of practically a little bit golden
a champagne shade this one is sort of a
medium brownish taupe and then you've
got a pretty shade here at the bottom
that's like a grey with a hint of navy
blue and it's surprising how well these
colors work together you can get a
really natural I think way back when in
my videos I did do a tutorial using this
palette and it's sewn
natural but I mean to give you an idea
of that like shade at the bottom that
kind of Navy shades see how it's just
kind of multi-dimensional depending on
you know it can look dark but it can
look a little lighter too so you could
use you know just that in the light
shade and get sort of a different kind
of blueish toned look or somewhere in
the middle but overall these aren't
super colorful shades so if you like to
keep it safe with your eye looks and
keep it really natural looking but just
have you know a hint of shimmer or
something to draw attention to your eyes
this would be a nice kit without going
all-out brown or all-out smoky so love
that one from Revlon now if you're a fan
of the purples and mobs and shapes like
that I love this palette so so much I've
loved about it before it's the
Physicians Formula custom eye enhancing
shadow and liner for is smokey hazel
eyes okay so they have regular ones and
then they have the smoky once and
they're four different eye colors I have
brown eyes but I got this set for smokey
hazel eyes because I just thought this
is so gorgeous and when they mention
shadow and liner obviously you could use
that black shade as a liner or it makes
a great smoky black shadow
so this palette you're going to get a
lot for your money in this palette
granted Physicians Formula is a little
more in spent expensive than some other
brands you're getting the ability to do
a great smoky eye in this look but
you've also got these great rich tones
of like a deep burgundy practically
purple you've got a medium purpley shade
right here a light purple some gorgeous
Gray's and then some wonderful highlight
and shimmery shades there so this is so
multifaceted this this palette and I
would like to try other shades as well
but this was the one the one for smokey
hazel eyes that I saw and I just thought
that is gorgeous I have to test that out
so I love love this palette for
Physicians Formula and if you really
like those looks that have tones of
purple and mauve and are really warm and
really complement the natural tones that
are in your skin already this would be a
great palette for you alrighty next I
wanted to share with you a palette that
I thought was really really multi
this you could do a lot of different
looks with this palette and it's kind of
a metallic palette so it like if you
want I would say if you want a really
glam look I would go for this palette
it's the Milani runway eyes in catwalk
and this is wonderful and if you don't
have Milani if you're getting bummed
right now I'm thinking I don't have
Milani in my drugstore they are selling
these palettes online at cherry culture
calm they now carry Milani and they do
carry these so you're getting I did a
look one of my favorite all-time
favorite eye looks with this where I
used the black the blue the red and I
think the white or the silver or
something and it I just fell in love
with it I love this palette I love the
versatility you have I mean you could
just pair up two of these shades on on
any given day and get a totally
different look than if you pair it up to
other ones you know what I mean so it's
it's great it's great for your budget
you have something that you can do more
than one thing with because then you're
not having to buy multiple palettes and
multiple singles you know and stuff like
that so totally in love with this
palette from Milani and I guess yeah the
category I would put this under is one
of the most multi-purpose drugstore
palettes and just for a really great
glamorous look because these do have
sort of a metallic finish to them I mean
there's the silver right there I mean it
looks like I just painted silver or
something on me and the red is gorgeous
too but you can see how they have that
sort of metallic II feel so you are
gonna have a little you know not that in
that natural finish this is gonna be a
little more metallic and lastly a great
great palette if you like color this is
the tropical fusion talent from
covergirl I know I showed a quad at the
start but this is another great quad
that if you like blues greens the warm
tones of orange and yellow you're gonna
like this as well and I didn't want to
leave my people that love colorful
shades out and if you want if you're
just in the drugstore and you already
have you know a great selection of of
colorful shades but this looks appealing
to you I urge you to just go ahead and
try it because you are gonna be
astounded by
the color on some of these shades you
can see the green and the blue there see
if I have a clean finger to put the rest
on there's that pretty orange um see if
I can get the yellow on here there's the
yellow so there's those shades and they
really are especially these two the
green and the blue there I think are
just dynamite shades so and I would I
would urge you to pick that up I would I
walked by this so many times and thought
I'm curious about that palette finally I
got it and I should pretty I should
definitely need to do a tutorial on it
because this is one of the best colorful
eyeshadow palettes in drugstores so I
hope you guys enjoyed this little
wrap-up of some different drugstore
palettes like I said these are things
that we all have pretty much have access
to at least a couple of those if you you
know depending on where you live I know
I have a lot of international viewers
and I'm not sure exactly what all in
that selection you'll have access to but
I have a real feeling that at least some
that you will so thank you guys so much
for watching this video I hope you got
some new ideas on some new eyeshadows
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
