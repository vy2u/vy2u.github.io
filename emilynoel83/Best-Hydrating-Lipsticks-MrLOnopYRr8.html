this video this one is a topic that I
really feel like I'm kind of a
connoisseur of and it is lip products
but specifically those lipsticks that
are really kind of hydrating sort of
like a hybrid lipstick lip gloss tinted
lip balm type thing and I feel like
there are a lot of brands coming out
with things like this and so I thought I
would give you like five of the types
that I really enjoy we're out of the
five that I'm going to mention our
drugstore so a lot of affordable option
just like I did with you know the nude
eyeshadow palettes I think it's kind of
fun to take something that's sort of a
trend right now or a popular product
category and really look at you know
what things are the best in that
category what I feel are the best are my
favorites first thing I want to mention
our favorites from way back they've
really been Emily Award winners until
the lip butter scheme how long this past
year which I love the color selection of
and I'll get to those in a little bit
but the Palladio herbal tinted lip balms
and I know that title is tinted lip
balms but we need to kind of take
ourself out of the box and stop thinking
so much title and what these actually do
because these are actually really richly
pigmented equivalent to a lipstick type
type product here they have great color
a nice amount of shine and they look
like just a typical lip balm and so I
love the shade and rosy which I just
swatched and then if you're more of a
neutral girl there's one called golden
pink and it's just beautiful but these
go on with a really nice amount of color
and that gives just the prettiest kind
of golden sheen takes your lip color
your own natural lip color but takes it
up a notch super comfortable on the lips
again they have that lip balm feel but
so much color so I really kind of
consider them like a hydrating lipstick
product next I have to mention the
Revlon lip butters because I love this
product I love how I feel like I have a
little basket of them over here for the
ones I have and I'll just pull one out
you know and on any given day you know I
enjoy so many of the colors and I love
the texture and I like that there's
different finishes too so you know berry
smoothie when people ask me what my
favorite one is I always feel like I get
a lot of wear out of this one it has a
shimmer to it but it's just such a
wonderful wearable berry type color you
know really enjoying lately cherry tart
which is kind of a creamy red but it has
a little pop of brightness kind of a
sheer really perky peppy looking red and
I like pairing that sometimes with red
velvet which is a deeper like bright
pinks lollipop is is beautiful
so is sweet tart I mean so is Strawberry
Shortcake creme brulee I mean I will
wear any of them for various occasions
but I love the feel give you lipstick
like pigment and color while just
gliding on a product that I feel is very
similar to the lip butters but I almost
like the packaging format even better
are the Milani HD advanced lip colors to
look at it in the packaging you think
well that's a lipstick but I tell you
these go on with such such nice shine
and and just they really make the lips
feel comfortable and I like that it's
smaller you can just slick one of these
on really super easy in that shade that
I just watched is called um right here
that's called classy nude and then this
shade that I'm going to swatch here is
raspberry blush and it's just a really
pretty berry pink but I like those
because I feel like they're just a hair
sheer I mean you're still getting nice
color but some of these two shades I
feel like are a little bit sheer just
very super wearable something I've
discovered recently it's a brand new
product and I feel like it's more on the
lipstick side lipstick lip balm but all
the color all the saturated color are
these wet and wild mega shield lip
colors SPF 15 now they might look kind
of similar to like the matte lip colors
which I really didn't like that much I
thought these were very dry they're just
not my style they're not my lip style I
like something that you're going to put
on it's going to feel super good on the
lips and it's going to shine a little
bit and these mega shields do that I
actually am wearing one of these that I
pulled out here in pink slip that's what
I have on now and some of these have
shimmers some don't they these last
these probably outlast anything I'm
going to mention this
video probably the longest wearing they
go on feeling like a lip-balm they feel
so good going on they have good staying
power some are going to be creamy some
are going to be pearly pink slip again I
guess I didn't need to swatch it but
that's that's the one I'm wearing right
now and it has just a little bit of a
frosty feel but I really love the color
and then there's another one here called
it's a girl this is another pink shade
so watch it in a different direction but
this one is just a little more creamy
and you can see the color is very
intense it's almost like a little more
intense than all these so what I'm
getting at here more like a lipstick but
it has a really comfortable feel and it
hydrates nicely but that one is super
pretty pink this is a great crepe creamy
red and this is called a current affair
gorgeous red and it you can just tell
that there is some saturation there
getting past the titles so much I mean
this is something that you might call a
jumbo lip pencil but talk about feeling
great on the lips the tarte lipsurgence
and I've accumulated one more this this
one is in enchanted and it's kind of
like a little bit of a rosy color on
super easy because they are this kind of
you know pencil type idea and they just
twist up so when you want more you just
twist it at the bottom
can't really critique these much at all
I just I like the format I like the
colors that I have this is sweet
this is moody and this is enchanted and
they're all really pretty and again it's
it's a very comfortable feel on the lips
so that's just what I wanted to tell you
about in this videos a to where they're
kind of a one-step lip product in a lot
of cases I wouldn't feel the need to
layer one more thing on top of any of
these I also wanted to give a quick
mention
I've tried one of these and granted I've
only tried one but the color riche lip
balms from Laureus in tender mauve and i
will say i wasn't very impressed by this
I felt like it felt kind of a little bit
greasy err on the lips then the lip
butters did and also the color payoff
was not much at all for this one on me
I'm letting you know they're out there
and some of you may like them and that's
really I'm just trying to find things
that I think are kind of like the whole
ball of wax all together feeling good
looking good and giving you giving off a
lot of great colors so thanks so much
for watching I hope this was informative
for you and I will see you again in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
