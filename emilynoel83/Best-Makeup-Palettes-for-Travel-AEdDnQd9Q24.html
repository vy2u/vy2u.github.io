great day I can't believe Christmas is
getting so close right now and this is
actually a video request that I've been
saving up until a little before
Christmas when a lot of people will be
traveling someone had asked me what are
the best makeup palettes for travel and
I thought that's a phenomenal idea and I
have a lot of palettes that I consider
to be great for that purpose because
sometimes when you look at makeup
palettes whether they are a big eye
shadow palette or maybe they've got a
lot of different face things in it
sometimes they're so big they're really
just not convenient or not practical for
travel so I have found some sort of
small ish palettes and some of them can
still do a lot of great thing else I'm
talking about I have kind of a variety
of price ranges and a variety of
functions as well so hopefully this
gives you some ideas if you've got
something similar in your collection
you're like oh yeah that would be a
great thing to take with me when I go
back to see family or what add some of
these palettes I might have already
posted a review on or a blog about so if
I have those I will post them as links
down below in the extra info so I want
to start off with a palette that is
really like super tiny I mean talk about
travel friendly this one is like smaller
than my hand and it's from NYX and it's
the bronze smoky look kit they have a
variety of different kind of color
combos in these little kits but
basically what you get are nine
eyeshadows and two lip colors and a
couple little applicators there so as
you can see the bottom part slides out
but NYX shadows are wonderful quality
they have other I think ten color
eyeshadow palettes that are also great
for travel I love this because it's so
small and this particular palette I
really enjoy because I like these bronzy
Browns year round I mean it kind of
strikes you to look at it as maybe
something that would be great for summer
but I think that these colors look
fantastically is that word fantastically
flattering on all different skin tones
all different eye colors is another
Mallett that i think is super cute first
off is from Tarte and it is the eye
couture palette and I know talked about
this one before I think I got some
swatches on my blog but it has this
gorgeous purple quilted look to it and
then you open it up and I like that it's
not an overwhelming amount of colors
here you've got two four six eight ten
different shadows you've got some nice
light shades but you've also got the
colors that can make this into a
wonderful smoky eye if you want to so I
think that's an important quality in a
travel palette you know you don't have
so much to where you're kind of
overwhelmed with color but you've got
enough to give you some variety this one
also comes with a double ended brush one
side works nice as a crease or kind of a
smudged out liner type side and then one
is more of a typical eyeshadow brush you
also get a double ended liner which I
must admit is not my favorite but it's
there if you need it and you also get a
nice big mirror which i think is a great
quality for a palette to have when
you're on the go got to mention it
because I know I've traveled with this
more than a few times and it's the Urban
Decay Naked palette yes I have posted my
review on The Naked 2 and that's
something I think just in a quick
nutshell here if you like kind of a
variety of different smokey looks I
think you can get more of that with the
first Naked palette because you've got
like dark brown dark plum and kind of a
dark grayish black here that you can
create different looks with paired with
the mid-tone colors and the light colors
naked2 has a lot of like medium to light
tone shades and only a couple of darker
colors so if you go for more natural
looks all the time you might kind of
gravitate more toward naked too both are
beautiful both had beautiful colors and
both are actually I mean the same basic
size here so either one you know is
great for travel because it is so
streamlined there's not a lot of excess
packaging with this so you get what you
get you can easily throw this in a
travel bag no problem and great quality
eyeshadows I want to give a shout out to
kind of a rediscovered neutral palette
that I think is really great and I don't
feel like I've heard enough about this
but this is from ELF and it is one of
their 32 color palettes which I
believe sells for $5.00 and this is the
warm option with that so what you're
getting if you kind of look row by row
with me across the top you've got some
nice light shades then you've got some
warm Browns and neutrals in the second
row third row I'm seeing like some berry
and wine colors and just really pretty
warm shades and then across the bottom
you've got kind of a nice array pretty
much across that whole row of dark
colors so variety and this is nice if
you like relatively neutral looks
probably the least hit miss of any elf
palette I've tried I can honestly say I
like most of the colors and do get some
matte some shimmer some metallic righty
for the quality I think this is really
worth more than five dollars and I think
that's just the size the portability
right now you might be saying where are
the colors show me a colorful travel
palette and I have one and I know I've
talked about this on a couple of
occasions but I just want to give it a
quick shout out again it's the smoky
palette from Coastal Scents this is
great because if you look closely at it
if you're thinking okay how do I use
that or where do I even begin well
you've got one two three four five six
different sections of color you kind of
have some direction when you look at it
that way and these shades really are
like bright and pigmented they look
right in here they show up bright on
your eyes so I think it's a great
palette for variety and if you really
have no idea what you're gonna want to
wear or like what kind of outfits or
looks you want to go with you could
pretty bit much pull off everything here
from a neutral smoky eye to something
really bright and colorful pretty much
everything I've talked about so far has
been a palette for eyes and I don't feel
like I have a lot of great palettes that
also contain face products that I feel
are really nice and portable but one
that I know I've spoken about before is
my Malley more perfect palette and I
there's actually now an even more
perfect palette on QVC I asked for it
for Christmas we'll see if it comes but
this has six phenomenal very wearable
eyeshadow
that I get good out of all the time from
the dark smoky colors to the mid-tones
to the light tones it's very these are
very well-put-together shadows they're
not just like you know okay random
eyeshadow colors just throw it into a
palette these are you know truly
saturated colors that go on so smooth so
rich you've got a couple blushes here
which I love especially this pink one
which is called mal a slow blush have
that individually as well I love that
shade and then you've got more of a
peachy blush and then over here you've
got an eyeshadow base and an illuminator
so that's kind of a cream product that
you can use to highlight you know any
area of your face you know big mirror
here too so that makes it so much easier
when you're traveling be able to pull
out something like that you don't know
if you've got enough bathroom counter
space for you and all your sisters or
whoever to use so it's nice to have
something like this this is a great size
and like I said I shadows plus some
blush colors plus some other products in
there so that can make it even more
travel friendly one more thing I want to
mention in case you're not aware about
the Z palette this is so cute this one
is zebra print you can get them in
different fun styles and I believe this
is the large size and they have smaller
sizes too but basically what you're
looking at here are some deep potted
shadows or Coastal Scents makes those
hot pots which are like little
individual shadows and they are they
magnetized right in here that's a very
strong magnet in here nothing's going to
fall out it's nice and sturdy with some
shadows you'll find you have to add a
magnet to the back just because I mean
that's the nature of the the pan or the
product that you had there but some will
magnetized right in here so I've got
like some big Stila
shadows a couple of blushes over here
but this makes a really great travel
product can you you can switch this out
and completely customize this to
whatever shadows and shades you like I
actually haven't switched my out much
because I've got what I feel like it's a
lot of variety in here already but love
the Z palette and I think
it's very streamlined like I said none
of these pallets have a whole lot of
frills to them but they are very
practical very functional they're going
to work with you size-wise they're not
going to overload you with product to be
traveling with and variety of price
range is there too so hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I definitely wish you all
safe travels for the holidays octagons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
