to talk about a product category that I
am pretty passionate about and if you've
seen my makeup collection videos you
know I got a lot of lip gloss going on
here and one of the reasons why is
because I love a good shiny lip I've got
some distinct preferences where lip
glosses are concerned in a lot of times
when I watch videos I see great shades
that people recommend and their favorite
colors but here I want to kind of put
the colors on the back burner and talk
about formulas that I really love then
you know if you're interested in a
favorite that I mentioned you know you
can go to the store check it out and
pick the shades that you really like
again what I'm looking for in a good
formula and you can kind of see if your
mentality on this matches up with mine
but I want something that is not going
to give me super sheer color I want to
see the color you want it to be a decent
thickness to where it's going to last on
my lips I mean I expect to reapply these
you know several times throughout the
day but there are certain formulas that
are so thin they just slide around so I
don't want that I also don't want it to
be too thick and sticky and feeling
goopy and feeling thick on my lips just
that feeling I know we've all had that
where you put something on your lips and
you're just like oh can I just get this
off right now you know it's kind of my
criteria here so I'm going to take you
through as quickly as I can because I
got a lot to talk about the favorites
and then the not so favorite
went way back to before I even started
making videos I fell in love with Revlon
Super Lustrous lip glosses my sister was
a big fan of these two I remember going
to Walgreens with her and you know these
were the ones we point out like those
are the best and this shade I'm holding
up here is actually called pink pop but
the formula on this is almost I mean I
would practically call it my ideal
consistency is such that it is not
overly sticky it's just sticky enough to
kind of cling the lips so I really enjoy
that I wish they made even more color so
NYX mega shine lip gloss these kind of
remind me of the Revlon Super Lustrous
you can find creamy colors you can find
shimmery colors there's a huge color
range with NYX mega shine make your lips
almost look fuller in that you don't see
so much the lines in your lips when you
put this product on and your you might
hear me say that with some more of these
favorites because I love that quality to
a lip gloss Rimmel stay glossy this one
is fairly new this line came out at some
point earlier this year I believe and
what I love about this is that it gets
better the longer it's on your lips how
often will you hear me say that about a
lip gloss not one of those where your
lips feel like like they almost want to
stay stuck together and that's a problem
for me if I use a too sticky lip gloss
and I'm doing the news and I'm talking
talking talking I can get so annoyed by
us so this is not sticky and the more
you wear it I've said this before it
becomes like one with your lips the
texture of it just kind of um it's it's
so unusual it's not quite like anything
else I'm going to mention because you
put it on and just it's smooth still
definitely a gloss but it does wear a
decently long time and I've gotta say
I'm a fan of the texture also elf super
glossy lip shine probably the least
expensive good range of colors this also
has an SPF 15 and I think the thing that
surprised me most when I tried these was
that I thought these were going to be
another one of those squeeze tube lip
glosses that went on way too sheer for
me and these actually give off the color
that you would expect by looking at it
I'm very impressed by that these are a
dollar so if you are really trying to
pinch pennies that is a great great
lipgloss to have now I got a few
high-end ones I want to mention one is
the one I'm wearing now and this is from
Malley this shade happens to be orchid I
like this applicator where it comes out
of the brush and in a little bit you're
going to hear me talk about another one
of these where I do not like the formula
mostly light colors in this line from
Maui and even the light ones the the
almost nude toned ones really do show up
on the lips the brush gives you a lot of
precision and you can go kind of right
out to the edge using mallies philosophy
where you go right out to the edge they
really catch the light
pick up that shine and your lips look
fuller they look very even around the
lips and these do not stray outside the
lip line whatsoever so you can kind of
go to the edge with confidence that it's
not going to feather so I have a few
NARS lip glosses and I've got to give
them credit
these are pricey but they are very
smooth very saturated I want to compare
this to one of the drugstore kinds I've
talked about I would say maybe a Revlon
Super Lustrous it's there's there's a
similarity they feel like I get a super
wet look with any of the NARS shades I
happen to own but they are still a nice
amount of gloss but a lot of color so if
you're looking for bold color this shade
I believe is dolce vita and i'm really
nuts about that
the ones but I don't like so much for a
variety of reasons and first one I'm
going to talk about is Stila lip glaze
another one that comes out through the
brush tip and I don't have a problem
with that but I find that any of these I
have I feel like they're really sticky
and I've had Stila lip glaze too before
and I just have it loved that I don't
feel like they consistently give off a
great amount of color another one that I
feel like is too sticky is the Milani 3d
glitzy glamour gloss not only is it
sticky but it goes on too sheer this
looks like a clear gloss on me and I'm
not sure what's going on with that I
want it to be I want that pretty peachy
color but that's not what I get all
these all the rest are not too sticky
they're too thin and not pigmented
enough Rimmel moisture renew was not
very impressed by this line of lip
glosses
I love the moisture Renu lipsticks and I
love the Rimmel stay glossy but these
just were not a hit for me I've got a
variety of colors and they're definitely
one that if you want to wear these and
you want color put it on top of a
lipstick because you won't get much
color on their own also
covergirl shine blast way way too thin
and watery for me okay and also very
transparent you see right through it to
your lips on color burst lip glosses not
nearly as good as Revlon Super Lustrous
in my opinion and some of them are kind
of creamy this one for example light but
it's not extremely opaque so you don't
necessarily get what you think you're
getting with all of these when you look
at the outside of the container
finally elf minty lip gloss I have a
couple of these I got a brighter shade
just to see if it was just the fact that
the other shade I had was too light and
that was why it wasn't showing up but
this amount of sheer it's just too sheer
look at that you're not getting anywhere
close to that with this it's just so
sheer its glossy smells minty but it's
too sheer and plus it also tastes really
minty so I do just I am tempted to just
lick it right off my lips
that gives you some ideas on some of my
favorite and my least favorite lip gloss
formulas again we're not talking color
here I may not have even mentioned
specific colors with
this because what this is about is
actually how they feel how they last you
know how they wear throughout a day so I
hope this point you in the right
direction with some good glosses so
thanks for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
