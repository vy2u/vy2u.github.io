where lots of people are showing a
little more skin and wanting to get a
good tan to go along with it and the
safe way to do that is by using self
tanners and I've used self tanners for a
long time I've tried many different
kinds and in this video I'm basically
going to tell you about some that I like
some that I don't like I'm going to
incorporate both high-end and drugstore
enters for body tanners for face so I
really want to cover everything in one
video so you know what things I like
what things might work for you
start off by talking about what I've
been using lately that is really the
top-notch product for me and it is from
bare essentials and it's called faux tan
and this is has been a really popular
product on QVC actually it's won some
awards through that and I recently got
this in this nice big size and it comes
with this really really dense brush and
I know we think of brushes for our face
you know for face makeup but this
actually applies you just squirt some of
the product directly on this really
dense flat top big sized kabuki brush
and you just swirl it on in circular
motions or you can kind of you know just
go like this I tell you what I have not
had any streaking issues with this
particular sunless tanner it's really
amazing I mean I kind of had my doubts
when I saw how dark the product as you
can see it's you know kind of from there
it's it comes out very dark and it does
have a tint when you put it on so it's
not it doesn't go on invisible you can
definitely see where you've put it and
where you haven't takes your hands out
of the equation you know it takes the
finger streaks which was is what I would
normally if I wasn't using a gradual
tanner if I was using any other
self-tanner somewhere on my body I would
be able to see the streaks created by my
fingers and with this this is so nice
because you can put this all over and
you can get it right down here on your
hands you know and but never before
could I do that because then you have to
you know you get the product all over
your hands and then you wash your hands
and guess what from your wrists down
your white okay so this works really
well for that let's see this is probably
two applications I applied it and then
two days went by and then I put it on
again so this is the sort of thing you
get you don't have to use it every day
and it'll still hold up it actually
builds really nice rich dark color it
was described really well on QVC they
says they said that it was the tan of an
olive complexion person you know it's
not Orange
I actually have one application of this
on my face so um you can use it on your
face I mean I have not had any adverse
reaction from using this on my face I
just kind of wanted to see what it would
do because I've
we used it only on my body and I can see
that you know it might be the type of
thing where for every two applications
on my body I might do one on my face one
of the biggest things about this bronzer
that makes it so awesome is the way it
fades off I have that has been my top
complaint from sunless tanners from the
oftentimes a lot of them from the
drugstore and they fade like you like
you've got like a scaly look you know
what I mean like patchy scaly stuff and
this just kind of you know like that
when I got this you know I've used it
for a week and then week or so went by
it was cold it was you know it was not
good weather I wasn't wearing short
sleeves or anything like that so I just
didn't use it for about a week's time
and the tan began to fade but it didn't
fade in a really unattractive went on
before you go out on a night out you're
going to notice a tan but the next
morning you're really going to notice a
tan so keep that in mind with the way
this develops like I think three to four
hours might be what it takes for that to
fully this is not a typical sunless
tanner scent it's almost a little bit
sweet and I can't quite place it
the best one I've tried from the
drugstore is from Banana Boat and it's
summer color and I've used this in deep
dark color I went through I've gone
through one of these and this one is
about halfway gone and this really does
give you a good dark tan this isn't so
much a I don't feel like it's like a
classic gradual tanner like Jergens or
something like that this is more of a
darker tanner a little bit faster tan
it's probably the best at not giving you
an ugly fade when it you know as the tan
goes away if you don't choose to use it
for a couple weeks you cannot be a
prisoner to your tanner you know you
can't feel like oh my gosh I start using
this now and then I have to use this
every other day or for the rest of my
summer or whatever you don't you
shouldn't have to feel that way so this
is a pretty good one again when you're
using your hands to apply it you gotta
be care if you got kind of try to keep
your fingers together and not get those
finger streaks and I think you do get
better with it the more you do it if you
like the gradual Tanner's let's say
you're more fair complected and you want
to just get a little bit of color and
you don't really so much even want that
much of it is Jergens natural glow
foaming and the foaming one dries so
fast so you put this on and it will you
know absolutely it almost instantly you
feel like there's nothing on your skin
there's and you don't have that feeling
like you just put on lotion or anything
like that so it comes out as a foam the
color does build up pretty well after
you know use it for like three days
straight you'll really notice a change
and you're in your coloring and this has
been an allure a beauty Award winner um
a lot of people go for this one probably
my favorite self tanner for the face I
got this as part of the QVC Beauty test
tube and is the alpha-beta globe as from
dr. Dennis gross these have an
anti-aging element in them and it says
anti-aging exfoliating self-tanner so
that's kind of cool how all the steps
are combined but these are just like
little towelettes and you have plenty of
juice in these to get all over your face
down onto your
what a area so if you were just kind of
concerned about this area showing you
know and it's great you have more than
enough and you will notice a tan like a
good tan out of these talk about sunless
tanners for the face that don't work and
this and that this will really give you
a great natural team okay now sunless
tanner that I really didn't like it's
from L'Oreal and it's the sublime bronze
clear self-tanning gel oh my gosh I use
this for a few days and loved it I
thought the color was great I thought it
really built up a good tan and then I
didn't use it for a few days and this
has been the worst culprit of fading and
making me look like some kind of
alligator or something like around my
arms I mean I didn't want to wear short
sleeves because it was that bad and I
once again it's you choose when you want
to put these things on you should not be
obligated to put them on you know on a
certain schedule every day you know it
needs to fade like a natural tan fades
and this does not so that's big thumbs
down face tanners um this one from
Jergens natural glow I tried to make
this work I use this really consistently
and I just couldn't see the color
building up on my face and I wasn't
exfoliating like crazy you know I gave
it its chance to work and it says medium
to tan skin tones this does have SPF in
it it sounds like a great thing but it
just didn't um didn't deep in my skin
that much you know if I'm going to take
the time to put it on I want to see a
results so for face tanners this one's
kind of and not so much for me so to sum
this all up I know I talked about a
bunch of different products and I was
kind of thinking at first I don't want
to mention all these but I do want you
to know what I think about this stuff
and um faux tan is definitely I mean I
know it is a high-end product but this
really is the best sunless tanner I've
ever you very much for watching have a
great day and make sure when you tan you
tans safe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
