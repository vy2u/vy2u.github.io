this video this is going to be another
one of those kind of top favorites
videos I've done several of these before
where I pick my very favorite items from
a particular brand and you can probably
check back and see what those are but
I've done like top fives top tens and I
wanted to do sort of a top favorites
from the NYC brand New York color it's
available usually at like Walmart stores
for example and other drugstores too I'm
sure but I also wanted to point out my
least favorites because I've kind of
been asked that you know you're telling
us your favorites but what about the
things you don't like because I feel
like almost every brand you know has
even when they have some great products
there are some duds too and I really
feel that way about this particular
brand so well I've got more things I
think that I've found that I like than
what I don't like at least from what
I've tried so far I want to tell you
about both of them I've got ten things
in my like list and five things on my do
not like list so and these won't really
be any in any particular order like I'm
not ranking them one two three four five
I'm just gonna go through first ten and
then the ones I don't like okay so the
first thing I'll talk about is a matte
bronzing powder that they have it's
called a smooth skin bronzing powder if
you can see that there and this they
have I think just one color that it's in
and it's in sunny so this is a matte
bronzer that you get and matte bronzers
can be kind of hard to come by
especially if you're in the drugstore I
feel like so many things have shimmer
added to them and a lot of us don't
necessarily want that I have this matte
bronzer dusted on I used it on my face
this morning when I was getting ready
for work and just it's just nice to use
with like a big fluffy kabuki brush just
swirl it in there dust it all over
because with matte bronzers you can
contour with these much in a much more
natural way contour the cheeks a little
bit and just for that all-over dusting
of color it kind of just lays down that
you know natural look so you're not
layering you know a shimmery bronzer
with a shimmering highlighter and blush
and all that so matte bronzer is
definitely a good thing to have in your
collection and I have recommended this
to a lot of people who say you know I
can't afford to spend a lot
but you know I want to get something
that's good quality so and that's the
deal with a lot of these products that
are my favorites from NYC because they
are very very affordable like this is
not going to probably cost you more than
three dollars so that's a great deal
there another thing I like a lot another
face product here is the NYC smooth skin
loose face powder the shade I have here
is 742 a it's naturally beige I think
they might have a translucent powder but
this is a really nice thing I never saw
a little puff about her come up there
but this is a really nice space powder
and loose powder is such an economical
choice I mean you get so much it's
usually not very expensive this does not
have shimmer in it either this is not a
mineral powder I want to make that clear
this is a loose face powder I tend to
use some sort of loose powder to set my
makeup um another one that I really
really like is the Mary Kay loose powder
but if you're looking for something
again you can just find in the drug
store pick up real quick the NYC smooth
skin loose loose face powder is a nice
way to set your liquid makeup and keep
it lasting a little bit throughout the
day I like their eye shadows that are
the color wheel mosaic eyeshadows this
one is in brown eyed girl and you can
see what you're working with there
you've got kind of a variation and
finishes you've got a couple of sort of
maybe you just satiny finish like Browns
like these two are the same these two
are the same and then you've got two
others so certain ones you have more of
than others but like this shade it's
just kind of a shimmery kind of peachy
tone you've got the brown you got this
gorgeous like reddish brown here kind of
a rust color and then a nice highlight
in the middle and these are super super
soft like you just Pat your finger in
there and it's a surprising amount of
color that you get off there that's that
really pretty kind of rusty color and
then
you got this that's kind of like that
champagne shade a pretty Brown you know
these are surprisingly nice quality and
such a cute little package too you get
it all there just like that and they
have I know they got a set of purples
they've got some with like a turquoise
blue mixed in with some Browns and
possibly silver or something like that
so but this one just really caught my
eye and I think it probably I don't have
any of the others but this is just my
favorite color collection that they've
put together for a nice neutral look so
they're very inexpensive again all these
products are very very affordable um
another eye product that I like that I
just recently started trying and I have
used this for two weeks now I ran out of
my Revlon Colorstay liquid liner the
kind that looks like a little inkwell
and you stick the applicator down in
there and and you know I love that I
think it lasts so awesome it's like my
holy grail liquid liner but I kind of
felt like okay I've run out of this I
sort of want to test something out
because I like to keep you guys updated
you know on what I think's good and
stuff and for about four or five dollars
less I got the NYC liquid eyeliner and I
was so surprised with this I had
actually gotten a magazine it was one of
those you know those hair magazines
where they show different styles with
like sophisticate hair magazine and I'd
never gotten one of those before but one
day I just picked one up and I noticed
they had a lot of makeup suggestions
like different recommendations for
different looks and some of like the
Stars favorite items and this was Megan
Fox's favorite eyeliner and I thought
hmm
NYC really and so I just had to try it
out this is like under $2 and I love the
fact that it's it's got a nice nice
skinny skinny little brush there I like
the long handle I almost feel like it's
yeah I don't know just a little bit
easier it just glides along so quickly
I've got that on as my liner today it
lasts as far as I can tell this has
lasted me as well as the colors stay
it doesn't take like a long time to dry
I'm trying to think of annoying things
that have happened to me with liquid
liner it doesn't come off with like a
shiny or metallic finish you know it
just looks straight-up black and that's
the color color I have is jet black I
think there might have been a brown to
UM but yet goes on completely black does
not take a long time to dry I just can't
find anything wrong with this and it's
so so cheap so this is probably the
cheapest liquid eyeliner that I've liked
the best it's from NYC again the that's
what I've been talking about the whole
time but it's really really good alright
my last six favorite products are all
lip products dye as a whole really enjoy
the NYC lip products so I'm just gonna
take you through them one by one here
really quickly I kind of got to speed
this stuff to get through everything but
here's one that I really like it's the
NYC liquid lip shine in number 554 a and
I believe this is called sungold pink
and this is the color it is it's kind of
it's very multi-dimensional it can look
pink and also very gold
it's what I'm wearing on my lips right
now it has a really nice texture to it
I'm not super wild about the scent the
scent is a little strong and it's not
like necessarily bad I don't know almost
like a little bit of a floral e scent to
it and I'm not wild about that kind of
smell in my lip gloss but I can deal
with it because I really like the
texture not too slippery not too sticky
but gives really great color and great
pigmentation on the lips so this is a
really really nice gloss there another
product that I like that I just recently
tried out was their smooch proof long
wearing lip color and the shade I have
is 483 and I believe it's called rebel I
hate how that's the one thing I don't
like is how sometimes the shade name
isn't on there but this is like kind of
a medium kind of Mavi pink it's got a
little bit of shimmer to that shade but
um yeah it's really nice this this feels
very light on your lips it's maybe just
a step up from a stain
and that a stain feels super light on
your lips and this feels really light
too and at last I mean this lasted me
through a whole part of my day the other
day I just haven't had issues really
with the staying power on this I think
it's great this basically what you do is
you put on this and then you let that
get dry and then you put on the gloss
clear gloss coat the strange thing about
this for me is that this smells kind of
sweet and sort of like vanilla II this
the color side but the gloss you put on
over the top that you might want to keep
reapplying doesn't really have that same
sort of sense so I have tried some long
range things that I think might have
lasted a little longer but this is for
the feel that it gives on your lips not
feeling like that much is on there I
think it's really good another lip
product I like are these little tins
that they have these remind me a lot of
the elf candy shop Lipton's but some
people you know either can't find those
in stores which a lot of people can't
and or you don't want to make an online
order so this is something you might be
able to find in your local Walmart in
this shade that I have is called sugar
kiss it's a light pink
it smells like cotton candy that's what
oh geez I dropped it
sorry guys alright it's okay it hit and
fell on the right side but yeah it's
just a really pretty pink has a very
sugary
cotton candy great scent and it does
give you like a light pink tint to your
lips the next thing that I have is one
kind of product but I have it in three
different shades suggestions for you and
it is the ultra moist lip wear and it's
basically this kind of lipstick they
have that looks kind of like a bullet
it's got the sort of the rounded cap on
there and these are really good I really
like these lipsticks I think they're you
know how to give you a nice bold color
you just kind of need to know what
shades to get and for a really nice
shade of red that's sort of like a
slightly deeper red I like this shape
which is called sheer red yeah this is a
very very nice
shade of red I feel like if i swatched
it for you on my hand here that's sort
of the shade it's not the loudest read
I've ever used but like I said it's
sheer red it's not I mean it's it's a
very very wearable read if you wanted to
get into that sort of for maybe like a
work look or something then they have
retro read which I like as well this one
you're going to see it right beside
sheer red and this is a little bit just
a little bit thicker it's right below a
little bit brighter
I think this I think retro read maybe
has a slightly more orange undertone in
it where a sheer red has more that
bluish undertone you've heard people
talk about although you clearly wouldn't
see blue it's the undertone that the
shade has so those are two good red
shades though and then on the other end
of the spectrum a nice light shade this
is a light pink it's called chiffon I'll
swatch that up above hopefully you can
see it maybe not it's it's just a really
pretty light sheer pink it's gonna look
like you know just a nice light pink
there maybe you can see it a nice light
pink frosty glaze on your lips it should
it's very sheer but I just like it a lot
and these are cheap - these are like
less than 2 bucks for those lipsticks
now time to move on to the products I'm
not quite so fond of from NYC the first
one is the maximum boost volumizing
mascara
cute cute packaging but my goodness this
did nothing for my lashes guys you get a
pretty big brush just the brush is like
a spiral type it spirals all the way
around the wand I just didn't like it it
didn't do anything for my eyelashes did
not build them up was not buildable the
formula it's a little wet it's just I
don't know this this is just what did
really nothing for me I was expecting
more maximum boost volumizing mascara
really not so good you can find a lot of
drugstore mascaras that are better than
that
if you're looking for some quick
suggestions I just predicted that as
being in question silhouette would ask
me L'Oreal hip mascara covergirl
fantastic lash the alum a triple effect
mascara there's a few a drugstore
options for you next thing I don't
really like the NYC cover stick in green
yeah this would be the type of thing you
would get the concept behind green
concealer is that it would neutralize
Reds and I got this and honestly even
when I would blend it out all it looked
like was that I had put a green makeup
of some sort like I used it for the like
broken capillaries on my nose and it's
just like if I rubbed it on my hand here
you probably can't really see but I did
it just continues to have a green
appearance and I just it wasn't really
blending in well enough to truly
function as one of those color
correcting things another product I
don't like is the cheek glow powder
blush in Central Park pink this it's
very light so I couldn't really expect
this to you know give me wild color on
my cheeks but I found it to be very
chalky I found that didn't show up
hardly at all I just I don't know I love
covergirl cheekers that's what that
would be a great drugstore option this I
just it did really did nothing but
really make my complexion look a little
more bland I didn't really like that and
then this other thing that I don't so
much like I think I featured it a long
time ago in like a haul video and I
don't know that I ever really got back
to you about what I thought but it's
this Metro quartet in best of Broadway
these are sort of the newer shadows
they've come out with and I just don't
think they're very well pigmented at all
I don't know I just I find them to be
like a little bit chalky even this this
pretty shimmery shade here like I don't
know it doesn't show up that great these
aren't the worst in the world but really
if you had your choice I'm sort of just
showing this more as a contrast between
this
and the one I talked about earlier the
mosaic this is such a much softer more
pigmented formulation than these are so
that's just my comparison but then again
you know you don't necessarily get like
all the blacks I'm not sure I don't
recall if there's like a shade of these
heads blacks in it but this does try to
have black but I don't know it's just
not quite that bold and so I don't know
just my opinions on the stuff guys but I
wanted to pass all that along to you
lots of information in this video I
realized that I just thought it would be
more helpful to you to get both ends of
the spectrum not just what's best but
the things that I haven't liked so much
either so thank you very much for tuning
in for this video and taking the time to
watch it and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
