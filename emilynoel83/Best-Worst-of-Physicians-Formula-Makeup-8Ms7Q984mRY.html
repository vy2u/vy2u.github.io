tell you all about the things I like the
best and the things I like the least
from the brand Physicians Formula it is
one of the more expensive brands in the
drugstore you might be a little more
hesitant before you pick something up
there because you're thinking I'm going
to be paying you know between 11 and 13
dollars maybe for this face powder or
this bronzer how well does it really
work so hopefully I can answer some
questions for you in this video I
haven't tried everything the line but
I've tried a lot of things and if
there's something I don't mention in
this video it's either because I haven't
tried it or I don't have a strong enough
opinion on it one way or the other to
name it best or water test I had done
some like my top ten products from this
brand or that brand type videos so if
you like that kind of thing you can
watch some of those also more recently
my one brand tutorials have shown you
know not only products in action but
little reviews on all the products I use
so that's kind of another way to get
informed on one brand kind of in one
video it's you know bringing back the
best and worst might be kind of fun here
so I'm going to start off with some
things that I like a lot and the first
thing is a product that's been a
longtime favorite of mine from this
brand and it's the Physicians Formula
shimmer strips and this particular shade
is Waikiki strip but I think there are
other good sort of shades out there but
why this is so cool is that you're
getting basically five strips of color
here and you can use it kind of as a
highlight more towards the top where
you're getting some these peachy more
golden colors and it's nice and light
and shimmery but then you're also
getting things you could use as a
bronzer or all these can be used as
eyeshadows which i think is a really
great thing they do function very well
as eyeshadows sometimes you know bronzer
or highlight might be sold as something
sheer and then while you might want
sheer on your face you don't want sheer
on your eyes these all come off with
kind of a nice pigmentation that can
make great eyeshadow as well so I think
this is one of the best things they have
I think it's a multi-purpose product of
a products I think are good are on the
happy booster first off the translucent
the powder and this is kind of like a
sheer highlight is what I would consider
this to be so as you can see there's
different tones in here like some really
light colors some beige a little bit of
pink and I feel like when you put this
on you've got a great highlight that is
not overly shimmery which i think is
very important I think when we wear
highlights out of the house you know
I've got it on my hand here just a
little bit I feel like when you wear a
highlight out you don't want to you know
look glittery you don't want to look
sparkly but you do want to glow a little
bit you want to enhance certain features
and bring them out and so I think this
is a really great highlight for the
degree of shimmer that it has it's a
little bit pinky tone but for the degree
of shimmer it has it reminds me of a
more high-end product from lorac called
perfectly lit powder and I have a shade
in spotlight that I love but this is
that kind of a thing you know it's not
overboard it's not glitter at all so I
think that's just a really nice
drugstore highlight and I also have to
mention the blush which I really like I
think this is a gorgeous shade for blush
and it's the same concept that they work
into a lot of their products which is
working in a lot of different tones in
one product and what you get with this
is a great a great shade of pink in this
blush and this is actually a dupe for
one of my very favorite high-end blushes
and I'm not going to tell you which one
it is because I have a blush dupes video
coming I'm just trying to find a few
more dupes before I do it but I just
really like this blush and I think that
that that would be my blush pick from
this brand that's the only blush I'm
gonna mention so you'll notice I'm not
mentioning a lot of face just straight
up face powders or a lot of lip products
any lip products because Physicians
Formula doesn't make a lot of lip
products I know they have some new ones
out but I haven't tried them and just in
terms of the face products I have tried
some but I don't consider them
outstanding or awful so that's kind of
why they're not getting featured I've
got some definite I favorites from
Physicians Formula they make some of
these shimmer strips eyeshadow sets
they're sets of nine shadows in like a
little palette it's very compact you're
not getting tons of each shade but there
are several of these kits that I've
really enjoyed over the year
and I'm going to go back to one of the
first ones I loved which was the smokey
eyes for hazel eyes and a lot of these
aren't designed to be for certain eye
colors but really if you like the colors
and you want see yourself wanting to
wear that I say go for it anyway I have
brown eyes this is for hazel eyes and I
have loved this one so much I like the
kind of mauve purpley taupe colors that
are great in here I don't feel like
there's a bunch of color repeats I think
that the shades are really gorgeous you
get a nice black in here as well it can
be sort of a liner shade and a great
range of light to medium colors so this
is just one of those really pretty
palettes I think this look can look nice
with really whatever you have on but all
the shades are shimmery so you were
warned in the title of that that shimmer
strips so I like this one for smokey
hazel eyes oddly enough another favorite
of mine is also a hazel kit and it is
from the pop collection and this one if
you saw my review I did on all the pop
shadows maybe a year or so ago this was
the one that was the standout this has
kind of a Mac cranberry dupe in there
all the shades are kind of different
from one another you're not getting
repeat colors the pigmentation is great
you're getting fun bright colors to play
with as well as you know a golden twist
that you can put on the look this is
just really fun if you like to
experiment with tones of mauve pink and
cranberry maroonish looks for your eyes
I think this is really really pretty and
several of these were not so well done
at all there was that's definitely you
know kind of hit and miss with some of
these eye shadow kits but these are my
favorites and one more favorite one to
tell you about is the nude eyes kit so
that's one with the really cute
packaging and I talked about this not
too long ago in my drugstore nude eye
favorites video but this is a fun one
guys this one has your hopes your greys
your black and then a wonderful range of
like peach to gold to champagne light
colors too and I've gotten a lot of use
out of this lately very quick you know
go-to palette and I think this can be
can totally be worn with anything it can
go as smoky as you want or as natural as
you position formula also has really
done some great things with their
eyeliners I really love their liners
that come like this
they are twist up so you're not having
to sharpen them but they are kind of
like their gel liners but in a a pencil
form and they're called custom eye
enhancing eyeliner trio this is the nude
eyes one and it came with kind of like a
champagne a brownish Cohen than a black
one which I had to throw out when I had
pinkeye so I'll have to get that again
if I want it but they they go on super
easily they stay on and don't smudge I
mean and they've got color selections
for anything you might want you know you
want to go more with the greens you can
get like a bright green one or purples
or whatever eye color you're interested
in but the nude eyes kit was more like
kind of a neutral selection of liners
and you can see you get kind of like
this light one too that you can have
some fun with so staying power I am a
critic of staying power on eyeliners and
these are really good options from the
drugstore as are their gel liners some
people prefer to you know take a brush
and use these gel liners these are cool
because if your little kid is bored and
you put this in your purse they could
play with this like blocks because they
snap apart all those like a Lego um but
no these are really cool because of the
staying power aspect also the creaminess
and they just you know you're getting a
trio of them you're getting several
colors in one term so what I don't like
I only have about four things to mention
to you here but I feel pretty strongly
about them all one is something I
reviewed way way back if you've seen
this video you've really been with me a
long time but it is the bronze booster
self-tanning bronzing veil get this
around for this purpose of knowing how
it's probably going to do like a top or
worst or whatever Physicians Formula
video what this is is a teeny tiny brush
it's a brush that's too small to be
applying the product that's putting out
which is a tinted self-tanner with
golden glitter in it and you have to put
this on your face it doesn't make sense
like what sequins do you put it on you
put it on under
your makeup over your makeup it's got
glitter in it what you know you want it
to be in close contact with your skin
because it's a self-tanner but yet it
doesn't make sense to put glitter under
foundation I mean it's just a very
confusing product the execution of how
it you know comes out the delivery
method through here is not effective
you've got to end up like putting it on
your hands and then rubbing it on your
face it's a little bit orangie I cannot
really think of any reason why I would
recommend this it could be maybe a
better body product and then a face
product but it's marketed for the face
so um anyway I'm not a fan so don't
really care for the bronze booster glow
boosting sunstones I have them in light
to medium this is one of those products
where you're going to dust your brush
over a bunch of loose like pearl looking
things so you undo the cat you've got a
brush here and a puff and then you've
got these things I've never been much of
a fan of dusting my brush over loose
pearls I just I personally don't really
get the point some people might just
love the thought of doing that but I'm
kind of like why why don't you just
press that for me and make that into
something flat or I don't have to worry
about you know being on the go and
losing some of those little pearls and
then stepping on one getting it smashed
into my carpet I don't know there's a
lot of things that could go wrong but
the bottom line is the the way this
product looks on the face it doesn't
show up much as you can see they're
they're pretty light and I do have light
to medium here but it doesn't bronze me
up much at all it doesn't really do much
of anything it's kind of like a
middle-of-the-road
shimmery powder because it's not light
enough to highlight and it's not dark
enough to be a bronzer and I don't like
the pearls so that's why it's on my
worst list another thing that might
again just be kind of a personal
preference thing but granted this is my
video so I get to choose what's the
custom eye enhancing mascara duo
um the mascara I feel is kind of average
what you get here you know it's a rather
large brush it's a rubber brush with
very very short little bristles on there
so I
think this is an outstanding mascara by
any means it's a little bit dry which I
tend to enjoy but it didn't do it
doesn't work wonders for my lashes and
then what they give you on the other end
is something that I never used and that
was like a really bright um
colored mascara if you're watching this
and thinking oh my gosh I've been
looking for a colored mascara girl check
out Physicians Formula because they've
got all these colored mascaras but for
me I will never put something on my
lashes that's going to take away from
the effect of the dark rich thick lash I
really have no desire to put to top my
lashes with a color in any way and
that's just me like I said personal
preference but I like a good black lash
this was not sufficient really to get me
the look I wanted and then the colored
end I would never use so that's why that
is on my worst list I mentioned that
some of the eyeshadow the shimmer strips
eyeshadows that they have are kind of
hit and miss you know not all of them
are wonderful there are a lot that kind
of fell in the middle of the road for me
but one that definitely was one that I
did not like was the pop collection for
brown eyes this looks like this should
be really intense the reason why I don't
like it very much as some of the shades
that you might expect to be like the
most intense really don't turn out to
give you as much as you would expect
color wise you see something being
marketed as something that's going to be
bold on your eyes make your eyes pop the
colors are going to pop and then it
doesn't pop um it just doesn't go
anywhere for me so that's the pop for
brown eyes your call the hazel eyes I
really liked and I noticed a big
difference in the way those shadows came
off and these just weren't quite doing
it for me wanted to definitely let you
know about that so if you see this in
the store you're not thinking this is
going to be some fantastically pigmented
wonderful product because I feel like
the shades are a little bit dull I hope
this cleared some things up for you
thank you to those who requested this I
also got a request for a video like this
on hard candy because I haven't talked a
lot about hard candy stuff at least not
as a whole with its own video so I will
keep that in mind too stay tuned for
blush dupes that's going to be coming
very soon I'm just going to
try to come up with a few more good ones
for you before I make the video so
thanks for watching guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
