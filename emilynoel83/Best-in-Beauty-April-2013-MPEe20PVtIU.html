beauty for the past month the month of
April I hope you guys had a great month
i would like to let you know that the
lawn mowers on my street are all running
in full force right now so that's going
to add to the spring-like feel of this
video yay or not a lot of things to talk
about in this video and only one product
is high-end so that's exciting for all
of us watching our budget I've got a lot
of rediscovered products as well you
know things that have been in my
collection a while and just kind of came
back to them I think it's really
important especially if you've got a big
collection of makeup to every so often
really look through what you have and if
there are some things where you're like
oh how to use that in a while pull it
out stick it in a little bag or a basket
or something and then that way you'll
remember to use it you know in the
coming week or month or whatever thing
I'm going to talk about are these little
elf elements palettes this is something
I totally got going long ago and I sort
of stash them away in a inconvenient
place and wasn't using them for a while
now I'm back to using them and I love
them if you check elfs website and you
go under eyes this is under the custom
section and i also find these at my
local target which is cool but basically
you get a compact and it's a nice
looking big white compact with a whoops
lost the applicator but it's got a nice
big mirror on it you know i'm really
handy and then you can choose whatever
eyeshadows you want to put inside the
palette and i think that's really cool
that you can totally customize it and
that means you know you could get some
extras switch them in and out as you go
for different look i recently did like a
face of the day blog post using these
shades right here including like kind of
a smoky shade couple of neutrals this is
like you know my classic neutral palette
that I've made for myself I feel like
I've been directing so many people to my
blog lately like you know people wanted
an update on this or that product that I
might have mentioned or a review on
something that i instagramed or tweeted
about and they're like you know can you
tell me a little bit more about that I'm
like oh it's on my blog you know you can
check my blog for more informations on
my blog it's on my blogs on the blog
it's on the block so there's a lot of
stuff going down on my pole
like every single day new stuff these
there is a little magnet that comes on
the back of all I believe these will fit
your Mac sized I shadows too but this
one this light shade is ivory this kind
of taupe shade is called moon dust I've
got kind of a coppery shade called mocha
and my black color is called dust and
I'm not just telling you about these
because I think it's a cool concept but
these are seriously like some really
good eye shadows so I really enjoy using
these I think the pigmentation is great
and I liked it so much that the last
time I was in target I went and I picked
up some new shades I noticed they had
some new ones including this teal which
is super bold very bold teal a great
rich purple and a couple of other
neutrals which I'm wearing today this is
pink ice and this is I think it's a
peach fuzz or peach is okay is peach
fizz and I'm wearing both of those today
just for a really light natural look and
it reminded me of my duo in the top
shelf the bare minerals duo those two
kinds of shades together so that was
pretty anyway loving these pallets lots
of shades to choose from definitely
worth checking out from the other eye
shadow thing that I've been loving once
again lately from the good old days it's
my comfort zone palette from wet and
wild love this and I once again
mentioned this on my blog but I think
about this as a palette that is green
you know what I'm thinking of olive
green eyes or something like that I
think of this but really half of this
palette is just completely neutral great
neutral shades nice deep dark brown love
this medium brown kind of a pinky shade
of butter cream color and going back to
this one a lot and really all of my wet
and wild things like we all get new and
exciting palettes you know it's like oh
this is the next great thing this is
great I'm times just those nice little
handy trios and things like this are so
easy to grab and I just love the quality
of the wet and wild shadows I feel like
every time I go through you know and
shadow application with something like
this I've come away thinking wow you
know how is it Sochi comfort zone in
particular has been my friend this past
month and it's like 499 at your
drugstore another great great I thing
that I love so much is the Milani shadow
eyes and these sticks are every bit as
long wearing as you know the maybelline
color tattoo so i have those great um
shadow sticks from malli the upper color
shadow sticks gorgeous shades they twist
up so they've got that going for them
but they're in a stick form and I think
that's great to have these sticks
because you know especially with the
darker smudger shades it's very easy to
use them you know as a liner or smudge
them out in some way just real quick
application this particular shade that
I've been wearing quite often under an
eye look and wearing it under today's
just for a little added glow it's called
champagne toast and the shade is
beautiful and you can absolutely you
know you can smudge it out a little bit
at first it's red there but once it sets
it's there for good teal a green purple
so some nice brighter options but this
is kind of nice if you're just looking
to try one of these and like wear it as
a base for pretty much any eyeshadow i
think it's great more rediscovered thing
and it is my elf warm bronzer yeah i
once upon a time use this a whole lot
but hadn't really picked it up recently
that's because a lot of times i talk
about bronzers as a means of contouring
like you're too faced chocolate soleil
or your NYC sunny and different ones you
know they're great matt bronzers they
can perk up your skin tone but they can
be perfect for you know contouring your
cheekbones and stuff like that bronzers
can also have another purpose for just
giving your face a little bit of a glow
like after your total application is
done it's like okay I just want a little
more pop to my skin I do not want
Sparkle I don't want glitter I just want
you know a little bit of a sunny kind of
look and that's what this is these here
you've got four shades and when you
swirl them all together what you
actually have is kind of a light golden
color not overly shimmery
and these can also all work well as
eyeshadows to or you can focus in on
just one certain shade and then you have
a very light highlight there for example
it's like kind of going in there with a
blush brush dusting this all over and it
just gives your skin just a really nice
healthy clip some new lashes to talk
about yay um you know I love the salon
perfect or ardell demi wispies I think
they're perfect you know they're thick
there a little bit flared out at the
ends and I found something that has that
same amount of thickness but not quite
as much length so I think they're a
little more natural I'm wearing them
today and they are the Katy Perry lashes
by I allure and they are in the style oh
honey and you have to say it like that
I'm thinking of you my southern viewers
but these are just so nice and they do
get a little bit longer at the ends but
not quite as long as the demi wispies
don't get me wrong I'm not calling these
like super natural looking false lashes
they're gonna be a little bit glad just
a great lash for added thickness and I
know a lot of people you know maybe
think about prom and doing some false
lashes for that I think these would be
great also I have like a very
comprehensive fall / tutorial for those
of you who are trying them out for the
first time video covers picking them out
putting them on taking them off cleaning
them off so it is really just start to
finish on false lashes but this is a
type that I know didn't get mentioned in
that video in 1 set I've got a backup
now I feel like these have lasted me
multiple uses now welcome to the pink
section of its favorites everything I've
got now is pink I've been loving pink
lips and it's like other things on the
face of been just following suit you
know one pink lip color I'm loving right
now is from Revlon and it's one of the
new lip butters that came out you might
find these at Target or ulta and this
shade is sorbet so beautiful just a
really pretty pretty shade of pink there
so this is going to be your brighter
pink almost bordering on magenta type
color I think it's so creamy it really
pops it really brightens the face I love
it also enjoying the color whispers so
much these feel very
right on the lips they're a little more
buildable than the lip butters so like I
mean I feel like sometimes with lip
butters you put them on and the color is
pretty full-on you know just one swipe
and you're good with the color whispers
um it's like when you first apply them
they can seem kind of light and then you
can build it up a little bit more so
it's kind of like you're getting several
colors in one they feel very lightweight
on the lips I feel like I like pretty
much every color i have i've been buying
more and more but for the pink family
which i've been wearing a lot i love
this petal rebel shade that's where i'm
wearing today soft pink but it's still
very pink you know so that shade looks
like this I'll give that a little swatch
aroo here there's that and so it's
creamy you know it doesn't have a bunch
of sparkle and shimmer and then I also
love lust for blush this is going to be
more of your like nude pink softer pink
light mauve type color how many ways can
I describe this one shade right but
that's right there so now that I've
twisted my wrist halfway around there's
the pedal rebel there's lust for blush
so it's gonna be a little bit more of a
muted pink but I really like them both
as a goal something there but i like
both those shades very much and i think
they're very comfortable to wear i feel
like i've just been gravitating toward
you know the lip butters the color
whispers those one-step kind of products
where you know gloss is optional as far
as I'm concerned they've got a nice
little bit of shine there but paired
with all these pinks I do like a pink
lip line my favorite favorite one of all
time is the Jordana easy liner in baby
beri it's my favorite pink lipliner I'm
going to put a line of that right here
to show you it's right there who doesn't
look dark and thats watch it's not that
door I'll this video under awkward
swatching okay it's it can be deep um
but as you I'm actually wearing this
with this color applied very lightly
sometimes I just go over the top of what
I've already got on you
oh and just add a little bit of extra
you know definition there it can be very
chameleon-like for all your pinks but I
love that as a pink one and so I decide
I'm going to do my pink lips and I want
to paint blush and I'm loving the in
stain blushes from the bomb check out my
review for swatches of all of these but
lace lace has been my go-to for a pink
that I think looks natural it looks like
you've been kissed by the Sun or just
gotten a little bit you know like you
just been outside i'm wearing it today I
haven't been outside but I look like
maybe perhaps I was outside for a short
period of time because I've got this
little pop of color on myself and it can
be very vivid these are powder blushes
that actually do stain so the staying
power is fabulous the pigmentation is
two thumbs up big time please get my
video on these if you want like every
possible detail on these blushes but
lace is one of my favorites couple of
body products first off my Ulta sheer
fragrance mist in fresh water mist I
love this scent this is just makes me
think of clean and summer and just love
it fresh out of the shower I like to
spray this right when I get out of the
shower or before I get into bed I feel
like it's just such a nice fresh clean
since one of those sense where like
Tyler will tell me oh you smell good but
he won't be able to pick out like you
smell like raspberries or you smell like
cinnamon rolls or you know one of the
super specific sense it's just a very
nice fresh clean scent so enjoying that
also oh this is so cool airbrush legs
Sally Hansen in a lotion form do you
remember when this was in a spray can
and it sprayed out and it was as if you
were just gonna airbrush your legs right
on with the spray can you know no way
Jose it was messy I would end up
spraying it right into my hand and then
it wouldn't blend really easily onto the
skin so I would always pump on some
lotion some regular old body lotion so
it could actually spread out on my legs
and not
look like a caked up weird medicine you
might use the airbrush legs is to just
get like a really perfect look on your
legs and there are colors that can their
shades that can make you look a little
more tan and it's just a really light
gives your legs a perfect flawless look
and I have always said I feel like my
legs are more sensitive than my face I
will get red bumps on my legs I'll run
into a coffee table and bruise my leg I
will have a bug bite on my legs you know
everything's happening to my legs and so
I want to you know make them look just
nice and perfect and flare brush legs in
a lotion form it is all ready to go this
is like what they had before with the
great color and the basically like leg
makeup type coverage in it but now it's
really easy to put on I love it in the
tan shade because I think it just gives
my legs a little bit more of a tan look
if you want even more of a glowy like
I'm a star singing on American Idol kind
of look where your legs are just like
luminous you could add you know a couple
drops of any kind of liquid highlight
type product and it would really give
this a glow as well as far as it's being
transfer resistant or water resistant I
don't notice this transferring onto
clothes I do get in the shower you know
it'll totally wash off no problem it's
not like hard to get off so I would say
maybe minimal amounts of water you just
could hold up for but obviously you're
taking a shower it's going to wash off
oh that's it that's all I've got for you
thank you so much for taking time to
watch again feel free for daily updates
new reviews all kinds of other stuff to
check out my blog that's media broadcast
net and I will see you again next time I
