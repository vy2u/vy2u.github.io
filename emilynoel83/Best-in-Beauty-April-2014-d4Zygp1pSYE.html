beauty my favorites for the month of
April and I have compiled quite a random
assortment of things for this month the
things that I've been using a lot
enjoying a lot I've got some
rediscovered stuff that I've made a
point to kind of shop my stash for and
just try to use some things that I
haven't been using much and then some
new things all the first thing I would
like to just give a quick mention to
because i know i have talked about this
a lot in the past but I've been really
getting back into my Revlon Colorstay
whipped I'm the shade warm golden I
think this is such a nice texture of
foundation and it seems to work really
well for even if your skin might be a
little bit dry or a little bit oily it
kind of I don't know balances me out a
little bit that's the way it works for
my like the finish on the skin I find it
a little more easy to blend than like
the regular colorstay especially the
combo to waylay formula so photographs
really really well just an all-around
super drugstore foundations so I've been
using that a lot also I feel like I'm
running all over the place this morning
didn't have what i needed sitting right
in front technically like blush and
highlight and this was something that i
discovered as i was like taking
inventory of my entire makeup collection
for that four or more tag and so I was
going through and pulling everything out
and Counting it and seeing what I had
the most up and something that I was
like oh I need to be using that is this
malli blush and highlight duo it's
actually called the 24 7 professional
blush but this is the illuminating
version I guess mine says pink satin and
it's the lighter tone but what you've
got here is a creamy highlight and
normally with Malley's like duos there
is a blush cream and then a powder blush
right beside it but here your creamy
thing is your highlight and these work
together so beautifully I had forgotten
like how nicely they look layered one on
top of the other this highlight here is
not like something that contains a bunch
of glitter and sparkles so it really
looks fresh when you put it on I like to
use my ELF small stipple brush and just
go into that and kind of blend it in
on the tops of my cheeks I think you can
see it there and then it totally comes
through the blush when you put this oops
right there when you put the blush on
top of it it's like you get just the
perfect marriage of color and finish
that way I don't know what it is but you
might even try this if you don't have
this exact product if you've got a
creamy highlight try putting that on
first and then put I mean this is
probably like a satin finish blush and
put that over the top and it looks so
beautiful it's like you don't look
overboard with glow I believe when I got
this it came with this little double
ended guy so you'd use the flat part to
put that highlight on and then this to
buff out the blush and it works but i
find that i'm most likely to use it when
I've got my ELF small stipple for the
cream and then just any random blush
brush for the blush part love it what's
next what's next um my all about eyes
from Clinique as I hold this to the
light I can see that I've used probably
about half of this now and this is my
morning I cry got this in the clinic
party favors kit I believe that came out
like a little bit before Christmas time
and I remembered being maybe a little
indifferent about this product in that
review like I thought it was a nice eye
cream but the more I've used it and I
guess maybe compared it to some others
that i also have in my rotation this one
has a really really smooth texture and
it does not um feel the least bit tacky
on the skin like you you feel like it's
actually absorbing and providing some
good moisture right when you're using an
eye cream in the mornings I think is
just really important that it doesn't
interfere with the staying power of all
that wonderful makeup you're putting on
there so this has just been great for
that extra moisture boost it says
diminishes the look of circles shadows
puffs and lines I don't know if I can
vouch for all of that I think it might
be a little bit on d puffing I do think
I noticed that but as far as diminishing
circles I have an experience and this
has been something I've consistently
used for probably the past two and a
half months now for added moisture in
that area but not getting too much
that's been awesome
guys know I love my lip balms right I
feel like I've been doing a lot of like
lip related stuff lately trying new lip
products doing lip dupes and the process
of seeking those out has been long and
kind of difficult over the past month
not that I don't enjoy it but it can be
a little taxing on your lips so once I
am done trying all that stuff I need
something to put on that just makes my
lips feel heavenly again and I've been
loving my Nivea lip balms I pulled out a
couple that I really really have been
especially liking one is the kiss of
berry swirl and this is kind of cool
this one does not leave really hardly
any color on my lips I mean it's
basically clear but look at swirly and
it smells like raspberry candy I mean
it's just a delicious scent it doesn't
have a lot of flavor on your lips or
color like i said but that great Nivea
lip balm type moisture that you're
accustomed to from these so that's great
and then the kiss of olive oil and lemon
I've had this one for a little while and
I've just been pulling it out more
recently very very fresh scent to this
one don't be turned off by like the
olive green color there it does not tint
your lips in any way but it just feels
really nice it just feels like you're
giving your lips a drink after you put
these on and for a lip color I've been
in a pink phase lately a very like
enjoying my medium to light Pink's a
whole lot that drawer of my lip stuff
has been getting a lot of action kind of
rediscovered but it's the Revlon super
lustrous lipstick in pink in the
afternoon and this is what I'm wearing
now um could that be any more of a
classic pink you know this shade is a
cream formula so it doesn't have any
sparkle to it these super lustrous
lipsticks nearly got mentioned in the
forum or tag i do have tons of the i
really like the cream formulas of these
that go on super smoothly evenly nice
and pigmented staying power is not
amazing but you know I don't mind
popping open this tube and putting out
it's like just such a classic you know
iconic makeup product from Revlon you
need to have at least one anyone out
there who keeps up with my blog knows
that I've been trying to not neglect my
single eyeshadow
so much there are so many great pallets
out there and it's so tempting as you're
getting ready for the day to just grab
one and use from it but I've got a lot
of single shadows that I also really
like you a couple weeks ago I went
through my collection I just pulled out
random different ones that I thought I
hadn't been using much and made a point
to get them into the makeup rotation and
i found a color combo that i think is
just stunning and if you don't have
these particular brands and shadows it's
all good i think you could find
something similar and put together this
color combo on your own it's great
talking about is a rose gold paired with
a plum just give it a try it's really
really pretty on the eyes you know this
all over the lid this buffed up into the
crease smudge down below it looks so so
pretty and the specific shades that I've
been working in our the elf baked
eyeshadow and toasted so see what you're
getting there that really really
metallic finish these are nicely
pigmented shadows from ELF and then my
burberry shadow in mulberry and this was
a gift from the lovely and talented
Kristen game and see how that's very
plummy it looks even more purple on my
camera right now it sometimes comes off
with a little more burgundy in it as I
blend it out sheer it out on my eyes but
those shades together are just mmm
they're yummy they're like separated at
Birth gorgeous shades together if you
know me you know I can't leave those
pallets untouched entirely and I will
say I've been very very attached to my
it cosmetics naturally pretty matte
palette review de talked about it
recently featured it in my it cosmetics
one brand tutorial but these shades are
just so fun to work with so blendable
beautiful tones I think it's great for a
quick look or you can go deeper and
smokey I mean you can totally go there
with a dark I with this palette and it's
easy this is what I'm wearing today and
I'm wearing love on the inner part of
the lid and in the crease I'm going to
have to just hold this still for a
second because my camera just can't take
the glare but I would tap into all heart
as well as violet and so just go like
boo boo boo boo and
then blend that into the crease and then
take some of this pinky shade blend just
above I mean if you are a fan of those i
looks that just look like they blend up
into nothingness these are gorgeous for
that because they're very easy to you
know just take a buffing brush with and
get a super soft but yet pigmented look
you're working with great shadows and
then under the lower whoa I just about
fell out of my seat ah this is a crazy
morning lower lash line I've got some
all heart and what's this shade iconic I
don't use that one a lot it's like a
really deep plummy blueish shade so I
got some of that in the outer corner but
look and lastly a little hair product
shout out this little guy ran away from
home recently and by ran away from home
I mean got into the back back of my
bathroom drawer where I thought I had
lost him for good but he came forward in
recent weeks and I've been using it a
lot this is my little like teasing brush
normally I use a comb for that but I
must say this brush works awesome and it
says I'll just show you up close what
that brand name is because i got it at
Sally's and it says spornette and it
says little wonder it's the little
wonder it's not like varying lengths of
bristles some plasticky pink bristles
some shorter looks like more natural
bristles you can of course use this nice
pointed tip to section things off or
maybe give a little boost in there once
you've already teased but it just does a
really nice job and I would venture to
say I feel like I teased a little less
when I use like less times that I'm
going like shhh to the hair and it's
just doing a quicker job with it so like
that a lot and that my dearest concludes
my best in beauty for this month thank
you so much for watching let me know how
any of these things that i've mentioned
have worked for you if you've tried them
and i will see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
