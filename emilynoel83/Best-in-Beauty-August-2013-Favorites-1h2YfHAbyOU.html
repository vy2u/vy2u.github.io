this is my best in beauty video for the
month of August so my favorite things
from the past month makeup wise I've got
a hair thing as well to tell you about
but I'm gonna start off with makeup and
I've just got so many favorites and most
of them are drugstore so that's cool
speaking of which this blush which I'm
wearing it now I was wearing this and a
couple other products I'm gonna mention
in a recent face of the day type post I
did on my blog I instagrammed a picture
and had a lot of questions not only
about eyes but the blush and the lip
color and so a blush that I think is
just outstanding this is from actually
boots number seven so that's a line at
Target stores err I find it at my target
here in the states and it's called coral
flush its natural blush tint powder so
it's just a powder blush and if you get
up really really close to it you might
be able to see a little sparkle but
honestly I feel like when I put it on my
cheeks it's pretty mad but it's just one
of those shades that I think coordinates
really well whether you're doing a pink
lip or a nude lip or if you're doing you
know maybe a bold eye and you still want
that pretty healthy flush to your cheeks
you know I think this is a great shade
and really nicely pigmented very smooth
nice color payoff and right along the
same lines price-wise of other drugstore
blushes so I think this is great quality
and I kind of want to try some more
shades so a couple of newer products
that just kind of snuck in on my
favorites this year or this month
it's the Sonia Kashuk lip products and
there are a couple that I've tried one
is this lipstick here and I believe I
heard about this on Miss crystal makeups
channel and this is what's it called
specifically Gus the print is so darn
small okay
it's the shine luxe sheer lip color and
the shade is sheer pink lust and it goes
on actually is a really pretty like
peachy nude shade I think it's just
beautiful there's so much shine in this
puppy I can't believe it's so smooth and
moisturizing this would be great if you
love those newts that aren't necessarily
a beige but have a little more peach
tone to them it's gorgeous and a lip
gloss what kind of turned me on to this
was I had done a swap actually it's on
my vlog Channel with Melissa from Elle
mphs
and she had sent me a gloss kind of a
plummy color and she was like you're
gonna love these this is great texture
great lip gloss and I really did love it
and then I found another shade in the
store so you know it prompted me to look
around at Target a little bit more and
this shade in the lip gloss is fairest
plus is a really beautiful kind of nude
pink shade and I'm gonna put a little
bit on top of what I've got on now on
top of that lipstick and you're gonna
see how opaque this glosses these Sonia
Kashuk glosses it's hard to talk about
glosses kind of fascinate me because
it's a thicker gloss but it's not sticky
at all so it's got a really nice texture
tons and tons of shock I said I really
like the deeper shade Melissa gave me
but I think the lighter one is great as
well and you really don't have to you
know layer on top of this lipstick I
just wanted to show you the shade
because this is so opaque it can
definitely stand on its own and look
just like this I tell you I'm really
trying to wear a lot of the things I'm
talking about in this video so you can
see what it looks like and one of the
things this was just mentioned in my
Avon reviews but this Avon extra lasting
shadow stick or it says eyeshadow pencil
but it's just like one of those creamy
jumbo shadow sticks and this shade is
amethyst I think it's gorgeous and this
is I set it in my fruit view but the
closest thing to the Mallee shadow
sticks which I love that I found because
it's twist up it's not too terribly wide
the color is just beautiful taupe with
like a hint of purple in it I'm actually
wearing that as a base it gave me even
more shine on my lid and just so long
wearing totally smudge proof I want to
get more of these pencils as soon as
possible another eye favorite that I'm
also wearing today and this is just one
of those things that's been in the
drugstore for a while and I'm like
kicking myself that I hadn't bought it
already but I saw Kristin game talking
about her top like I think was drugstore
neutral palettes and this was one of
them it's the Maybelline quad in
designer chocolates and then I told her
I was like I can't believe I haven't
tried this one yet and then like
lickety-split she just sent me one so I
thought that was super sweet of her to
do but this quad is so great on so
levels you've got like a pearly white
shade this is just kind of a nude it
goes on maybe with a satiny finish this
really pretty rosy mauve color just
gorgeous
and then this matte Brown I've been
using this quad a lot lately and I just
love the intensity you can really get
out of it I mean I didn't throw in any
other shadows with this look and I think
that this is a little star right here
this gorgeous rosy color and then all
the other shades really have a nice
amount of pigmentation to them as well
way I use this today was I did the
pearly white kind of around the inner
corner like I said I used this jumbo
stick as a base for it all then I did a
little bit of the rosy shade on the lid
faded it into the brown did the brown in
the outer corner blended it inward into
the crease a little bit and then as sort
of the transition or blending out type
color I brought in that rosy shade again
right up here on the border and then use
this lesser lesser shimmery nude shade
as my highlight right under the brand I
just took one of my swatch fingers and
dabbed it right over my eye look and
then I took the dark brown on the outer
corner of the lower lash line and
continued inward with the the mauve kind
of shiny color and I just love this I
love it so much thank you Kristin for
bringing this up I'm sure some of you at
home are thinking oh I have that that's
great just been getting into using my
drugstore quads a lot more lately and
another one so excited to tell you about
this one this is the color riche smokey
eye squad from L'Oreal the shade is love
to hate me
you know haters gonna hate and this is
so freakin pretty I think you probably
know what drew me into this you know
this really pretty blue and then I got
to looking at the palette in the store
and I'm like you know I like that they
threw in the brown as well because I
think they can kind of anchor the look
and make it a little more neutral if you
want recently I've actually tried quite
a few of these different quads and
they've been a little hit and miss you
know some are not necessarily the most
amazing quality but this one I'm really
just shocked by will I ever learn not to
swatch right there
it's my body like that way around but
there's that pretty blue the white shade
the shade that appears to be white
actually has a little bit of golden tone
reminds me a bit of Mac's nylon but it's
a little flaky I'm gonna warn you on
that one it so I like to really pack it
on and make sure I'm using some sort of
base underneath this is like the
charcoal silver shade and then a
gorgeous matte Brown really been
enjoying this and I love how this blue
you know it's kind of a step up from
being a deep dark navy it's got some
true blue color to it so when you pop it
you know kind of on the outer part of
your lid or something shows up is the
color that it is and I think that's
really impressive so nice little smoky
eye quad there are a couple of favorite
tools to tell you about one is from
Sigma and this is from this came in that
performance eyes kit and it is the
blending a36 got to show you just a size
comparison this as you can see I've been
using it this is the I believe the e25
brush here and see how much smaller this
one is that I'm talking about here I
still like to use this one I mean I
think it's great for crease colors one
of my favorite all-time brush is
probably discovering that a great use
for this is for those what I call
blending shades are some people call
transition shades you know right up in
here when you've got your deepest shade
in your crease and you're sort of
bringing up a little a little bit of
blended out color just above the eye
this brush just as wispy and light as it
is is perfect for getting in there so
for example like today when I use this
quad I go into this rosy color a little
bit on my brush and then you know take
it right up in this area and it just
gives the softest amount of color in the
past you know I would use this brush for
that but now I'm getting into using that
a little bit more just getting shadow in
the crease because it's got more density
and this one for its lightness is just
beautiful for getting those shadows
worked into that area so whether you're
using a shimmery shade a matte shade
whatever that mid-tone Shane is you're
popping in there this is a great brush
for it my other tool obsession for this
month is this from Real Techniques it's
the lash brow groomer mainly because of
this metal lash
Combe life-changing absolutely changes
my life because I've been using let me
show you what I've been using trying to
comb through my lashes okay you get a
clumpy coat of mascara on you need to
you know get rid of some of the clumps
this is what I've been using before this
was from Coastal Scents not a bad
product but look at these thick like
kind of bookends on each end of that
comb how is that really gonna get in
there to your lashes when these are too
wide to really get in and separate this
comb see how there's nothing on the ends
of it it's just a straight up comb so
that's going to really be able to get in
there and it has it has just been great
for getting through my lashes it's great
for I go like this to get under the
lower lashes as well or like this to get
through the top and it's just perfection
it really gets in there and tip though
is that this fine comb will get clumped
up with product pretty easily so I
pretty much clean it off after every
time I use it but not a problem this has
been a great product I'm sure there are
other brands that are putting out metal
lash combs I'm not saying this is the
only one around but I got this from old
so I've really been enjoying it and then
it has you know one of these brushes
where after you do your brows you can
brush through them as well it's like
I've been working kind of backwards
today because now I'm gonna talk about
foundation and I've been combining
foundations quite a bit lately main
combination has been my Mac Pro Longwear
which this is unless I'm really
self-tanning big-time this is a little
dark for me but I combined a little bit
of the tarte maracuja miracle foundation
and I tell you what the combination of
the two not only does it create the best
shade for me but it also is like the
perfect finish I've been doing this so
much in that picture on my blog and on
my Instagram you know I was doing this
with my foundation and what it gives me
is something that's really long wearing
but not a dry kind of flat finish on the
face this gives some glow this has been
a foundation I've recommended in the
past for people who are dry but want a
long wearing foundation because I feel
like a lot of long wears are geared
toward an oily skin
person because they're trying to attack
that oil this actually is long wearing
in itself but I feel like it's even more
so when I pair it with something like
this I will also sometimes put this in
with my estee lauder double wear or
Revlon Colorstay so this is a great
little mixer foundation day I am wearing
it with the Mac and I'm just very
pleased with the finish the staying
power the way I mix them together is I
just do like a pump of this and a pump
with this just on my fingers and I rub
them together dotted everywhere and buff
it in with like a sigma f80 brush
goodness gracious we're still going this
is from gosh when I was in New York very
briefly recently I went to a Duane Reade
and got to look at all the gosh makeup
and I'm not sure where else this line is
sold I'm sure their website says but
it's a little bit pricier than a lot of
drugstore makeup is but this is a
multicolored blush the shade is pink
pipe brace yourself this is gorgeous oh
so beautiful if I blend my finger across
I get see this really pretty shimmery
pink shade that's like the combination
of it all and on the cheeks that is so
glowy and pretty I've got to just do a
little bit here for you I like taking
sometimes a lighter brush dabbing it
over all of it tapping it off because a
lot color will come out and then this
pretty rosiness just takes over your
cheeks I love it it's glowy it's pretty
these shades individually are so darn
pigmented they are beautiful like as
eyeshadows so let me get a few on here
look at how lovely these are so
definitely a multi-purpose type product
it is one of those things that the
appearance of those colors together just
made my brain say want get it now so my
hair thing that I've been loving I have
been doing more wavy Styles lately I
used my new Bed Head bubble wand for
this look I'll have to do a video on
that because I'm just loving the way the
waves turn out I think that plus this
product really enhances the way the
waves look and just keeps them looking
even
shinier and more healthy you know and
it's the gut to be kinkier a double
curling power gloss and define curl
cream and with judging by the directions
I think this may have been put out for
like you naturally curly girls because
it says apply a small amount to damp
hair and work into curls diffuse or blow
dry as desired but for me I use this as
kind of like a curl defining thing after
my style is all done so once I get done
with taking the wand through my hair I
like to brush through it and get the
curls you know a little more light
little more air in there and then I get
just a pearl sized amount of this on my
fingers get it in my hands like this
flip my head over starts crunching I
kind of work it into my roots a little
bit for some extra volume there I just
love the way it puts the shine back in
my hair normally you know I expect my
hair to be shiny when it's straight I've
naturally really straight hair now I
love getting that shine even when it's
wavy and it has a nice scent to it it's
in a nice little pump too so it's very
easy to use there on your sink oh do we
go through some favorites there or what
