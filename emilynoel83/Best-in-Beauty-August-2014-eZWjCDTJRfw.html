this is August best in beauty my
favorite products over the past month
and I got to tell you I'm it's almost
laughable the amount of lip products
that I've been loving lately I mean it's
just been the thing I've been having the
most fun with I've been experimenting
with tons of different eye palettes you
know and that's been fun to we'll
probably be inundated with palette
reviews from me in the near future
there's just been so many things that
I've been testing out so I don't know
how many of you are keeping up with the
pregnancy-related vlogs over on beauty
vlog cast that's my blog channel I am
currently 37 weeks my due date is
September 17th so I don't know how much
longer I have to go in this pregnancy
the bump is really really out there
right now so thank you so much for
keeping me in your thoughts and just
giving me all the wonderful positive
vibes I appreciate in addition to kind
of just the vlog type progress reports
I've also done a couple nursery updates
on that channel as well but for now the
favorites the beauty favorites first
thing I want to talk about I know this
got mentioned in the colourless makeup
must have even since that time I feel
like I've been using it even more
consistently and it's my elf lip
exfoliator this little thing I've pretty
much been using it daily
after I moisturize I just run this over
my lips for as long as a minute really
which seems excessive but it totally
smoothes out my lips so well this is
such a cheap well item it comes actually
formed like a lipstick mine has
definitely rounded off since then but I
love that but if you haven't tried that
before the gritty texture is from like
sugar that's in there and it also has
kind of a sweet taste go figure so I
really like it another cool little find
that I randomly stumbled across a couple
months ago at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
it's the lip licious plump blends what
the packaging looks like it says visibly
plumping lip gloss I would say this is
like a minor lip plumper it does not
sting but it does give you like a little
bit of a tingle once you've got it on
there but the scent is absolutely divine
I can't even decide if I'm smelling like
a little hint of cotton
candy or maybe like frosting on a cake
can you see there's a swatch right there
just a clear gloss you could put it on
top of a lip product that as I let that
just stay on my lips for a little while
they start to look just a little more
rosy which is sometimes what happens
with lip plumper to some days after I
use this lip exfoliator lips are all
smooth and wonderful I give myself like
a thin coat of this stuff and it just
looks and great and you could just go
with that for the day really nice not
too sticky makes a nice little prep step
or a finishing touch type of thing also
if another video I did on this channel
as any indication I'm enjoying the matte
lips lately a couple of things that
don't necessarily pop into my mind as
being matte but it's always the finish
that they develop are on the Too Faced
melted 's and I have a full review on
the initial one soups sorry the initial
ones that came out but then they've
released some more shades as well and
I'm really liking those it's like you
put them on at first and there might be
the slightest hint of shine like if you
put on a creamy formula lipstick you
know there's just a little shine there
it's not like a gloss but just very
subtle these always end up getting to
that matte finish in no time it seems
like and the way I'm wearing now is
melted Barry love this shade the one
little downfall of these have is the
applicator is not incredibly precise for
some of these deeper and brighter shades
you've got to be kind of careful you're
really serious about it you might even
dab across the applicator with a lip
brush and then apply just to get like
really clean edges this shade absolutely
gorgeous and I've also loved melted fig
this is wonderful for those of you who
like the radiant orchid type things not
too purple though I think it's very
wearable I wore this to my baby shower
absolutely loved the look and these
lasts a really long time too another
total matte lipstick love that has been
somewhat rediscovered in my collection
are the Rimmel Kate Moss matte lipsticks
the ones in these red 2/3 that I have
are 102 103 and 109 102 the lightest
pink 103 is not far off from
look really really close it's just maybe
a little bit deeper and then 109 is this
really fun like Corley orange shade I am
totally up for any other shade
recommendations you have for me from
this line I think the texture is
unmatched seriously so smooth so
non-drying yet so richly colorful I
think they're just awesome I can't wait
to get some more of cheeks you guys know
I love digging into my collection
rediscovering something you know what's
old is new again I love that kind of
thing and the Maybelline Dream bouncy
blushes there's a particular shade if
you've really kept up with my videos you
know what one that is it's Hot Tamale
and I use that one a lot as a result of
that one being kind of the star of my
collection I have neglected other shades
that I've made a point to pick up but
they just kind of sit there like the
super-talented backup singers - Hot
Tamale that nobody's talking about and
so I'm talking about them now and I've
realized how much I love them one is
coffee cake doesn't look maybe as
exciting as the Hot Tamale color but I
tell you this gives off actually a very
beautiful look on the cheeks I would
especially recommend this to people who
have developed maybe a slight bit of a
tan or maybe you're doing a little bit
of self-tanning this shade looks so
pretty and of course I apply it with my
ELF small stipple brush I have this on
underneath another blush that I'm gonna
mention in a second so it's kind of a
nice base thing but it looks gorgeous on
its own let's look really closely not
seeing chunky glitter in this product it
has like a little sheen but it's very
wearable comes across with a really
pretty finish on the skin and while I'm
added another shade from this line that
you might kind of glaze over in the
store and you're like oh maybe that's
too dark for me it's called plum wine
look at this swatch stout and sheared
out a little bit it's such a pretty like
kind of berry type blunt you've got to
look at it and know you're not gonna get
that much intensity out of it but what
it sheers out to become I think is just
gorgeous I see myself wearing this one
quite a bit as we head into fall I'm
just so especially pumped up about the
things in this best in beauty video I
mean I just really feel
I've got some Rockstar items to the
another thing that I've been using a lot
is my benefit coralista blush and I'm
gonna propose an idea to you and you can
tell me if you think I'm crazy or not
but I think this blush makes my pores
look smaller does anyone else notice
that with this product it does have glow
to it it's not too much once you put it
like right even in the problem zone you
know the part of my face where I might
be most likely to see uneven texture or
pores I feel like I actually get and I
don't toss this term around much but an
an airbrushed type look from this
product I really really like that's not
to detract from the color at all I think
it gives a pretty peachy coral look to
the cheeks but also just the finish that
it leaves has anybody else picked up on
that something that a lot of blushes
don't do it goes beyond just depositing
the color but it actually does something
to the way the surface of your skin
looks so I'm loving this that smell I
haven't used it for a while and then you
pick it up and smell it and it's like
yeah why can't all blushes smell that
good I've also got a couple drugstore
products here that I'd like to mention
that have gone above and beyond in
comparison to some higher-end items I've
been trying a lot of those like liquidy
brightener type things lately the things
that you might put on top of your
cheekbones or your brow bones or
wherever on your face
to get kind of a highlighted glowy look
I gotta say I've been let down by some
more expensive versions of this kind of
product but the one that really works
well for me and I keep coming back to is
the Maybelline instant age rewind in
fair my product here it's down to the
bottom it's almost gone this product has
the perfect amount of opacity on this
not too thick but it also doesn't get
completely sheared out it really is an
awesome brightening tool and I just kind
of sponge it on and then blend it out a
little bit with a brush I got especially
on days where I'm using my really full
coverage foundation the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum coverage and then
it's like this is the only thing I feel
compelled to really pull in and just do
a little brightening create a little
oops there goes the cat
a little contrast here and there on the
face and it's like okay I'm done
where's my bronzer where's my blush I'm
moving on yeah a solid product I know it
comes in some different shades but this
fair color for my skintone it provides
just the right amount of like lightness
on the face in comparison to my
foundation color another little
drugstore rock star is my covergirl
clump crusher water-resistant mascara
I'm mentioning this because I had
actually kind of stepped away from this
product for a while I ran out and the
next waterproof mascara that I had had
come in a bareMinerals kit and it was
the it's a flawless definition yes it
was a flawless definition waterproof
mascara so I'm like okay this looks like
an easy enough to maneuver brush you
know it's nicely tapered toward the tip
and I thought I'll use that for my lower
lashes that's where I like to use
waterproof or water-resistant mascaras
because that's my problem zone down here
on the lower lash line is where I'll
have more of a tendency of transfer so
for at least a couple months I was using
that mascara in that way and it was
doing a decent job but actually
depositing more product on the lower
lashes than I was 110 oh it's a very
minor make-up detail on the face but I
was having to pull in my little lash
comb more often to kind of separate that
out and make it all look the way I
wanted it to covergirl clump crusher is
actually I think the best thing to have
on my lower lashes because I can build
it up if I want to but if I just want a
quick coat it just defines all the
lashes they're there lengthens them out
a little bit thickens them up just a
little bit does not clump them together
in chunks and does not make it look like
too much not to mention the fact that it
does not smear off or flake off and I
also love Maybelline lash discovery and
it gives me almost the identical look to
this but I think this might be just even
more long wearing and in the summer
months where it's hot humid I really
want to go for the most long wearing of
it finally little hair products shout
out to the Remington T Studio pearl
styling wand this was shown and demoed
in a tutorial I did like a couple weeks
ago
this thing for creating waves what I
love about it even more is that the
waves last a super long time on me don't
simply tolerate my second day hair with
this I actually like it I think I like
it even better maybe than the first day
when it has a chance to really loosen up
so it's just so quick and easy to use
check my tutorial if you want to see it
in action but I'm convinced you do not
have to spend a lot on you know this
kind of a product to get a good look
that's gonna last you a long time a
really good question stemmed from that
tutorial when I had mentioned being able
to sleep on my hair when it's in this
state and wake up and still have some
body and waves to April asked how do you
make that work so here's the easy cheap
trick I have a scrunchie yes these can
be purchased at Walgreens put your hair
up in a really high ponytail before you
go to bed it's kind of keeps me from
really laying down on the curls I'm able
to lay it you know keep the ponytail out
from under my head and once you take
your hair down in the morning the higher
the better on that ponytail because once
you take it down you have more volume
from the roots and the point of the
scrunchie is like for those of us fine
haired girls we're dense show really
easily in your hair if you used a rubber
band or a smaller elastic band take it
down from this and you can't see a mark
from where this was it was just a matter
of taking your hair out of the scrunchie
in the morning flipping your head over
you know working out some of those curls
again and then maybe using some sort of
like a curl cream I like the when
replenishing mist and just scrunching
the hair up again and it really revives
the curls so I hope you enjoyed this
video guys thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
