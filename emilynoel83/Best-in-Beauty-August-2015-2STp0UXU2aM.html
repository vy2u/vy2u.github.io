favorites today my best in beauty all of
the things that I've really been
enjoying over the past month or even
more in some cases
I know this is the part where everyone
says I can't believe the summers flying
by but seriously it's gonna be my
child's first birthday in the month of
September September 21st and I can't
believe it and I'm not gonna dwell on
that subject because for whatever reason
I feel like I just get emotional
whenever I start thinking about her
turning one I don't know what it is it
just makes me emotional I don't know
what to say and I don't know if my
camera's straight yet either but we'll
go with this also I wanted to say a huge
thank you to everybody who asked great
questions in my Q&amp;amp;A video that was my
last video here on this channel amazing
questions really really sweet comments
too like I couldn't believe I told Tyler
I was like people are being so so sweet
in the comment section so thank you so
much for the great response on that
video it was very personal so I feel
like I don't know it means even more
when I see your nice responses to it
also Lowell announcement I'm getting
back to doing the stuff I love videos on
my vlog channel which are totally random
favorites so I'm not sure if that will
go up before or after this video but
whenever it is up I will add a link to
the description box so you can check
that out totally random favorites a lot
of food favorites actually but starting
off with this video something I am very
excited to share with you is my little
blush method this is kind of a series of
products and I don't think you would
have to use these exact products but
these few have been kind of ones I've
gotten in the swing of using but most
importantly I think it's just a method
of applying the blush that really is
working so here's what I use a highlight
that has just the tiniest amount of
shimmer then a very glowy highlight and
then a matte blush okay so for example
these are the products I use and this
would be after I've got you know maybe I
bronzed or I've done a little bit of
contour and then I use my laura geller
baked french vanilla which I love this
is a much-loved product and I put that
just for overall lightness like in this
whole area here okay
then I take a very shimmery highlights
such as a mary lou manizer and i take
that right on top of the cheekbones here
so like shook right there from top of
the cheek back and now normally I would
apply blush before highlight but I find
applying the blush after particularly
when it's a matte blush it does
something so beautiful it takes the edge
off of that really shimmery highlight a
little bit but it just gives the
prettiest look so I've been using tarts
Dollface quite a bit and just applying
that right over the top and I feel like
I still get glow but it's I don't know
even looking up close at my face I just
think the look is so pretty it's almost
a little more natural than just you know
OOP there's my shimmery highlight on top
of everything I still feel like my skin
looks very glowy but it's just in a less
obvious makeup looking way so try that
I'm not saying you have to have these
exact products but a matte blush
shimmery highlight and a less shimmery
highlight just see what happens and tell
me your feedback there was a little like
sample bag that Ulta gave out well they
didn't give it out you had to spend a
certain amount to get it and mine was
like fluorescent yellow and it had all
these like pretty decent samples inside
and one that I just love so much I've
never heard of this brand before until
now it's called wish WH is H body butter
and this is the almond scent this smells
so freakin good oh my gosh sweet almond
holy sweet almond it smells so sweet and
delicious it says organic shea butter
organic raspberry butter and organic
aloe in this thing and I know it says
body butter um but it's not as thick as
a lot of body butters I have most things
labeled body butter are in like a little
tub for me you know I got think of the
body shop kinds this is much much
lighter than those it feels just like a
traditional lotion it still does seem to
retain some moisture so I love that want
to mention my lip products real quick
this is a lip product that I like
primarily for the color and the scent
another set related thing here it's my
the balm meet Matt Hughes and this
the shade comitted I've worn this
several times on snapchat I just burped
it's just a very easy shade it's peachy
it's fresh but it's also that matte
finish it does stay the tinniest bit
tacky on my lips I think I've compared
this to the feel of the NYX liquid suede
but now the more I'm wearing it I'm
thinking it's well it stays a bit tacky
it's not quite as tacky as those you
feel like and the scent on these they
smell just like Thin Mint Girl Scout
cookies right on the money
like not even slightly different or
almost like that they smell exactly like
that smell yours if you have it I mean
there is nothing else that those smell
like but Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies
and sometimes with these liquid
lipsticks something to be aware of is
that they can treat liquify even though
you feel like they've for the most part
set on your lips and they're nice and
matte once you know you start eating or
drinking and you get liquid in contact
with your lips they can kind of break
down a bit or actually start
transferring off so for day-to-day wear
what I'm not really like keeping an eye
on my lips constantly and really wanting
to bother with a lot of touch-ups the
more natural shades can be a little bit
easier to pull off so shades like
committed this one I love it
now another lip product I want to
mention just because I've been using it
tons over the past month but I don't use
it on top of my liquid lipsticks I'm not
saying you can't put gloss on top of
those but when you do you will start
having the real iqua fiying happen and
they can easily transfer off just
something to be aware of but if you guys
need a good nude gloss I've talked about
this before but this is nude ballet from
L'Oreal it's one of their extraordinary
lip colors I don't even know how I still
have any left in this tube but it is
such a great nude gloss it's really nice
alone on top of lip liner on top of that
nude lipstick that you think it makes my
lips look a little dead you know put
some of this on top it's so comfortable
it's got a beautiful shine and it's just
the right color so I just wanted to give
that a little shout out because I find
like maybe I've used something that's a
little darker than I
to be on my lips still in the neutral
family and like this is what I'm
grabbing out of this drawer to pop on
top I have started experimenting with
quite a few different things from makeup
revolution Ulta it's carrying this brand
now they do a lot of pallets some other
things as well but just a lot of
different pallets that are ten dollars
or less and one that I've really been
liking is this ultra blush palette that
it's called all about bronzed and it's
really really good
I've actually been foregoing a lot of
heavy contouring just to use this
because I feel like there is one shade
in here that's a little darker than my
skin tone that I will use for just maybe
the super softest contour but it's kind
of fun because these shades up top can
make beautiful highlights and then
you've got some matte shades right here
and then these shades I think they were
labeled as baked and one is a little
more golden and one is a gorgeous
shimmery highlight so I've just been
loving playing with this palette I also
have the blush palette in sugar and
spice and this one has a lot of pinky
blushes and these any time been wearing
these highlights I've had questions
about them but there's a nice big mirror
in these palettes and I just had fun
like kind of mixing and experimenting
and going for that bronzy look that's
not overly chiseled and really really
overdone from the contouring perspective
if you have tan or deep skin I think
you'd definitely be able to take
advantage of the lighter shades as
highlights but the bronzers probably
wouldn't do much for you just keep that
in mind and a couple of other palettes
that I want to mention one seems to be
my low maintenance like grab it in a
hurry type thing and it's not even
something I think I've recognized in a
previous review I did on the Express
channel it's not something I really
pointed out is oh my gosh I love this so
much but it's just turned out to be a
convenience for me you know what I'm
saying and then the other palette I'm
gonna mention is what I reached for when
I have time to play but this is the
naked on the Run palette yeah I reviewed
this it seems like months ago on the
Express channel it contains a perversion
mascara which I'm just about out of it's
just on its life
legs eyeliner in stag this is the naked
gloss what was the shade this came in a
set so then you've got these eyeshadows
this can be like an eyeshadow or
highlight and then bronzer blush so it's
a lot in one palette with a big old
mirror and I have just found like over
the past few weeks if I can't be in this
room doing my makeup and I just need to
grab a few things
out it's like okay when I grab this out
it's like I've grabbed you know the
equivalent of a whole makeup bag full of
things and I just need my eyelash curler
and a couple of brushes and it's like my
my foundation concealer whatever I'm
going to use from that respect so it
really takes the thought out of planning
your makeup look and I love planning my
makeup look and I love taking my time
but there are some days where it's just
not feasible and this has been such a
quick thing to reach for I love the
quality of Urban Decay's eyeshadows the
blush I think is really pretty and fresh
I'm not loving this particular bronzer
shade it's very very it comes off a
teeny bit orangie the one thing that
kind of ticks me off is that they put
the mascara in here but mascara is gonna
be the kind of thing you're gonna go
through repeatedly so what else is gonna
fit in here since like I said I'm about
out of the perversion and it's kind of a
special size it's smaller than a lot of
full-size mascaras but I have real lives
I've already been planning that any
sample sizes that I have of tarts lights
camera lashes will fit in there nicely
but this is the kind of thing I don't
know that I would have identified it
really is like a super favorite of life
you know but it is just one of those
things that's turned out to be so
convenient and then the other thing this
probably isn't coming at it as a huge
surprise since this was one of my five
high end products worth trying mentioned
in a recent video but my honest hacia
shadow couture world traveller palette I
just think it's gorgeous I'm loving
these shades I love that there's color
variety but there's also just really
simple easy shades this is what I'm
wearing today I've actually got some
soft peach all over the eye area a
little bit of Bellini all over my lid
and then a little Morocco just lightly
in the crease and I used fudge
I'm just smudge that on the outer part
of the lower lashline that's this
brownish shade so you can take it in a
ton of different directions I feel like
I want the absolute softest easiest
route today two more things to mention
one is a lash these Vegas nay by eyelure
lashes I have tried two styles and I
have absolutely loved them both one of
them that I talked about before I know
it's really giving you a lot to go on
here with this empty box but the shining
star style is very thick I think the
lashes are a bit shorter and then the
one that I'm loving the most is actually
kind in the red box called easy elegance
and I'm wearing those today so you can
see them they are long that they're kind
of wispy and I just I've gotten so many
uses out of these you guys like the last
three weeks I have worn these so much on
and off and the quality of like the lash
band and the lashes themselves it has
not changed one bit I've been really
really happy with these one thing I
found with both Styles is that they're
very long left to right so I have had to
trim them up and with these these have
such a beautiful length at the outer
edges normally I trim from the outside
when I need to shorten lashes but these
I actually trimmed a little bit from the
inner part because they were like so so
tapered down I thought I could get away
with it and I could and they still blend
really nicely down into the inner corner
so just I don't know something to think
about if you like the really nice length
on the outsides you can still keep that
I think with these last thing my fellow
mask users this is one IRA totally
totally recommend it makes my skin feel
so soft afterwards it's like I feel
hydrated and soft but not in a dewy and
tacky way your skin just feel so
comfortable after you use this thing and
I really think it could work for all
skin types that's what it says on the
outside here it's the freemen
diamond mineral rinse mask so you just
put it on leave it for 5 to 7 min
and rinse it off now I have not found
this in a full-size so I've purchased
multiple of these little pouches which
say they are two to four applications
which I'd say it's fairly accurate
depending on how much you like to
slather on at one time I find these at
the end of the beauty aisle in Walmart
and between 1 &amp;amp; 2 bucks I think it's
just a steal just get yourself one try
it out tell me what you think I think
you're going to absolutely love the way
your skin feels it's just a nice little
treat we all have busy days days that
leave you feeling like kicked in the
butt at the end of them so this is a
nice way to just give yourself a little
something back give yourself a little
time even if you're still busy you know
you can do things while you wear a face
mask but your skin will thank you for it
I think when you're done so thank you
guys so much for watching my latest best
in beauty video I hope you got a few
ideas if not certain product
recommendations just some different
ideas maybe for the way you're using
things or you might think oh I have
somethings just like that you know in my
collection already and that's what I
hope to do is just kind of inspire and
share some ideas and videos like this so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
