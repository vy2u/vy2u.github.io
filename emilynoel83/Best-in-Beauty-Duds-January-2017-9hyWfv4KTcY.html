e time for the month of January I guess
this is the first favorites video I'll
have done since the Emily Awards so I
have definitely even though I've been in
this timeframe that's been really weird
with you know having a baby and being in
kind of a different makeup routine at
times / total lack of makeup routine
I still have definitely accumulated some
favorite products some of these you know
I was really starting to get into before
the baby arrived and now as I attempt to
establish some normalcy in my life in
terms of my makeup routine I'm using
them a whole lot now as well but
speaking of baby
what foundation was I wearing when I was
in labor well I happened to be wearing
the Estee Lauder Double Wear just the
traditional stuff I wear this in the
shade Thani I'm wearing it now as well
and this could have rekindled my love
for this foundation I've been wearing it
a little bit on and off pre-baby and I
do feel like the coverage level is just
really perfect for me right now I do
even when my skin is pretty good like I
feel like overall skin tone wise I don't
have any major discoloration to deal
with right now I don't necessarily need
the fullest of the full coverage but I
still love evenness I really like when
everything is super even now and this
just does that so well it definitely
proved to me that going through an
entire day no touch-ups it was able to
survive childbirth pretty well I thought
I mean maybe there was a little wearing
down around the nose if I want to get
super picky this is certainly the type
of foundation that you put it on and you
really don't have to worry about it you
know you can go through that entire day
and feel like yeah everything's pretty
well intact but I have been
experimenting with a lot of foundations
lately but getting back into this one
some more it just reminded me just how
good the staying power is is really
spectacular staying power for the juice
a regular double wear another foundation
that I find myself using more kind of
just around the house you know and I
just wanted to slap on something real
quick whether I am downstairs in front
of my bathroom mirror or I'm up here you
know just trying to pull together a
little bit of a look I have been
reaching for this so much Myatt
cosmetics CC cream and
this gets talked about so much by me I
mean I think it's a great product I like
the illumination version as well but
when you're wanting that hydration and
the coverage 1 step make it easy plus
the SPF this is just a wonderful thing
to have on hand love the pump as well
because I use you know one pump maybe
just a little bit more than that all
over the face works wonderfully well and
another thing that's gotten some love in
a recent video my NYX sponge I just used
this so you're seeing some product on
there but it has been all saturated with
water so you're seeing it at its maximum
size and I think this is such a
phenomenal sponge to definitely check
out my wedge sponge comparison video for
a lot more details about this and some
others and why I like this one so much
but it really is awesome if you like
both the roundness that a beauty blender
has and the flat side that a Real
Techniques sponge has but also there's a
really nice taper to the top of it so it
gets around my eyes so well basically it
does my foundation and it does my
concealer it's one sponge that really
can pull it all off and it can bake you
know you can use that flat side put some
powder under there work so well and it's
SuperDuper soft cleans up nicely really
just super impressed with that sponge
from NYX another coverage product
meanwhile that I am enjoying a lot is
this concealer from NARS it's that a
soft matte complete concealer I have it
in light 2.75 Cannell and it's a really
perfect skin tone match shade for me
I've got it on my under eye area and
around my nose and at first before
trying it I thought okay soft matte
concealer like I do like the matte
finish but a lot of times things that
might be mattifying that you might put
up under your eye area may not be the
greatest for keeping your skin looking
fresh and hydrated and supple and
everything but I gotta say this really
does cover well and it doesn't look
super gooey when you're done with it so
you wouldn't necessarily even really
have to set it with anything if you
didn't want to and it feels a little bit
cooling when I tap it on the under eye
area which is so weird I just wouldn't
expect that out of a product that
doesn't have a lot of like liquid eNOS
do it you know I still like my honest
hacia concealer and you've heard me
compare that a lot to benefit erased
paste because it is so emollient it had
such a dewy kind of creaminess to it you
know and I still think that might be a
better bet if you're especially dry on
the under-eye area but this has worked
surprisingly well and its face looking
fresher by day's end than the NARS
concealer in the wand the kind with a
doe foot applicator I know a lot of
people love that I think it's called
radiant creamy concealer I feel like
that kind of settles and dries down in
my under eye area in a little more
obvious way on me than this product does
so that's sort of fascinating to me
let's talk setting powder for a second I
did not have a like a loose powder a
setting powder really included in my
Emily awards because I felt like I was
still kind of in the thick of trying out
and comparing a bunch of different
things as I sit here look this is what
I'm doing the topic so this was a lot of
my like rubbing I'm suspecting a genie
to pop out or something the Laura
Mercier powder though the loose setting
powder that says translucent I am
probably the last person on earth to be
on YouTube talking about this being a
great powder but I held out a really
long time I felt like I tried everything
under the Sun and then I had I found a
little sample that I had is this and it
had a different concealer attached to
the top and I wasn't using that anymore
I knew that that was kind of past its
prime but I did experiment with some of
the powder I thought you know that
really is a nice powder on my under eye
area or just all over the face to set my
makeup and so I thought I'm going to go
ahead and buy the full size and I have
really really loved this if you do feel
like you have a concealer on your under
eye area that needs to be set with
something whether you use this in the
baking capacity which would be pretty
thick and full-on or just lightly I mean
just a light amount of this it does add
some coverage it adds some brightness on
my skin tone without being like
ridiculous looking it does not look dry
and cakey on me I mean it really is a
great great loose powder it pairs really
well with concealers such as the
Anastasia or Benefit erase paste
anything that's leaving a little bit of
Haacke texture on your skin put a little
bit of this on top of it and it's like
the perfect marriage of product there
and just lightly worn all over my face
it enhances the staying power so well
though I have been loving my little
Laura Mercier loose powder definitely I
think worth the purchase of the full
size let's talk lip products for a
second and I want to give a special
shout out as I did to the double wear to
the lip product that I was wearing while
in labor and it was from Besame is the
dusty rose shade it's the 1969 replica
color I have it in the mini size because
it was part of that kit that I got
shortly before Christmas time and it's a
fantastic shade it is like my kind of
color it's sort of a pinky berry shade
very easy to wear and I tell you what so
many people assume that you've done a
whole heck of a lot more of your makeup
and you maybe have if you just take the
time to put on a lipstick that's got a
little bit of color people think wow
you're really good
but this lasted me so well all day long
with the double blot technique so you
put it on and I put it on with the wet
brush at first blot it off put on a
little bit more blot it again and I tell
you what your lips are like stained
double time with that happening on there
it stayed looking so good without like
dripping outside my lips it was like the
color was just one with my lips using
that double blot method with pretty much
any creamy lipstick that you have will
just intensify the color and make it
last so much longer so I love that shade
and that will be very special to me I
don't think I'll ever forget that I was
wearing that that day another lipstick
that I'm loving and so many of you saw
me wearing this on snapchat and I
couldn't believe how many times that
picture was screenshotted but it's the
Maybelline their little intimate nudes
collection the shade called brown blush
this is so gorgeous if you like a berry
that's just barely there berry you know
it's mostly neutral it's got a lot of
brown in it it's not very pinky at all
but it just has a little hint of pinky
Berenice going on there a little bit of
mauve this is so pretty the finish is
gorgeous on the lips Maybelline
beautiful matte lipsticks and this one I
don't know it doesn't feel like a
classic matte it feels very nice and
creamy going on but it just doesn't have
a lot of shine this is kind of a nice
shade to add some depth to your lip
color wardrobe without getting too
colorful if you just don't like you know
the really bright colorful shades also
you guys know if you've been keeping up
with recent videos I love the Revlon
Ultra HD lip colors that they have sort
of redone in the skinny packaging I have
two shades all rays that I adore one is
called HD desert one is HD Vineyard I
have added two to my collection this one
called HD sand as though I've been
wearing throughout this video
love isn't that a beautiful like kind of
glossy nude and I also got HD blossom
which is like an outstanding beautiful
orchid type purpley shade this gets
compliments from Bella like mommy I like
your purple lipstick so this is really
really gorgeous love the texture of
these these are shiny they feel kind of
like Revlon lip butters you know used to
feel maybe a hair thicker than that
really great if you want color and a
near gloss like shine on really dry lips
like my lips looked so chapped and kind
of nasty before I put this stuff on and
now I feel like yeah they're smooth
they're glossy we're pretending that
I've got lips in fabulous condition and
these are just great products for that
kind of a look that scent I'm loving
this matte shade sent in creme de nude
yes this is by far my favorite scent
from that line mmm it's yummy it's kind
of like vanilla but a little bit spicy
just a little bit spicy it's mostly
sweet I don't know there's just this
feminine softness to the scent it's a
very comforting type scent cozy might be
the best word to describe this love it
so much and this is really random but
these little hair tie things here from
scrunchie the everyday and active six
piece workout chill out super stretch
these are good and I have a barely there
ponytail okay like the hair really does
not want to stay in but I put one of
these three times around it and the
stuff isn't going anywhere this is what
they look like it's almost like a
situation here but they're really
stretchy and I have in this little set
there's these colors the blue like the
lilac the pink this kind of mauve color
and then I have a gray in a black
downstairs there's nothing like rubbery
in these whatsoever but they really grab
the hair and they're not so bad about
putting a dent in it as some of the
smaller elastics are so those are really
good a little bit of a follow up on my
hourglass palette here it's the ambient
lighting edit surreal light palette I
use this really quite a bit right around
baby time and so so enjoyed most of
what's in here my absolute favorite
parts are the blushes and the bronzer
and I'm wearing those today also I do
like this powder over here which is what
they call the finishing powder I guess
in surreal light that really does have a
nice finish on the skin if you're
looking for something that's not
completely matte the one thing that I
just don't love about this palette is
the highlight it does have some glow but
everything in here kind of had some
glows so I was looking for something
that would really go up a notch and be
super brightening it's one of those
things it's okay it's usable but it's
not my favorite part of the palette by
any means still I definitely do enjoy
the palette I've gotten a lot of good
out of it I think these blushes are so
gorgeous this pink one really pops on
the cheeks I'm wearing both of them I'm
wearing this one a little more lightly
but mostly this kind of soft pinky
neutral and I think they are just
stunning and that bronzer surprised me
so much that really gives a lot of life
to my face and I love the size of the
mirror on this bad boy too I've really
got a thing for multitasking face
palettes so I took that with me when I
was in the hospital and some people did
ask like why didn't you take that giant
it cosmetics palette or why didn't you
take the it cosmetics one that had the
four products that you loved so much and
really I guess the reasoning was because
I've already made up my mind about those
I love those and here this was still
kind of in the testing phase I'm never
not testing something okay always just
got something cooking in the back of my
mind so that was what was cooking at
that time couple of things though that I
want to point out that have not worked
quite so well one thing that I did take
with me to the hospital was the better
than sex waterproof mascara I was not
wearing this while I was in labor I'm
not even sure did I have a waterproof on
at that time I probably had on the clump
crusher water resistant and maybe the
super sizer mascara as well but this I
put on the day we left I put on a little
bit of makeup and this smudge so much
under my eyes I'm like a waterproof
mascara
really it had so much smokiness down
here below and I wasn't even crying it
was just standard wear you know I put a
little on top and I thought surely you
know I'll be able to wear a little bit
of this on my lower lashes but no it
really transferred badly on me so that's
not going to be something I feel like I
can trust in a waterproof capacity at
all and then another product that just
didn't really float my boat is this
almay brow pencil Almay has joined the
club of brow pencils that have this sort
of teardrop or triangular shape like a
wider tip to them I have it in brunette
it's got the pencil on one end and the
spoolie on the other and the thing I
don't like about this is the texture of
the product it's very very creamy some
of you out there may like that you're
looking for something that just
transfers on they're really really
softly and feels buttery creamy smooth
this lays down a lot of product for me
it's too much because my brows are
already kind of sick and I like
something that's a little bit drier
something that is going to have pigment
you know and be able to show up on my
skin but I just got so much hair in my
brows already when I have a pencil like
this that's borderline goopy feeling and
it just it becomes too much so if you're
like me and that's kind of the way your
preferences go for brows stuff I just
wanted to give you that little fair
warning on the almaty brow pencil but
that is my destiny beauty video for the
month of January I hope maybe got some
insights on some products you may have
been wondering about thank you guys so
