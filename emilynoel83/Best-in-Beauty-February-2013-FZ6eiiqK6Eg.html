best in beauty video for February I used
to call these shopping list ideas but
recently changed it over the last few
months just to moreso describe what I'm
actually talking about which is beauty
products so best in beauty what it's
called this is the first one I've done
since the Emily awards actually so I've
got some great favorite things that have
been enjoying so much to tell you about
first thing is a brush it's Real
Techniques brush and it's called the
fine liner brush so this is what I use
with all of my like cream and gel liners
I've been having a hard time you know
finding just the perfect brush for that
kind of a thing and sometimes I end up
blaming the product maybe because it's
not going on the way I you know smoothly
enough or whatever but really it comes
down to the brush I think what's funny
is I actually got a different liner
brush from Real Techniques at first and
it came in the very first Real
Techniques thing I ever got a set of
like basic eye brushes and I just found
this one to be really big I mean if you
compare it to the fine liner brush I'm
talking about the larger of the two is
called the pixel point liner brush and
it just gave me way too thick of a line
so I just found I couldn't really use it
in that way so I realized that sold
individually was this little guy so once
I got that started using it I was like
wow this is perfect not just in size but
a lot of times the issue all have with
liner brushes is that they're a little
too flexible like you you know you put
them on your skin and they just start
really getting bendy and they can't give
you the control you want so this is just
stiff enough the perfect size line I
mean believe it or not I have some that
are smaller than this and then you have
to keep going over your line so this is
just just the right size so it's again
it's called the fine liner brush and you
can buy that one individually I'm also
talking about eyes I have a couple of
eyeshadows to recommend and it's from
the L'Oreal infallible line and when you
look at these you kind of think
those look sort of similar I'll swatch
him for you and you'll see that they are
truly different kinds of shades but I
really like them both first off the way
these shadows are packaged if you're not
familiar the guy cap you can see the
product from that side and then there's
a little stopper here because these are
really I mean they make me think of like
a pigment that's been pressed down it's
not as solid and dry as a lot of
eyeshadows so these are the two shades
this one here is called bronzed taupe
and that is this swatch see how
reflective they are they're just a ton
of color payoff with these and so that
one even though you know the word bronze
is in there it's very non brassy I feel
like it's cool very much more on the
taupe side of things so that one's there
and then if you're a fan of rose gold I
think this is a true rose gold this
other shade is called what's it called
amber rush so it looks like that and it
is that other shade right there that
you're looking at so again it's not it's
not too brassy it's not too gold but
it's just got that that peachy warmth
that that rose gold pens to have and
give you that one shadow look for
example I'm only wearing bronze taupe
today on my eyes it's just this shade
I'm using two brushes one shadow and I
love it when a shadow can pull this off
normally it's these mid-tone shades that
have a little bit of shimmer to where
the natural contours of your eye make it
look lighter or darker so I pack it on
with a flat brush did that all over the
lid and then buff it out with a more
fluffy brush and it can kind of develop
those two different looks I smudged it
under the eye as well so that's bronze
taupe that I'm wearing today but again
wanted to give a mention to that
gorgeous rose gold which can do a
similar effect to this one downside I
guess to these shadows is that they are
compared to like other drugstore singles
a little bit expensive like I've seen
them for like around eight bucks at
Walmart or Walgreens and stuff so maybe
at Walgreens you can try to take
advantage of that buy one get one half
off deal but I've mainly looked for
shades that I think I'm gonna wear a lot
so of all these kinds of shadows I have
mainly neutrals trying to wear most of
things I'm going to be talking about
today so you can see them on and another
one of those items is this maybelline
color whisper in mocha muse I've showed
this on Instagram and stuff but this is
just a really nice neutral lip color
that feels very light on the lips it's
not erase your lips nude you can see it
it almost borders on a little bit of a
caramel color and if you're wondering
about these I do have a review on my
blog I don't know that this one was
included because I didn't have it yet
but I have several of these and what I
demonstrate there is the fact that these
color whispers are pretty buildable so
like you do you know one swatch of it
and it looks one way but they can be
built up to a whole other intensity and
with like lip butters I love lip butters
too but they seem to have kind of one
intense sort of look especially the
colorful deeper shades you know they're
very bold but these are a little bit
lighter they feel a little bit lighter
on the lips and they can be built up to
your desired sort of intensity so this
is all I have on my lips is this shade
again that's called mocha muse it's just
creamy no shimmer to it really nice
shade now the blush I'm loving is from
Neutrogena and talked about one of those
things that's been sitting around in my
collection and then one day you pick it
up start using it and almost discover a
new purpose for it and this is the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin custom glow
blush and bronzer and the shade is
called Posie Cola remember getting this
at first and thinking that bronzer shade
I don't know about that has kind of a
little bit of a satiny finish to it a
little bit of like a golden tint to it
and I just wasn't sure about wearing
that blush it's just a gorgeous color
the essence of peachy pink and it just
has a lot of pigmentation to it a
gorgeous look on the cheeks a very fresh
look I'm wearing that blush right now
and so I loved it and then one day I
thought you know what I'm just gonna
blend my brush across them both and
what's interesting is when you do that
it instantly tones down the blush to
more of a peachy looking blush so you
kind of get two blushes in one while I
don't just love wearing this bronze
shade alone
I like you know swirling the two and
this isn't going to be a great
indication because you don't wear it
that intense but see how peach it looks
there and then here's the blush ads is
so you've got more of a peachy tone and
then more of a pinky tone if you just
wear the doesn't come off on the skin
looking powdery it makes you look a
little bit glowy and the color intensity
is really nice it's a big advocate of
blush any time of year really but I
think this time of year maybe you're
wearing some darker colors and it's just
nice to pop up the complexion a little
bit with something like this feel like
I'm kind of going backwards in the order
of these kinds of products might
actually be applied on my face but
whatevs next I'm going to talk about the
covergirl plus ol a concealer bomb this
is an Emily award winner it kind of
swooped in at the tail end of last year
and I was already loving the Revlon
Photoready concealer stick what sent me
over the edge with this one was the fact
that it seems to have just a little bit
more moisture to it and I'm using
concealers probably mostly around my eye
area I feel like any time I can get just
you know a little more hydration in that
area it's a good thing it makes you look
less dry crepey whatever so I have this
my shade is fair light and it's just
like one of those lipstick tubes but I
promise it's not like those typical dry
concealer sticks that had been out for
ages this one really has a nice
smoothness to it I just love the way it
applies it blends in nice really good
coverage and what's also neat about this
is I feel like I can apply it around my
nose and even though it's a nice creamy
concealer it doesn't break me out in
other areas of my face as some super
emollient you know eye concealers will
the example like it cosmetics had the
bye-bye under-eye and I thought it was
great under the eyes and they even
recommended using it all over your face
practically like foundation but the rest
of my face couldn't handle the amount of
I guess hydration it had in there
because it was breaking me out I can't
make promises on how it's gonna perform
on your skin but I feel like I can apply
this anywhere this is the only concealer
I used today it just works really nicely
so let me know if you've tried this if
you liked it I think it's just a great
quality
I almost forgot to mention this is my
tarte multiply it's a lash primer I
mentioned this in like my five beautii
game-changer products because i think a
lash primer is such a great way to
extend the where you get out of pretty
much any mascara you have it's kind of
like eyeshadow primer you know you put
on an eye primer and it's like oh it
made that so so eyeshadow look a little
bit better this is kind of the effect
I'm having with this product and so it
looks white and you just apply this to
your lashes before you put on your
regular mascara and you let it dry if
you don't let it dry I think that's when
people report getting like a kind of a
grayish look to the mascara you mix
black and white you get grave so just
let it dry and then apply your mascara
over top some people have really good
combos of like layering two different
mascaras and they're like you know
that's my ideal look when I take mascara
a and mascara B and layer them the
trouble I find with a lot of mascaras is
that they harden your lashes quite a bit
and kind of make them very stiff and
brittle and when I put this on before I
apply my mascara I don't feel like it
makes my lashes super hard and therefore
I can apply whatever mascara over the
top and I don't end up with really
unnatural looking lashes you know says
the girl wearing the huge falsies today
but I mean I when I wear this with
mascara I just really like the effect
that it gives it lengthens thickens and
I think that's just really cool I mean
who would I recommend this for probably
the person who likes to experiment with
a lot of mascaras and you don't like
every mascara you try and this can kind
of make a bad mascara a little bit
better honestly makeup stuff in this
video but I do have a skincare thing to
mention I've been experimenting with
some of the skincare items from the balm
I was sent some things from the balm to
review and one of the standout things
that I've been finding is the time balm
skincare is the white tea cucumber face
toner and I really got away from using a
toner at all in fact someone not too
long ago asked me what kind of toner do
you use and I'm like I don't really use
at owner at all because they all seemed
drying to me you know you put them on a
cotton ball or a cotton pad all over
your face after you wash your face and
they always kind of tighten me up and it
doesn't feel doesn't feel normal
so this one however it says it infused
with cucumber extract will chill you or
will chill you out and cool you off your
skin instantly feels refreshed and
hydrated and so that's truly what it
does it has kind of a cooling feeling it
doesn't feel like it's tightening up
your face but your face feels completely
clean like it'll gather up any extra
little you know dirt or oil possibly
left behind when you wash your face and
at the same time it leaves you just
feeling very refreshed very nourish I
use this at night I'll do it after I
wash my face and before I moisturize and
it's the same kind of deal in the
morning after I wash my face before I'm
putting on eye creams or moisturizers or
anything I use some of this and I'm
really really liking that okey dokey so
that is my best in beauty for February
thank you so much for watching and if
you're interested in products I've run
