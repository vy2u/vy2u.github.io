favorites my February best in beauty my
favorite stuff from about the past month
or so and I'm really glad to be back
doing these I didn't have one for
January because that's when I was doing
all my Emily awards videos we're of
course like favorites on steroids
because it was like all the best stuff
from the past year's video I've got a
lot of makeup and one key skincare item
one other item it's kind of on the fence
with being makeup or skincare but I must
start off with probably the boldest part
of today's look and it's this eye shadow
I have on yes it is my infallible shadow
from L'Oreal and the shade is burst into
bloom and if you watched my color
lover's video where I pointed out my
favorite radiant orchid products this
was one of the shadows I named and it's
just so so beautiful and I feel like
I've been more prone to incorporating
this into my looks as like a pop for a
lower liner but today I decided I was
gonna do it just as my main eyeshadow
but turns out it's really my only eyes
shadow on the upper part of my lid I
just started patting it on my lid
blending it through the crease and then
just really really softly blending it
out from there and it's just such a
gorgeous color and it can take on some
different looks you know it can take on
a very very soft look when you apply it
super sheer like that it's a little love
for the false lashes and this adorable
thing that I have sitting out at all
times
too cute to be put in a drawer this is
my storage for false eyelashes it could
be like a little travel case as well
I've got it holding three pairs right
now but you could double them up and
maybe put six in there but I had ordered
a lipstick holder from the lady Moss
website oops I'm sorry sorry sorry got a
lot of cool storage type things but this
is like throw four or five bucks and
it's just so adorable and it's kind of
nice to you know maybe put some of the
current ones you're using in here
because of course false lashes can be
reused lots of times and then you know
you don't worry about keeping everything
in the plastic packaging at all times
have been bouncing around a lot wear eye
makeup is concerned trying different
pallets and stuff but something that
I've liked for a quick look is this
prestige total intensity i shadow trio
and it's the one in Fantasia and if you
haven't explored the prestige eyeshadows
in at Ulta they've got great singles and
trios a link to the video where I talk
about all the ones I have but this one
has been especially nice for a quick
look now you've got kind of a wild card
sheet in here you never really know what
you're gonna get with that because it's
one of those sort of duochrome you know
if you apply it really concentrated it
might look more greenish sorry for the
middle finger there but if it's more
sheared out a lot of warm Brown comes
out of that shade but the way I've been
kind of wearing this more often is to
use the pink and the brown and these are
so beautiful these pink and brown colors
here look at that what am i doing with
my fingers here but let me swatch them
out there's the pretty pink it's so
pearly and concentrated these are such
like creamy beautiful formulas and then
the brown is great as well and I will do
what I call my sandwich method with this
which is I will put pink on the lid
brown in the crease pink under the brow
so your sandwich in the brown between
the pink and it's just super easy and
these blend really nice a lot of pretty
shades in the line and if you can get
like the buy one get one 50% off at Ulta
look for that cuz that's a great deal
just a quick mention to something that
has been talked about in a four of you
in my top five high-end products video
but this if cosmetics feel the moment
primer serum has been so great for I've
been using this so consistently because
it's really been good for the areas on
my skin that are dry I've had some very
dry kind of patchy areas areas where you
know I felt like even as much as I would
moisturize them I was still dealing with
a texture problem and when I put this on
it's kind of like an oil serum gel sort
of thing and I put it on before my
makeup but you let it sink in for a
couple minutes
and it's so-so skin softening and just
really helps my foundation apply really
nicely over the top and takes away the
texture problem so for that reason I
love them with consistent use you know
the product hasn't gone down that much
in the bottle so seems to be a good
value and I'll keep on using that and
I'm excited to test it during warmer
months to see how my skin responds to it
then cleanser I've been using in the
morning so not to remove my makeup but
just to kind of get my skin ready for
makeup application is this CeraVe or
CeraVe tomato tomato hydrating cleanser
it's been working so well for me and the
thing that tends to concern me about the
cleansers that are really creamy or
claim to be hydrating is whether or not
they're going to handle my nose well
enough because this is where I seem to
produce a lot of oil
regardless of how dry I may be elsewhere
so I worry you know is it getting that
clean enough but every time after I wash
my face with this rinse it off dry off I
do feel like my skin is very clean but
not at all tight feeling so I'm very
happy for that and not to point any
fingers but I think some of the
cleansers I've been using in previous
months had been drying me out a lot with
face products I've been enjoying a lot
my Maybelline Dream wonder powder this
is just a really really nice texture for
a powder a very matte finish and I do
find it to be pretty buildable as well
so if you choose to wear it alone or
just over concealer you know you can get
a nice natural look but you get a really
really flawless matte look when you
apply some of this over your foundation
I just love the look that I can achieve
with that just very very evened out skin
I have it in the shade classic ivory
which is not a shade I would normally
reach for but I think these run just a
little bit dark so that ended up being
what works for me also a nice drugstore
blush this is from Al May and it's the
smart shade blush in what's the shade
exactly coral it's just called coral and
it looks like this and it is just an
awesome peachy blush I am wearing that
today I think it looks so natural I
would say
it's somewhere between a mat and a satin
finish so hardly any shimmer at all but
when I swatch it I kind of maybe see
just a hint and I really hadn't had any
experience with the Almay blushes until
recently in fact I didn't hardly know
they existed but they do have a few
different shades and this is the one
that really caught my eye and I promise
it's not just a favorite because carry
under what is the new spokesperson for
LA as much as I love Carrie Underwood I
do legitimately love this product and
that's why I'm naming it as a favorite i
just think it's a blush that would work
across a lot of skintone it's just a
subtle pretty blush I mean there's a
difference between subtle and
non-existent right I don't like the
blushes that look non-existent or so
light they're chalky on your skin this
definitely gives off you know some
pretty peachy color and I love that it's
a little duo of products that I really
like together and have been enjoying
very much and they're both from NYX the
first is the NYX retractable lip liner
in nude I really like these retractable
lip liners first off no sharpening love
that but they're very long wearing
I love the staying power of these I have
a lot of these but I didn't have the
nude which seems like a very basic good
shade to have so I picked it up when I
was at I'm at it's actually just a
really great nude color see how it's got
a little more depth to it than just an
eraser or concealer type nude so I love
using this as a base to a lighter gloss
or maybe even a lighter lipstick so this
is what I've got all over my lips I'm
definitely one who puts the lip liner on
fills in the entire lips because I think
it helps the staying power
especially when the staying power is so
good with a product like then and the
partner in crime here is the NYX butter
gloss in creme brulee I'm not even the
biggest fan of butter glosses I know
that's crazy but I blogged months ago
that I felt like they were they're kind
of like a milky formula and sometimes
when I first put them on I feel like
they can go on a little streaky and
certain shades are worse about that than
others this is one that I actually
really enjoy and I especially love it
applied all over the lips on top of the
move lipliner you're helping your
staying power when you put this
underneath and then I just love the way
this comes across on top of it alone
it's still pretty and I have worn it
alone you know it's kind of like a
peachy nude type gloss pretty gloss
right but something about the
combination of the two it's like yeah
that's my nude thank you very much so
that about wraps it up that's my
February best in beauty thank you so
