again my February favorites whatever you
want to call them products I have been
using a lot recently and it feels like
it's been a really long time since I've
done a video like this actually I think
that's because of the Emily awards I do
so much just product testing of all
kinds during that time period so it kind
of takes me a while to get into a groove
of just using basically whatever I want
again and right now I still got it
sitting in my lap because I just used it
and this is something I never talked
about doing it truly I probably do this
before every video I sit down to do and
I take this Milani multitasker powder
this is in the shade light/medium and
this brush or the elf brush just
whichever ones closer frankly this is
the Sigma f-35 and then there's a small
tapered brush from elf that I do this
with too but I just like dab into this
product tap it off and then I go boom
boom boom boom boom boom basically right
under my eyes and I don't know something
about it it kind of mattifies it
brightens a little bit I don't know what
you want to call that favorite daily
habit obsession I don't know but this
thing is definitely a favorite as well
this is my Rimmel lasting finish
foundation I am 200 soft beige that was
the same shade I was in when these were
in the squeezy tubes so I do like that
they kept their coloring consistent but
I love this foundation so much and
really it's kind of a love-hate thing
with the new release I love it because
it brought to mind a great foundation
that I was obsessed with years ago but
kind of you know just started trying new
things and sort of set it aside but I'm
really not a huge fan of the glass
bottle packaging I think the squeeze
tube was much better but for the what's
really important the product inside I do
love this foundation I think it has
beautiful coverage but I think it still
comes off looking natural for your
skin's texture but if I ever have any
dryness any little texture problem maybe
from a lingering blemish or something
like that that I'm dealing with
I feel like this looks so natural on top
of it it's really nice coverage but it
just never leaves the skin looking caked
up so I think that's why my mom likes
this I like this foundation and it's
really one of those where I think I
could recommend it across a lot of
different skin types so I really
that foundation a couple of blush
favorites to talk about one is from
Milani and it is this powder blush in
romantic rose and I know I mentioned
this in my last tutorial I had this on
and the color might look a little bland
you know compared to a lot of the pretty
bright blushes that are out there but
this is actually I think such a
beautiful thing for giving you this
subtle blush that I think works with
every makeup look just everything you
know it's not too pink it's not too
peach it's not too brown it's just very
I don't know neutral but gives a little
life to the cheeks also this doesn't
have any shimmer in it there it is right
there see how it's just like a soft
dusty rose I just love opening the
compact to be quite honest I mean isn't
that just a beautiful looking blush I'm
definitely guilty of sometimes
overlooking those more neutral blushes
and just going for the brighter ones
because I think well obviously that
one's gonna be pretty right well
sometimes those you know little more
understated blushes can be really
beautiful too and surprise you
with the way they sheer out on your
cheeks another blush pick and I have
been sent quite a bit of NYX stuff that
I've been pulling through and enjoying
some of it not enjoying some of it but
one thing I really have latched on to is
this new HD blush in the shade intuition
and this reminds me a little bit of the
elf studio blush in blushing Rose the
texture of this is maybe a little better
than that though it's very soft it has a
little golden shimmer it definitely
gives that really natural like rosy
cheek look I actually like the bit of
Sheen that this has it's not to the
point where I feel like it takes over
for highlighter but it just gives the
cheeks a really glowy appearance so this
would definitely be deeper than the
Milani blush and a little more red in
this one but I really really like it
it's interesting with these new HD
blushes from NYX eye the texture is not
the same on all of them but this one is
a really really fabulous feel that's
superb highlight that I love using is
this Becca shimmering skin Perfector
this is the one in Pearl I use this
totally interchangeably with the one in
opal the one in champagne gold on these
are just beautiful liquidy highlights I
just take out the wand
a little on my hand go in with my ELF
small stipple brush and just dab it and
that's this beautiful glow that's
happening right there on the tops of the
cheeks I love these I raved about these
around Christmastime a whole bunch so I
think it might be too late if you missed
out on this little trio but these are
sold individually full size I think with
a pump and I've enjoyed my opal that's
in the pressed version but something
about these liquidy ones I think they're
a little more subtle while they make
your skin glow
they really are undetectable if you were
to look up close as far as spotting you
know bits of sparkle and shimmer you
can't see that I think there are really
special formulas oh I love those
highlights something I'm really really
enjoying for my brows and I'm so glad I
got this product it's the Nick stamen
frame tinted brow pomade and I still
love my do face brow advocate I mean
that is one of my favorite things to use
but I kind of gotten into trying out
this product from Too Faced called
bulletproof brows and that's another
brow pomade
I loved how I could use that it's kind
of a one-step product because I put it
in my brows and I would feel like it
actually had some hold so I could even
skip the brow gel the one flaw in that
product that I was noticing the more I
used it was that it was seeming really
really dry and I like that it was more
dry than some of those other brow pomade
products that I think you know you put
your brush into them they're like the
consistency of gel liners they're kind
of goopy it's really easy to overload
your brows with some of those one that I
recently reviewed that was like that is
the salon perfect brow pomade so then
more recently I tried the diamond frame
and I have this in the shade brunette it
is like the perfect shade it's a cool
deep brown and I love that this is more
dry than some of those other pomades but
not as dry as the two-faced one it's
still got a little moisture happening in
there I can really get a controlled
application and this has some hold I
would say brow gel is optional for me
when I put this on and I use this with
my Sigma angled brow east 75 breath
there are a lot of pomades that come
with a brush this one does not but I
really do like using this particular
brush with it I think the size is great
and see how it's a pretty finely cut
brush so I think you do have a lot of
control
in small areas you know covering up just
those minor gaps in your brow
check out the Express channel if I don't
already have a review up on this I will
have one soon you guys it's a weekend
here is I sit here and shoot this I
really had some time to play around with
my makeup today and I really enjoyed
that but for a lot of days during the
week I am hustling Belle does not nap a
whole lot during the day she's getting
back into it a little bit but she really
is spending a lot more wakeful time and
so that tends to equal a little less
time for me to come up here and spend
time on makeup so a couple of just
really quick easy quads that I've been
liking are the Neutrogena and nourishing
long wear quads I picked these up on
this one at Walmart this one at
Walgreens they're all available in those
places but that was just where I've seen
them Coco mom and classic nude I do have
a review up already on this including a
demo on the classic nude but they're
just really nicely textured eyeshadows I
must say they're very smooth they're
easy to blend out I had mentioned in my
review I think these would be great
quads for makeup beginners or just
people who want a really low fuss makeup
look they don't generate a lot of
fallout I think Coco mauve gives you
more of that taupe smokey eye and then
this one is like just those natural
shades that look good for every day
there's kind of a shimmery peach beige a
soft kind of taupey brown and then a
dark brown the other claim with these is
that there is a built-in primer I can
get away with wearing these I have on
multiple occasions with no primer
underneath but I should also throw out
there that my lids aren't very oily if
you do have really oily eyelids that
claim might mean jack squat to you and
you still need to use your primer and
lastly here I just have kind of a
handful of lip products to mention one
is this Burt's Bees lip balm in wild
cherry I am really enjoying that Burt's
Bees is kind of expanding coming out
with a lot of different lip balm scents
and this one oh it smells so good I am
all for a sweet berry type scent and
this is so 100 percent cherry I mean if
you blindfolded me and put this under my
nose I would be able to tell you that is
cherry
it just says moisturizing lip balm 100%
natural I think some of the
since maybe have some different claims I
find the texture this is well to be so
much more smooth and just easy to apply
than that original Burt's Bees beeswax
lip balm which I'm sure has a huge cult
following but I really like this wild
cherry scent and the feel a couple of
other really great low-maintenance lip
products this bite BB for lips in the
shade tawny I got this in a little set
that I think where did I talk about it
but it was a little set that came with a
couple of lip wipes the agave lip mask a
lip scrub and then this which is a
full-size BB for lips and tawny and I
didn't love everything in that kit and I
think initially I thought well you know
this products okay but I kind of set it
aside been pulling it out more and more
now and really realizing how much I love
the texture and how great this is on dry
lips that's kind of a fruity scent that
makes me think of I don't know a lighter
take on Trix cereal you guys remember
that I know that's a really random thing
but that's kind of what it makes me
think of and here's a look at that this
gives a peachy kind of soft coral ish
look on my lips and it's just one of
those things that you really don't have
to pay attention when you're putting it
on it's soft its kind of sheer but still
gives some healthy-looking color to the
lips and a lot of great moisture nice
thickness to this foam and a drugstore
product that kind of does mimic that
same feel and texture for me are the
Alma smart shade butter kiss products
these are kind of split up into color
families if you saw my Express review I
showed several different shades that I
have I think I have one in the red
family a couple from the berry including
this one called berry light and so
there's like pinks nudes Reds and
berries and there's different depths of
color within each of those and these are
just a really really comfortable product
to wear a lot of color surprising amount
of color that comes off with each of
these that I have to compare these to
say a Revlon lip butter I think those
are more like a lipstick and these are
more like a lip balm they still give a
nice amount of vibrant color but there's
just a little more richness and texture
by the way I am wearing this shade today
but I wanted to lighten it up a little
bit you see it's pretty bright there in
that swatch so I added show so I added a
little bit
of cream cup mat cream cup lipstick and
that's the combo that's rockin on my
lips today you can see it gives a little
bit of shine it's just a really nice
color and finally the lip liner that I
love with everything it seems um my
Milani color statement lip liner in
spice this is a total total must-have
lip liner for anything remotely neutral
I mean all the way from light nude to
medium kind of brownish nudes berry type
colors even as an example a lot of times
when I've put this bike product on and
I've had a little extra time and I'm
like oh I'd like my lips to look a
little more defined I just put this
product on first and then only use the
lip liner you know kind of right around
the edges like the Cupid's bow area
maybe down here a little bit where I
just want a little extra definition and
in some cases that's the only way I'll
use this or it can be great for a fully
filled in lip and then just accentuate
this really natural pretty color with a
gloss on top I think it's the definition
of deep neutral really just works with
so many things and so those are my
favorites for the month gosh it really
feels good to do these videos because I
feel like it's just sitting down just
talking makeup talking about key
favorite awesome products so thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you again in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
