again my februari favorites whatever you
want to call them products i have been
using a lot recently and it feels like
it's been a really long time since i've
done a video like this actually i think
that's because of the emily awards i do
so much just product testing of all
kinds during that time period so it kind
of takes me awhile to get into a groove
of just using basically whatever i want
again and right now I still got it
sitting in my lap because I just used it
and this is something I never talked
about doing it truly I probably do this
before every video I sit down to do and
I take this Milani multitasker powder
this is in the shade light medium and
this brush or the elf brush just
whichever one's closer frankly this is
the sigma f 35 and then there's a small
tapered brush from ELF that I do this
with too but I just like dab into this
product cap it off and then I go boom
boom boom boom boom boom basically right
under my eyes and I don't know something
about it it kind of mattifies it
brightens a little bit so I don't know
what you want to call that favorite
daily habit obsession I don't know um
but this thing is definitely a favorite
as well this is my Rimmel lasting finish
foundation i am 200 soft beige that was
the same shade i was in when these were
in the squeezy tubes so I do like that
they kept their coloring consistent but
I love this foundation so much and
really it's kind of a love-hate thing
with the new release I love it because
it brought to mind a great foundation
that I was obsessed with years ago but
kind of you know just started trying new
things and sort of set it aside I'm
really not a huge fan of the glass
bottle packaging i think the squeeze
tube was much better but for the what's
really important the product inside i do
love this foundation i think it has
beautiful coverage but i think it still
comes off looking natural for your
skin's texture but if i ever have any
dryness any little texture problem maybe
from a lingering blemish or something
like that that I'm dealing with I feel
like this looks so natural on top of it
it's really nice coverage but it just
never leaves the skin looking caked up
so I think that's why my mom likes this
I like this foundation and it's really
one of those where I think I could
recommend it across a lot of different
skin types so I really
that foundation a couple of blush
favorites to talk about what is from
Milani and it is this powder blush in
romantic rose and I know I mentioned
this in my last tutorial I had this on
and the color might look a little bland
you know compared to a lot of the pretty
bright blushes that are out there but
this is actually I think such a
beautiful thing for giving you this
subtle blush that I think works with
every makeup look just everything you
know it's not too pink it's not too
peach it's not too Brown it's just very
I don't know neutral but gives a little
life to the cheeks also this doesn't
have any shimmer in it there it is right
there see how it's just like a soft
dusty rose I just love opening the
compact to be quite honest I mean isn't
that just a beautiful looking blush I'm
definitely guilty of sometimes
overlooking those more neutral blushes
and just going for the brighter ones
because i think well obviously that
one's going to be pretty right well
sometimes those you know little more
understated blushes can be really
beautiful too and surprise you with the
way they sheer out on your cheeks
another blush pick and i have been sent
quite a bit of nick stuff that i've been
pawing through and enjoying some of it
not enjoying some of it but one thing i
really have latched on to is this new HD
blush in the shade intuition and this
reminds me a little bit of the elf
studio blush in blushing Rose a texture
of this is maybe a little better than
that though it's very soft it has a
little golden shimmer it definitely
gives that really natural like rosy
cheeked look I actually liked the bit of
Sheen that this has it's not to the
point where I feel like it takes over
for highlighter but it just gives the
cheeks a really glowy appearance so this
would definitely be deeper than the
Milani blush and a little more red in
this one but I really really like it and
it's interesting with these new HD
blushes from NYX I the texture is not
the same on all of them but this one is
a really really fabulous feel a superb
highlight that I love using is this
becca shimmering skin Perfector this is
the one in perl i use this totally
interchangeably with the one in opal the
one in champagne gold on these are just
beautiful liquidy highlights I just take
out the wand I put
little on my hand go in with my elf
small stipple brush and just dab it and
that's this beautiful glow that's
happening right there on the tops of the
cheeks I love these i raved about these
around Christmastime a whole bunch so I
think it might be too late if you missed
out on this little trio but these are
sold individually full-size I think with
a punk and I've enjoyed my opel that's
in the pressed version but something
about these liquidy ones I think they're
a little more subtle while they make
your skin glow they really are
undetectable if you were to look up
close as far as spotting you know bits
of sparkle and shimmer you can't see
that I think there are really special
formula so I love those highlights
something I'm really really enjoying for
eyebrows and i'm so glad i got this
product it's the knicks taemin frame
tinted brow pomade and i still love my
du pays brow advocate I mean that is one
of my favorite things to use but I kind
of gotten into trying out on this
product from Too Faced called
bulletproof browse and that's another
brow pomade I loved how I could use that
as kind of a one-step product because I
put it in my brows and I would feel like
it actually had some hold so I could
even skip the brow gel the one flaw in
that product that I was noticing the
more i used it was that it was seeming
really really dry and i like that it was
more dry than some of those other brow
pomade products that i think you know
you put your brush into him there like
the consistency of gel liners they're
kind of goopy it's really easy to
overload your brows with some of those
one that i recently reviewed that was
like that is the salon perfect brow
pomade so then more recently i try the
diamond frame and i have this in the
shade brunette it is like the perfect
shade it's a cool deep brown and i love
that this is more dry than some of those
other pomades but not as dry as the two
faced one it's still got a little
moisture happening in there I can really
get a controlled application and this
has some hold i would say brow gel is
optional for me when i put this on and i
use this with my sigma angled brow e75
breath there are a lot of pomades that
come with a brush this one does not but
i really do like using this particular
brush with it i think the size is great
and see how it's a pretty finely cut
brush so i think you do have a lot of
control
in small areas you know covering up just
those minor gaps in your brow check out
the Express channel if I don't already
have a review up on this I will have one
soon now you guys it's a weekend here as
I sit here and shoot this I really had
some time to play around with my makeup
today and I really enjoyed that but for
a lot of days during the week I am
hustling Bell does not nap a whole lot
during the day she's getting back into
it a little bit but she really is
spending a lot more wakeful time and so
that tends to equal a little less time
for me to come up here and spend time on
makeup so a couple of just really quick
easy quads that I've been liking are the
Neutrogena and nourishing long-wear
quads I picked these up on this one at
walmart this one at walgreens they're
all available in those places but that
was just where I've seen a Coco mauve
and classic nude I do have a review up
already on this including a demo on the
classic nude but they're just really
nicely textured eyeshadows I must say
they're very smooth and they're easy to
blend out I had mentioned in my review I
think these would be great quads for
makeup beginners or just people who want
a really low fuss makeup look they don't
generate a lot of fallout I think Coco
mom gives you more of that taupe smokey
eye and then this one is like just those
natural shades that look good for every
day there's kind of a shimmery peach a
beige a soft kind of topi brown and then
a dark brown the other claim with these
is that there is a built-in primer I can
get away with wearing these i have on
multiple occasions with no primer
underneath but i should also throw out
there that my lids aren't very oily if
you do have really oily eyelids that
claim might mean jack squat to you and
you still need to use your primer and
lastly here i just have kind of a
handful of lip products dimension one is
this Burt's Bees lip balm and wild
cherry I am really enjoying that Burt's
Bees is kind of expanding coming out
with a lot of different lip balm since
and this one oh it smells so good I am
all for a sweet berry typeset and this
is so one hundred percent cherry I mean
if you blindfolded me and put this under
my nose I would be able to tell you that
is cherry it just says moisturizing lip
balm one hundred percent natural I think
some of the different sense maybe have
some different
claims i find the texture this is well
to be so much more smooth and just easy
to apply than that original burt's bees
beeswax lip balm which I'm sure has a
huge cult following but I really like
this wild cherry sent and the field
couple of other really great low
maintenance lip products this bite BB
for lips in the shade tawny I got this
in a little set that I think where did I
talk about it but it was a little set
that came with a couple of lip wipes the
agave lip mask a lip scrub and then this
which is a full-size BB for lips and
tawny and I didn't love everything in
that kit and I think initially I thought
well you know this products okay but I
kind of set it aside been pulling it out
more and more now and really realizing
how much i love the texture and how
great this is on dry lips that's kind of
a fruity scent that makes me think of I
don't know a lighter take on Trix cereal
you guys remember that i know that's a
really random thing but that's kind of
what it makes me think of and here's a
look at that this gives a peachy kind of
soft coral ish look on my lips and it's
just one of those things that you really
don't have to pay attention when you're
putting it on it's soft its kind of
sheer but still gives some healthy
looking color to the lips and a lot of
great moisture nice thickness to this
phone and a drugstore product that kind
of does mimic that same feel and texture
for me are the almay smart shade butter
kiss products these are kind of split up
into color families if you saw my
Express review I showed several
different shades that I have I think I
have one in the red family a couple from
the berry including this one called
Barry light and so there's like pinks
nudes Reds and berries and then there's
different depths of color within each of
those and these are just a really really
comfortable product to wear a lot of
colors surprising amount of color that
comes off with each of these that I have
to compare these to say a Revlon lip
butter I think those are more like a
lipstick and these are more like a lip
balm they still give a nice amount of
vibrant color but there's just a little
more richness and texture by the way I
am wearing this shade today but I wanted
to lighten it up a little bit you see
it's pretty bright there in that swatch
so i added show so i added a little bit
of cream cup matte cream cup lipstick
and that's the combo that's rockin on my
lips today you can see it gives a
little bit of shine it's just a really
nice color and finally the lip liner
that I love with everything it seems on
my Milani color statement lipliner in
spice this is a total total must have
lip liner for anything remotely neutral
I mean all the way from light nude to
medium kind of brownish nudes very type
colors even as an example a lot of times
when I've put this bike product on and
I've had a little extra time and I'm
like oh I'd like my lips to look a
little more defined I just put this
product on first and then only use the
lip liner you know kind of right around
the edges like the Cupid's bow area may
be down here a little bit where I just
want a little extra definition and in
some cases that's the only way I'll use
this or it can be great for a fully
filled in lip and then just accentuate
this really natural pretty color with a
gloss on top I think it's the definition
of deep neutral really just works with
so many things and so those are my
favorites for the month gosh it really
feels good to do these videos because I
feel like it's just sitting down just
talking makeup talking about key
favorite awesome products so thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you again in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
