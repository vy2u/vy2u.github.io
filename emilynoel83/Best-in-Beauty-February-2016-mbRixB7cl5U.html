here with me this is best in beauty this
is where I talk about the top products
from the past month in my opinion for me
and I really have got a lot of things
that pertain to certain routines in my
makeup like some things that are
integral to the way I do eyeliner and
also some things that are really
important to the way I do Foundation and
concealer and just some revelations that
I've had over the past month with those
things but first off couple things that
weren't really intended to be included
in this video but I feel like I must
mention them I got my next one to the
box the next accessories box and I love
this infinity scarf that came in it
so cute love the plaid and this red lip
this is my first time wearing this it's
the Gwen Stefani collection from urban
decay and it's 7 1 4 so this is the
matte red in that collection and I'm
wearing the coordinating lipliner too
and that helped me get a really good
line on the outside but there's just
something about a good red lipstick you
put it on don't you feel like it does
something for your entire just attitude
it just makes you feel empowered to take
on the day
not that nude lips aren't great I know
I've been doing the lip of the day on
snapchat and Instagram and many of you
guys love the nude lips and I think
they're beautiful too but red red is
just what lipstick was meant to be all
right what a move on talk about lashes
for a second my huda beauty Samantha
lashes no there's nothing in the box
because I am wearing these and I have
been wearing these a lot do you guys
remember I got these for Christmas slash
birthday so end of December and I've
been wearing them so much and you've
seen me in them sorry knows it you've
seen me wearing them in a lot of my
videos and I am just so happy with how
well they've held up because these were
like a twenty dollar pair of lashes so
you really want to think that you can
get a ton of uses out of them and they
have stayed in such good quality and
they're so thick and luxurious and in
some other video when I was talking
about these I think I said they were
gonna be my special occasion lash well
they're not they're like the lash I want
to wear every day and I do wear them
most often so yay for those turning out
to be not only beautiful looking and
something I loved when I got them but a
really strong lash band
that can hold up to so many uses I don't
even know how many times I've been
wearing this I should have totally done
it Ali another really key thing I wanted
to talk about in this video was the way
I do my under eye area the way I've been
doing it pretty consistently for the
past few weeks and it involves the
baking technique okay so you put on your
concealer and then you put a lot of
powder on top and the success of that
technique for me I thought relied so
much on the particular powder I was
using when I would look at my skin later
in the day and I think all this looks
dry and unnatural and cakey I would
always blame the powder I put on top
when in reality something that I think
is very important to keep in mind with
this technique is to use a really rich
and creamy concealer that does not
totally like set on its own concealers
that set on their own and kind of dry
down and don't remain sort of dewy and
tacky I think those have been
problematic for me as I've tried to pull
off the baking method because it's like
it just doesn't work that combination of
a concealer that really needs to lock
into that powder that powder needs
somewhere to go you know it needs
something to warm up and kind of mesh
with you know on your skin so think
about that if you're trying this
technique and you feel like you don't
get a really flawless result on your
under eye area things aren't looking
really nice and smooth and staying that
way it might not be so much the fault of
the powder you put on top but the
concealer that's underneath one other
thing really make sure to blend in the
concealer take your time to Pat in
whatever you're putting down there
that's something I always thought I was
doing and then I watched a video and I'm
going to link her down below I think her
channel is sugar puff and fluff is that
the right name oh I'm gonna link to the
specific video below where she addressed
baking on ageing skin and whether it
really worked and whether you've got
aging skin or not I think her tips were
great and one thing she really hit on
was how important it is to really make
sure your concealer the creamy concealer
you put on first is totally blended into
your skin like really work it in there
and I think that has made a huge
difference too so now that we've talked
technique let me talk about the product
I do use for this so the first thing I
pop on the ides
mainly right in here and just really
anywhere else on the face where I have
darkness is my benefit erased paste and
medium talked this stuff to death but
that is the first thing I put on and yes
it is very very creamy then game changer
here with my mascara a contact Cara is a
beauty blogger I mentioned this back
when I did a video on different cream
products contouring kids foundation kids
etc she has this palette and at the time
I had a very yellowish shade right here
where the concealer like coverage type
product would be and I mentioned I
thought it looked yellowy on my skin
love the texture of these but I thought
that was kind of off so I did purchase
this shade I believe it's called white
peach it is ideal it is so creamy it's
just I love it so the way I would use
this is put whatever foundation I want
it could be full coverage it could be
light coverage it doesn't really matter
honestly then I do my erase paste on my
deepest darkest areas then I'll pop into
this cream contour shade and I'll put
the names below of specifically
everything I've got in here because I
forget what this one was called but it's
a nice cool cream shade I'll do that in
the cheekbones a little bit around the
hairline just softly nothing too major
in harsh I actually bought her brush as
well it's a double-ended brush to see
what that was all about reminds me a lot
of the it cosmetics double-ended guy
that I've used a lot in the past pop
into that kind of blend it out then I go
in with the smaller end and I do this
white peach which is all about coverage
this is not shimmery this is just like
straight-up creamy coverage and I kind
of just paint that on you know the under
eye area down the nose anywhere that I
wants to be a little bit brighter than
my foundation cuz that's what this
amounts to lend it in really well I will
take a dampened Beauty Blender and
really go over it that way then I take
my fingers and I just press over it the
warmth of my fingers really works the
erase paste in it works this stuff in
and then I feel I can set that with
about any powder I want to I can set it
lightly if I want to I can do the baking
method and put on a whole lot let it sit
there for like 10 minutes and
dust away and it looks good either way
and again a big reason why this all
worked out I think is that I used creamy
creamy products that were really able to
work with a powder that you put on top
and really kind of bind together and
also I paid attention to getting these
worked into my skin so well so I still
absolutely love the way my by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder sets the under
eye i can even turn out a really nice
smooth look under here with things I
didn't even think I liked so much like
the airspun powder or you know you name
it it seems to be working with these
concealers another love this Real
Techniques sponge for foundation for
blending over concealers I love the flat
edge this little point like honestly
it's not small enough to get right
around the eye area you got to bring in
a brush or the micro mini or your finger
to do that but as a whole I really love
this I think it cleans up great blush
favorites oh do I have some blush
favorites to talk about can I turn on
the broken record for a second and talk
about covergirl instant cheekbones
because seriously the glow this
highlight this blush that's all I've got
on my cheeks right now love this is the
trio called peach perfection I also love
the plumy one which really just comes
off more pink but it's surprisingly good
you guys the way the highlight shade
picks up a glow on the skin it's just so
nice I lied I have another thing I'm not
used to uh it's the Clinique cheek pop
in Cola pop these are the ones that look
like adorable little flowers Kristin
game got me onto these and let me tell
you the staying power on these I didn't
think anything truly compared to the
insane washes from the balm until I
tried these and I can swatch them and I
can try to rub away that swatch and it's
like in this lock-in I really think the
deeper skin tones would be all about
this it sheers out and you can see a
little bit more of the rosy red and then
it looks like a darker berry if you wear
it deeper but I've just got it a little
bit right in here right above where my
actual contour is I just go a little bit
over that and I love it I've been using
this a lot and the thing that gets me is
that I try to rub away this blush swatch
and even the lighter shades are this way
two that I have and it stays there to an
extent you know you can rub away some of
the
city but with most blushes you just be
able to wipe them away and this really
locks in is locked in like my phrase of
the day or something because Tyler and I
always say that so now it's drifting
into my makeup videos but if we feel
like we've got our act together like
really got stuff done or being super
efficient we're like oh yeah we're
locked in today and there's always times
where we forget stuff or lose something
or don't do this or that and we always
blame that on not being locked it's a
quick little mention here of the PB and
J pallet I love this palette by the way
did you know a few days ago at the time
I post this video it will have been a
few days ago that it was peanut butter
lovers day and I was thinking gosh
wouldn't this have been a fun gift for
someone who's just crazy about peanut
butter a great gift really cuz this is
an awesome palette for the warm brown
folks out there I know there's a lot of
you who love these kinds of tones and
it's just that's what it's all about in
here I was talking in my top 5 bottom 5
to face video how I think there's a
crowd for this and I think there are
people who would also feel like this is
way overkill on the warm tones and if
you feel that way you know you can go
play with another palette we can still
be friends but I do really love because
it all revolves around peanut butter
which was an existing color in the
semi-sweet palette so they put that in
and then brought in all of its best
friends so you've got like a peach a
gold I love this matte white shade down
here apple of purples for the unexpected
pops but I think you will love those
once you start playing around with them
peanut brittle really metallic peanut
butter down here is like I said your
classic warm brown and then we get even
more like red terracotta with the nuts
about you shade and today I just went
for like the quickest look ever I did a
little bit of extra creamy on the inner
part of my lid and then I used a lot of
peanut butter cup which I hadn't messed
with much because it's kind of like the
backseat shade of this palette
everything else is really vibrant and
catches your attention and then you're
like oh there's a regular shimmery brown
in here so I took that into the crease
and just diffused it all the way out
I also smudged it in a more concentrated
sense on the lower lash line and I want
to give a little mention to this inner
corner e46 shader brush from Sigma
this is a really small brush it's
probably like two-thirds of the size and
width of the Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush and you can see the tip is a
little bit tapered and I find myself
using this so often when I just want to
get a little bit of color right in this
zone of the lid and usually it's when I
finish my look and I'm like okay the
shade I had on my inner corner was just
appearing a little bit so like in this
case I went back into the extra creamy
and I can get that just where I want
I'm not overlapping my eyeliner or my
false lashes or anything like that and
it's just a really great precise
placement brush so I just wanted to
throw that out there in case you had
that issue sometimes then for eyeliner I
got two things that I've been using a
lot for both of my eyeliner needs so
like across the upper lash line when I
want a nice black liquid liner
I use my Physicians Formula eye booster
what I love about this so much is that
it's kind of a low-cost alternative to
the Kat Von D tattoo liner because this
is actually a little brush tip that's
not just a felt tip but that's actually
little brush hairs that really hang
together and I think it creates a juicy
black line so easily for me one tip when
you store these store them flat
don't lay them down like this in a cup
don't do them up like this they really
have the best longevity when you lay
them flat but winged liner going across
the upper lash line is a breeze with
this and then when I want to put
something on my waterline lately or just
kind of smudge it gently on the lower
lash line this master precise skinny in
the defining black shade from Maybelline
so great this is a really fine tip
mechanical pencil whenever I put liner
in the waterline I always make an
attempt to kind of blend it downward a
little bit and I love how easily this
just kind of dots right in between the
lashes so I can go boom boom boom boom
boom and then smudge it out bring in the
Sigma e 21 smudge brush and just get it
looking really soft and then top it off
with a little bit of shadow whatever
works for your look in this case like I
said it was that shimmery Brown what was
the called peanut butter cup I believe I
got a check now yeah peanut butter cup
lend that over the whole area and Boone
there's your smokey eye easy alright I
think I'm gonna leave it there I've got
so many fun videos on my to-do list you
guys my video to-do list has never been
so long because the ideas have just been
flooding into me from you guys and just
from my own brain it's been great I feel
some next-level excitement for my
channel and I am just so glad that
you're here with me for it goodness I'm
kind of like to the end of the video and
I'm done shooting this video but yeah
I'm not done talking does that ever
happen to you Bella's still napping what
do I need to do I need to go downstairs
and do a little cleaning a little
list-making and we'll throw out to you
guys a book that I am a love thing so
much is the Dita Von Teese your beauty
mark book it's like a text book I mean
it's a coffee table book if you want to
put it that way but it's a dang beauty
textbook beauty textbook and my sister
recommended it to me she got it for
Christmas and she was telling me about
it one of the last weeks she was here
and I was like okay I have to get it
Amazon was out of it Barnes and Noble
was out of it I finally got my hands on
it and it is like it speaks to me if you
are obsessed with beauty it will be
you'll feel like she's speaking directly
to you within the first five minutes
that you cracked open the book like the
things that she says make a beauty lover
feel so I guess validated in their
passion for what they do
I've been reading the book straight
through and I'm only just now getting
into the chapter on makeup but I just
love some of the points she makes I love
how she's all about just
unapologetically being yourself
embracing the things you like beauty
wise I mean I think in the title it's
called a guide to eccentric glamour if
you get it and read it I think it will
really cause you to further embrace the
things you love about yourself and your
own beauty routine or just you know
yourself in general I think it's a real
confidence booster type book but also I
think it causes you to appreciate the
beauty in others and in the world around
you in just a little bit deeper way
loving the beauty in a
person not because oh that's like the
perfect wing liner that's exactly the
way I would have done it but seeing them
and thinking they're doing their thing
they're doing them they're doing what
they love and it looks beautiful on them
because they're confident and loving it
that's the whole vibe I'm taking from
this book so far and I want to do like
book club I want to have like everybody
all of y'all who have got that book and
are reading it I would love to like have
a discussion maybe we should do a
periscope about it but I'm not even
through the whole thing yet I'm just
getting into like what I think is my
wheelhouse of the book which is the
makeup chapter and I'm just love love
loving okay at this point I really am
just procrastinating so I love you guys
I'll see you later
