best in beauty video my favorites of the
month
this is a really no-nonsense favorites
video by that I mean there's nothing in
here that I just simply liked because
it's so pretty
sometimes that is my reason for liking
something but everything in this video
it has really earned its spot for being
something that is just it's practical it
has a purpose it really does something
that you can completely put your finger
on you know what I'm saying so that's
what I'm talking about today and I have
some things that are not really makeup
related and I think I'll start with
those because normally those get bumped
to the end of the video for whatever
reason but one thing is the shampoo that
I've been using lately and don't you
just love this hairstyle by the way just
loosely put it back this little part
fell down and then I kind of thought
maybe I like it that way
maybe I don't I'm not sure but I've got
this L'Oreal extraordinary clay
rebalancing shampoo and the point of
this it says oily roots and dry ends
isn't that an interesting concept
because that's pretty much always the
situation I feel like I'm dealing with
with my hair I have fine hair it's
straight when I see oil in my hair you
know it's right up here in the roots
that's like the reason that prompts me
to think normal I think I need to wash
my hair but my ends never really seem
that oily so I've been using this and I
really love it so much
one thing that I noticed right off the
bat the very first time I used it it
like as suds is up just immediately it
goes into a really thick rich lather
what's up with the clay thing it says
three refined clays silicone free it
says it instantly purifies oily roots
and hydrates dry lengths without
weighing it down for beautifully fresh
flowing hair from root to tip I'm also
using the conditioner as well these were
sent to me like a PR scent and I've been
using them since early January and oily
roots were something I remember dealing
with a lot shortly after Bell was born
and I haven't noticed that a whole lot
now but yet I think about the whole span
time I've been using it and kind of
overlaps with when I had Eve and maybe
this stuff is the reason why my hair
just feels really normal right now and
it feels like
light and clean at the roots and then it
definitely does feel nice toward the end
granted I have a shorter hairstyle now
so I'm not dealing with all that massive
amount of length you know so of the two
products for me I think the shampoo is
really the the main favorite here but it
says up to 48 hours of purified roots
and hydrated ends with the system so
truly I think this has been good for me
and I like that another thing that I'm
not sure if I mentioned this in a video
or now I know I've mentioned the spray
lotions before but this one is from st.
Ives and it's the coconut milk and
orchid extract this is something that's
kind of a rediscovered favorite I had it
for a while and then you get back into
this mode where you've got a newborn
baby and you're showering is like
happening so quick you know you can't
just spend forever in there unless
you're really sure someone's asleep you
know what I'm saying so I get out of the
shower and I'm just wanting something
very quick lotion wise not really one
thing necessarily that rich body butter
that you got to spend forever just
massaging into your skin this I love
because I can spray it all over but it
is still a really nice scent coconut
milk orchid extract it's really sweet a
little bit tropical if you've never seen
this stuff in action let me see if I can
just spray a little there on my arm see
how thin it is it almost looks a little
bit milky and then it just blends in
pretty much with just a swipe or two
over the product now if you've got
world's most dry scaly skin and that's
not going to be the most heavy-duty
lotion you could use obviously but just
for a little light you know moisture all
over I think that has worked really well
for me and like I said you can use it in
a hurry setting powders I got to I'm
going to mention here and what I feel
like I've talked about just to know and
recently because I love it so much and I
just I think it's a fantastic product
and I'm late to the party on it but I
think it's great it's the Laura Mercier
loose setting powder the translucent
setting powder I think it's so good it
adds a little coverage wherever I put it
but yet I can't really see a big powdery
look on my skin you know great for
baking great for just a light setting of
the under eye area or all over the face
so I do really enjoy this but in my
little makeup total I did the video on
this little
guy right here the thing that kind of
travels around the house with me and
what I can't really fit in you know
coming up here to the makeup room to do
my makeup I've got some stuff in there
that I can just use really quick and the
thing that lives in that bag is my
toothpaste primed and poreless and this
works well also I feel like when I'm in
a the biggest hurry I'm not wanting to
mess with loose powder products now that
that's some huge thing to work with but
you know it takes just a little more
doing and so this is just very easy and
it's less messy obviously you just pop
your brush in and this is great for
setting the t-zone
great for setting the under-eye area I
mean we're talking just basically a
colorless but very very smooth powder
next thing and it pains me kind of to
mention this because I know I'm going to
talk about how much I love it and it's
no longer really on the market but it's
this Bobbi Brown shimmer brick palette
Bobby took aloe is what it was called
and you may have remembered me talking
about this when I was contemplating what
I was going to get in the Sephora vib
sale and I think I mentioned it later on
in a hole that I've gotten it but it's
three shimmer bricks in one you've got
gold bronze and this one's called Wild
Rose and I really do like each one of
them I think they're really cool I enjoy
this palette more than I ever really
thought I would but here's why I'm
really choosing to bring it up in this
video bronze bronze is like the ultimate
this thing is so versatile this one can
do so much and these are all available
individually so if you're really
thinking about a shimmer break purchase
and you want to buy one that's like a
lot of bang for your buck I really think
bronze is it because guys this is like
my all over bronzers this is my
highlight this is my blush and this is
my eyeshadow and I thought I was really
accomplishing a lot when like I think I
talked about on snapchat or Instagram
that I had done like all of the color
products on my face just using this
whole palette like that's my blush
that's my highlight that's my bronzer
and eyeshadow but truly you can condense
it all down to just this one and it can
still be doing a lot for you it's a
matter of what kinds of brushes you use
so smaller brushes you know can
concentrate your color into the
different strips just the Sheerness with
which you apply it to the
in you know if I just want a light
little bronzy look all over I'll take
something like my ELF complexion brush
and just sleep it through all the colors
dust it all over if I want blush I go
toward basically you Center 3 right here
and it makes this pretty you know kind
of bronzy blush how about that highlight
this top shade or the top two shades I
mean it really can give you a beautiful
glowy
highlight and then for eyeshadow you
guys know how this works you just go to
the different shades that you want there
in the palette I use the darkest one in
my crease these kind of rusty reddish
shades are really beautiful blended just
up above the crease I've got the light
shade on the inner part of the lid I've
got the darkest shade again on the outer
part of the lid and I smudge that dark
bronzy color on my lower lash line as
well I've been doing this so much and I
haven't really been talking about it a
whole lot because again it lives in my
little traveling makeup bag and I use it
on days when I'm not really doing
anything particularly notable with my
makeup maybe I'm not shooting a video on
a specific product and just downstairs
trying to throw something together pop
this open and ultimately it's the bronze
one that I think is just the best lookie
here you guys were losing the whole
little clip back ponytails so I'm just
going to I'm getting a little trim on my
hair soon but it hasn't happened yet so
we're just kind of speaking of lower
lashline though my pencil brush I kind
of fallen in love all over again with my
Sigma e30 pencil brush not that I
haven't used it a lot like just all the
time but right now for whatever reason
I'm just really loving a nice smudgy
lower lash line and so this does that
for me it's really just the perfect size
I mean shaped like I mentioned and that
little bronzy shimmer brick it works
really nicely just to give your eyes
some definition but you can do it so
fast right because it's just it's not a
super precise brush also where the eyes
are concerned this tweezerman lash
curler and I've left a little box back
here so I can remind you of what the
exact name is because I mentioned this
in my haul but it's the pro curl lash
curler effective for most I shaped ideal
for round eyes and this comes in contact
with my entire lash line like no butt
business I can curl my life as quickly I
can just pop it on there and instantly
there's no fussing around there's no
like a little bit lower over here on the
right like nothing it just works I said
this in the hall as well but the
sponginess also of the little pad that
you clamp down on there is just right
because my lashes don't like to curl and
when it's got a little something to
squeeze into there they'll curl a lot
better so I love this lash curler it is
a bit more of an investment we're
talking like what was it 18 20 bucks but
alas curler is the kind of thing you're
going to use again and again and again
and they do give you a little thing of
three extra pads in here so you're
pretty much set for a good long while if
you get this I've had a cold recently my
lips have been more chapped than they
have been all winter long and so that
gave me a good opportunity to test out
some lip balms I tried several and I
determined that the one that really was
able to feel like it was repairing my
lips because there are plenty of great
lip balms that feel nice when your lips
are in decent condition or maybe they're
just kinda dry and you just need a
little something on there there are
loads of lip balms that work fine under
that circumstance but the thing that
worked best for my lips when they were
just at their worst and it helped them
heal I felt like it was this one from
Almay so I've talked about this before
and really putting it to the test
hardcore it works so well at the age
essentials lip treatment SPF 30
broad-spectrum lip balm it's got that
little pink core it's so softening and
it really felt like it had some staying
power on my lips which is a strange
thing to mention with a lip balm you
know you don't really think about that a
whole lot but so many of the lip balms
don't like the reason why they weren't
working for me is that they just be
there and gone in an instant you know
they rub off on my cup and then I don't
have time to spend grabbing it and
reapplying it all the time or thinking
about it really so with this I could
just put it on it had a nice thickness
to it right away and I felt like it
really stayed on my lips for a good long
time and the hydration whatever it was
giving back into my lips death
only like was there to stay so I enjoy
that very much if you're in need of a
great lip balm you might want to check
us out and yes if it's looking big it is
a big football and it has the lightest
nicest little like cotton candy scent I
love that oh one more thing I meant to
mention at the start is this hand
sanitizer spray from honest company
I am so hooked on these they're
everywhere throughout my house in the
car in my purse and this is the orange
scent which I think smells so so good I
also like the lavender and yeah this
one's got a Cinderella sticker randomly
put on the bottom of it I don't know who
chose to accessorize it but really good
stuff it's very fast drying just you
know a spritz there rub your hands
together and you feel like oh it's gone
but my hand smell nice I usually use a
few sprays of this and still it's just
very quick drying very easy to use and I
think I'm done now those are my
favorites of the month and you see what
I was talking about here everything does
something it's not just here because
it's looking pretty it actually works
so thank you guys so much for taking
time to watch I hope you've had a great
month and here's to a great March coming
up thank you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
