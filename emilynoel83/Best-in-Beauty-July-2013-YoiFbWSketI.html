that's where I tell you all about my
favorite products from the past month
and lately I've actually had a lot of
kind of what i think of as top products
type of videos like I've done dirt cheap
products worth trying high-end products
worth trying and I want you to know that
when I do things like that I am thinking
like of all time like ultimate favorite
some people have told me in response to
those videos like I've heard you
mentioned some of these things before
can't you give us some new things and
that's really what the monthly favorites
or best in beauty videos are all about
you know those are those things I've
really been latching on to lately know
what I'm saying so I'm first off in this
video I want to talk about the lip
product I'm wherever you watch beauty
broadcast live or you pay attention to
what i do on instagram l'oreal colour
riche gloss and this shade is rich pink
and i think this is such a great
versatile gloss it's kind of like a
neutral pink and i know it looks maybe
even a little bit deep there in the
packaging but it's really just such a
wearable shade and it's very very
comfortable if you hate sticky glosses
this might be something you enjoy and
wearing it today actually on top of
another lipstick i'm liking a lot which
is from Tarte and this is the glamazon
lipstick and inspired and i just love
this combo this is a great pink that is
actually pretty neutral so you can see
those two swatch they're together um
that's the lipstick that's the gloss and
I just love the way they come off
layered another one that I like layering
with this is my Kate Moss matte lipstick
number 103 of course it's fine on its
own and if you want to go Matt don't put
a gloss on top but for a bit more pinky
look I'll wear this lipstick and so
there's a swatch of then this happens to
be a lipstick that I'm totally
comfortable wearing on its own like I
don't feel like it's overly drying I
think it's comfortable on the lips but
if you do use any sort of product and
you're like man you know feels a little
dry this is a very comfortable gloss to
put on top and it also i think might
make things that you think are a little
bright for you just a little more where
another product I've really been getting
into lately is my benefit erase paste I
have it a number to medium and this is
one of those peachy salmon-colored
concealers that's great for your dark
under eyes and why I've been reaching
for this one more lately is because this
particular concealer has a lot of
moisture to it so it's very like I guess
kind of supple do we sort of a finish
and so I feel like my under eyes have
been a little more dry lately as of my
lips my lips have been a little more dry
too i'm not sure what's going on that
normally doesn't happen so much in the
summer but anyway i will put a little
bit of this on and use it underneath
pretty much any concealer i might apply
and I feel like over the course of the
day the whole area seems to stay a bit
more hydrated and I think the
formulation of this concealer is helping
with that it's also of course by nature
of its color it is kind of corrective on
those under eye areas another one that's
nice that I've recommended is the pixie
correction concentrate in brightening
peach and that's from target and that's
very similar this color wise but it
doesn't have quite the moisture in it so
that's kind of why I've been using this
lately another sort of makeup basic that
I've really enjoyed in my collection for
a while you can see a hit pan on it and
this is my Maybelline shine-free pressed
powder the shade is golden you may have
seen me reach for this in different
tutorials here and there but i often use
this brush this is probably another
favorite too this gets asked about so
much this is my tapered highlighting
brush from sigma and i like to use it
with powders that I just really don't
want to get everywhere this is not
really a powder that I we're all over my
face but I will just kind of dab it on
my forehead dust it around my t-zone my
chin area I feel like it does a
fantastic job of keeping me shine-free
like a pretty exceptional powder here I
just like you know confining it to a
certain area so you can see my cheeks
can have a little more glow but the nose
doesn't get out of control gotta watch
out for that t-zone sometimes it'll get
you I product I've really been liking is
my avon super shock cream liner or gel
liner and this shade is in velvet plum
and I got this kind of the last batch of
avon stuff i order
and i owe you guys I have a big Avon
review coming I've gotten some mark
stuff and some avon and wondering facts
it's loaded up but there will be reviews
coming but this is one thing in
particular that I've been using it's
just gorgeous I think a lot of cream gel
liners you know things you'll run across
in the drugstore they put him out in
really dark plum colors if it's going to
be plum it's going to be like nearly
black and this is just so gorgeous
because it is purpley I don't love the
brush that comes with it because it's
just a really you know cut straight
across type brush and I've got it out
for the purpose of swatching for you
here prefer to use like a really pointed
brush or maybe a smaller angle brush but
there's that liner and I just think it's
beautiful really good staying power on
this too this is the only one of the
super shock liners I've tried so far but
if you're kind of wondering what to get
from Avon might be worth trying velvet
plum is gorgeous cannot believe how much
I've been wearing my Sigma dare palette
over the past month and I've really been
attracted to the oranges lately I just
can't get enough orange and so this
ballot definitely a rediscovered thing
in my collection I've had it for years
and just kind of remembered lately oh
it's got that beautiful rust shade kind
of a reddish color peachy corals and
then a great contrast shade with this
plum so I've worn this in different
videos where you've seen a little bit of
an orange haze kind of sunset type look
coming off of my eye I also use this
yellow lots of people were asking me
about the yellow in my Mall of America
haul videos so I've been surprised at
how many different ways I've been able
to wear this you're all about oranges
and warm colors like I am these are
really fun to play with because I often
don't wear these as opaque as they might
appear here in the palette but when you
share them out a little bit they just
have the most beautiful warmth to them
and it's like yeah it takes a shade like
that to pull off that sort of look so I
love began finally another little I
shadow recommendation here and this is
something i blogged about is like a
hidden gem type product please read my
blog if you don't by the way there's a
lot of reviews on there
and a lot of things people ask me review
to review and I've got one on my blog
this is one of those things that another
youtuber started talking about and then
I felt compelled to buy it myself on
cats make occur case make up her name's
Casey and her channel of CAS makeup told
me about this or she actually told
everyone about this but it's called
sun-baked neutrals it's from Maybelline
it really is a great little eight pen
palette and it reminds me a lot of wet
and wild comfort zone only instead of
like half the palette being greens you
only have two green shades here but this
is a fantastic blending shade this matt
light brown some beautiful kind of
coppery bronzing metallics and then of
course you've got your greens as well
this brown down here is really creamy in
nice and it's just one of those pallets
I never really looked at much you know
I'm looking at the new stuff I'm looking
at the ice to do I shadows but I've
never looked at this much in the store
but I'm really glad I picked it up a
really nice versatile little neutral kit
that wraps up my best in beauty for the
month of July a lot of rediscovered
favorites it's fun to find those things
in your collection that you sort of
forgot about but they were really good
so thanks for watching guys and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
