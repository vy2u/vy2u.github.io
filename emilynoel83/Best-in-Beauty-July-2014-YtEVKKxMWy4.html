these are my favorite products for the
month of July so some of the things that
I've been using a lot lately is just
such a variety this month in terms of
new things rediscovered things that have
just kind of like re proven their worth
in my makeup collection and then I've
even got something that in the past I
didn't love so much but it's totally
kind of reinvented itself in my makeup
collection so I'm really excited to
share these finds with you first thing
that I must mention is a blush and it's
a Milani baked blush and they have all
these really kind of shimmery baked
blushes but they more recently came out
with a couple of matte ones and one of
them delicioso pink I think is just a
perfect perfect blush Italy I've really
been enjoying these blushes that don't
necessarily come across with their own
special color on your cheeks so to speak
or they don't stand out for their color
it's kind of a classic give your face a
glow make your face look better kind of
shade and what's interesting about this
shade is that well I do think it totally
gives a glow to the skin it doesn't give
off shimmer so it's just by nature of
this bright pink color when it sheers
out on your cheeks I think it's just
perfect so I've got some of that on I do
have a little highlight on top of that
if you are seeing some sheen here on my
face but the cheek color is this and I
don't know that you would have
necessarily guessed oh that's a bright
pink blush just kind of sheared out on
her cheeks but it really gives a
flattering look really recommend this
for anybody just looking for a
no-brainer blush that works with
anything products a couple different
things to mention first off what I've
been noticing that has been the thing
that I'm just tossing in my purse lately
sometimes I'll start the day with a
different kind of lip product but I know
that if I'm out and about I just want
something to throw on quickly and those
have been a couple of these maybelline
color whispers I really really like some
of the deeper more intense color
whispers I think they're gorgeous they
give off an impressive amount of color
but lately over the summer it's been
some of the lighter shades that I've
been using a bit more
including pin-up peach probably one of
my all-time favorites of the line and
that is what I have on now you know it
gives that soft peachy Coralie look to
the lips but very lightweight it just
looks really natural fresh and when I
want to reapply these it's no big deal I
really don't even feel the need to look
in the mirror and the other one is the
lust for blush color that I've talked
about a lot great kind of pinky nude
type of shade I think it's a total
standout in the whole line many people
seem to enjoy the soft nude colors that
have that hint of peach or a hint of
pink so if you like something a little
on the pinky side I think you'd enjoy
this on the other end of the
spectrum some more intense lip products
that I've also been enjoying have
definitely been the LA girl glazed lip
paints full review on all six of the
shades that they have in their line
bought these in the six pack on lady mas
calm so I have all the shades and they
remind me so much of OCC lip tars in
their texture and so that liquidy kind
of consistency makes them very easy to
mix and then you create your own custom
shades with them really full on color on
your lips a little bit of shine when
they're freshly put on but then as they
wear I think they tend to wear pretty
evenly Friday favorite shade in the line
that I've been enjoying the most is
probably blushing kind of a mauve a
little bit berry type color but there's
definitely like a little hint of purple
in this it's a very interesting shade
pretty Union it's hard to pick favorites
from this line because I really think
they're all great and they all have
their place if not individually as a
mixer type of shade but bombshell would
be the bright pink from this line is
just classic like hot pink very intense
love this shade for summer as well I
want to talk ice and just a few brushes
that seem to always be in my eye makeup
rotation whether I'm here at home I
recently traveled and it was like yes
absolutely I need to take these with me
and a couple of them are from Sonia
Kashuk I know I've talked tons and
you've seen me use this a lot the small
shadow brush it's so handy I mean it's
great for precise placement of shadow
maybe it's
I'm the outer part of your lid maybe the
inner part your lid this could even
smudge on your lower lashline oh or
maybe you just want to get right in the
crease and then blend it out with
something else it's just a really handy
go to brush love it so much but more
recently the one I've been using
alongside it has been the medium shadow
brush so if you look at these
side-by-side you can see the medium
shadow brush is definitely wider but
when you turn them it's a little bit
fluffier as well you can see there's a
little more like separation of the
bristles out there on the toward the tip
I love this for like a wash of color all
over your lid maybe you're just doing a
quick look and it's like I want it in my
lid I want it in my crease blend it out
with a fluffy brush and you're done
both of these are very very useful for
me I've had them both for a long time
they've gone through so many cleanings
and they kind of baffle me how I don't
give them really any special care I just
you know wash them up like every other
brush and they maintain such a wonderful
shape and you would know with your flat
brushes if you know the bristles are
starting to go out everywhere and it's
no longer giving you the precise
placement you were after before but
these are great low-cost brushes would
totally recommend them for your
eyeshadow looks a couple of other eye
products to talk about one of them is
from Ali and she has come out with the
matte shadow sticks you know I love the
ever color shadow sticks that are in
this white packaging but she recently
came out with a matte duo it's matte
brown and matte black and it comes with
like a little double ended brother geez
who continued to prove themselves to me
in a whole other way not only can they
make a great base for an eye look or a
nice you know smudgy smokey eye liner
but they're awesome in the waterline
this matte black has been probably one
of the most longest wearing things I
have used in my lower inner rim here
where many of us struggle to keep a
product in there I will go through a
whole day and double-check on this and
this is still there and I'm baffled by
it it's so long wearing I knew these
sticks already we're long wearing out
they've come out with these couple of
really rich dark match
I mean it just it works so well in the
water line I know this is an individual
thing though because some people get
super watery some people you know rub
their eyes a lot or they've got all
these circumstances where a product may
not last so I can't really guarantee
that it's gonna work the same way on
every person but for me it's absolutely
been wonderful most of what's in the
rest of the line is shimmery so it was
nice to see something matte come out I
only forward the makeup this is the
product that I know when it first came
out I racked up a bunch of dupes I'm
like all these shades are pretty common
I don't think this is a total must-have
palette and slowly it has edged its way
into my makeup routine the main reason
why is because when I was doing that
electric challenge with the Urban Decay
electric palette like 100 percent bright
color and it's something else to pull in
that contains some very basic colors so
I could you know have highlights or have
crease colors and this and then so naked
basics has really been awesome for me
and you know you open it up and you
think wow those are some pretty typical
shades you know if you like highlight
shades you got a brown you got a black
largely matte colors with the exception
of this one and ever since doing the
electric challenge I've kind of kept
this out and kept it very handy for
myself here on my makeup table and I've
been reaching for it so much more not
just along side bright shades but stuff
like this like you know I have one
random kind of colorful shade that I'm
using on my lid and then I go to this
palette and I used faint you know in my
crease I used a little bit of crave and
my eyeliner oxy was my highlight under
the brow so it's just really been a
great companion palette for me and yes I
do have like all of these shades in
singles throughout my collection but the
handiness
the convenience factor of having them
together in a little palette that's very
compact and if you were traveling and
you were taking some other palette that
just you know didn't quite have
everything you need didn't have all the
basics you know that when you toss this
in you do pretty much have everything so
I got to say this product at first I
didn't see that it was worth
that much to me and now I'm enjoying it
more and more and you could get looks
just you know with this palette on its
own they would be very basic very
neutral but I've really enjoyed it like
I said as a companion palette to some
other palettes that might be lacking a
few things I also really wanted to
mention something for those of you who
might also be spending some time in the
pool and getting a lot of chlorine and
your hair and potentially chlorine
buildup happening I noticed that
happening in my hair me it wasn't
something necessarily visible that I
could look at my hair and see but it
just didn't feel as clean as it normally
did up in the roots and so I knew I
needed something that went beyond my
typical shampoo and conditioner and so I
got the something called as an aqua swim
ultra swim and I actually bought it at
Ulta it's a shampoo and conditioner
specially formulated to remove chlorine
from your hair and that did a pretty
good job but I still didn't feel like
100% clean I mean I can just tell my
hair is very fine very straight and it
just has that slickness to it you know
when it's really really clean and I just
wasn't feeling it but a light bulb went
off in my head and I remembered when my
mom had me use this when I was quite a
bit younger and it's the Neutrogena
shampoo anti residue formula this stuff
totally cleans the hair I tell you I use
it maybe once or twice a week depending
on how much I've been swimming and it
does such a great job of getting my hair
super clean you know I still use a
pretty heavy-duty conditioner or on my
end it's talked about the Carol's
Daughter monoi deep conditioning hair
mask thing that's still awesome for me I
love it in terms of my scalp and just
getting everything super clean this is
the balm it really goes there one thing
about this that you will notice is it
smells very manly I think it has a very
strong scent that makes me think of a
guy's cologne and that doesn't
necessarily bother me I don't feel like
that scent lingers big-time in my hair
but you will totally smell it like you
can't miss this set so if that sounds
like it might be a little bothersome to
you maybe this isn't something you want
to go for
if your kind of feeling a little
desperate for some super squeaky clean
hair after your pool time this may be
worth checking out and you know just
drugstore prices so there you go that's
my best in beauty for the month of July
