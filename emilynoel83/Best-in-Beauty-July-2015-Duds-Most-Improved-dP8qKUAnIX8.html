for the month of July this video a
little bit different than my usual
because I did have a few kind of dud
products that I thought I might just
lump into this video also a couple of
improved products I'm excited to pass
those by you to see if anybody has felt
the same way about a couple of these
things also my hair is just feeling
really puffy today I made it wavy but
sometimes when I do that I like to like
just tip my head over and get it all
really like some volume in it I guess
lately I haven't been used to seeing
myself with really full hair so I'm
liking it but I think I'll jump in
talking about bronzers here and I think
my skin lately has had a little more
color to it so when I pop on some
bronzer and I don't mean in the
contouring sense but in the traditional
like just sweeping it all over the face
since I feel like bronzer just kind of
takes my skin to the next level just
really like the look that it gives and
one thing that has been a real go-to
lately is this laura geller compact and
it's big as you can see over on the
Express channel I did a dedicated video
to this product and it's half bronzed
and brighten and then you've got this
blush and then the french vanilla baked
highlight that I love so much and have
raved about for a few years now and so
I'm wearing all of this today I think it
makes for a really easy look you can
even just you know I'm not really doing
a major contour today but I did apply a
little bit extra of the bronzer down
there and I think it looks nice in that
way also that cool thing about Laura
Geller's baked products is that I feel
like they last forever
I have actually used up an entire
Bronson brighten before and I'm really
like proud of myself for doing that but
this is kind of a cool combo and I like
that the compact is actually so big
because there's plenty of room for your
brush to you know get all up in all
those products the blush is super
pigmented that is the blush I'm wearing
today it's got a little glow to it
probably has more glow than the
highlight the french vanilla baked
highlight which is pigmented in its own
right but it's more of a highlight that
I like to use to actually bring light to
a whole section of the
face and really create contrast with the
deeper tones that's a great shape for
that and then you can take your
SuperDuper shimmery highlights and apply
them in a very you know exact spot
actually a new highlight that I'm
playing with is from makeup revolution
got it from Ulta it's in the shade
golden lights it looks straight up white
but it has this really gold any kind of
Sheen to it but I just apply that very
targeted exactly where I want it but
I've got that French vanilla underneath
that's giving me the overall brightness
hopefully that all kind of makes sense
so that kind of brings me right into my
next product I know I can't shut up
about up and up brushes from Target but
they're an insanely good deal for how
soft and great quality they are and this
little guy is actually part of that
complexion brush set that I reviewed
probably around round about last year at
this time on the Express channel and
there is like an angled brush and a
couple different ones and there was this
isn't it kind of an interesting size I
mean look at it compared to my blush
brush it's pretty much like the exact
same cut as the blush brush but just
downsized and so it's really nice for
these more shimmery highlights when you
just want to go like on that one zone
you feel me on that when placement is
really key this brush is really nice for
putting it there so again that's part of
a little set and the other brushes in
that set are great as well but this one
I don't know if I initially appreciated
this one enough at first but it's really
nice it's also good if you needed a
brush to kind of set the under eye area
even just highlighter in general but I
find I've been using it more when I
really want to place a very shimmery
highlight somewhere another bronzer that
I've just been using the heck out of is
my Too Faced sun bunny two tones
sometimes I'll just swirl them all
together if I just want quick all-over
glow enos because this is a glowy
bronzer and then the deeper side is
probably what I use more of when I
really want to get it up around the
hairline get that JLo forehead I know
that sounds weird but she's always got
the most beautifully like bronzed up
forehead and this kind of gives that
look that's enough bronzer talk for a
little bit let's get into my other
obsession right now which is olive green
I shadow I am in such an olive phase
right now I'm not gonna apologize for it
I am just all in for the olives these
days and I've got a few different things
to talk about in varying intensities so
I'm going to start with what I would
call entry-level olive green I already
reviewed this did a little tutorial with
it on the Express channel but it's my
Sunkist olive duo Maybelline expert
where this is nothing like brand new to
the drugstore it's just new to me within
the past few weeks it really um I think
gives a nice classic but soft olive look
it's a great way to bust into a little
bit of color in your look if you're kind
of tired of just you know wearing brown
and bronze all the time this duo is very
simple and you can use this and only
this for your look and I like how the
olive has a little bit of a golden twist
the only thing as I said in my review
that I don't really like about this is
the fact that they didn't give it an
even split if not more of the olive
because the look that's kind of my go-to
with this incorporates a heck of a lot
more olive than it does this shade but
this is gonna be your I just want to dip
my toe into greens type shade and then
if you're saying okay I'm fully
committed to this green life you got
going on boom l'oreal infallible now
this is really pretty new to me but it's
just sneaking in i just got to mention
it it's golden emerald l'oreal
infallible it's just money I love it
it's watched here next to the Maybelline
duo it's more shimmery it's more green
it's just more of a commitment to green
and I do have that all over my lids
today and I've also worked in one other
thing that I want to mention that's
green this is my camo chrome trio from
Estee Lauder this deep shade takes you a
little bit more in a teal green
direction but this color here so so
shimmery so I added some of that the
really really shimmery one on top of
this I really like that result this
shade - I mean that is serious look at
that cream with beautiful golden glow so
I've got that around my inner corner as
well I think I use that on my swatch
finger where I put something deeper and
see how it just has no problem standing
out so there's those three swatch dry
and then my buddy David who is an
stay water makeup artist at Bergdorf
Goodman he recommends wearing this
middle shade like wet or I've put it on
a base and it has an even different look
there's that color applied wet a whole
other animal going on right up my green
ally right now so I really wanted to
share those with you you might also
notice a little warmish brown in this
look and I pulled that shade right here
from this mad format palette from elf
that's what I've got kind of just up
above the crease and just a teeny bit of
that on the lower lash line too
I've got a few lip colors to discuss
I've really been all over the place with
lip colors lately which is not out of
the ordinary for me I really like to try
different things but there are a few
here that I think pair especially well
with the olive looks one of them this
hard candy plumping serum lipstick which
I love and if these are so so creamy and
comfortable and this is in the shade
anonymous it's a really nice kind of
nude with a little bit of peach it looks
really great on its own you can add a
little dimension by wearing it with a
slightly deeper lip liner but I've worn
this quite a bit lately gotten a lot of
compliments with it love layering it up
with Milani lip liner in spice it's nice
to see a lipstick that's got that much
creaminess and shine to it but it's
still really pigmented you know I
wouldn't call it a sheer color so love
that also just these kind of earthy
little bit reddish tones are great
this is the colour-pop ultra matte lip
color and this is a shade bumble and I
just think it's beautiful it might be
coming off like extra red on camera
because I'm so like lit right here it's
kind of like that marsala color of the
year type shade I really really like it
and I've been enjoying these ultra matte
lip colors too they are a liquid lip
color that fully dries down so like it
if not kiss off onto anything and for me
I love that because when I give Bella
kiss all right you know take a drink of
coffee I don't see any transfer off like
price that you pay for that is that it
doesn't feel moisturized really to your
lips so I think your lips have to be in
pretty good condition
going into wearing something like
also a little tip with application on
these try to apply the thinnest amount
possible there's no need to like cake it
up and go extra rounds around your lip
with this stuff the thinnest amount of
this will feel best on your lips and
it's just all you need so bumble is a
definite recommendation here also love
the shade called drive in this was I
think the first one I put on from this
whole selection and it remains to be one
of my favorites just a really pretty
like orchid purpley color definitely
other end of the spectrum from these
more neutral earthy shades I'm talking
about but I love this nonetheless and
wanted to give that a shout out pepper
girl has some jumbo gloss balm creams
and I have this shade called berries and
cream get questions about this any time
I wear it because it's this pretty like
kind of mauve pink with a little bit of
a satiny finish see that tiny bit of
frost that's happening in here I'm not
normally a fan of that but it just works
for this particular color you know
because it's kind of a more natural tone
it looks it just looks right on the lips
that's all I can say a little bit of a
rediscovered product because I recently
repurchase this and just realizing how
much I love it all over again my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer I've got it now in
the shade NC 25 and it's just there's
just so many great things about this a
little goes a long way that's one pro to
it it's super full coverage it doesn't
necessarily require a lot of setting on
top of it just kind of goes matte and
flawless and you don't really have to
worry about that so much I love the pump
style because you can kind of make sure
you're dispensing the same amount every
time and it just kind of makes me worry
less about what foundation I'm going to
wear because I know when I got this I
can take care of where I need the extra
coverage so love that that's always
great now a couple of those products
that I wanted to discuss with you that I
suspect have improved a little bit over
time one of them and I really didn't
like this product at first I do have the
full review on it when it was just out
in black and it's the benefit they're
real push-up liner and more recently
they've come out with some colors they
sent me these colors and this is the one
in
I'm not sure of the specific name but
it's the green one and I've been using
this playing around with the others as
well and I feel like the consistency it
has gotten more creamy at first a
complaint of mine was that it was kind
of dry and when I would apply it it's
like the product would almost ball up a
little bit out of this tip and the
product if you're not familiar it's like
this flexible silicon tip but so there's
some product coming out now but the
product is coming out the middle and so
you twist it up and your cream is just
coming up through and even now when I
first use it like just initially open it
up twist it up I feel like the product
needs maybe a bit of warming up but once
I get going
I feel like it applies ten times better
than the old one did this is what I'm
wearing as my winged liner today
I think this green is just a gorgeous
color I really wanted to love this color
and I was glad that I just thought the
application has been easier with these
another product that I think has
improved is this elf makeup mist and set
it says with a low green tea cucumber
and vitamins A C and E first got one of
these like after it was launched that
may have been a few years back and I
remember my complaint about it was that
when I would spray it I didn't think the
sprayer was working very well it wasn't
giving me like consistent sprays and too
much was coming out like too big of
particles bits dots I could just see it
more like when I would apply it to my
skin I could see the dots of it and now
the mist mmm the mist is so fine it
sprays out a lot better so this is a
newer one that I've gotten and I feel
like it's gotten better has anybody else
noticed that - I don't know I just
wanted to pass that by you because I've
been all about the setting mists lately
and I think this is gonna work its way
into my rotation because it just it
gives you this big fanned out fine mist
and I never noticed that about it when
it first came out so yay a few little
duds to mention here briefly one is the
Rimmel BB cream radiance I'm a huge fan
of the traditional the first one that
came out the Rimmel BB cream with the
blue cap on it I think that's like the
best BB cream from the drugstore has the
best coverage
just applies easily really love it and
so then I got the radiance and the Matt
the Matt I haven't really messed with
enough to give you a real verdict on it
but this radiance one I feel like this
is just when I apply it I can see it
just sitting on top of my skin it does
not even apply with my fingers where you
might think maybe the heat from your
hand really helps it just sink in it
still just does not look right on me it
just really looks like makeup the finish
of the original one just looks really
like natural but it still has some
coverage it's just everything I would
want in a BB cream and this one just
didn't measure up for me another thing
that I was really liking using when I
first got it kept using it some more and
started to not like it is this elf SPF
20 sunscreen face primer and says fills
in fine lines and creates a flawless
finish and I do like and of course the
pump isn't pumping it out come on pump
there we go I feel like it's kind of
thin and it gives a nice silky feel but
what I'm noticing now about this that I
didn't notice right at the start is that
there are like little gritty bits in it
I don't know where that grit is coming
from I feel like there's a an ingredient
in here that's maybe settled or
something's happened with it where it's
solidified and it's coming out in little
gritty flecks that don't really mesh
into my skin when I apply this and at
first I thought okay you know here's
your SPF 20 and the primer maybe that's
adding a little something extra to my
skin because I've already got SPF and my
moisturizer and maybe even my foundation
on somedays I thought this was going to
be good stuff but it's just with time I
haven't enjoyed it I don't know if
anybody else has noticed that when I did
my did elf dupit video I was talking
about
malee face defender and then elf has a
product that spoiler alert did not
measure a huppah to what Malley's was I
noticed some questions about another
similar product to those that benefit
has out and so I thought I would just
update you and mention that here in this
video is the professional license to
blot and it's an invisible finished pore
perfecting instant oil blotting stick so
they
basically no puff involved in this
you've just got this stick that twists
up it feels like a creamy kind of thick
lip balm actually if you swirl your
finger on this you definitely feel more
product coming off of it than you would
the Mallee face defender and if it
already has dr. feelgood it feels like
that kind of consistency put into a
stick
so just consistency wise no I don't feel
like it's the same as Mally's face
defender but I'm a little put off by
taking the product taking this balm and
like dabbing it on my nose that just
feels funny to me that the product
itself is going to be collecting the
oils from my skin and then it's gonna
sit on there until I wipe it off and
then not to mention the fact that when I
have tried this and my nose is oily my
nose really doesn't have any oil on it
right now cuz this is a pretty fresh
application but it just does that weird
kind of collecting on the remaining
makeup type thing and sort of
exaggerating what makeup does remain on
your skin kind of like the elf one did
the only thing I can say is that it's
cute you know like I appreciate the
little professional detective woman I
think she's cute on all the professional
products but I just it's not working for
me so I end this favorites video on a
down note but I just wanted to tell you
about that and thank you guys so much
for watching my videos I truly
appreciate it I love getting your
requests all the time I love interacting
on snapchat so thank you so much for
snapping me and I will talk to you guys
