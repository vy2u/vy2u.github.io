baby fruits video because I've got so
many great makeup products to talk about
this month just a lot of cool things
have worked their way into my beauty
routine lately so I'm going to share
those with you I'm gonna try not to take
forever on each and every one but at
that a little box here and it is quite
full so I'm gonna jump in and tell you
the first things just foundation face
wise the things I've really been liking
the best but they haven't necessarily
been part of my game for the entire
month but they're certainly things that
I enjoy a lot and I've been using very
consistently since I discovered them so
they are the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation the Tarte shake tape
concealer I did a full video very
in-depth devoted to both of these things
and the application and the wear time I
would say just check out that video for
the most comprehensive information on
these products that I wear the
foundation in 4.5 the shape tape in
light to medium and they're just they're
amazing if you're into the full coverage
look so that is my ultimate full
coverage face video if you want more
details also a killer highlight that
have been using lately and a lot of
times I feel like I'm maybe a little bit
more drawn to the powdery highlights
just cuz they're so quick they're very
low fuss in application but this is a
stick cream highlight it's from NYX and
it's called bright idea and I have this
in the shade Chardonnay shimmer they had
quite a range actually I purchased this
off the Voltas website and I got this
one
because I thought hey that looks maybe a
little more beige II a little more nude
a little bit more like might naturally
occur from the skin you know so I got it
and I was at first really impressed with
the way it's watched and the way I could
just blend it out with my fingers but it
looks just so whoo glowing on the skin
like I'm getting told I have that
pregnancy glow I'm sorry but I did not
wake up like this this is pregnancy glow
and a stick glow is so perfect and it's
so undetectable in terms of looking up
close at my face and seeing any kind of
shimmer or particles or sparkle no you
see none of that it's the closest thing
I think to the effect that I get from
the
shimmering skin perfecter in the
liquefied form I know that was like the
top reason why I raved about that
product because once it's kind of
blended out on the skin you just don't
see product and it's kind of fascinating
how that works so just in case you were
wondering the way I apply this it's a
big chubby stick here I take my ELF
small stipple brush I just kind of you
know go across the top like that and
then dab it right on top of the cheek
and onna could not be easier but it's
just a next-level really pretty glow
that's where the glows covered from I
mean I may have woken up a little on the
bloated side but my skin was not doing
this I can tell you that moving on to a
bronzer that is a rediscovered product I
love when a rediscovered thing makes its
way into my favorites and this is the
laura geller bronzed and brighten and
this product I tell you what the first
time I had it it was in a smaller size
you know how laura geller sometimes puts
out the little travel kits and it was
the size of I don't know like a silver
gun excuse me is this like a silver
dollar is anybody familiar with the size
of a silver dollar I don't know anyway
these are baked products they are kind
of domed up a little they are made on
these terracotta tiles which you will
see underneath if you ever do hit pan
but that one that's a product I
completely used up and it took me so
long
I used it consistently but it took me
forever to use up since that time I've
purchased the full size and while I have
kind of flattened off the dome a little
bit I still think it's gonna take me a
good long while to actually go through
it but this is a great bronzer very like
skin brightening it's not to like
intensely warm it's very kind of
brownish I think but when you swirl your
brush in it you've got all these like
beige tones a little bit pinky tones and
some deeper Brown and tan colors in
there so it's a real mix and I feel like
the end result on the skin is just very
pretty and very natural and the finish
of this is overall just matte and so I
use it with my ELF complexion brush
which looks like this and it's just a
perfect kind of bronzer all over face
powder anything type brush I just dab
around and I'll go forehead I'll
sometimes for a quick contour might hit
under the
cheekbones but you know it's overall
it's bronzer it's a skin tone boosting
type product blush wise a blush that
I've been so enjoying and it's been a
little surprising just because to look
at it in the pan you think oh that
doesn't look like much but it is the Mac
mineralized blush in warm sole and I
really like wearing it on its own I
applied it what was a video where I
applied this just as is I think it was
the foundation video I did recently and
I just popped it on real quick look
beautiful you know it has some Sheen but
it's not something where you're gonna
see flecks of sparkle and shimmer it's
just a very naturally pretty look but I
also have like this in terms of layering
it so like today I'm wearing one of my
favorite bys from the Nordstrom sale my
favorite buy from the Nordstrom sale by
the way the anniversary sale probably
that lorac palette that I just whoa that
I just tutorial for you but this shade
for example this is just like a for
instance here I put this on my cheeks
and then I layered a little bit of that
on top and then for the ultimate you
know glow I put the stick on top of that
and that's how all this is getting a
cheap there on the cheek area but the
point I'm kind of trying to make here is
that this is just a nice blush on its
own or you may find it really really
beautiful layered on top of darker
blushes more neutral blushes matte
blushes whatever the case may be it's
just a nice little companion let's talk
brows for a second I feel like I can get
away as being a full brown person I can
get away with a lot of different things
because I'm not maybe gonna be as picky
as someone who is waking up with no
brows and having to go to a lot of extra
effort to create the brow you know what
I mean tone is still very important to
me consistency is important and just
ease of use is those are three factors
that I think matter a lot to me so
something I've been using lately is this
L'Oreal brow stylist definer this was
mentioned to me back when I did a video
talking about how the NYX micro brow is
a total dupe of the Anastacio brow was I
think this was just kind of getting out
there to people at that time and several
of you said you've got to check out this
pencil from L'Oreal it's even better
well to me I find this to be really
similar to NYX micro brow
and the brow is I mean it's certainly
the same shape like it's just as
itty-bitty and skinny and precise and
it's got the little spoolie wand at the
other end and I wear this in the shade
brunette which there are three shades
and this is the middle one and when
y'all were telling me that there are
only three colors in this product I
thought okay yeah there's gonna be one
in there that's gonna be just my dead-on
match but this is it it happens to be it
it's not too warm it transfers down
easily it's creamy but it's not as
creamy as the colour-pop brow pencil
that I've been working with for a while
so I guess I'm here to say that I like
it but I also do like brow Wiz and micro
brow and those other things like that
for me just happen to really work well
because like I said I'm going in this
area I'm filling in some there I'm
filling in a little bit around the end
but I'm not doing a ton of work on the
brows but the shade range is certainly I
think more vast with the anastacio and
the NYX selection just FYI and also
color pop has a lot of shades for this
only having three it might be a little
bit more questionable as to whether you
come up with the perfect shade for you
an eyeshadow product that's kind of like
rediscovered because it's been lurking
it's been creeping around in my stash
and I bought it I remember i swatched i
swatched on snapchat I was impressed
where did it go you know what happened
well it's back I've been playing around
with this recently and I am so so
impressed it's this wet and wild palette
which I believe is exclusive to Walmart
correct me if I'm wrong but that's the
only place I found this and one that
looks a whole lot like the Naked palette
that one's fine too but it just doesn't
like excite me quite as much because it
seems so similar you know it's just like
a kind of a one of those repeat palettes
so this is the one called nude Awakening
and this is for my berry people out
there who love this kind of shade if
this shade is speaking to you you will
love this because this is just a beaut
look at the intensity there that kind of
reminds me of you know the ashkelon of
shadow we're getting from regular wet
and wild color icon
you know trios and
the comfort zone palette and things of
that nature but just a little bit
different format here but I feel like in
terms of quality it's all there I mean
these mats are just that couldn't be
more rich and full on opaque so I'm very
pleased with this if you think these are
the kinds of shades you're gonna want to
wear like particularly headed into fall
it's great a few basic mats that I want
to point out would be this shade right
here at the end this kind of creamy
color and then you've got this one
perfection in the crease deeper deeper
darker crease color berry smoke it out
smudge it out you'll see more red and
burgundy in that color it's just
beautiful and then you've got this matte
kind of like charcoal grayish color and
a matte black so I feel like all the
basic matte bases are covered here and
then you've got interesting little
shimmery pops some are a bit more peach
some a little more in the pink
department but all beautiful and I got
to get that black swatch off of my
finger before it transfers somewhere it
shouldn't be I get such satisfaction
when drugstore shadows are awesome like
that you know sometimes I'll come across
someone randomly on YouTube and they
kind of just like lump all drugstore
shadows together like make this huge
generalization that you know well for a
drugstore channel and say okay well you
know what drugstore shadows can no
longer just be lumped into some category
as subpar eyeshadows because if there's
stuff like this out there in the
drugstore you know there are fantastic
quality product yeah there are some duds
but you know there are some duds from
Dior too so don't tell me that let's get
off that soapbox shall we um another
drugstore shadow thing wait I'm still on
drugstore shadow ah the L'Oreal quads
I've reviewed these I love these I
really love all of the ones that I
picked out because I had the the French
biscuit which is great you know basic
kind of warmish Browns charcoal pretty
gorgeous purple quad I've got the Rose
one at some point in time or another
I've tried all of these and shown them
on snapchat really easy basic one to
pull for though is the boudoir charm
because this is one where there are a
couple of awesome mid-tones that
easily be worn all on their own are just
paired with the highlight or just smudge
that little guy on lower lashline it's
so so easy if you like these kind of
bronzy autumnal type shades one of the
biggest questions I came away with from
my review on these was are they the same
quality as the color riche singles not
the infallible singles but a lot of
people were wondering about those color
riche singles that I think are kind of
like a little bit squared off pressed
eyeshadows that came out more recently
and to me the ones that I have from that
collection are very hit and miss more
toward the miss side and I feel like
these quads that I have are so much more
consistent you know the shades are
really soft really pigmented just easy
to blend and work with and I like the
shade selection and now it was about
that time where you're thinking okay can
this girl please stop talking about
eyeshadows for a minute but I've got one
more thing that I have to share because
it is a true favorite in my soul and if
I don't talk about it in this video it
would just be wrong and it's the Mallee
muted Muse eyes shadow palette if you
haven't heard about this I'm not really
shocked because this is a product I've
only seen on QVC's website it was a
situation where I think either on
Mally's Instagram or snapchat or
somewhere I saw her mention that this
was the one time only value on a certain
day and it was being sold for like 25
bucks or something some kind of
ridiculously good price and so I'm like
okay I'm just gonna go to the QVC
website and order that I didn't even see
the presentation but I just thought it
looked like the kind of palette I was
really gonna love and I'm so glad I got
it because I do love it probably the
best quality eyeshadow I think Malley
has ever put out and I have religiously
kept up with her palettes I feel like
these are next level just creamy easy to
use and just gorgeous shade selection in
here I'm so happy with it it came with a
brush by the way I feel like the brush
would be huge for me to apply eyeshadow
with it just seems so big but it's
fantastic for concealer I used it for my
concealer eye with the Tarte shape tape
today and I was like wow there's a
perfect it's like this little end will
get right in there and the flat side
just really sweeps it on nicely I shadow
though the shades in here are so
gorgeous like this orange what you know
it's random and it might look random if
you just glance at it but that kind of a
shade blended up just above the crease
is just it's money it's awesome and
there's a shade in here that I feel so
especially strongly about and of course
when I move into that shade we've got
lawnmower next door so I might be a
little distracted here but it's this
color called fancy if I could create an
eye shadow color it would probably look
like this it is if taupe and mauve and
plum had a baby it's so so beautiful I
can't get over and I would probably name
it fancy too in tribute to the Reba song
that I'm always singing around the house
when I'm doing stuff like chopping
strawberries for bail you know it's just
so so ooh
it's tasty and it has this sheen on it
that is almost why is it picking up like
a little bit of a golden peach thing
with the shine in that color I don't
know it's so unique and interesting so
if you're not comfortable just bouncing
around the entire pallet and you look
vertically you can see kind of this
plummy selection a warmer selection with
your matte Brown you got a matte plum
here daydream has a little Sheen to it
artistry over here is matte and then
awakening has a little bit of a sheen in
the description on the website
these weren't like marketed necessarily
as face contour products but I did
contour with it today and guess what
it's that that's a perfect contour color
any of y'all can look at that why am I
saying y'all so much lately it's just
easier but you know just by looking that
that shade popped into the hollow of the
cheek is just perfect and then you've
got a little shine and glow if you want
it there but I like that they're kind of
jumbo sized here even if not for
anything else but the eyes because that
is your easy crease color and then you
can dress it up with all these other
things I'm sorry guys I feel like I'm
having one of those days I've got just
thoughts of poppin in my head but this
is the palette I'm wearing today I've
got fancy used all over the lid into the
crease a little bit of the plum in the
priests as well a little bit of this I
can't stop burping sorry right around
the inner corner and I smudged some of
the dark brown on the lower lashline too
when I got it that was on that one-time
only value so it was like under 30 bucks
I think now it might be right around 30
bucks still I think it's awesome also
what I'm wearing today is this product
from Mac and it's one of their tender
talked lip balms I think this is kind of
a new thing and look how fun that
packaging is it's so like I don't know
disco type thing but the product on the
inside could not be more like low
maintenance and easy total lip balm
style product here and did I say this
isn't the shade teddy pink so I went a
little bit brighter because I suspected
you know given the balm in the name that
these were gonna be more on the shear
side so I went brighter and I love this
color this is not necessarily a shade
that's been living in the makeup room so
much and I don't always start my day
with this because it's more so in my
purse because it's an easy touch-up and
today this morning I don't know if you
guys are hearing that more that's next
door but I feel like he's in our yard
well if you wanna mow our yard I mean go
ahead but today I popped on a little bit
of lip liner this is the Rimmel
exaggerate lip liner in East End snobs
so just a soft pink and then this you
know the color is kind of buildable it's
so just mmm
comfy creamy smooth love it easy to
throw on without even looking in a
mirror but here's my question how is
this different from this aside from the
packaging looking different this is the
huggable lip color in the shade bear hug
not like grizzly bear but like ba re hug
and this is kind of a coral e color I'm
not comparing shades that like the
texture of these two products seems
identical to me and if anybody wants to
sort out the differences and you're a
real like matte guru please tell me
because I feel like they're just the
same kind of feel and I like them both
but why do we have different lines I'm
not sure last thing I want to mention is
a brush cleaning product and it is from
Benji Bell and if that name sounds
familiar that's the brand that makes the
brush trees where you can stick
brushes in and dry them I love those
it's a great invention it's a fantastic
innovation in the makeup world to have
that method where you can hang them up
basically they're hanging upside down in
this little brush tree and I think the
one I have is the Daisy or the snow I
think I have the sunflower and it has
all kinds of different sizes so it's
perfect for your little brushes and your
big brushes hang them there all at once
let them dry overnight but they put out
some brush cleaning products this is the
organic breast shampoo so kind of a gel
like you know type consistency and this
surprised me so much in how effectively
and completely clean it gets my brushes
so I would say I use two pumps to get a
Sigma f80 just completely completely
clean these kinds of dense brushes take
a little extra work because you know it
also depends on the kind of product
you're using with them but odds are
those are going to be used to apply
foundations which I just think cling
into those brushes a little bit harder
than a powdery product mice so how long
has it been since you've cleaned your
brushes what kind of products have you
been using with your brushes that could
dictate how hard it is to clean but
really with minimal effort and just a
couple pumps of the soap I feel like
those get 100% back to new clean and
then with smaller brushes or brushes I
might use exclusively for powder
I swear I'm just using like a quarter of
a pump I'm not even taking it down
halfway and the brush will get
completely clean and I've got like a
little brush cleaning tool that is
insanely cheap that I want to use it
just a little bit more before I'm really
confident in recommending it to you guys
so hang tight on that issue I may do a
brush cleaning video soon but this stuff
I've been using for a while and I can
tell you know it does a better job than
the baby shampoo of quickly and
effectively getting the brushes totally
clean suds up great it rinses clean it's
just an awesome product and the pump
that it has is so great because that's
how you can know like okay I'm just
using the quarter pump you start to
understand how much it's gonna take to
clean certain kinds of brushes and you
can make sure you're not overusing the
product so that's great great design and
that is it I am finally done with my
best in beauty for this month I thank
you guys so much for the time that you
spend with me throughout your
I love hearing that you enjoy the videos
but this is a total two-way street
because I love sitting here making the
videos too so thank you for giving me
this opportunity to have a makeup
obsessed audience to speak to about
these things because it brings me joy it
brings me happiness I love connecting
with you guys and I'm so thankful for
you I would also like to give a little
shout out to my friend Erica Jones
because she has gone through a very
difficult loss recently she lost her
granny and if she calls her granny very
precious person to her and I know it's
been a difficult time but she has come
back to her YouTube channel and posted
her like favorites of the last couple of
months and I just really enjoyed that
video it was nice to see her again first
off but also her beauty favorites and
just some random things that she had on
there I thought it was just really a fun
video and if you want to go over and
show her some love I know many of you
like watching her too she's got that
great Kentuckian voice so I just I love
listening to her because you got the
best accent ever check out her video

tough time and it's great to see her
