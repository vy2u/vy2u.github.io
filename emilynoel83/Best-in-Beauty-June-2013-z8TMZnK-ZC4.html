this would be for the month of june so
favorite products in june beauty
products have been using a lot this is
pretty much purely makeup in this video
sometimes I pull in different body
products or hair stuff but I mean if
this has just been all about the makeup
and I have been compiling this list as I
do all throughout the month I just kind
of have a little post-it note here by my
makeup area and I attack something mon
when I think it needs to be included and
I'm gonna start off with my lip product
I'm wearing it now gosh i love this pink
this is a great pink lipstick and it's
from avon i have had so many requests
from people saying get some avon stuff
try it out and review it for us and so
I've been doing that a couple times and
I'm just going through it and trying to
see what I think of it so future video
alert that's coming but is the totally
kissable lipstick and the shade is
lovey-dovey pink lovey-dovey pink it's a
beautiful pink with a little bit of
pearlescent tone to it i don't think
it's like a completely frosty looking
lipstick but it does have a little
shimmer and i like it i love the feel of
it it's super comfortable on the lip
formula seems to make my lips just come
across a little bit plumper i don't
think it might be a line filling kind of
thing that's happening here but this is
just a really great lipstick I love the
shade if anybody else has this back me
up on this tell me if you like it but um
gosh I just love putting it on it's so
smooth I mean who can't use a shade like
this in their collection I just love
them on lips I'm just gonna mention my
other favorite and i know i did my whole
on these kind of recently but i've been
using these before I just wasn't really
going to talk about them much until I
did my whole but really a star product
that I love on the elf lip balm tints
these are two dollars and I haven't seen
him in my target store yet but they are
definitely on the elf website I had them
in nude and Barry I don't think I could
choose between the two like they're both
Oh
and these remind me I mentioned it in my
elf haul but they totally remind me as
the Loreal hit jelly bombs that I used
to love and then they took them away
reuni colorful pigmented shades there's
the berry in the nude just get a little
on my finger here so you can get a sense
of how actually richly colored these are
see that I love it and they have a great
sent a little bit of a lightly sweet
flavor um but just really impressed with
the amount of color that comes across on
these how comfortable they are on yes
they are something that's going to be a
little bit glossy I just really like
them and they're nice and quick to put
on you can put them on with the lip
brush put them on with your finger um I
just think if you're placing an elf
order this would be maybe you just want
to try one of these because I think
you're going to really enjoy it we talk
lashes for a second and the lashes i
just love so much red cherry number 43
ah i know i've gotten in some kind of
mode where for a long time it was like
demi wispies were it for me it was like
I was going steady with them you know
like they were my lash and I still love
them but some about these I mean
goodness gracious on my blog post i
talked about how they're kind of like
you got shorter lengths you've got
longer lengths these seem to have more
length overall than the demi wispies
thing that makes these really really
wearable you see how short they get on
the inner part I think if you're wanting
a lash that really blends in with your
own lashes look for something that
tapers to a very short length on the
inside because things that stay a little
bit too long they can be very visible on
the lash line you know I'm saying like
they can you can really see where the
lash starts when they taper down to very
short they blend in so easily like
effortless listening not so much a
particular product but kind of a tip a
just a technique I'd like to incorporate
at the end of my beauty routine I'm done
doing my makeup and I want to give the
look like completely done with face
makeup everything
on but I've want the look to just have a
little extra summary glow this is how
I'm getting use of bronzers that I have
that might have a little shimmer in them
maybe you know you're all about the
matte bronzer and you're like for the
contour I do too but I do have some
shimmery bronzers like for example this
NYC Sun and bronze bronzing powder this
is in montauk bronze it's just strips of
rather shimmery satin finish type
bronzer I love taking one of these duo
fiber brush brushes and I will have this
specific number of this because it's
kind of this is the old numbering and
that's on this one but see how it's got
nice tapered bristles really light light
fluffy brush not going to get a dense
application of color with something like
this right so get you a brush like this
and any I mean you can do this with
matte bronzer Stubbe sure but I just
like to use the kind of glowy ones in
this way get a little bit on there and
then just finish off right on top of my
makeup with just a little bit of this
glowy goodness and I like it really just
like the light finishing touch that that
gives and you know what you get to
Dustin you can dust all over your arms
your body wherever but I just found
myself doing this a lot so I just wanted
to let you know maybe you've got some
kind of shimmery bronzers and you're
wondering how do I get use out of this
use them you know use them on your body
maybe even with a bigger brush but
really lightly on the face with a brush
like this you're not going to overdo it
eyeliner alert here people if you've
only been like half watching if you're
multitasking now give me your attention
on this master drama taupe take over
this is a taupe maybelline master drama
eyeliner i believe this is limited
edition that's why would you like some
kind of flashing like limited edition
signage here or something so you know
this is not probably something you can
just get go out and get any time but
this is a beautiful color I absolutely
love it i'm going to lay on a thick
swatch here you so you can see the color
love it see how it's a little metallic
this could easily be smudged as like a
base type chat
but where I like putting it is smudging
it right under here and you don't even
have to go too much effort to smudge it
because it's kind of just a lighter
lower contrast with your skin tone type
shade anyway so I just kind of go
underneath here and I mean I don't
always set it with anything because this
is a really long wearing liner you know
I love the master drama and midnight
master for a great black but this is
such a pretty liner underneath here and
if you're going smokey if you're lining
the waterline with some black this is my
vision okay this is what I do with this
a lot in what I did with it today line
your waterline with black go underneath
here with some of this do your lower
lash mascara and those lower lashes kind
of like almost pop a little bit more
with this slightly metallic shiny shade
right in the background I love this is
set on my hand in a rub it anywhere you
know that stand put love that they came
out with the taupe shade of this if you
love your satin taupe I shadows and
you're all about that kind of shade pick
this up you will enjoy it to know it
last little thing here also kind of a
technique idea thing that I've been
doing lately and you don't need these
exact products to do it with but if you
do want these products check out Milani
on cherry culture calm cherry culture
that website has like old Milani stuff
like the sunset duo's i just recently
realized the old little round shadows if
you have been a big Milani lover for
years you know they had great single
little shadows smaller than these and
they were awesome they've got everything
on there so browse to your heart's
content you will find some things you
like but what I'm getting at here is I
have a Mac real pure white shade here
and I have a matte cream eyeshadow what
I like doing with this matt white and
this shade is called white lie it's the
Milani powder shadow I have a full
review on all these powder shadows a
purely white matte eyeshadow I am loving
the look of going with matt white right
in here I don't know what it is it's
brightening um it's really clean and it
looks good when you you know maybe
you're blending in
whether it's a shimmery shade another
matte shade it plays well with others it
you know you have this you can put it on
there and you can get really nice
looking fades into other shades and so I
would normally go shimmery there but now
i'm really liking the look of matt also
the white shade and the meet Matt nude
palette same thing but you probably have
a purely white matte shade just make
sure it's like a nicely pigmented one
not one that's super dry and flaky is
the off white cream shade come in this
one's called french vanilla this is
another Milani powder shadow another
totally matte one and I'm realizing how
much i also like matt right up in here
so this is another instance where i
might normally you know go for the
shimmer oh it needs to be a shimmery
highlight doesn't have to be and think
about your highlight under the brow as
being not only something to be brighter
there but also something that can
totally make the edge of your like
transitional color that's right in here
look totally finna makes the border of
your transitional color look absolutely
seamless again you've probably got one
of these common shades in your
collection but I love the white in there
I love the cream matte shade there
another shout-out to if you're liking
the really warm I shadow looks lately
things that incorporate you know a
little bit maybe a rusty color I when I
first got this I thought of it oh that's
a full palette but I really think it's
definitely a summer palette too and it's
the Ferdie center stage photo op
eyeshadow in desert festival this is a
fun one if you have not played with this
yet you've got a matte brown in here you
got a really dark brown kind of a peachy
shimmery shade and a red a few of those
shades right there and if your think
about how to use it you know you've got
this color too you could go over the lid
with that blended some dark brown and
use one of these fun warm shades this
peach or this really fun red orange and
blend out with Ron Singh up your skin
maybe you're going for more of a bronzy
color glowy blush that would be very
paired with it i think so that's my best
in beauty everyone thank you so much for
watching I hope you're having a great
summer I also like to remind you that on
July thirteenth I'm having a meet up at
