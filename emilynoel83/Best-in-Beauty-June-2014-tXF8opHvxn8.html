joining me for my best in beauty for the
month of June I know I'm kind of late on
this one but I just had some other
videos that I wanted to get done first
and I have a collection video that I
need to be working on also for this
channel I definitely wanted to share
with you the products over the past
month that have really been standing out
to me that I've been getting a lot of
use out of and that I've just also found
myself recommending left and right to
different people and I start with the
makeup and then I've also got a hair a
body and a skincare item as well that's
a variety to share with you today the
first thing though is this double wear
stay in place flawless wear concealer
from Estee Lauder I have it in the shade
zero eight warm light medium and this
has just been my go-to concealer
throughout the past couple of months
it really is matching well to my skin
tone right now and I think that's part
of it but also I think this is just a
phenomenal texture whether I'm putting
this on top of a foundation or just
using this as like my primary coverage
thing on top of say just a tinted
moisturizer it still has a very natural
looking texture but really good coverage
the applicator is one of those classic
doe foot applicator --zz kind of a
liquidy consistency to this product and
sometimes with these really liquidy
concealers it's like you don't quite get
the coverage you want or they shear out
so much that the covers kind of fades
away as you blend it in but this
maintains really good coverage for just
about anything talk about like
all-purpose concealer I can be your
under-eye concealer it can do redness
good on any like little lingering zit
that you've got that you want to cover
up it's just not too thick thing that I
also have that would probably be most
comparable to this and texture would be
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I really
like that as well I think that's very
good coverage the shade I have right now
is a little bit light for my skin tone
so this seems to fall like dead on skin
tone match but I've just been
recommending this type of concealer to
people who say I need a long wearing
good coverage product to get me through
the summer that's not
feel too heavy so this format as opposed
to some of the creams out there might be
a really good option for you my next
product is something that my opinions
kind of changed over time on isn't that
interesting how that does tend to happen
sometimes with makeup products it's like
when I first use this I thought oh it's
too much I can't control myself with
this product I'm applying too much it's
looking to shine but now I've really
kind of settled into a groove with it
and I like it a lot it's the mary lou
manizer from the balm and if you've
tried blushes and highlights from the
balm you know they don't go halfway
pigmentation wise like everything they
make as far as their their face color
cosmetics go are very intensely pigment
and if I just take one swipe across this
I mean I've got very opaque shimmery
color they're kind of with a bit of a
golden a candlelit glow type of look and
with just a subtle application on this
product just the lightest tap in here
with like my Sigma at f-35 brush or my
ELF small tapered brush both are just
great small highlighting options you
know just a tiny dip in there and then a
little tap right back on my hand and
I've got what I think is a really nice
glow to go right on top of the apple of
my cheeks and on up on top of the cheek
total finishing touch type of step and I
still like my more matte type of
highlights to really you know cover this
area and do some definite brightening
but just for that light glow when your
makeups all done that makes your face
look you know not quite so fly oh this
is really nice for that it also makes a
great eye shadow I'm using it so
sparingly I think I'm gonna have this
puppy forever the eyes um something I've
been doing and I don't know if anybody
else has been doing this but I'm really
excited to share I've got this Milani
shadow eyes 12-hour wear jumbo shadow
sticks so really hardcore staying power
you could wear this on your lids with no
powder shadow shadow over it and I think
you'd find that you have a really long
wearing result at least I do but the way
I've been using this lately is in my
lower inner rim previously I've been
using my Rimmel scandaleyes in nude a
lot
and that perform pretty well for me but
I feel like this lasts even longer and
if you have trouble finding this Jordana
and makes something that is like what I
think is practically the exact same
pigmentation also in an almond ishe
jordanna's is called continuous almonds
so if you can't find Milan ease or vice
versa you know those are basically the
same kind of product but it glides in
there so easily on the waterline
brightens up it's not a stark white and
as I've been using this I've also been
grabbing for the one in champagne toast
and this one has shimmer and this has
been my great little inner corner
highlighting type thing lower inner rim
inner corner highlight love the way that
comes off is just a beautiful pearly
soft neutral type coated all over your
lids if you want to kind of bump up the
shimmer and pigmentation of whatever's
whatever powder you might put on top or
wear it alone but I primarily really
like it right in here it can also be
beautiful under the brow as well and I
got a bad scare a shout out oh I love
this one so much my essence I love
extreme crazy Volume Mascara um Emily
award-winning product I've talked about
it a lot I have gone through multiple
tubes of this this one is actually on
its last legs talk about like good to
the last drop so to speak about ready to
get tossed but it's still so good the
rubber bristle brush it does have some
itty-bitty like bristles right there
around the very very tip of the brush
and I just love the way this builds up
length and volume on my lashes it's just
been great it's the only thing I really
want to reach for mascara why and I've
got quite a few mascaras in my drawer
that I probably should be rotating in
more but this is one that you know gives
my lashes the look that I want but it's
not gonna be a smudgy type thing I just
think it goes on really really well for
me you're looking for a great mascara at
an extremely affordable price I continue
to love this one a few other super
random things to share one of them is
the not your mother's not eaten ice
conditioning detangler rediscovered
product I had kind of forgotten I had
this
and then we moved and I really had to
like pick over everything and look
through all my stuff and I'm like oh I
need to start using that again it says
infused with carrots and protein and
this has totally been my go-to post pool
thing like I'm out of the pool I take my
shower rinse the chlorine out of my hair
and then I spritz some of this on maybe
like three or four spritzes mainly on
the lower half of my hair and then I put
it all up in a Turbie twist this smells
so awesome I don't even know if I should
start trying to explain what I think
this smells like because it might not be
very accurate but I would totally love a
body wash or a cologne it smelled like
this I mean it's it's sweetness it's a
little bit maybe exotic smells great
makes my hair smell great makes my hair
very easy to comb through my fine hair
wants to tangle so much and I'm just
getting out of the shower spritzing this
on a few times it makes that process go
along easier but it's actually you know
providing some nourishment I think to
the hair itself not only has it kept my
ends you know feeling softer but I think
the appearance of them is a little bit
shinier so just a great affordable
product I mean this is gonna cost what
like four or five dollars I got mine at
Walmart I know they're Ulta probably
Target and I know this was recommended
to me way back when when I was looking
for a good detangling product and I
don't know how I kind of lost touch with
this for a period of time but I'm really
really loving it now so from dry hair to
dry skin I've been kind of a lotion
fanatic to try to keep any dryness on my
skin at bay and a lot of times you know
I've got some great really rich like
body butter type of products that I love
slathering on everywhere there are other
times I'm like let's just get this
lotion done as quickly as possible okay
but let's also not let it be a lotion
that's gonna disappear on me in five
minutes so this is what I've been using
the Vaseline spray and go Tyler reviewed
these on one of his Tide a Friday
reviews months and months ago on the
Express channel we have both this aloe
fresh kind and the cocoa butter I use
them pretty much interchangeably I just
this one but it goes on so great I mean
look at that just really quick fast
absorbing quick to just rub right in put
this kind of thing on later in the day
or before bed and it's not like I wake
up the next morning and feel like
where'd all my moisture for as thin as
it is it does do a really effective job
at least for my skin of moisturizing and
it's so quick - it's like I just don't
feel like messing around with this too
much put it all over rub it in and
you're good to get finally my night
creams that I would say I have been
using throughout most of my pregnancy
I'm still using this consistently before
bed and it's from Cebu I picked up a few
things from this line when they were on
HauteLook a while back and this is the
sea buckthorn replenishing night cream
you know I'd say I've maybe used half of
this little jar up and this has been
just a fabulous night cream for I know
the sea buckthorn is supposed to be
really good with collagen production in
your skin got a lot of like essential
fatty acids in here it's all natural and
that was kind of a decision I made very
early in my pregnancy I started
switching some of my skincare over to
some more natural items and several of
those were from Cebu I've also got the
hydrating serum I've got an eye cream
but this is the one item that has stood
out to me the most as being just great
for my skin for the level of hydration
it give this is a fairly thick cream and
I've been kind of on and off with my
dryness some days are more dry than
others but I still you know put this on
every night I just feel like I've been
having great results with it as thick as
it is it hasn't been breaking me out but
I wake up in the morning and it's like
my skin feels so soft I love not waking
up feeling like a grease fall you know
it feels really nice when your skin just
feels smooth and healthy and recharged
and so this I think has been a great
nighttime treatment for I think if you
would describe your skin type as oily or
very oily this might be too much for you
but if you're more on the normal to dry
side of things I think you might really
really like just the level of
nourishment this gives your skin it's
something that's all natural you can
feel kind of good about what you're
putting on there and again just love
waking up feeling soft skin but not
greasy skin well that wraps it up thank
you so much for joining me for my
favorite things over the course of the
past month please stay tuned to this
channel I will have a collection video
coming soon I promise so thank you for
watching guys and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
