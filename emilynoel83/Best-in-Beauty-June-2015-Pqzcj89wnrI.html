videos or my favorite products over the
course of the last month or so things
that I think kind of have lended
themselves to this time of year it also
just things that I've been reaching for
a lot in the midst of a lot of product
experimentation I mean you guys know I'm
reviewing stuff all the time over on the
Express channel here trying out new
things even with all that there are
still some things that I find I'm using
repeatedly or mixing in or just you know
working in in different ways they're
just things I keep wanting to put on my
face so that's what I'm going to be
talking about in this video first thing
is something that just recently has
gotten featured quite a bit on my
channels because I've done an express
review on this this was just shown in my
like glowy foundation routine but it's
the cosmetics your skin but better CC
plus illumination I really love the glow
factor in this particular product but it
also has the coverage that I really
liked from the original CC plus I don't
think this would be for everyone I think
if you're especially oily this could
make you look even more so also a lot of
people just prefer an overall matte
finish and I'm a fan of the matte finish
as well but I do have kind of a normal
skin type and if I want to go more glowy
I can usually get away with it so
wearing this today I really like the way
it looks I definitely set it with some
powder today I actually used a little
bit of my Estee Lauder Double Wear loose
powder but if you check out my other
video I didn't quite set this stuff as
much and more glow comes through so it's
kind of neat how you can use a setting
powder to kind of control how much
shimmer and do eNOS is actually coming
off on your skin like the SPF 50 and I
also I don't really talk about that much
but I love the packaging because the
pump style really helps you control how
much you're getting each time and you
can keep it consistent like I know I
pretty much use one full pump every time
and I can stay consistent with that and
not overuse if you really want to get a
feel though for how much glow is in this
product and you've got an Ulta near you
I would say check it out they're swatch
it out on your hand and really see for
yourself if you think that's something
you're gonna like to kind of like rehash
something that I just went over in my
video but this brush I gotta say this is
a great brush if you've got this
maybe you've actually already got this
brush stowed away in your collection
because I remember the same style of
brush came with a bye-bye under-eye
concealer that I got years ago this came
out again with a QVC today's special
value and I have been loving this for
foundations and concealers I am a total
like foundation buffing brush like
addict I've got several that I like so
much going back to my Sigma f80 the f-84
is my epinet buffing brush from Target
I've got one from Tarte Real Techniques
they're seriously like tons of great
options and this is just one that I'm
adding to the mix for me because I think
this size very similar to the size of
the Real Techniques buffing brush but
it's got this also little concealer end
and this is really handy to go around
the eye area but this also for just like
kind of stamping over your under-eye
concealer works really well I've also
been using this with the CC cream it
just had to mention it I love a brush
style application with foundations I'm
still trying out some sponges here and
there but this is the kind of thing that
I just keep wanting your age for it it's
honestly like the little roadblock in my
collection that I keep wanting to use
this to apply my foundation and I'm not
using the sponges as much as I should
because I really want to be testing
those out anyway got to keep it real in
this video it's not the things I should
like it's just the things I do like
right umm rediscovered products that I'm
loving are these Dream bouncy blushes
from Maybelline I really think that
color pop got me back on the train with
these products because color pop really
is an unusual and I think really cool
texture their eyeshadows their blushes
have this kind of mousse like creaminess
to them too real softness to them as
well and not saying like these Dream
bouncy blushes are identical to that
because I think these I don't know have
even more of an outright creaminess to
them to the touch maybe you feel a
little more moisture in these I love
these and I've just been doing a lot of
blush layering lately so popping on one
of these shades putting a sheer blush or
like a really shimmery blush over the
top and enjoying the different effects
that I can get so a couple that I've
loved and this one I think was in my
cosmetic cocktails video but it's the
one in peach satin
so a great peachy shade if you want even
more intensity than this maybe you're an
even deeper skin tone and you want
something just I don't know a little bit
amped up in terms of color payoff check
out Hot Tamale
but what I'm wearing today that I really
love because you can get such a range of
looks out of this one and this is plum
wine I feel like this is just in a
constant rotation in my collection like
I'll pull it out I'm pretty sure I've
probably mentioned it in the best in
beauty video here there but it's just so
fun it looks like it would be a total
fall type shade but look at it here it
is in its surest form on my cheeks but
then if you wanted to lay it on thicker
it looks so pretty this hair is
bothering me today speaking of color pop
I have been trying out some different
bronzers and highlights one highlight in
particular that stood out is the one in
lunch money it's labeled as super shock
cheek and it says pearl eyes this is so
pretty and such a like buttery smooth
texture or I love that and look at the
glow on this I mean it's very very
bright so even if you had really fair
skin and you felt like a lot of
highlights dulled you down because maybe
they were too golden or too bronzy too
deep
this one really pops and I like I've
already got some on but this is so soft
and so easily blendable I'll just like
barely apply any pressure to my cheeks
it's so lovely and with this particular
texture I'm all for powder highlights as
well but this can be very very targeted
to exactly where you want it like if you
wanted to do one of those like super
intense highlights like right up in here
you know right at that part where your
cheek bone kind of pops out I mean you
could completely target those zones and
just go for a very intense look if you
wanted to so I'm really liking that for
brows I kind of stumbled across a
product it like really did stumble
across it like I grabbed for it by
accident actually used it on my brows
and thought hmmm why do I like the way
my brows look so much today
and it's the elf instant brow lift
pencil which I have reviewed these and
I've got a couple shades deeper but one
day I randomly reach into my drawer and
I grabbed taupe and this is a really
cool shade so I mean I can see
I it didn't like cause a problem with my
brows to use this one see it's very cool
but it's not super dark and I realized
that when I'm in a hurry like I don't
need to be coating my entire brow like
I've got a lot of thickness in there as
is but if I just want to you know fill
in this little spot on this brow and
fill in this little scar over here this
is fine you know um so I don't have a
ton of this in my brows but for just the
little spot fill in this shade actually
works really nice for not adding too
much extra depth don't like my next aim
and frame still like my two-faced brow
and V kit but this is very fast and I
just put on my control-freak
brow gel on top here's what it reminds
me of that it cosmetics your brows a bit
better pencil it which is in a shade
called I think Universal taupe or
transforming taupe or something like
that that is designed to work for pretty
much anyone it's so neutral and that's
kind of the way this is - just a couple
more things here on the elf palettes
first off I haven't had them super long
so I kind of felt funny including them
in a favorites video but I am really
loving that contouring palette and also
the matte eyes palette but something
I've been kind of playing with a little
bit more that I tried and I was like
holy cow elf where did this come from
the prism eyeshadow and this isn't a
palette called naked oMG these are so
smooth so beautiful looking at them in
the palette does not do them justice I
must swatch them for you
I actually already had a prism palette
and it was in it had like a purple shade
and kind of corley shades and I would
have thought that I might have liked
that one more for just the uniqueness of
it but for whatever reason these shades
just speak to me more they're neutrals
but they're very shimmery and I talk a
lot about like you know taking your
shimmery eyeshadows and then having that
matte palette that your go to to use
alongside well this would be a great
partner to a matte palette here are
these shadows and they feel so good I
can wear it together you know but I
think they make great little like
spotlight shades this white here is so
full on so I've got that white like
around the
in her corner and talk about like no
effort no need to pack it on or really
build it up but just really intensely
brightens the inner corner and then I
did a little bit of a gradient effect I
went white to this buttery shade and
then to this color which i think is a
really outstanding like kind of bronzy
taupe that's what's happening on my lid
for that really pretty kind of metallic
shimmery effect then what else is on my
eyes I actually used a couple of these
purples right here to blend up into the
crease and use them on the area under my
eye as well I just had to mention this
this was sent to me by elf in the midst
of some other products and I just
thought the texture of these was so nice
I know this has been around for a little
while now but I would really recommend
it if they would have put like this
exact texture into some of their new
palettes they would be so good so I love
this as far as lip products go I have
been a lip product testing freak lately
I mean I've been trying all those color
pop matte lip colors still have more to
go those are a really tricky thing to
test out because if you're trying to do
them back-to-back-to-back like it's so
hard because they're so long wearing
they really cling on there and even when
you think you've got them off there's
still like some remnants I'm still
testing those still testing a bunch of
glosses for makeup forever and in the
time between when I'm not testing them
like I just want something easy if I'm
going somewhere I want something simple
to throw like in the diaper bag or
something that just around the house
feels really good on my lips it's got a
ton of like rosy lip balms that I was
mentioning in my rows product favorites
video those are sprinkled everywhere
love those but from a color standpoint
just a couple things to mention my
benebalm from Benefit this also
mentioned in the Rose video because it
smells so nice and rosy I love this this
is a great sheer red what about a great
like easy summer rosy red it's so pretty
I love that love it layered on top of
Benetton and also a shade that I get so
many questions about it's like the
easiest no-brainer type lip product ever
but it's the Almay smart shea butter
kiss which I love these these are think
Revlon lip butter but
little bit more luxurious texture a
little more nourishing to the lips still
great color payoff and this is the shade
called nude light they're all separated
into like light light/medium medium
whatever but this turns out to be a
really nice peachy shade it's got some
Sheerness to it but definitely still a
lot of color comes through I personally
don't have a ton of patience for super
sheer lip products and this I like this
today I'm wearing it with just a little
bit of my ELF matte lip color in praline
which is just a slightly deeper neutral
and I just kind of went around the edges
just to get more definition on the lips
with that so those are my favorites one
last little thing though my Bobbi Brown
Beach scent it's that time of year I
remember getting this last summer it
takes me back to pregnancy because I was
using this a lot then but I got the
little rollerball I think it's so handy
and it just mmm smells so good very
outdoorsy a little bit spicy though does
anybody else get that five-minute I
really appreciate you taking time to
tune in and also thank you for watching
my snaps on snapchat I'm having so much
fun with snapchat it is like taking over
my life so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
