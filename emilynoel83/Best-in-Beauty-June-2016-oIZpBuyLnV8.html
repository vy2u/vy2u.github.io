going great I am excited to share some
favorites with you in this video they're
pretty much all makeup related I've got
a few brushes and just some little
random odds and ends that I want to tell
you about and first off I want to talk
about a couple of different foundations
I've really been enjoying one of them is
my eight cosmetics CC plus illumination
and this is a rediscovered favorite I
have had this in my stash for a while I
feel like when I think about reaching
for a product like this I usually go for
just the regular version it's great it's
got great coverage it's very like
foundation like in the coverage but it
still provides a great amount of
moisture this is the kind of product
that really truly can be especially this
time of year
my moisturiser my foundation you know
it's just sun protection it's great more
recently I've been going for my
illumination one and I wear it in the
shade medium and there's just a lot of
things coming together right for this
product to work for me right now it's
just the absolute perfect shade I love
the amount of glow and it is pretty
glowy
like in the scope of glowy foundations I
would say this is toward the more
extreme end of the products I own but
I'm not having a real issue with uneven
skin texture right now or pores and
things that just really show bumpiness
on my skin I'm not having that issue so
this performs pretty well if you are
having a lot of that issue I wouldn't
really advise any sort of glowy
foundation that's going to exaggerate
those things got great staying power
like I said it is my moisturizer and
foundation in one it's got the pump the
SPF 50 I mean I've just been wearing
this a lot lately and feeling so happy
with the look and I've been doing my
makeup a lot like over the past weekend
this was what kind of solidified this
for me we had company here and I don't
like to you know banish myself off to
the makeup room if I know we've got
people here so like put some makeup that
I know I'm gonna use in a little bag and
I'll go downstairs and just you know
chitchat with whoever and I was sitting
in front of a window putting this on and
you know natural broad daylight bright
daylight can be kind of harsh and it can
really tell the truth about how
your makeup looks and I had this on in
that circumstance really getting a super
clear look at my skin in natural light
and I thought this looks fantastic so
very pleased with that rediscovered love
and as I said way into my next
foundation product this has good staying
power for me this next one I'm gonna
mention I think has even more reliable
staying power this you know you get it
out under certain circumstances it's
already glowy your skin gets a little
sweaty or dewy
and you know it can be a lot of do going
on just be aware of what circumstances
you're taking it into this stuff the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
plus concealer I wear this in the shade
buttermilk and it always makes me think
of a buttermilk pancake or a waffle it
love this stuff I talked about it in my
long wearing makeup essentials video and
it's kind of an opposite animal you know
compared to this one because it's not
glowy it is not a dewy type of product I
think the finish is overall it sets to a
very matte finish super long wearing
super full coverage yet Cosmetics has
good coverage too but across the board
if you're wanting the most flawless look
on your skin the glowy stuff doesn't
give you as flawless and even of a look
as a matte finish will just because it's
more perfected it's even more evenness
across the skin when you're wearing
something glowy like I'm wearing the it
cosmetics today you know it's catching
the light in a few more places and yes
it looks natural and glowy and nice but
it's not necessarily going to make your
skin look you know super perfect all
over this stuff does have the giant buck
foot applicator as I call it not doe
foot a duck foot I believe I had a
little demo applying this in that long
wearing makeup essentials video if you
want to see that but I have been
enjoying this very much and just
phenomenal staying power with that
product also I want to point out the
brush that I've been using with this I
forgot to mention I've just been using
the Sigma angled top kabuki f-84 this is
just one of my favorite dense brushes I
like my f80 as well which is just the
classic flat top kabuki this little bit
of angle I don't know it just makes it
really easy to get around like
this zone with your foundation every
little nook and cranny and like I said
if I'm just doing my makeup in various
spots in the house I'm not maybe gonna
worry about a Beautyblender and
dampening that and then where do I put
it so it can dry out so I just like
throw a brush in my bag and that paired
with this has really maximized the
coverage of this product as far as the
clinic beyond perfecting I can use this
one with this as well a Beauty Blender
is nice with this also I found both to
work nicely and the finishing touch of
any makeup look for me these days has
been this product the hard candy sheer
envy hydrating primer mist it says 12
hour power
electrolytes energize and hydrate skin
it's oil free silicone free and
alcohol-free and this is my favorite
setting spray I really don't use it from
the primer mist standpoint I don't prep
my skin with it although you could you
know if you felt like you just wanted a
little something extra after you
moisturized or something but I have used
as I hold it to the light I can see that
I've used maybe a little over half of
this right now and it says it contains
coconut water hydration for up to 12
hours it really you know for me it's all
about the finished look of the makeup
once it's done and if you've had to
powder certain areas if you've had to go
over some spots you put this on it's
like everything has a little bit more
consistently glowy and skin like
appearance I guess would be the best way
to describe it so love that stuff and
speaking of powder you might be curious
exactly how much powder am i wearing on
top of this stuff the glowy CC cream and
I really make a point to powder and set
the under eyes so I've gone ahead and
applied this all over concealed the
under I set that with some powder set my
nose with powder and a little bit in
center of the forehead and everything
else is kind of being allowed to just
glow on through so that's that's where
we're at with that product
several blushes have just really had me
excited lately and they are the more
understated neutral ish blushes from the
city color be matte line I really like
applying these and then I'll take
whatever highlight I feel like wearing
on top and just kind of mess with the
look you know
these are pretty on their own they're
very pigmented and there's something I
like about a really pigmented blush but
just by the nature of its color it's
still a subtle shade that really looks
like yeah that could come from one skin
you know they have some bright shades
too and a lot of people may enjoy those
as well but these are just what I've
been going for for daily wear I've got
this papaya shade which I can't open up
it looks really great
if you throw on like a peachy highlight
like Bobbi Brown's shimmer brick in
what's it called nectar that looks great
over this papaya I would describe as
like dusty peach you know it's not a
really pure bright Coralie peach but
it's just got that little bit of dusty
neutral thing happening and then one
that goes just a little bit deeper well
it looks like on camera it's quite a bit
deeper I'm wearing this one today I work
very softly but this color called
hibiscus has a little more Brown
happening in it I'll swatch that here
beside and you can see what I'm talking
about it's kind of a similar feel to a
benefit Dallas it's got a little more
plummy Brown happening in there and it
looks nice I think kind of lower on the
cheek and then the other one that I'm
liking for a bit cooler look is the
color blackberry so this is an
interesting shade isn't it it's got a
little pink in there a little lilac
happening but yet it's somewhat muted
it's not super bright and I think you'll
see that here in the swatch you know
cool tone but just not shouting at ya so
I love all of those blushes I could find
a lot of city color blushes at five
below you can also check the city color
website for the full selection because I
think there are still some shades that
don't get stocked in five below eye
products you know if you watch my
singles cruising video I have been
bouncing around to a lot of different
things it was you know a few different
palettes before and then all those
different singles that I tried but a
brush that I would have mentioned that
I've really just been you know grabbing
for its really getting into that regular
routine for me is this Sigma II 57 the
firm shader look at this kind of unique
brush that I've got here it's not super
wide I would say it might even be just a
hair more narrow
looking across the ferrule this way left
to right a little more narrow than my
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush but as I
turn it a quarter turn there you can see
it's a little bit thicker so little more
effect bristles are nicely tapered but I
can do so many things with this this can
pack shadow on the lid this is really
really easy to get an outer V going and
it just really fits that crease area
nicely so I find if I'm going for a
quick eye look this is a great thing to
pick up because it can just kind of
transition from one part of the eye to
the next so easily I can highlight inner
corner pack it on the lid do something
deeper on the outside carry it right
into the crease it's so so easy so again
that is the firm shader a 57 I want to
talk lip products um I posted a blog yes
the blog is happening folks and I posted
about this on Estancia lipgloss set this
is the summer gloss set I bought this
off of the Anastacio website at the same
time I bought modern Renaissance and
another couple things that you might
hear me talk about in the future and
these glosses just blew my mind I really
love them you've got a couple of nice
neutrals here one is a true classic pink
this one has a little bit of a pearly
finish and then a couple of berry shades
and I blog the bottom showed each one of
them on my lips swatch them I give you a
much closer look at everything that's
happening in that post and a very
detailed account of exactly why I like
these but I tell you what they really
come through as
what-you-see-is-what-you-get type colors
so comfortable though not thick and
sticky yet they don't drift outside my
lip line
they are so pleasant to apply it's a
nice kind of flattened out doe foot
applicator as opposed to the traditional
kind of scoop like doe foot so even with
a more intense shade like this you feel
like you've got all the control you need
to get out to the outer edges of your
lips with it I love the way they smell I
feel like the wear is very even so even
as you lose the glossiness
I still have a really nice look to my
lips after that point and I just you
know lovin those as far as lip glosses
go I think those are fantastic so I've
never really gotten huge into any of the
Stassi lip products at all I know the
liquid lipsticks are super popular and
I've only got one of them you know I
kind of haven't really fully jumped on
the bandwagon of that stuff but I was
just like shocked by how good the lip
glosses are now in the drugstore
marketplace a new kind of glossy lip
product that I think is so so cool are
these maybelline color jolts I got these
in the shade orange outburst which is
probably my favorite and then I also got
never bear my one gripe is you're not
getting a lot of product in here it's
0.21 fluid ounces that's less than like
a lip tar that's quite a bit less than
let's say a NYX butter gloss that being
said these are very concentrated lip
products there's a lot of intensity even
in my lighter shade you know I'm wearing
some of that today and I used another
product that I love this elf matte lip
color and praline I use that to kind of
tone it now it's a very true pink I feel
on my lips and I just wanted to
neutralize it just a hair they're very
true pure fully opaque colors the
packaging says intense lip paint and
they do kind of remind me of like a
cross between a lip tar and Too Faced
melted application design you know the
product coming up through this little
spongy tip is very much like to face
melted but there's a little more like
moisture content in the product just
have a little more shine I feel like on
the list and on the fourth of July I was
wearing this orange shade and the
staying power was just tremendous with
it and of course I was eaten and you
know doing my thing talking not really
caring about my lip product and it's
just a lot of color and it really does a
good job of hanging on there so if
you're looking for a new you know a
little drugstore lip product to
experiment with one that really packs a
punch color wise I can't remember what I
paid for these but I am you know
definitely thinking about getting some
more and as I alluded to here the elf
praline I am wearing that just a little
bit mixed in with the pink and you can
see it's very brownish and neutral and
it's just a great nude or pink lip mixer
type product these elf matte lip colors
in general great formula happening there
a lot of people don't know that there's
a little
rpenter at the bottom so if you want to
refine that tip a little bit more you
totally can but that's definitely one of
else better lip products and one last
thing I want to mention Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks in case you
weren't aware and I did this video
months back but they have released new
shades in this line a lot of what they
had almost everything they had
when these initially launched this all
of the shades had a little bit of
shimmer to them and now they've released
a lot more creamy ones and this pink
nude is one of the cream E's and it's
still got you know that nice little bit
of thickness very nice moisturization I
mean if my lips are the least bit
chapped this is the kind of thing color
wise that I'll want to put on and that's
the pink nude I think it's gorgeous you
can mix it with other things you can
just slap it on and wear it alone but
low maintenance sweatpants of lip
products I've said it before I'll say it
again it's a great great thing and I
think a lot of people would like this
pink nude shade so that's it those are
my favorites for the month of June thank
you guys so much for watching thank you
again for all the nice feedback on the
singles cruise that was a collaboration
with my friend Kristin game and the
mastermind behind that whole idea was
