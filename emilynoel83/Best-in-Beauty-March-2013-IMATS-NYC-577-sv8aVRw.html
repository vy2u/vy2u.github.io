in beauty again woohoo and I have
favourites for face for eyes for lips I
mean I don't know how I came up with its
money but I've got a lot of things to
talk about
first thing though I want to make sure
you know that I'm gonna be at IMATS in
New York one week from today I can't
believe I've never been to IMATS before
I am so super excited to go I hope I can
meet a lot of you I hope I can just be
surrounded by makeup and just be in
heaven Tyler will be there too you see
like a really tall 66 blonde guy just
look down and I'm probably near I think
it's just gonna be incredibly fun those
tickets were my birthday gift
back in December so yeah it's happening
soon I'll make sure to tweet and
Facebook specifically about you know
where we are for going anywhere else
during our time in New York you know
I'll let you know and maybe we can meet
up other places too but I'll just you
know it kind of to be determined on some
of that other stuff but I will
definitely be at IMATS on Saturday and
Sunday one week from today now for the
best in beauty stuff I'm gonna start out
and talk about a great mascara I have
not been this excited about a mascara
probably since I'll make it up and grow
and this is like rifling that one and I
can't believe it I liked this one as
soon as I used it I've been using it for
weeks and I continue to like it it's the
essence I love extreme or iheart extreme
crazy Volume Mascara
I tried this mascara just not a win
thinking ooh crazy volume let's see you
know how this is gonna fail me then
because normally you know things that
make big claims just don't quite stack
up but this one I really like it it's
kind of a large brush it's rubber
bristles it's got little bristles very
little bristles at the very tip just
think it's a great great formula it's
not too wet and it builds upon itself
really nicely it gives me great length
if I decide to go without false lashes
this is probably the one
gonna be reaching for most likely just
because of the you know the drama it can
give small lashes I'm like wow this is
awesome so yeah it says mascara for
extreme and crazy volume I don't know if
it's crazy but it's it's pretty extreme
I would say Optima logically tested oh
that's a different language that's why I
can't read that anyways um this is
really good stuff there is one small
downfall to this and a couple times I've
worn it and I feel obligated to admit
this to you because you know it's always
honest here but um a couple times when I
wore this
I noticed a few little flakes nothing I
couldn't just sweep right off and it was
not smudges it was not smearing but it
was like a couple of miniscule flakes
you know like I check in the mirror
check in the rearview or something I'm
driving like ooh I didn't like that but
it hasn't happened every time I've worn
it and I don't know if those were just
days I happen to you know mess with my
eyelashes or do something but I had just
a few flakes so it hasn't been quite a
consistent problem but I would say it's
been an occasional thing still wearing
it it has not deterred me from this
mascara so next time you're in Ulta or
you checking the Ulta website look for
the giant pink - I think you're really
gonna like it well we're on eyes a great
eye liner also is the Milani ultra fine
liquid eyeliner I've been using this all
the time in the black vinyl shade and
don't be mislead that does not mean this
is metallic or shiny in any way it
drives to a perfectly dark matte black
and I don't really like shimmery you
know shimmery black liners things that
can kind of catch the light and then
make your eyeliner look uneven that's
sometimes what I think when I want to
see that happened but this is just a
kind of traditional seeming liquid
eyeliner but the real bonus to this is
that this is totally waterproof like
this claims to be waterproof and it is
you saw the review on my blog this one
is waterproof the one called black gems
is waterproof the purple one is
waterproof but there are two Blues in
this line
kind of ones more blue and one's more
like turquoise greenish and they got wet
and just ran like I did a little test on
my hand I've got pictures and everything
on the blog to show you but I mean some
were clearly not waterproof so that's my
little pet peeve on that waterproof
claim it's like were these tested
because in a very you know simple
fashion I was able to see what was
waterproof and what wasn't but you can
rub on this I mean I think this is a
good one to try for people who have
issues with like the eye line are
transferring up on to you know the
crease area and stuff like that I would
really give this a try I mean it seems
just very hardcore it's just what you
want in a black liquid like favorite lip
products and this is so funny because as
I figure out things that I'm going to
include in this video as the month goes
along I kind of sit them aside and every
lip product that I set aside was in the
same color family of pink but it's like
one was sheer ones medium and ones like
very full-on color and I thought that
was so funny I was like wow these are
all the exact same color families so I'm
going to start with the sheer one and
that's what I'm wearing today and it is
the Baby Lips it's one of the limited
edition shades and the shade is melon
mania oh love this feeling I'm a big fan
of the Baby Lips anyway but this is just
a nice sheer pink oh this is what you
want to put on when you don't want to
think about it you know you don't want
to pick up a mirror it's right there
it's like hardly visible but when it
comes in contact with a little bit of
pigment you might have in your light
shows up kind of like that and so I like
it smells like a jolly rancher I think
that's just fantastic the other thing
that I'm enjoying and have been for some
time the Neutrogena moisture smooth
color stick this shade the sweet
watermelon is a really nice pink I raved
about this in the Emily Awards but you
know this is going to be just a little
bit more pink than the other one
actually quite a bit more pink its
pigmented it's fruity I described this
scent as yeah right after you open the
jello packet and you haven't yet mixed
it up and it's all that concentrated
like sugary sweetness fruity that's what
that smells
so we've got your shear your medium then
the pink that is just a true lipstick
full-on color this little whole line of
lipsticks is about color color color and
it's the Milani color statement and
fruit punch I have mentioned this before
still wearing it still enjoying it
there we see it right here so sheer
medium and Kapow yeah it's really full
on color I have swatches of all of the
color statement lipsticks on the face on
the blog just very impressive lipsticks
that not every one of them I'm in love
with but something I can assure you with
all of them is that the color is very
saturated and rich punch is just that
real pinky true pink shade that's not
not bordering on purple not a fuchsia
pink but just real real pink eye and I
like that loss I have a foundation pick
and some people were asking me I feel
like I've gotten this question multiple
times late what's a good foundation that
is long wearing full coverage but works
for dry skin because a lot of those
really good long wearing foundations you
know they might be real suitable for
oily skin but they can be just show up a
little too cakey on skin that's already
kind of dry and so my recommendation
that I've made several times and I
wanted to make it in this video as well
is the tarte maracuja miracle foundation
I've reviewed this before it came with
in a kit when I got it you can of course
buy it individually to my shade as lives
do run a little bit dark just so you
know on the shades but this is a really
interesting foundation in that the
coverage is good and it is buildable so
in other words if you've got some
problem areas you can go back and add a
little more without it looking you know
too heavy or too much staying power is
really great and most of all if you've
got dry areas it doesn't cling to those
areas and make them stand out like for
me I might have an oily t-zone and this
doesn't make me crazy you know much oily
ER or more oily in those areas but I am
kind of dry between my eyebrows and I'm
kind of dry around my mouth and so this
doesn't it kind of like
balances things out it's hard to a
little bit hard to explain people who
want the coverage want the staying power
but have drier skin I think this might
be really nice if you want to experiment
with this and you've got more oily skin
I would just say make sure you're
setting it with a powder and it can
still work for you I mean it has a
beautiful finish on the skin it's very
fresh I won't call it do it doesn't have
any shimmer at it either but it's just a
very fresh like kind of real skin look
so I definitely like that foundation so
also this little palette if you saw my
palette picks
sorry about my chipped off nail but I
did a video on like great multitasking
palettes for travel things that can do
more than one thing basically and this
one another Tarte thing I don't want to
put you on tarte overload but let's face
it these are my favorites right now and
this is a great little palette here from
Tarte gives you two blushes one is
exposed I'm not sure what this other
color is I think it's a limited edition
shade but I'm wearing them both I like
to wear exposed just a little bit lower
almost near the hollow of the cheek and
put the brighter shade a little bit more
around the Apple but all the shadows are
super wearable as well I mean these are
like shades I would wear all the time
and today like I'm wearing the bronze II
shade a little bit of plum and brown and
the outer corner popped it with some
brighter liner that I'll talk about in a
second even this shade right here where
you thinking maybe that's kind of a
boring shade no that totally helps you
blend out any of the darker stuff it's
great so you've got you know a couple
shades that are a little bit matte and
satin and then a couple quite a few
others for others that are shimmering is
extremely handy I like the blushes just
as much as I like the shadows like I'm
not sure which part of this palette I
like the best the shadows are very easy
to work with easy to blend and I've been
using this Alana Lee this is the
rediscovered favorite this is the thing
that I haven't been using enough of
lately I kind of forgot that I even had
them and I plan to be using them a lot
more as time goes on and they are the
NYX
slide-on liners I've talked about these
as being kind of a dupe for the urban
decay 24/7 pencils they just perform
like them they feel like those pencil
they last like those pencils do I mean
really you can I've got my swatches are
the ones I'm going to talk about here
you can prep right over them they don't
go anywhere much cheaper and still come
in a really wide variety of colors and
what I'm gonna try doing to work more
color into my eye makeup is use liners
and use them kind of like this this is a
very easy spot to do like that pop of
color so I'm wearing this as your shade
right there you know kind of a fun
turquoise teal I think it looks great
alongside bronze another shade that I
really like is this sunrise blue that's
more of a true like royal blue a little
bit deeper but still would be a very
pretty kind of finishing touch on an eye
look and also something for the pop of
color I might use it in the same way I
did this but an you know with a
different look is glitzy gold it's
really really a fun gold color and I've
got those three swatched here but
they're so ultra creamy and you do have
a little time to smudge them out but
once they set they set and you can rub
over those and you know they don't go
anywhere and just like I talked about
this liquid liner earlier you know
everything has its place I will use
liquid liner quite often on my upper
lash line but I might go for a pencil or
a smudgy color or something like that
more likely on the lower lash line or
you could layer the two but you know
everybody needs kind of a variety of
liners I think and I'm gonna be trying
to play with some more fun ones here in
the near future I think that pretty much
wraps up my best in beauty video again I
can't wait to see and meet any of you
who are planning to go to IMATS in New
York City not that this is gonna be my
last video that I post until that time
but I just wanted to give you a heads up
if you're making plans so thank you so
much for watching I'll see you guys in
the next video and I hope everyone has a
great Easter bye
let's talk about at the end dear there
is you can't go though um it's good and
I in these and then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
