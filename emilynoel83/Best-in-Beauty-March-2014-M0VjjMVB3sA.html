for my latest best in beauty video these
are some of my favorite products from
the past month and a lot of these face
products that I realize I pulled as my
favorites this month a lot of them
I think pertain to kind of glowing skin
so a nice transition I guess from winter
into spring getting a nice soft glowing
complexion and my top top favorite like
if I could give an award to the favorite
of all favorites in this video it's
something I've been using all the time
and loving so much it's my Milani
bronzer excel this is in the shade fake
tan you may have seen this used in my
Milani one brand tutorial and I just
love this the more I use it the more I
like it and the more I come up with
little tricks for using it best I really
really love the Revlon Photoready
bronzer from the drugstore but that's
kind of being discontinued so that's
that I'm gonna miss that one but this
one is really I think filling its shoes
nicely you've got a really great deep
matte cool toned bronzer so this is
really great just alone for contouring
anywhere you want to contour and then
this other shade which I thought you
know maybe I won't use that very much
it's got like a little bit of a glow
it's more of a sunny golden a bronzer I
actually use this a lot too just dust
that lighter shade like all over you
know center of the forehead tops of my
cheeks wherever the Sun might naturally
hit it's such a big pan I also take like
my really fluffy kabuki brush and I just
go into everything and apply it all over
my neck and decollete area it's just
been a great all-purpose bronzer I would
completely recommend this I think even
if you're you know lighter skin tone
than I am I think you would still really
enjoy how cool this bronzer is doesn't
take a lot but yet you don't have to be
like insanely careful with it either so
I've just been loving them another thing
and if I was going in order here of
application and this would be applied
before the bronzer but I've been
reaching for my Mac mineralized
skinfinish natural a lot whether I'm
using this on top of foundation like I
am today or maybe I've just you know put
on some
and I want quick foundation this has
been really great
I am the shade medium plus it's the kind
of product that I wonder if I'm ever
going to use this up because I feel like
I have you know over the past couple
years use this a lot but it's one of
those domed kind of baked products and I
find that those do last a really long
time but this gives a really nice finish
on the skin you know it's definitely not
shimmery but I think for anyone who just
doesn't want their skin to come off
looking too dry or too flat this is just
a really nice step on top of foundations
and if you want to get the most coverage
out of it I've actually been using this
little brush from Ecotools or an elf
makes a great flat top brush but any
nice soft flat top brush that you can
find if you want really great coverage
out of this just kind of like get the
product on the brush so okay I can see
that everywhere and then practically
stipple it on the areas where you want
more coverage like maybe you're going
over your concealer or something like
that and then you can really buff it in
all over the rest of your face but it
does a great job and I've been using
this custom coverage buffing brush a lot
especially if I'm just wearing this
alone and kind of working it as my light
foundation this brush is really good for
getting like maximum coverage out of it
now for blushes I've got a couple of
favorites I've just been like a blush
fiend lately I cannot get enough of
blood one that's really just gotten me
lately has been this one from Too Faced
and it's the peach Beach I was wearing
this in my last video I've just been
reaching for this any time I want my
cheeks to be glowy but yet not overly
colorful actually reviewed this one and
the something about berry one when these
came out on these new sweethearts
blushes from Too Faced and this one I
remembered saying like I wasn't too
struck by it immediately like I just
thought it was going to be some barely
bear type blush but it really does show
up on me I use these two shades right
here as my blush and then I'll just use
that one as my highlight so that way I
feel like I get a glowy look on the
cheeks but it's not too much and I can
kind of control where this most glowy
shade is going and then the other two
kind of combined for something like that
which is
still you know really really pretty but
just more nutrient remember in my review
saying that I liked this product but
it's definitely grown on me over time
though I just love that and I'm wearing
that today along with the bronzer and
the powder that I mentioned but another
blush that I've really become attached
to also is my sleek blush by three and
pink lemonade full review on this as
well but this is a cream blush and then
what makes this really special like what
takes us over the top for me is that it
gives you two like separate tones of
pink powder blush that you can pair with
that cream or use instead of the cream
you know whatever you want to do but one
of the Pink's is more of like a classic
like bubblegum pink and one has more
coral to it so depending on like maybe
the lip color you chose how warm or cool
you want your cheeks to be you've got
that option here so I think it's great
for traveling the quality and textures
of these sleek blushes is really really
nice you know doesn't take a lot to get
the look you're after and if you do
layer powder over the cream I think the
staying power is just absolutely
fantastic so lovely as usual I've been
bouncing around between lots of
different eyes shadows lately but there
have been a couple of liners that I've
really found myself using consistently
and they are the Rimmel scandaleyes and
I have them in nude and deep blue these
are the two shades I've been using a
whole lot for my lower waterline today I
have the nude in there and pretty much
any time I'm going for a little more
wide-eyed look this is what I use
because it's very long wearing for me
it's very bright you know I've talked
about this technique in the past I'm
sure lots of people have but our water
lines can tend to especially for a
little bit tired they can look a little
bit pink naturally and that doesn't do
much for brightening your eyes so when
you go over that it's kind of like
concealer for your waterline you know
you go over it with this nude color and
it really widens out the whites of your
eyes more makes them your eyes look more
wide awake and just bigger too
so I love that nude shade that's really
great but the deep blue has been a more
recent thing for me that I've been
because this brightens in a whole other
way when I put this deep blue in my
waterline it's a non shimmery navy blue
you know it's not super loud if you want
to see how it comes across
check out my Too Faced alamode tutorial
because I use that there but it
brightens by way of like contrast when
you put this blue and that comes up
against the whites of your are makes the
whites whiter doesn't necessarily make
your eyes look like they're open wider
because anytime you put something dark
in your waterline you are kind of
closing yourself in just a little bit
more but I think the look is so pretty
you felt like you know black maybe looks
like too much on you and your waterline
this is funny because it's so close to
black but I feel like it gives a
completely different kind of effect to
the eye it just gives a fun little pop
of something different so try that out
also also for lips and great winter to
spring transition color and it's the
Milani color statement lipstick in
pretty natural sometimes I think I
mistakenly call this naturally pretty
but it's pretty natural it makes you
look naturally pretty but it's a great
pink that has a little depth to see what
I mean here you know it's not baby pink
it's not something just really cotton
candy-like but it's got a little bit of
depth to it and I think it's just
gorgeous
this cream formula of the color
statement lipsticks I love so much and
this one was one that was more newly
released like in the early part of 2014
by the way if you're like a lip product
junkie I devoted a whole video recently
to lipsticks that I'm loving a lot right
now but this was one of them and I think
it's just gorgeous looks great on like
any woman from the richer skin tones to
somebody more fair it's just beautiful
so I'm wearing that today and I topped
it off with something that well it could
be a favorite I guess I haven't been
wearing this gloss a lot but I do love
this formula it's the maybelline color
statement and this is the shade glisten
up pink it's kind of a light shimmery
pink so you see how this lipstick would
come off normally you know not exactly
matte but not super shiny either so this
just gave a little bit of a glow on top
of that right
finally folks just had to run to the
bathroom to get this I am NOT
using dry shampoo anymore and I don't
think I ever will I know that's a bold
statement but I've got like maybe five
in my cabinet and bottom line none of
them do what this does this is just
Johnson's baby powder
it's that soothing aloe and vitamin E
pure cornstarch this is what I will just
shake a little bit not tons but a little
bit into the palm of my hand working
into my roots when my hair is feeling a
little bit oily a little bit lifeless
and I want to stretch out the thyme a
little bit before another wash I mean it
just works great and here's my beef
here's my issue with a lot of the dry
shampoos they will give me the results I
want initially like right when I put it
in I really like going around and doing
this you know and feeling like okay you
know I've got some decent volume now my
hair feels a little bit lighter because
my hair really is pretty fine and
straight so it can take on a little bit
of oiliness at the roots pretty easily
so when I use a lot of dry shampoos
initially I'm kind of satisfied with
them but I find that it takes hardly any
time at all for my hair to fall back and
it's like ultimately the dry shampoo
weighed me down even more this stuff I
mean not a big shake just a little bit
in the palm of my hand I would say let
me show you how much I probably use most
of the time okay
that's maybe a little more than usual
but I get some of that in and work it
kind of on to my hands first like this
and then get it into my scalp and at
that point it's like I'm not giving my
care of major white cast because it's
not like I just dumped a baby powder all
over my head it seriously has such an
effect for absorbing that oil and more
of a long-term result for me like my
hair will feel a lot fresher as a day
goes almost to just feeling light and
clean for just a little bit you know
probably got this under your sink right
now just pull it out next time you need
some dry shampoo I don't care if you're
blonde brunette whoever put a little bit
of this on and I think you'll find that
it's every bit as good as anything else
and I'm not like coming up with some
secret of the universe here I think
people did this before
the dry shampoo craze really came about
that is my best in beauty for the month
of March thank you so much for taking
time to watch and just a little reminder
that on my vlog channel I will have my
stuff I love video going up soon or
maybe it might already be up at the time
of this video I'm not sure but check
over there for just totally random
favorites as well as pregnancy updates
and things like that so I appreciate
your time and I'll see you guys later
