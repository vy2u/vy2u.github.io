time thank you so much for joining me
these are some of my most favorite most
used products from the past month and I
just kind of consider these videos that
time where I get to play beauty editor
like beauty editor from the magazines
and give like my top picks you know the
first recommendation that I would love
to make to you that I've really been
enjoying and I do need to do like a
dedicated review to this product and I
can go into a little more detail on what
this product does but it's the hard
candy glamoflauge invisible coverage
foundation I love coverage in a
foundation you guys know this I feel
like this gives such a flawless look but
with so little product that you actually
need to use because it just has the most
wonderful spread across the skin I feel
like this is kind of walking the line
between a medium and full coverage
foundation the more I use it the more I
enjoy it I just think it has a beautiful
velvety finish a great texture one thing
that I need to look into a little bit
further is the shade range though
because I am fair in this foundation I'm
not fair and like anything else that I
have it has a pump which I love you know
it helps to dispense just that
consistent amount of product each time
you know how much you're using you know
how much it takes to get all over your
face and while I do think it mattifies
the skin it does so in the most natural
way possible it's just a really great
product another thing I'm loving that I
did a four of you and tutorial with is
my NYX highlight and contour pro palette
this is great the more I use it more
find little tricks about it I can't tell
you how many times I've used this to
throw together a quick eye look because
it's like okay I've already got it out
it's open boom-boom-boom put a shimmery
shade on the lid put a deeper shade in
the crease and you're done it's really
pigmented a little bit goes a long way
with these various powders this is
probably my main one that I used to
contour with and then I used this for a
little bit of bronzing and then I've
been completely bouncing back and forth
between all of these highlights I've
been using this light pearly one a lot
more than I thought I would just for
sometimes a light like a dewy pop on the
cheeks you know on top of your blush I
actually feel like I've had to work
harder to build up color on my cheeks
with the Anastasia contour kit compared
to this one and I'm wearing it as my
contour today I'm wearing this shade in
the cheekbones and I've got
little bit of this Shay just really
lightly around my hairline and my
highlight today that's giving me this
yummy sheen on the cheeks I'll explain
that in a minute that's something a
little different that I just kind of
stumbled upon also I feel like I've
mentioned this little palette several
times but I'm truly truly loving it and
just finding new combinations that I
love all the time and it's the Mack um
trend forecast spring 2015 lip and cheek
palette and I just love how every part
of this palette is working for me this
is actually my blush today and this can
be intense you know it can be an intense
berry type lip color but sheared out
with the elf small stipple brush right
here on the cheeks just a soft berry
glow I love it prior to discovering how
much I like that is a blush I love these
two as blushes these are the most
probably predictable but when you wear
either of these to brighter ones sheer
doubt on the cheeks they look awesome
they're great on the lips too I mean you
just dab them right on or you could use
a lip brush there's no shimmer frost in
any of these and they're just very easy
to work with now an eye palette that
I've been loving and kind of
surprisingly I mean I know I gave this
kind of a good review in my palate
originals versus sequels video where in
a lot of cases I feel like I like the
originals best but this is a sequel that
I really have been taking to quite a bit
lately
it's the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced my standout
shades in here would be rum raisin this
taupe is great for like a one shadow
look I think it's gorgeous I love peanut
butter to take any look and give it a
really warm twist kind of up above sort
of between the brow bone and the crease
it's a really nice place for that nougat
love saying that word nougat it's a
total winner in terms of blending things
out being kind of a transitional type
shade and butter pecan down here I'm
glad they give you a big size of that
shade because I love using this as a
highlight on the face try it get your
palettes out try this as a highlight
that's what's giving me this beautiful
glow you can lay it on thick as an
eyeshadow and it's not sheer in the
least but if you just lightly like tap a
little you know like a sigma f-35 or
something of that nature into it and
just sweep it right there on the tops of
your cheeks it's so pretty and on the
eyes I've also got butter pick
kind of on the inner corner I've got rum
raisin all over the lid and into the
crease then I deepened up the crease
with some hot fudge that deep dark brown
just in the outer corner and went up
above kind of blended out everything
with nougat and then I don't know if you
can tell you're on the lower lashline I
played with a little bit of the
blueberry swirl shade I had a navy liner
on there so I kind of smudge that out
and went over it with the blueberry just
on the outer part and I think it gives
kind of a cool look for lips a product
I've been super impressed with and I'm
so glad it's a drugstore thing it's the
NYX high voltage lipsticks I mean come
on who has tried these who else loves
these they are such a great great
texture I mean if the best way I could
describe it is if I were blindfolded and
somebody was applying one of these to my
lips I would think they were putting a
lip balm on but then you look at it and
it's like the color payoff is extreme
the staying power is really really
impressive and I think that's a result
of them being so colorful it just really
I don't know penetrates the lips and
lasts so long the really vivid ones do
and if you watched my vibrant crazy lip
color Tryon video there were a few of
these in there that I used and it was a
couple of the purples and the one called
the one called Dalia that's like a near
black berry type shade black berry but
it's so beautiful and then they've got
some more I don't really want to say
normal because Who am I to say what's
normal but they've got some more
traditional lip color type shades in the
line too that I really really have taken
to one beautiful one that I was wearing
recently it's called Hollywood I think
this is an epic amazing red it's so
full-on with the color but still feeling
really lightweight on the lips it gives
a little bit of shine it's just Oh yummy
wonderful cherry red got to mention the
amazing berry in this collection called
wine and dine this is such a juicy deep
rich fun color I mean it might make you
think fall because it kind of makes me
feel that way I tell you what I am gonna
take this right into the spring and
summer months I'm gonna pop this on with
some bronzed up skin maybe kind of a
bronzey I look keep it kind of simple
and then BAM with this on the lips I
think that would be great and then
I'm wearing the one called flutter kiss
this is a kind of shade I think you get
if you mixed a nude and a soft mauve
together you get this kind of a look and
this is all I have on no lip liner mixed
in no lip gloss mixed in you can see
that little bit of Sheen that these have
again very lightweight feel I just love
them great job NYX love those one other
thing this is something I posted on
Instagram and I'm loving it so far it's
the naked love body wash from Marc
this smells freaking awesome it's so
funny I put the picture up on Instagram
and I said like it smells so so good and
then somebody had commented is it really
that good like yes it's really that good
it's amazing I love the scent of this it
is described as gosh it's hard to read
here and blend of apricot nectar velvet
freesia and skin musk that's what it
says I think it smells a little bit like
grapefruit e2 it's got this really
refreshing clean fresh vibe going on but
at the same time there's a warmth to it
that I just love it's very unique to me
and I think I'm gonna do a floor review
probably on this and maybe the body
butter that I've been using the body
butter the scent is slightly different
on that I love the texture of it it's
got an amazing kind of melted cream
cheese type of texture when you put it
on but like kind of melts into your skin
like an oil it's it's so cool and the
scent on that is good too but if you
guys are really into you know different
body products and trying like the full
family of whatever scent it might be you
know that body washes and lotions even
though they have the technically the
same scent or the same label on them
they still can be a little bit different
and I think this is the absolute best
scent I love it thank you so that's it
everyone for the roundup of the March
favorites I hope you enjoyed this video
