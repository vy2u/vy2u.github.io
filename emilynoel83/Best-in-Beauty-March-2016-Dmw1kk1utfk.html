this video is my best in beauty for the
month of March so some of my favorite
products over the course of the past
month and I've got some really awesome
makeup related things I guess one thing
first thing I'll mention is a little bit
more of a skincare item and it's from
benefit it's called this specialist
dreamscreen SPF 45 and it's oil-free and
I have really been loving this and it's
kind of been acting as a primer for me
really because it's a very very thin
lightweight sunscreen for the face you
shake it up you can hear that little
mixer ball in there and you squeeze it
out and you can see it's very very
liquidy and I love how kind of silky it
feels on the skin it's very lightweight
it doesn't leave my skin feeling super
like tacky or dewy my foundation seems
to really glide on across it that's why
it's just that nice kind of Inbetweeners
step after I apply a moisturizer which
may or may not have sunscreen in it and
then I know I've got my sunscreen with
this and I just love that feeling once
you give it a second to kind of dry down
even though it doesn't come away feeling
totally dry it's just this silky soft
feeling it doesn't take a lot it just
you'll find it kind of glides across the
skin you know that some products just
slip across easier this is one of those
and it says invisible silky matte SPF 45
sunscreen for face so it has been that
nice little primer type step under
foundation and making sure I've got the
sunscreen so that's an awesome find
speaking of foundation Shea Moisture oh
my goodness I have been loving this
foundation so much it's the weightless
Shea serum foundation says natural
finish I got it in the shade nude it
does have the little pump style
dispenser here and I got mine on ulties
website and then more recently I did see
a full Shea Moisture display in my Ulta
store so that was exciting but I'm
loving this foundation for how
lightweight it is but yet really good
coverage it does give my skin a little
bit of a glow it's not actual like
flecks of shimmer that I can see in this
product but it's just like a soft softly
luminous
finish to the skin I think it's gorgeous
and I love that extra kind of drink of
moisture that I feel like my skin's
getting I'm not super dry but something
about the texture of it just makes it
look so natural on the skin as opposed
to something that's really like dry and
flat and matte looking but you know if
the product is gonna be that way for me
it has to have the coverage like
coverage has got to be there for me and
I love that this has that as well that
still it manages to be so thin so
lightweight so it kind of reminds me of
that tart rainforest of the sea that I
tried the sample of a few times similar
consistency and texture I just I do feel
like this has a little more moisture to
it I don't even need to use a full pump
with this an example of another one of
those things that just really spreads
glides across the skin easily you don't
feel like you're constantly going back
for more and more product and with a
really liquidy foundation like this and
I'll really like those dense tight
blending foundation brushes like a sigma
f80 or what's this one this one that
likes to fly out of my hand f-84 is good
for that I really like kind of a dabbing
it in type of approach I'm wearing this
today love the way my skin looks with
this again I am the shade nude cream
contouring is something I have been
doing lately usually if I'm doing the
baking method for whatever reason I
think it's just the compacts I have that
also contain a contour type shade along
with a coverage product like that
mascara product talked about this
compact last month and my favorites I've
hit pan now on my white peach shade
which is great for added coverage and
just really getting that smooth effect
on the under eye but I'll also use this
cream bronzer quite a bit too because
it's there and it's a really nice tone
but my favorite brush for anything like
that pretty much regardless of what
compact it's coming from I love this
Real Techniques sculpting brush so dense
a little bit angled definitely tapered
down the sides so you know if you hold
your brush or you place it on your skin
a little bit you know this way or that
way you're still laying down nice
tapered bristles and able to get a
really easy blend and I just love the
size of it I feel like it stamps the
product down exactly where it should be
not too big not too small and I am
really not a fan of like the super blunt
cut contour type brushes like this one
from ELF I just I don't get it I don't
see what they're really doing they just
require even more blending because
you've gotten such a concentrated swipe
of color and here I just take this I'll
dab it right into the product put it on
here it's already looking soft before
I've even made much effort to blend it
out and I just you know Real Techniques
quality is great super dense incredibly
soft no complaints about this brush and
this could even be good for applying
foundation to just the size of it I do
think it's large enough to do a nice
even buff in a foundation so many face
type products this week that I'm loving
another one here is from ELF it's those
tiny it's the total face palette and I
love what's in here at first when I got
this I thought is it just gonna be you
know super soft and sheer and barely
show up on my skin but I feel like
everything in this palette like you
glanced at it and you think oh that
seems kind of subtle everything makes
more of an impact actually applied than
it even appears in the palette that's
just my opinion and a lot of things
aren't that way a lot of times you'll
look at something and be like oh it
looks great and then you swatch it out
or you apply it and you're like oh let
down these I love these products this
will be a nice thing like even if I'm
just doing a light contour no cream
contour let's say or if I want to top
off a previously cream contour area like
I did today really nice and soft it's a
great kind of cool type tone to use in
that manner you've got a couple of
gorgeous matte blushes here I'm wearing
the pinky one I think it's so fresh so
brightening to the skin and in one
palette I think it's great to have the
peach and the pink I will often bounce
between two shades like that so I like
having them both there and then this
thing up here is gorgeous first off the
texture is like whoa super soft and it's
got that little bit of a glow but see
how it's more of a muted color you guys
that you think does that have a grayish
cast to it and it's really it's not but
it's like you've just turned the lights
down a little bit on those brighter
champagne highlighter type shades it
kind of reminds me of the effect I'll
get from the hourglass dim light powder
but this has a
little more Sheen to it so I love just
lightly taking it all over my face after
I've done my makeup and I feel like it
gives a nice little glow and I think
there's there's so much happening behind
my head with this horribly messy bun
should I even bother fixing it at this
point we'll just leave it be I made an
attempt to just casually like pile my
hair on top of my head and it didn't
quite work but no this palette beautiful
I think the skin tones that would
benefit from it most would probably be
fair light light to medium skin if you
are a deeper skin tone elf has now in
the same kind of format but there the
black compacts some really vibrant like
darker blush palettes in both cream and
powder so definitely look into that if
you want some blushes that will really
stand out on your skin but this is more
like the subtle natural take and I like
how it's got the bronzer the two blushes
and kind of a glowy shade and I
mentioned using that glow kind of all
over the face but I still like to really
pinpoint areas for a certain something
here on the cheeks and the powder I've
been using in that way is this laura
geller
filter finish setting powder in
universal so it's got all these sort of
color correcting looking shades and I
don't know that this is actually like
correcting much of anything it just
comes together to look like a really
brightened face powder and it's funny
because in that perfect palette video I
did one of the questions was about what
shade in a palette would you like to
have singularly and one of the things I
mentioned was this kind of light really
bright lilac highlight from the NYX
stroke of genius palette and this kind
of gives me that effect because it's
like over-the-top brightness it's not
too shimmery but it's so incredibly
brightening does that make sense just
the tone that this powder takes on I
feel like it's so nice and brightening
so I like to use it with a smallish
brush I'll just dab across all the color
tap off the excess and it's the kind of
thing that I think is designed to be
used all over the face so you could
probably do that but I think it does a
beautiful job when you apply it really
concentrate it's smaller brush right on
top of the cheekbones I already had this
product on my face I don't really need
more but I just I love that glove and
you can kind of change the color tone
that you get a little bit if you go into
more of the lilac shade see there's that
crazy like next-level bright it goes
beyond the champagne and the soft golden
highlights and takes you to something
even cooler and thus brighter in my
opinion or you can stay over here more
toward the peachy and golden type shades
and you get a little different tone
sorry what am I doing with my fingers
here golden see more cool tone there's
no sparkle in this is just that
beautiful healthy Sheen the brush by the
way when I referenced a smaller brush
this is my up and up highlight brush it
comes from a little complexion brush set
of up and up brushes from Target and
it's just a really nice size I'm super
random thing that I know I mentioned in
my ELF one dollar favorites video but
these tweezers good Lord these are great
tweezers they have replaced my tweezer
moons I use them every morning to pluck
out or tweeze out some stray hairs they
are so so nice like really nice quality
one dollar the way the little tips come
together is absolutely perfect and
precise and you can get right in there
two hairs that you think you have
nothing to grab on to and boom it takes
it so I love those them down Singh
around to a lot of different eye
products as usual last week I had my
easy I week so if you're interested in
some certain eyeshadow products that I
really like check out those videos but
in this video I wanted to mention a
couple of cream products that are really
great for a quick look as well I know a
lot of those videos mention quick
techniques but these are the batter up
long wear eyeshadow sticks from the balm
and they've got some beautiful like
neutral shades in this collection all
the way from deeper ones to mid-tones
and a couple of the ones that have
really captured my attention are these
lighter ones feel like they're just so
brightening if you're wanting you know
lighter springtime type eye looks this
one is called moonshot I think it's the
lightest one in the collection and I'm
wearing it kind of around my inner
corner up onto the lid just a little bit
these go on really really smoothly they
do set like many of the great long wear
shadow sticks out there and I love the
little bit of pink hue that this has
because I think it's extra brightening
when it has that and
in this other one that I love is called
shutout and it's kind of unique because
instead of being like a crazy loud like
brassy metallic gold it's like a really
soft neutral barely they're gold I don't
know quite how did you survive it I've
got it all over my lid and in my crease
today it's actually just um this contour
shade I just used that as my crease
color and chose to pop these on the lid
these could definitely be basis for
different shadows that you love
different powder eyeshadows but I think
for a quick look you know popping them
on the lid really getting that bright
glow these are fun
I mentioned the Shea Moisture foundation
earlier another thing that I'm loving
from this line yes I'm gonna do a full
Shea Moisture video coming up but this
shea butter luscious lipstick oh my
goodness feels so nice such a vibrancy
with the color line and I'm wearing red
rose today really pretty packaging too
by the way it's got this kind of like
it's a teeny bit rubbery feeling on the
outside there and then I love this kind
of chocolate metal and I think this is
such a pretty wearable read I think what
sets this particular line apart is just
how moisturizing and wonderful they feel
but yet they don't bleed outside my lips
so it's a comfortable easy to wear
beautiful red lipstick not so bright
that you feel like you've slept on like
the brightest retro read ever but not so
dark that you feel like is this kind of
a fall lipstick still very you know
spring and summer appropriate and I love
when I come across what I feel is in
every woman's lipstick you know the
shade that I think everybody needs in
their collection because it really looks
good on everyone
and it's this Revlon Super Lustrous and
Rose velvet I've worn this more than a
couple times on snapchat recently it's
such a pretty soft dusty rose shade you
know just enough pink happening there
just enough neutral not too light not
too dark it's the kind of lipstick that
you put it on and your face looks
finished but it doesn't really take the
spotlight like here with today's look I
feel like the red lips are like look at
me look at me and I have no problem with
that but sometimes maybe you're just
wanting a more soft look overall and you
just want to look nice without anybody
really being able to point too
thing and say oh it's the lipstick or oh
it's the eyes this is such a nice
finishing touch to the look that's it
everyone those are my top products over
the course of the past month let me know
