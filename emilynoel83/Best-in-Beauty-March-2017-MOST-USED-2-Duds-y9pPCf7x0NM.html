being here for my best in beauty for the
month of March so many awesome things to
share with you in this video it's a lot
of really like strictly most-used stuff
and a lot of times with these videos you
know when we go month by month and share
the favorites a lot of it is the stuff
that I've been using the most that's a
good gauge for me to say like this is a
favorite because I've been reaching for
it over and over but then there are
those other like really outstanding
things that maybe aren't necessarily a
daily use type item that still work
their way in well pretty much everything
I'm sharing in this video is a thing
that's just been getting used repeatedly
I've got some really really good brushes
in this video and man as I look at
myself in my little camera screen here
my eye look is very dramatic today and
you know I don't really have an
eyeshadow palette that I was planning to
share in this video but I have been
enjoying just mass in general a lot
lately matte eyeshadow looks the palette
that I did use for this look today and
I'm trying to kind of get a feel for it
you know I'm not quite sure if I love it
yet or not it's the new the new one from
the balm called meet Matador and this is
what it looks like and I'm kind of
trying to figure out if maybe the meat
matte idea has run its course yet or not
they had an original meat mattes it was
a rather small palette and then the meet
matte nude which I loved meet matrimony
was fooled like my kind of shape had
more like a berry plum thing going and
this one I'm just I don't know I'm not
sure I used a lot of the top part for
this look and then another day recently
I worked in the blue shade but anyway
this is so like this is so so off topic
for this favorites video but I thought
somebody might ask like what's on your
eyes that's what I'm messing with right
now trying to figure out but first thing
favorites why's that I want to talk
about is my shape tape concealer and a
flat foundation brush if you feel like
you've heard this before I did give this
a quick mention on snapchat maybe just
in a picture and I really feel like any
flat foundation brush will probably work
this one happens to be from Sigma it
says F 60 and it's a shorter one so I
think it came from one of those like
travel sets from years back but any kind
of flat brush I feel like it works great
with this especially if you like to you
you're shaped ape up under your eye and
by the way I am light/medium in this and
this is a fabulous coverage concealer
for as good coverage as it is it seems
to be very good in terms of the wear
like it doesn't look too heavy on my
skin and I don't know I'll Blansett
myself later in the day and feel like I
don't have this super heavy under-eye
area even though a lot of times I'll use
this and then maybe go ahead and set it
with something even though it doesn't
totally need to be set it just is really
good about looking natural now another
little tip with this I don't think you
need a lot of it the temptation is there
and I see it a lot like if I catch a
video or something on Instagram you know
those little quick makeup videos this is
a huge applicator here this carries a
lot of product it's not it's a lot
bigger than your typical gos foot I have
referred to this before as a buck foot
because it's bigger you know and so when
people go straight straight straight
tricks drink with this I'm always
thinking like this way too much because
this is a pretty potent concealer and it
just doesn't take a lot and this
applicator is already holding a lot of
product so just dot it just a few little
dots on your under eye and then spread
it with the flat foundation brush and
something about this style of brush all
you want to look for is that it's a flat
brush you know about that size and it'll
have this nice taper pretty much all of
them do down the side so you can lay it
flat and it gets the product so nicely
up to that lower lash line it just seems
to spread the products so evenly acts on
really good coverage with the small
amount of this that I do use and I think
I might be getting an even more natural
effect with the shape tape because this
is a little bit wider brush than maybe
what I was using before and it just I
don't know it thins it al where it just
spreads it a little more evenly and I've
gotten feedback from some of you after I
posted that little tip and you tried it
and you totally agreed that it was a
really good method so if you haven't
dried that out yet you might think about
it with your shape tape flat foundation
brush is totally the way to go another
brush that I think is really wonderful
to have in your collection is this one
from Real Techniques and it's called the
contour brush and I believe this came in
like a little set with the buffing brush
and one other thing
the buzzing brush is great too like for
liquid foundations powder foundations
that this is amazing for cream contour
if you like any kind of cream contouring
on your face this little guy you know
it's so well right here in the hollows
of the cheek around the hairline it's
very dense it's very soft it's like just
a mini egg shaped brush and it works so
nicely so I just wanted to point that
out because I know cream contouring a
lot of people like to do that and
sometimes certain blender sponges
depending on what you're working with
can be a little bit big for actually
getting the best blend on those dark
cream contour products and this is just
a really good size a lot of times I find
I work in like small circular motions
with this and it blends out the products
very nicely okay one more amazing brush
I got to throw out there and my friend
David who works for Estee Lauder he
tipped me off that there was a new
amazing brush out he's like you want to
try it and I'm like yes sign me up I'm
going to order that and so I ordered it
came in it's the defining powder brush
and he said this kind of a brush look at
this crazy shape here yeah it's like a
little cup there you go you can see it
this is so good for like accentuating
the apple of the cheek that's what he
told me he thought this would be a
really good brush for me and by the way
it is tapered like everywhere you know
it's tapered down here the sides you
know have a nice taper like that there's
no harsh edge to this brush but I swear
it does take this little loan right here
and it just cups it with blush it's so
cool it probably seems like kind of a
little gimmicky thing like do we need to
reinvent the blush brush but I do really
like this I like the way it picks up
product from my blushes I lay it in I
press the bristles down so it's kind of
getting in contact with everything tap
off some excess especially depending on
the blush you're working with and I
don't need to apply any more but I'm
gonna for you here and then like this
that's the kind of motion I do a little
sweeping motion there and it's just ooh
you just feel like it's practically
contouring this part of the cheek with
your blush and it's just exact
placement it's so good I just wanted to
mention that because I'm sure I've got
some brush geeks out there who love you
know weird and a little bit different
prizes and this one is so good and by
the way the brush the blush that I just
dipped into it that is hot mama from the
balm this is another most used thing
from the month and I kind of always
think of this blush it's one of the
lighter ones in my collection like
really soft but you know I'm kind of
realizing it's not so much that way like
let's get it just in full-on lighting
here and it does look kind of light
because there's a lot of shimmer in this
a lot of glow eNOS a very golden vibe
throughout this blush and when it
catches a light it does look light but
when it's not look you know it's really
looking like kind of this deep and coral
and I can see that on my cheeks as well
because in full-on lighting you know
it's giving you almost that highlighter
effect a little bit and then you turn
and it's like oh yeah there is a decent
amount of actual color to that blush as
well so this has been in my collection
for a while I love the balms powder
blushes I think that's one of the things
that they really do best above all I
mean they do great eyeshadows but their
blushes are just outstanding and this
one is definitely if you've had it you
have it reach for it for a while it's
kind of worth a second look I've always
thought it was a pigmented blush but
something that I thought it was getting
this really light effect with and no I
think there is actually a good amount of
color with that and maybe it's that
brush that's showing it off to me a
different way I don't know it's so cool
though another thing in my collection is
kind of rediscovered and what prompted
this rediscovery was when I was doing my
expensive drugstore makeup video and I
was using that L'Oreal superstar mascara
excuse me which is a two-step mascara so
it's got the white in kind of a primer
side and in the black traditional
mascara that you put on top and I had
noticed that the primer was really kind
of heavy on my lashes and caused them to
sink can I cause them to fall even
though I had just curled them and I
thought you know what primer doesn't
make my lashes do that is the Estee
Lauder little black primer lo and behold
I look in my drawer and I've got one
unopened it was in my drawer as a backup
and you know I'm in this mode
constantly trying new mascara new
mascara and I hadn't used it I hadn't
busted it open it is been sitting there
probably brand new for months so here it
is I'm back on the train
little black primer is amazing like this
is the best lash primer and the people
who need it most are the ones who have
curl challenged lashes like me lashes
that want to think that feel pulled down
by a lot of mascaras even though you go
to the effort of curling them the wand
just looks like this and it is black I
love the primer being black I don't like
the obligation of coating every single
white lash then you know after you've
applied a white primer and you'll put
this on and chances are the first time
you use it you'll be like what you know
it doesn't look like anything's on there
and then you sweep on your regular
mascara and you're like oh okay
coming through loud and clear I totally
get it now this it's like lash hairspray
it locks in the curl and then I can go
on top of it with any frankly crappy
mascara and it will still look good but
go on top of it was something you loved
already like a covergirl super sizer or
the superhero mascara from it cosmetics
and it's like huge so if I'm not wearing
lashes I think this is an essential step
and if I am wearing lashes it still been
helpful with like I'm wearing lashes
today and it helps my natural lashes
hold that curl and blend up with the
false lashes even better so it's so so
good you will find that it's a little
bit harder to get off your lashes as you
remove your makeup so if you've got any
kind of like cleansing balm or any like
eye makeup remover that you really love
I just find I have to do a little step
further than my equate daily facial
cleansing cloth type deal to get this
off I need to give it a little special
attention and mainly that's because I
don't like rubbing on my eye area at all
I like it to just go off easily you just
don't want to be too rough with your
eyes so be aware you might need to use a
remover or something when you want to
take this off click mention to a
finishing powder that I think is so so
good makeup forever has these
powders which we know about the HD
powder I feel like makeup forever was
kind of a pioneer with those white you
know loose finishing powders and I'd
mentioned this in my beauty chat video
that they seemed even finer and silkier
than ever before I would sent you know
that powder all over again and I thought
wow that's even more silky than I
remember and then they have a pressed
version and I feel like just out of
convenience because sometimes it's
easier just to grab for a press powder
than a loose powder I'll just sweep into
this any particular brush I guess the
brush i've been using most is this
spotlight duster and just get a little
bit of that on and just kind of sweep
over the nose and sides of the nose
t-zone area when i'm done with my makeup
and i swear it's like a pore eraser the
pores look so much less evident any kind
of texture on your skin looks a lot less
pronounced with that powder over it it
is the finest lightest silkiest just
wonderfulness like i'm getting up close
on myself here and I put that powder on
twice and it still doesn't look you know
makeup in terms of lip products the one
I'm wearing in this video and the one
that has lived in my purse for about the
past month or two is this Revlon Ultra
HD in the shade HD dawn I love this
entire line of lip colors but this one
is so so good kind of this rosy with a
little hint of metallic can you see how
it's like catching the light but I'm not
wearing any kind of gloss and I just
think these are the best they have a lot
of fragrance to them which may or may
not be a good thing depending on who you
are but I don't notice that really once
I'm wearing them and I think the color
is so anytime you know there's a reason
why this is in my person if I need to
slap something on when I'm out on the go
this is the easiest thing to grab really
not worried about it interfering with
any kind of eye look any kind of cheek
color whatever that I've got on it just
works for anything another one that I
love in that manner and has been in my
little daily makeup tote where is that
this is the thing that kind of floats
around the house with me and has
products that I can just grab for and
use really quickly this is the almay
smart shea butter kiss in very light
medium
and so this is another one that's really
easy to reach for and it's kind of
similar to the Revlon but a little more
light a little more pinky I would say
but this is super comfortable on the
lips as well both of them have a really
nice smoothness a little bit of shine to
them especially when this one is freshly
applied it looks quite shiny but they're
just comfortable easy lip products I got
to say one more thing here I'm really
getting into my buxom lip creams again
and this was kind of prompted by that
Ulta sale when I was going through my
stuff and realizing how many things I
had that I love that are available
through that 21 days of beauty this
shade is called cherry flip is a great
go to summer creamy cooling warm red
gloss I think it's so beautiful on the
lips like I said doesn't have shimmer
it's just a straight-up creamy shade are
these truly plumping I can see why
people might feel that these have some
plumping action going on because you
know the cooling kind of minty tingle is
happening but also there's a thickness
the gloss that really smooths out the
look of your lips so when you're
eliminating the look of all the little
lines it does make your lips look fuller
so this is a great product and this
particular shade I absolutely love now I
mentioned at the start of the video
we're talking most use stuff that has
just been so frequently reached for over
the past month but one thing that is a
little bit more of a statement lip color
that I can't sad been wearing every
single day but my goodness do I
absolutely love this shade and it is
from Besame and it's called tango red
it's a really nice warm red it's mostly
red with a little kick of orange in
there and I think it's so so beautiful I
also I'm loving carmine too from this
line and I'm really considering a whole
video just about warm beautiful red
lipsticks but tango red a few days ago I
thought I lost it and I went several
days it was like missing I was about to
put up flyers around town like have you
seen this lipstick but no I found it it
was just you know in my mess it was
hiding behind a little container over
here but it is such a great great
vibrant shade for this time of year and
again I'm a focus in more on
that type of lip product in a future
video before I go I just want to mention
a couple of things that didn't work so
well for me here lately one is from
makeup revolution I got this skin kiss
highlighter in ice kiss and this is an
interesting product it's a huge
highlight okay
and maybe this would be better as a body
product I'm just having that realization
considering how huge it is and you know
you could stick a big brush in there and
dust it on your body to the touch it has
a nice texture between my fingers it
actually feels creamy but on my skin
this just looks like too much the it
looks like a very very fake type of
highlight I guess it goes on the skin
with quite a bit of thickness and maybe
that's kind of hard to control so if you
just want a sheer wash of this it's just
hard to achieve that and it seems kind
of chunky which is it's strange to be
saying that it feels creamy yet also
chunky am I making any sense here I
don't know it's just too thick it seems
a bit too thick to be more on the face
so my next thing the way I'm going to
try to make this work is more like on
the body if I ever start showing some
more skin maybe that time of year is
coming so I'll go for that another thing
I've been using is the st. Ives
exfoliate nourish coconut oil scrub then
using this in the shower is this is for
the face by the way so I've been
removing my makeup and then every couple
days I'll use some kind of scrub so this
is basically like little exfoliating
bits suspended in this kind of thick oil
gel you start scrubbing and first off
not enough scrubby's for me like you the
first two seconds you feel like you got
scrubbing action and then it just sort
of rubs away and then you're trying to
rinse and I love using scrubs in the
shower because it's like I just put my
face up to the shower and it rinses so
easily usually but with these little
scrubby bits being like I said suspended
in the oily substance it just does not
rinse very easily the little bits that
are still on your skin that aren't very
effective at scrubbing but still remain
hard to get off your skin hard to get a
good clean rinse of it just seems like
way too much work to get this rinsed off
and then you definitely are going to
have this
kind of oily a little bit residue type
of feel and I can kind of make that work
for me sometimes like once I'm out of
the shower I can kind of blend it in
I'll feel like okay my skin does feel
sort of soft right now but just don't
think you're going to use this and end
up with any kind of squeaky clean
feeling
I just don't think these two steps go
together if you're going to use a scrub
get a good scrub get like some
philosophy micro delivery wash or
something like that really scrub your
skin and then get out of the shower and
put on in some kind of facial oil if
that's what you want and then you don't
have these two competing things in one
product so I think that's all I've got
right now guys the mostly hits couple of
misses thank you so much for tuning in I
hope you enjoyed this let me know if
you've got any video requests any
certain things you'd like to see for me
in the coming days and I will talk to
you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
