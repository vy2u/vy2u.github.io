of May thank you so much for joining me
I'm sorry about my voice I have been
sick for about the past week and while I
am feeling a lot better my voice is just
a little behind it's pretty scratchy I
talked a lot when I probably shouldn't
have been talking and my voice is just
gotta know I am behind a little bit
little bit scratchy so but I'm not in
pain it's not a sore throat anymore so
that's really good I have been gathering
up my beauty favorites and I definitely
want to share those with you so I'm
gonna jump in and start with lip
products because I feel like my lips are
really bold today and these are my
favorites the products I'm using I'm
actually using my OCC lip tars those are
from obsessive-compulsive cosmetics and
I love these so much I actually got
these for Christmas and I hadn't been
using them for a long time and I just
think they kind of got put away and I've
always kind of felt like these weren't
super like travel friendly or easy to
use on the go because the colors are
just so pigmented and they come out of
these little squeeze tubes and then it's
like you gotta have a lip brush and I
don't know it just seems to require a
lot of like extra little things but I
recently got these back out and started
playing with them some more and actually
mixing them the shades I have our
trollope that's this like pretty kind of
pink with a little bit of a coral edge
to it and then this one is vintage and
this is really deep deep red and I
actually love combining them this is the
combination of these two a magenta pink
kind of a bright berry color and I just
love it but really what made these user
friendly for me again was the fact that
I had taken my deep potted Physicians
Formula pallets and I did blog about
this so I'll link to that below the blog
post about how I did it but D potted the
eyeshadow that used to be in here and
this actually makes a perfect little
on-the-go lip palette I just need a
mirror I usually carry a powder compact
so that's not a huge deal but
what's neat is that the area that used
to hold a sponge tip applicator
perfectly fits the lip brush that comes
with the lip tars and then you know you
can just like this is one dot of each
shade and then I blended them to make
that chase fallen in love with these all
over again I love the color intensity
they don't feel really thick on your
lips they have kind of a I don't know a
thinness to them I can't really describe
but I've gone and purchased more but
these are the two that I've definitely
been using the most the ones I've had
the longest and the ones that prompted
this whole little discovery next
favorite is another lip product and I
love the look of a red lip in the summer
I think it looks so fresh so just kind
of all-american look but a lot of red
lipsticks can be very high-maintenance
and if you're going out to a barbecue or
you going out to a concert or something
you know you don't want to be constantly
touching up the lips and something that
I think is really easy to wear and but
yet a beautiful red shade is this tarte
lipsurgence and fever and it's just a
really pretty red shape but see how it's
like a little bit softer not quite as
intense as like maybe your most
pigmented red lipstick but it's got like
a little bit of shimmer in there and
it's just so easy to apply
like I mean there's not a lot of red lip
products that would venture to put on my
lips without even feeling the need for a
mirror but this is one of them and I
just love that color okay another thing
the Milani color play felt tip liquid
pen this is in black line these actually
come in a bunch of colors but I feel
like Milani is onto something with
having a pen form liner that lasts
longer than other brands this has lasted
me so long
it's a really nice fine felt tip pen
very easy to and quick to go across your
upper lash line it does not smudge I
have actually had a little swatch here
on my hand I've washed my hands a couple
times and it hasn't come off but I feel
like they're onto something and that I
think their pens last longer than other
felts at pins my mom for example uses
the Milani brow tint pen which is the
same basic format and she's like used
the same one for like
months daily use and it's still going
strong she's got a couple backups but I
mean it's really working well and they
do advise you to store it horizontally
so instead of storing it this way or
even this way in a cup store it flat and
I've been doing that and it's just still
going and going I I will let you guys
know when this finally runs out but I
mean it's been months that I've had this
and used it for liner across my upper
lash line it's been wonderful another
product that I've really been getting
into lately is my Ben Nye luxury powder
in buff I should do a video I have three
different shades of these luxury powders
I do have the banana powder buff and I
have cameo and to compare like here's
cameo and here's buff like a but that's
just a lot closer to my skin tone if not
maybe a little bit lighter and what I'd
like to use this for is to set my under
eye concealer and I just feel like it's
a really really fine textured powder and
I love that like you get a ton of
product for the price and previously I
have been using my bare minerals summer
bisque and well rested and I still use
those on and off I think they're great
products I think you just have to be
even more careful to really really use
them lightly on the under eye area and
this is just by its nature it's a much
thinner powder very very finely milled
and it's just a great color I feel like
for me to set my under eye concealer and
do a little bit of brightening but not
look too white and the brush I like to
use it with which is kind of a favorite
I guess but you don't I don't think you
need this specific brush but just
basically a large brush that maybe it's
too big to use on your eyes like this
was an eye brush from Smashbox number 10
and I feel like it's huge you know like
it's way way big for my eye but it's
really nice to get a light application
of powder right in here whereas using a
flat brush might pack on too much on
your under eye this mitt keeps it really
light so if you
have you know a large large blending
brush sitting around where you feel like
it's maybe too big for your eye area
wash it up use it for maybe some sort of
under eye setting powder it can work
really nicely and the way I use Venice
which is as you can see it's in this
kind of plastic jar I just give it a
shake and then there's usually then some
powder in the cap and some powder right
on top and I don't even use up all of
what comes up on top but I'll take a
little bit with my brush and just
lightly dust under the eye I feel like
it has a teeny bit of coverage not as
much coverage as the summer bisque
powders and stuff but main thing is that
it mattifies and it just seems to even
and also set your concealer for longer
wear which is great as far as eyeshadow
goes I've really been making a conscious
effort to use different shadows all the
time I've tried not to fall into using
the same one over and over do you kind
of have a go-to shadow for when I just
need a quick look and don't want to
think about it and I'm pretty sure I've
talked about this before but it's the
infallible single in bronzed taupe and
I'm wearing that today I'm wearing it i
padded it with a flat brush all over my
lid and then I blended it with a
blending brush up into the crease so one
shadow look super easy this is a
gorgeous shade and it just works with
any outfit you might be wearing when
it's very opaque like this look how
metallic but when it's buffed out it has
you know just a much softer look - it's
always good to have one that you know
you can grab and use quickly and get a
good look out of without having to think
too much about it so I really recommend
that oh a hair recommendation this is
the got to be oil licious tripple oil it
says argon white grape and marula calm
and shine styling oil this is another
find another recommendation that I got
off of the mascara blog and I'll link to
that it's a great blog but I've really
enjoyed using this on my ends whether
I'm styling my hair or not if I just
want to wear my hair straight and it's
kind of you know towel dried I feel like
it makes my ends seem so much healthier
kind of Hydra
did you know without being oily and
greasy I mean I would have never thought
I would have styled my hair with some
sort of oil being as fine as it is
but I just mainly keep it down on the
end I've used just like the josie maran
argan oil in a similar way in the past
and it I didn't feel like maybe it
really penetrated them as much or or had
the same effect on my hair but this
stuff really works nicely and today I
just curled it a little bit and I feel
like it just I don't know it keeps the
hair seeming so soft even after it's
curled so it only takes a teeny bit last
little thing I want to mention and this
wasn't a recent video but my ELF daily
moisture stick I mentioned using this as
a great way to refresh your under eye if
you look at yourself midday and you feel
like gosh what happened I'm looking dry
and cakey under there you just take a
little bit on your finger dab it under
the eye I've got more in another video
also been using this for since I've been
blowing my nose all the time
I take a little bit on my finger and
I've actually been using it to sort of
rehydrate this area right under my nose
that gets so dry so I mean I feel like
it's the type of thing you'll have and
you will come up with probably a bunch
of different ways to use it for those
little times when you're dry maybe
around your cuticles your nose your
anywhere it works great so this is a $6
item I got it from I slipspace stock so
that's it everyone thank you so much for
bearing with me with my low voice it's
actually improved a lot over the past
few days so I appreciate you tuning in
and I have many more fun videos planned
so stay tuned and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
