favorites of the month and actually the
last time last month when I did this
video I did a fully focused lip
favorites video so if you're really
interested in some great spring and
summer lip pics check out that video I
always like doing a good lip focused
video every so often I have some lip
favorites in this video as well but also
just various makeup products some new
some that I've had in my stash for a
while that I'm just really excited about
right now and by the way you guys I have
been up since 3 o'clock this morning I
have not gone back to bed every now and
then since Bell has really gotten into
the teething hardcore she'll like wake
up maybe one time in the night not every
night but sometimes she'll wake up and
I'll go ahead and nurse her and she'll
typically go right back down to bed
today she just didn't feel like going
back to the head she wanted to stay up
so it was like a couple hours past I fed
her again and then after that time she
went back down I am a little tired this
morning but I do have my coffee so
that's what's gonna save this whole
situation and I'm going to start things
off on talking about a cheap product
that has really been on the market for
quite some time and I've always viewed
it as a bronzer but not really one that
I thought I'd like as a bronzer and so I
never really gravitated toward it until
I've started using it as blush and this
is the Too Faced pink leopard blushing
bronzer so leopard print everybody's
gotta love that right I really have a
thing for these bronzy type blushes and
in a swatch it's so deceiving like I see
that and I think maybe that's a
highlight you know is that kind of like
a soft taupe shade you know what's going
on with that shade but I really love it
on the cheeks its soft it's got a little
bit of pink to it as you can see there
are little spotty pink areas in there
but if you're getting a little more Sun
or maybe you're self-tanning and your
skin's starting to get a little more
color to it this type of a blush shade
looks so healthy so flattering it does
have kind of a satiny slightly glowy
finish to it and along those same lines
another product which I do have a
forward view on over on the Express
channel is the balm desert bronzer slash
blush from the bone this isn't
one of those things were it's kind of
deceptive you know you look at it and
you think okay typical run-of-the-mill
bronzer but it actually has such a soft
rosy tone that it takes on when it gets
on your skin that's why for me this
doesn't look quite right as a contour
but it looks gorgeous as a blush and
also really pretty as an eyeshadow in my
review I did a one shadow look with this
was really happy with the outcome it has
kind of a satiny finish if you're
familiar with Bahama Mama that totally
puts this product in its place you know
you see the two side-by-side and you're
like oh I get it now this is a little
bit lighter warmer Bahama Mama cooler
deeper matte traditional bronzer balm
desert is really great as a blush or an
eye shadow in comparison to the pink
leopard shade here it's a little deeper
there's more rose that comes out of it
this is a little more light and pinky
but probably not really surprising that
I'm liking those kinds of shades it is
that time of year where all things
bronze are really coming into play
another face thing I want to talk about
is this Rimmel hide the blemish
concealer it's a stick concealer it
looks very you know just old school
stick concealer it's in the shade light
beige and I assure you this is not like
a typical dry concealer stick it's
actually super creamy really easy to
blend out but what I especially love
about this and I'm not sure if you'll be
able to tell on a swatch on my hand it's
got a little bit of a light peachy tone
but this just so happens to right now be
like the absolute perfect shade for me
to conceal with and I'm not talking like
especially brighten but just completely
hide something into my skin it's like
the perfect tone this happens a lot with
like the favorite status of different
face products it's not like you know
they stopped being a favorite because
you just stop liking them for whatever
reason month-to-month but sometimes you
know that particular tone ends up just
being perfect for your skin this is
called hide the blemish but it does say
on here effectively conceals spots
blemishes under-eye circles it's just a
nice little all-purpose use it anywhere
type of stick I use it around my nose my
under
I actually did hide two blemishes on my
face I got one on my chin and one in
between my eyebrows and I think it did a
pretty good job with that four eyes I
got to tell you I have been having just
so much fun playing with my color pop
eyeshadows lately and just doing
different things with them using them as
like a pop on the lids
maybe down on the lower lash line
combining different shades it's really
been hard for me to hone in on you know
just one or two and say you know these
are my favorites because I've been
bouncing around with so many different
shades what's really making them work
for me is the thought of pairing them
with various matte shadows that I like
so I've gone back to you know my hard
candy
birthday suit palette my Sonia Kashuk
matte palette but a couple that I've
really been reaching for most have been
the Too Faced natural matte palette
which this just is a great color
selection it's so so basic here across
the top that cashmere bunny shade is
just awesome it looks like maybe that
wouldn't even provide enough contrast in
the crease but it is such a great
natural shadow crease shade and just a
warning for you though if you have the
Too Faced natural eye palette that's the
one that's not fully mad it's got some
shimmer in there it was recently
repackaged in this like metal style
compact they put this same row in there
and also on this shade called nudie is
the same in that palette as well so I'm
not thrilled that there's that much
repetition going on there but at the
same time I love how basic you know that
top row is and then I love these down
here the honey butter and chocolate
cookie shade the warmth to those is so
so working for me for the different
bronzy shades I'm liking all over the
lid and also strapless this rosy mauve
color is of course right up my alley and
then if I want more of an overall
burgundy twist to the entire matte
aspect of my look we're talking you know
crease colors maybe just above the
crease the pier mineral Sol mattes
Palace is one I know I reviewed on the
Express channel it might have been was
it before Christmas time these are
stunningly pigmented and this shade here
this tan is just so fun to work in with
the burgundy colors might
that is kind of an unlikely pairing but
they work awesome like to use this in
the deepest part of your crease and then
blend upward with that it's great but a
couple of color pop shades that are kind
of new to me that are also really just
standing out to me as being fun to play
with one is called shark attack and it's
this gorgeous coral look at how that
catches the light so there's a swatch of
that and if you're not familiar with the
color pop shadows you know they are a
consistency all their own they're almost
a little bit mousse like you press down
into them at a light touch you might
just think oh that's a really pigmented
powder but when you really press into
them or swirl into them you can tell
that there's a creamy consistency
happening there as well I love the way
that you set so you don't have to feel
the need to top them with anything the
staying power has been really awesome
for me so just to illustrate what I'm
talking about with this look today I use
that cashmere bunny shade in the crease
I went up above it with a combo of both
of these nice warm shades and then all
over the lid I used this color right
here shark attack and it's just giving
that fun summery coral pop another crazy
gorgeous color pop shade is this shade
called millionaire look at that bronzy
goodness i've swatched it out here so
you can see more of the sparkle in this
shade it's gorgeous
this kind of shadow is a way for those
of you who don't really like playing
with color that much but you want to
jazz up your look take a neutral like
this and just experiment with a
different texture or finish because this
is so fun just dabbed right on the lid
and I literally dab these shades on my
lid with my finger and then maybe blend
back into the crease a little bit just
so everything's looking kind of finished
another eye product so excited about
this mascara you may have seen my rave
review on the Express channel but
covergirl super sizer love I am really
not a person who falls in love with new
mascaras left and right but I liked this
from the first stroke onto my lashes I
could tell something awesome was
happening here and it's a cool design
for the brush because it's actually flat
on two sides like here you see how flat
that is and then I turn it this way you
see the spiky bristles but you put the
flat side up against the bay
severe lashes and it laced some product
down and then you kind of comb through
with the longer bristled edge I've been
so pleasantly surprised with how great
it looks just after one coat that's
really all I need and what's really
important about this too it keeps the
lashes feeling nice and soft and
flexible yet it also holds the curl
I have those straight everybody do it
with me downward pointing like this and
so I really really like what this does
for my eyes and finally just to wrap
things up a bunch of lip products that
I'm enjoying right now one of them
colour-pop lippie stix right along with
the color pop eyeshadows I'm having fun
with the lippie stix as well again there
are so many shades and I've had so much
fun experimenting it's been hard to
narrow it down to one favorite but one
kind of more basic shade that I find I'm
reaching for when I just want a base
color going on something that gives me
kind of that neutral nude look all over
the lips matte finish and then I can
dress it up however I choose and that is
the shade called cookies so I will
swatch this out for you here it really
looks great just on its own you know I
mean you can see how that's such a
wearable color it's not too tan it's not
too pink but it's still definitely I
think comes under the heading of nude
for me and it's matte without being
drying so I'm loving these I also love
just how skinny these are because then
you never really lose the precision with
something like this next year I'm gonna
mention a little more rosy a little less
nude but is the kind of shade that I
think of working for like any
professional setting if you're a nurse
if you're a teacher if you're whoever I
see this just looking so finished and
really completes a look and it's the
Rimmel Kate Moss lasting finish in the
black tube so it's not in the matte line
but the number is zero eight so there's
that shade right there I have gotten
lots of use out of this just maintain
that little bit of shine you can kind of
see it catching the light as I move my
hand but I think that is just so
beautiful
something I'm wearing in this video I've
been trying out all kinds of shades in
the makeup forever Plexiglas line like
seriously I've got the whole box of them
they were sent to me I think I posted a
picture on insta
I've been wondering like how am I gonna
get all of these shades out there to
everybody how am I gonna show everything
and I think what I'll do is probably on
my blog just split it up by color family
sort of and just periodically post some
lip swatches on there I think I did that
with like the Milani color statement
lipsticks quite a while back I'm really
happy that I'm liking the formula and
I'm loving the applicator with these the
first shade I pulled out of the box is
actually one that I've worn quite a bit
lately
shade I want to throw in my bag because
I feel like it won't look off no matter
what the rest of my makeup look or what
my outfit is and it's number 204 this is
what I have on my lips today as well I
actually put this on over cookie but
it's so opaque that really you're not
seeing any cookie through this I almost
think of it as like a soft red but a
little bit of neutral happening to you
know it's not too bright look at this
applicator instead of being like a
rounded applicator it's actually got
kind of an edge to it and it's an edge
that makes it very easy to get a super
defined look on the outside of your lip
line and this really comes in handy with
the brighter more bold shades you can
absolutely take it right out to the edge
and feel like you're getting a line
practically and the shape was what I
wanted to mention because I think if you
wanted to splurge and get just one of
these glosses this is the kind of shade
I think a person might wear over and
over again because it's the kind of
shade I'm wanting to wear all the times
enough color to light up the face but
not too much color to interfere with
other aspects of your look also just
because it's summertime I'm not saying
goodbye to my berry shades you guys I am
loving a good berry lip and bronzy eye
and face these are a couple of the
glazed lip paints that came out in the
later collections remember there was
that first round of glazed lip pains
I've got temped here this was what I was
wearing in my last video and also this
shade called daring the outer packaging
here is very accurate I think to what
these two shades are and kind of the
differences between them this one has a
little more purple to it
cooler lighter this one has the
potential to go very very dark
and it almost has a little bit of a
brick red thing going if you were just
gonna get one of these I would probably
go for this shade called tempt because
there's such a range you can lay this on
very thick this is very much
characteristic of the OCC lip tars as
well you know you can put them on thick
and this can be dark as heck it can be
like that dark on your lips but you can
wear it a little softer like I was in
the other video and it looks more like a
berry but you want to apply these with a
lip brush they do have the squeezy tube
there but I'm just gonna swatch them out
here for you you can see as i shear this
shade out looking like a classic berry
right and the staying power with these
is so good
but then I lay a little more on see how
dark you can potentially make it there's
daring see it's a little more purpley
mob still very wearable but less of a
classic berry and a little more purple
thrown in so that is my best in beauty
