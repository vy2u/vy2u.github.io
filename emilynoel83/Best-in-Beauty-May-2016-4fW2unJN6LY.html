here for my best in beauty video for the
month of May and I have some awesome
favorites this month I have a few body
type things a lot of eye and lip couple
random little face products to mention
too so sort of arranged but not quite as
much of a range as I had last month when
I chose to put them all into a get ready
with me style video still gonna do it
get ready with me probably in the very
near future but I just didn't really
have the vast amount and varied types of
products in my favorites this month like
I did then but I'm very very excited
about these things I'm gonna jump right
in and tell you about my lashes these
lashes are so amazing they're the salon
perfect it's a five pack it says the go
glam multi pack and they're labeled as
615 I think these are just the greatest
thing and they kind of go against the
style of lash that I normally go for
which is very like swooped out kind of
cat eye at the outer edge these as you
can see the length is longer in the
center and they're just super wispy and
light I'm on my second pair I'm wearing
them now and I just think they're
gorgeous something about the length
being in the center of the eye it really
just widens and opens up the eye when
you're wearing them so I got mine at
Walmart where it appears salon perfect
is going through a packaging makeover
normally remember it was like
blue-and-white packaging and now it's
black and pink so look for these they're
the 6:15 s go glam multi pack and they
had other styles too but these I am just
I love them so much I'm having a major
drugstore eye palette moment right now I
am just really getting into some of
these different palettes and I have
mentioned I believe it would have been
my Milani top 5 bottom 5 video I said I
had this earthy elements palette from
Milani it's a great little like really
warm sunny eye palette mix of matte and
shimmer gorgeous tones in there and I
had said you know I wasn't really
ranking it because this was the only one
I had tried so shortly after that video
I went in search of some of the other
shades that were available and first off
the line I don't like it holding out on
us because I know there's a plum and I
know there's a
really colorful one and apparently those
don't get stopped in store at least I
couldn't find him anywhere where I live
but I did find the must-have neutrals
which I am wearing today and I gotta say
just amazing quality getting to see um
how a matte black performs in these
palettes I'm totally sold these are like
the original original Milani formulas
way back when I would have started
youtube and the shadows were about yay
big bout the size of like a Mack shadow
sold as singles incredible quality I
mean there were like high-end shadows
being found in the drugstore and people
were nuts over them they had a lot of
shimmery formulas in those little
singles and I swear they have put it out
again in any of the shimmers that I see
in these palettes I'm like yes that
feels exactly like the old Milani
shadows did and then they've got some
great mattes as well that black is
fabulous today I'm wearing I did a
little pop of the shimmery shade on the
lid and a little bit of this shade on
the inner corner but a lot of the matte
black and brown just in the crease in
the outer corner and just amazing
intensity great blend ability with those
and then I also picked up the smokey
essentials palette this has like a
couple of really fun blue tones when I
did this look might have been last week
or the week before I kept the bluish pop
on the lower lash line and I use the
black and you know some of these matte
neutrals up top and again the softness
of these shadows the pigmentation the
mix of matte and shimmer just a great
variety that you can get in any of these
so these were the only ones I could find
in store there was one more neutral
palette that they had technically in
stock but it was sold out and it was I
think a little bit warmer take on this
style of palette but I still think on
the earthy elements by far is going to
be your most like warm option with that
terracotta brown that pretty orangie
shade so I am loving these I say snatch
them up if you find them in your stores
but they also are being sold on Milani
cosmetics calm but isn't it so exciting
to see drugstore brands really bringing
it and putting out some great quality
eye palettes another one I'm loving is
my turn I don't know why I just hit it
like
my covergirl trublend true naked roses
palette the shadows are so soft if
you've tried the Maybelline eye studio
quads if you've tried some of the sort
of newer packaged covergirl eyeshadow
quads those are this kind of formula so
it's really soft very pigmented I also
have the bronze one and/or the Gold's
and just the nudes one which I need to
use more of those but the Roses is
definitely like my top pick out of those
and it's great for even a summery look
you know you can wear the rosy shades on
your eyes wear a pink lip bronze up the
skin looks really nice speaking of
bronzers I talked about some great
bronzers and blushes in my top summer
blushes and bronzers video that I posted
very recently so I'm not really
including those in here just because I
don't want to be super repetitive and I
really love everything that was in that
video so just check that out head on
over there everything's a drugstore just
some really great options for the summer
glow type look but a couple of kind of
random face products I'm going to throw
out there in this video I swear I don't
just love this because it looks like a
panda bear it's so cute it says pandas
dreams so cool eyes stick and I really
did just kind of sit this around for a
while like I just added over by the
mirror like I'm content to just have
this sitting here it's like a figurine
and then I really started using it and
I'm like whoa this is actually a legit
like really good product so you've got
this stick here it's very smooth and
slick and it's very cooling like when
you immediately put this on the under
eye area and I'll do it like after a
shower it feels that you get the best
impact where you get out of the shower
because your skin is kind of warm and
then BAM the contrast of this cool stick
feels so nice
or you know you can do it first thing in
the morning you'll really notice it then
I have a tendency of starting to put it
on and then I just keep going back and
forth back and forth as you continue
doing that you will lose a little bit of
the cooling sensation because you know
you just keep doing it and that's not
necessary but it just feels good but I'm
saying just right at the onset
you immediately swipe this on the under
eye you really feel some cooling very
likely some deep puffing I don't always
get super puffy in the under eye area
but I really see this doing something
for me because it really does leave some
moisture behind I don't know that it's
quite to the extent where I would say
this replaces an eye cream or something
like that like I would go over it with
an eye cream but just try this out like
sweep it on first thing like make it be
the first thing that touches your face
before moisturizers before anything else
and it will feel so cool I haven't been
like putting it on over makeup I've been
doing it strictly as like a no makeup
skincare step but it's really really
nice it came from Ulta I can't remember
if I got it in store or on the website
but make sure you get these so cool I
stick because I think there might be
another thing that looks like this but
these so cool I stick is the one I'm
talking about
how can you say no to that like I just
kind of want him to hang out in the
background maybe he could just chill up
there for the rest of their you know
several awesome lip products one just
shade in particular that I am so so
drawn to you know it's pink it's maybe
got that little bit of orange a warmth
to it but just a hint I'm not saying
this is an orange but it's just such a
fun color and it's from Too Faced
it's one of their matte la creme
lipsticks and the shade is called
Bachelorette by the way who's watching
The Bachelor at this season yes I
watched that and I thoroughly
entertained by this season so far anyway
I love this shade I think it really
brightens up the face it is truly mad
it's not one of those matte lipsticks
where you have to kind of blot away
product before it actually starts
looking matte and another reason why if
I do choose to go mad on my lips I'm
kind of preferring a lipstick form
rather than a liquid lipstick because
the lipstick states so much more true to
color so when you put it on you know it
looks like you expected it to look out
of the tube a lot of the liquid
lipsticks I've been trying like I'll put
them on and they darken by a good like
three to four shades another couple of
shades that I'm pretty sure I've
mentioned before but I've been wearing
them a lot my Mac huggable lip color in
the shade bear hug this is the beautiful
soft shiny pink there's a swatch right
there it's
definitely like a lighter shinier take
on the type of shade I'm wearing now and
a little more orange in it really
comfortable on the lips smells amazing I
already love the smell of MAC lipsticks
but this is maybe even a little bit
sweeter I want to mention the lip color
I think everybody should own and I have
mentioned this a lot and this might be
one of my most used lip products just
period and it's the l'oreal glossy balm
the shade is called lovely mocha it is
the perfect just your lips but better
type of color let me swatch I think this
is what I threw on in my last tutorial
that I did look at how perfect that is
you know it's the easy no-brainer
super comfortable comes in that jumbo
stick format so I love that there's no
shimmer in it it's just nicely shiny and
it's just that perfect ma vie neutral
shade the only thing that I might be
able to pick out with this product is
that it doesn't have amazing staying
power and it doesn't really claim to be
long wearing although I wouldn't say it
immediately vanishes from the lips
either it doesn't feel like a really
greasy slide off your lips type product
but I really see this type of shade is
something that would look good on
absolutely anyone so L'Oreal glossy balm
lovely mocha snatch it up can you tell I
feel strongly about these lip products
this month I tell you I've got three
body products that I want to mention
first off this is the dial yes
dial body wash which could there be like
a more practical brand in the body care
lineup you know in your drugstore but
it's the miracle oil restoring body wash
it's marula oil infused and yes we are
down to the bottom with this bub and I
use this a lot we've also got some in
our guest bathroom we've had a lot of
people staying with us lately friends
and family and on multiple occasions
with no prompting people have brought up
the fact that this stuff smells amazing
and just feels awesome so it's gotten
rave reviews I'm interested to hear if
any of y'all who have stayed with me
have gone out and bought this stuff but
it smells so like it's a little floral
but it's also um kind of got fruitiness
to it
very fresh and clean feeling as well I
think bub seems to enjoy using this just
as much as I do but there's something
about the texture of the body wash it
looks like just a body gel and don't be
too thrown off by the fact that it's oil
infused because it's not a body oil
either it's definitely more like shower
gel but it's got this added slip to it
when you feel it on the skin it's like
it's slicker than a normal shower gel
and yet it still lathers up it rinses
clean but it does leave your skin really
nice and soft the scent experience is
wonderful so this stuff I gotta say it's
not just me it's not just Tyler many
other people have said they enjoy that
do also I've got to tell you I was
tweeted that the tree hut has got some
rose stuff out they have a scrub the
scrub was sold out where I looked for
this but I found the tree hut Shea body
butter in the Moroccan rose it's all
about the Moroccan rose scent I smelled
this in the store and my first reaction
was I don't know that I smell a lot of
rose happening there but it smells oh it
smells unlike any other scent that I
have there's like something yummy and
almost baked like this light delicious
dessert maybe a hint of rose and just a
lot of freshness like fresh air kind of
thing mixed into it that is so strange
in my description but this is a really
great quality very nourishing body
butter I showered last night I put this
on and you know went to bed and my skin
is still feeling supremely hydrated by
this stuff and it's interesting because
it's not as thick of a body butter as
say like a body shop body butter is and
when you put your hands in them you know
the heat of your body starts to melt
them down a little bit and they end up
thinning out just fine and I like those
this is a little bit more like it feels
lotion II it kind of feels like you're
dipping into a thicker body lotion and
then when you blend it out on your skin
you're like well the moisture is really
sticking you know it doesn't just
immediately go SHhhh you know into your
skin and then you feel like you didn't
put anything on it really stays
the scent is just amazing and the other
day I put a little bit of this Bath and
Body Works pear berry spray on top of it
I came downstairs and bub was just he
mentioned it multiple times how good I
smelled with this these scents on and I
just had a little bit of the pear berry
so I think it was mainly this scent
coming through but it's definitely a
two-pronged reason why I love this the
scent is so good and it is so
moisturizing so if you're spending time
in the Sun your skin is drying out more
you're spending time in a pool sometimes
that can be drying on the skin this is a
great way to kind of give back to your
skin when you're done so that is my best
in beauty for this month
oh shoot I missed one I forgot to
mention my instant age rewind in
neutralizer um the other shade is called
neutralizer you know they have these in
a range of colors they've got the pinky
kind of brightening one I realized that
the neutralizer is so so good for me
when I want to brighten this area that's
what I'm wearing today I you can see it
in action in my last tutorial and I will
still correct my under-eye area for the
dark circles with like my peachy
correctors and stuff like that but this
is like just the right amount of shades
up from my skin tone that it really I
think does a good job of brightening
without being too white you know it's if
it's that realistic level of brightness
so I just kind of sponge it on and I
also like that it's matte basically you
know it doesn't have a bunch of shine in
it so I can control where I want the
shine I can put this on and blend it out
I can set it with powder if I want to
and then I can put shine wherever I want
with my highlights you know this isn't
like one of those shimmery spot lighting
type products it's truly just taking the
sections of my skin that I want to lift
and bring forward and it does it so yay
now I'm really done thank you guys for
watching I appreciate your time I
appreciate all your kindness it really
means so much to me and I will see you
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
