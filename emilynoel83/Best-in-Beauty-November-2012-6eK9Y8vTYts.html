november and this used to be shopping
list ideas I last month renamed it
because I thought it would be just a
little more identifiable for what I'm
talking about the best beauty products
over the course of the last month the
things I've been using a lot my
favorites and stuff like I feel like
I've been talking a lot lately about
great holiday palettes I've had a couple
of videos devoted strictly to the new
gift sets that are out so I'm kind of
excluding those from this video and just
talking about some other things that
I've been loving because I think it's
pretty clear in those other videos you
know what palettes I like what palettes
I don't live a lot of drugstore products
to recommend this month just some odds
and ends you know real random it seems
thing I'm going to get into is my Revlon
Photoready concealer I've talked about
this since way way back it seems since
around the time it came out I remember
trying and thinking this is a little
different from any stick concealer I've
tried the texture is just a lot creamier
it's very blendable you can blend it
with your fingers or you can use a
little like concealer brush to get just
a really flawless look but what I've
been finding this past month on my skin
is not you know as tan as maybe it tends
to be in the summer months and I really
haven't been doing much sunless tanning
either and I've just got a lazy on that
but this shade that I have light medium
has been a dead-on match for what my
skin tone is now I mean this can cover
anything this can tackle under I this
can tackle spots it just matches the
skin so perfectly like sometimes that's
what it comes down to with concealers
sometimes I feel like oh well this
concealer isn't covering as well well
maybe it's not that it can't it's not a
good coverage concealer it's just not
that perfect match right back into your
skin and I just feel like that's what
this happens to be right now and
it's just awesome so if you feel like
you're kind of my skin tone this light
medium dang it is dead on blends out any
imperfections really really well so I'm
wearing that today and I've been wearing
most days always been a fan of the
peppermint sent I think it's called
twisted peppermint that bath and
bodyworks puts out but recently i was in
walmart and i came across their version
the body ecology version um called
peppermint twist and I picked up these
two little things they were each like 99
cents and I think they were sold like
among some stocking stuffers and one is
the fragrance mist and one is the body
crees love the scent um i feel like i
enjoy it just as much as i did the
twisted peppermint and it's just a
little bit cheaper and it comes really
cute lee package these are really small
sizes but they're great for your purse
or just you know throw it in your kind
of on-the-go makeup bag and you've got a
great little cream i've been using this
mainly as a hand cream actually and it's
just so fragrant so fresh and it just
kind of gets you in the mood for the
season i'm going to do a separate
stocking stuffer video for sure this
year just talking about some great
little beauty things small beauty give
back to this video a great brush great i
brush that i've been liking a lot I've
been also getting a ton of brush related
questions lately either questions about
brush sets how to clean brushes so I
need to get on that and brush dupes
somebody had a great idea to do like I
try this not that on brushes so I'm
going to be getting on that coming up
with some ideas for you there but one
big question I do get asked is what is a
great brush set that gives me everything
I need and I usually go with the Sigma
essential kit because I feel like that's
what i use the most of from the face
brushes to the eye brushes it's kind of
like all encompassed there is one brush
outside that collection that I'm always
reaching for and it would be just a
great little addition to have with that
full kit and um it's like the dupe I
think the mac 217 and i'll put the
official sigma name down there because
i've got the old numbering on this brush
but it's like I use as like as a crease
brush it's kind of pinched at the top
here and so it can be a little bit flat
but it's also a little bit fluffy and
it's just like the perfect brush and
I've been grabbing it all the time for
my eye looks because I'm sure this has
gotten mentioned in other videos before
that I've done but
if I want something in the crease I can
use it with that flat side kind of going
sideways and get the product in there so
it's good for kind of like wedging it in
and being small enough to do that but
then I turn it more vertically and it
becomes a great blending tool so it's
placement of product but it's also
blending out the product and there is a
nice crease brush in that Sigma
essential kit and it looks like this and
I I use that a lot for just blending or
you know putting something under the
brow but this is just a little more
targeted than that and I go to it a lot
we're on eyes I know I've been palette
crazy lately I just I use a lot of
pallets but there are those days where
you're just like okay I don't want all
the options I don't want the choices I
just want to grab like one thing and
really get a minimal I'll and for me
that product that can do that for me
that I love so much is from hard candy
and it's called high maintenance
ironically it makes a very low
maintenance I look but it's the baked
eye shadows I've raved about these blogs
watched you name it I've don't know what
these shadows telling you that these are
great but this past month this has just
been kind of like that quick grab and go
thing because i feel like this light
shade gives a nice amount of sparkle and
shine but this other shade here this is
the gorgeousness it's like a a taupe
with a little bit of plump to speak like
mac language here it would be like satin
taupe with that's a with a little bit
more depth to it and just that little
hint of like a purpley plum color and
this is all I have on my eyes today I
mean I just did the light shade all over
the lid and I blended this shade with
that very brush I was explaining just
now this into the crease blended it out
and I feel like it's just perfect for
that easy quick go to look and then you
can bring the light shade that light
little highlight color right up under
the brow and it's it's natural enough
but it gives you that little bit of
shine that makes it feel like kind of a
special look so i would so recommend
checking out these it's not just this
duo but there are others that are great
far as the rest of my eyes i did just
black liquid liner on the top
um I did plum on the bottom and then I
just set that plum liner again with this
purpley shade right there on the lower
lash line love it just nuts about this
little doodle season where we're wearing
lots of like red lips and for a true red
lip I think a red lip liner is super
helpful and this one from to face their
perfect lips lip liner in perfect red
has just been great and i love this
particular shade so much that i will i
won't even go for a lipstick I'll just
fill in the hole lips with this color
compare the red and this swatch to the
red on my fingernails you see how it's a
little bit deeper and it still gives you
like real full on red lips but they're
just a like a hair deeper than like fire
engine red so I think that makes it very
flattering very wearable your teeth look
whiter with this kind of red for sure I
were to come up with like a drugstore
dupe for this this is very close to a
Rimmel exaggerated lip liner in ravish
it's been like my favorite red lip liner
but I ran out and i happen to have this
so this is what i've been using wearing
it right now but this is just very
creamy very easy to wear and if you're
looking for that thing that can give you
that nice clean line for a red lipstick
or just use it on its own this is great
as for what i am wearing on my lips
right now and you saw this in my last
tutorial but it's the Revlon lip butter
and sugar plum I've been loving Revlon
lip butters I think they've been out for
maybe a little over a year now and I've
been loving them for the past year but
this is one that I hadn't picked up
until um maybe a month or so ago and I
think it's just a really beautiful color
I've got it on my lips like I said and
here's a swatch I really messy so much
let's clean that up a little bit there
but it's nice and shiny um kind of berry
plum it's not shimmery it's just a
straight-up creamy lip butters time
around I topped that with a Neutrogena
lip gloss in very fit and so that's just
a creamy berry lip gloss coordinates
perfectly with the lip butter and um I'm
liking that look right now it butters I
mean I've just I liked him from the
start and I haven't stopped like I'm a
little cheek combo to tell you guys
about
it's kind of interesting how things come
in and out of our quote unquote
favorites I mean I feel like sometimes
you first try something maybe you didn't
love it then you came back to it and it
became like just the thing you were
looking for and that's kind of my story
with benefit Dallas this was initially
probably one of the box powders that I
liked better out of their whole
collection I feel like they're solid
colors are a lot of times better than
the ones that are like multiple shades
swirled all together I got in depth on a
blog on this one day but this one is
described as dusty sunset plum powders
played into my new sort of obsession
with combining multiple blush shades so
I'll take like a little bit of this with
my ankle brush go right in here deepens
up that cheekbone area i'm not using it
really as a full-on contour in fact i
already contoured with some bronzer but
just that little added depth of this
color this is very pretty and i can't
quite describe it is a little bit
plumbing it's a little bit new time just
going to this all the time regardless of
the more pop of color blush that i'll
put more on the apple of my cheek this
is that kind of blush that I'm putting
down in here and I'm just loving that if
end for more of a colorful blush and
this is still pretty soft but this is
covergirl cheekers in pretty peach this
is the first blush not this exact would
but this is the first shade of blush I
ever used I remember my mom used this
for years she still uses this people
were asking in the video with her that I
posted the other day what blessed she
was wearing this was it there's no
glitter in it it may have just a slight
satiny finish not 100% Matt but I think
that's perfect i think it looks great on
i'm wearing it today and it's just kind
of like an unidentifiable blush you
could put it with a red lip and it would
look great you could put up with this
kind of lip and it looks great too so
it's just kind of like that inner glow
kind of thing going on and i actually
like these two care to get depth of this
blush press plus the brightness of this
it's still kind of subtle I feel like
about anybody could wear this it's just
a universally flattering peach kind of
blood
shade with a little bit of pain I hope
you get a chance to try some of these
products I've been loving and if you
have let me know what you think of them
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
