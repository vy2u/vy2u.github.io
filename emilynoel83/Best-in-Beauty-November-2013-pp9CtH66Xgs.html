best in beauty video some of my favorite
products over the past month and I just
feel like I've been experimenting so
much with different kinds of makeup
because you know it's the holiday season
there's all the palettes and kids so I
don't really feel like I have a ton to
share in this video and I wasn't going
to just throw things in and call them
favorites if they really want it I
really think about the things that I've
been gravitating toward and using a lot
there definitely are some things that
stand out I think you can kind of tell
that the weather's changing because so
many of the things that I'm going to be
talking about pertain to hydration and
just combating the dryness this time of
year so if you need some things like
that there will be some suggestions for
you here saying is this boots number
seven primer it's called Photo Fix
wrinkle filler and primer and I feel
like this primer works so so well with
some of those foundations that I love
that give really good coverage but at
the same time might be a bit more drying
on the skin I'm thinking about cover
girls stay fabulous three in one estee
lauder double wear those are a couple
that I'm loving right now because I
absolutely love the appearance that they
give my skin you know the flawless
coverage to show you here it's creamy
white and I feel like when I put this on
after my moisturizer has had you know a
minute or two to sink it gives me that
light smooth silky feeling but yet it's
not a dry feel like it's adding just the
littlest bit of extra hydration and I
think that goes a long way with some of
those foundations that I mentioned it
does help to even out your texture
issues a little bit I think and
primarily with me I'll have little dry
spots now and then different places on
my face and I feel like this helps those
areas another thing that I know I've
mentioned before cuz i did a whole video
on this is the elf daily moisture stick
I've been reaching for this a lot more
lately and mainly making sure I have
this with me if I'm on the go because
this is a great little stick to go over
those dry areas that might look a little
cakey by the end of the day most of the
way through a day and primarily talking
about the area under your eyes i mean
you all know you'll do your makeup and
it's gonna look pretty good when you
finish it
but then later on the day things are
looking a little bit bright out so I
love taking this stick I just like swirl
my finger right over the top only that
much and then just dab it over any
visible lines anything that looks a
little dry and not only does it do away
with that issue but it feels a little
bit cooling as well which is nice and if
you've got dry patches if you've got
dryness really anywhere you could dab
some of this oh you don't really use
this as a lip balm but pretty much any
other dry skin use you can think of this
is good food just love that you can
refresh your under eyes with this and
just use that itty bitty amount and it's
not going to screw up your makeup at all
I did like a little before and after
thing with this in the video where I
featured it so you can check that out if
you really want to see the difference it
may has a great Coco Shea avocado
macadamia aloe and chamomile in people
lip products that I've been liking a lot
lately I've been trying so many fun
buried deep lip colors and a great lip
liner to use alongside those products if
you want a little extra definition is
the NYX lip liner in plus NYX lip liners
are so creamy and nice I'm great color
payoff if you're one like me who likes
to not only line your lips but fill them
in this does a good job of that as well
I also really like the knicks
retractable lip liners those have
incredible staying past has good staying
power to but the primary reason why I'm
recommending it is for the great color I
mean it's just really going to work
nicely with your berry lips just kind of
a light neutral throw it in my purse as
a touch-up type thing a kind of product
that i want to recommend that i have
reviewed also is from NYX and it's the
butter lip balm and I have it in the
shade called where is it brown might
even call it like a your lips but better
shape there's a ginormous what do I nice
watch that but it really looks pretty on
the lips it adds just a little bit of
like a neutral pink tone to make it very
wearable it's like regardless of the eye
look you threw on regardless of the
cheek this looks appropriate and not to
miser also not very like slick greasy
shiny lip balms either there's just a
hint of thickness to that the shade
called brownie is just a great little
like Rosie basic that I
think anybody could work with somebody
had tweeted me or facebook me saying you
have a lot of nick's favorites you
should just do a knicks favorites video
and i think i should if you guys want to
see it i will totally do it because i
just have so many things that i'm really
loving from there's no I've talked about
this before but if this isn't worthy of
being a favorites video I don't know
what is because I've used it at the end
of like every time I've done my makeup
lately and it's the dewy finish
long-lasting setting spray I love the
finish this gives my skin once I've done
my powder and my foundation my blush and
my bronzer and I just want a really nice
skin like finish just do a couple
spritzes of this I just spray it sort of
right up in the air let it fall down on
my face get myself a look maybe do one
more spray after this is just phenomenal
and you may think especially if your
oily or you use a lot of like mattifying
things like ooh I don't want to get
something that's Dewey isn't that like
counterintuitive if you're like me you
really like the coverage that those
mattifying products give so you don't
want to give that up but yet you want to
kind of balance things out once you get
done with your makeup so this is a great
way to do that I love it well I've been
doing like different I looks using
different I products pretty much every
single day when I go to line my
waterline something that I have been
reaching for a lot is from em cosmetics
that's Michelle fonz makeup line and if
you watched my full review video you
know this was one of the outstanding
products that I tried me I tried the big
old pallet I tried different things that
she had now months after first trying
everything this is the thing that stays
around that i'm using a lot it's the
water liner intense color eyeliner in
black nine this is called water liner
because it is supposed to be able to
last a really long time in your
waterline i totally feel like it does
it's right up there with my Malley liner
I really need to do is like a I to I
comparison with this on one waterline
and my malli ever color automatic
waterproof liner on the other that's
another one that works amazingly well
and this one is right up there with it
it does have a little smudger tip on the
end love using this across my upper lash
line because I don't feel like it has
the creamiest smoothest glide as some
other liners
goes in fine on the inner rim and I've
said this before but sometimes those
liners that aren't the rich and creamy
'used somehow they cling a little bit
better I think to the waterline so
that's why this one and the Malley one
works so well lastly I would probably
have to call this my most like
groundbreaking favorite of this video
like this is such such a great find for
me and it's the Carol's Daughter monoi
repairing hair mask I don't know how
many of you out there are familiar with
this brand but this came in the allure
full beauty box you can of course get it
on its own other places I'll put some
links below past few weeks my ends have
been drier than ever I mean I don't
think my hair has ever been this dry at
the ends and so I love experimenting
with the different deep conditioners I
know one that I've talked about most
recently like really loving is the one
from the bomb that one works well but
this one I don't think I've ever tried
to deep conditioner that works as well
as this what's my hair dried after the
first time I used it in the shower I was
like whoa this feels like new hair from
there on out I didn't notice it drying
out as quickly so this has become my
once a week thing that I do for my hair
and I basically just shampoo my hair
when I get in the shower I take a big
glob of this I don't know exactly how
much but I basically make sure that the
whole like bottom half of my hair is
coated and the last thing I do before I
get out is I rinse this so this has
maybe a good I don't know five six seven
minutes in my hair just sitting there's
I've been using this I haven't been
putting in like other serum type things
or oils in my hair or anything like that
to add hydration I mean this has been it
and I've just been so so impressed with
how it's warm times when you're using
hair products the differences in your
hair are so subtle it's almost hard to
pick up on but this was something that
was like a totally clear difference in
my hair is this like big enough it can
become like a little bongo drum before
you know if i need to stop now thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this best in beauty video and I
will see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
