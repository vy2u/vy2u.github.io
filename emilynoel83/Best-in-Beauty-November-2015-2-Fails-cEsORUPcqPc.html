in my business in this video but I'm
still not sure if it's right to be
honest so last video I did I made some
adjustments I added in an extra light
wasn't a hundred percent pleased with it
so it's just going to be a little trial
and error but its best in beauty for
November so yeah I've got some things to
talk about here some interesting little
things some unusual product combinations
before I get into the really fun stuff
I'm going to talk about this because
I've had a few deep zits lately like the
ones that are kind of painful even when
you're not touching them you can feel
that they're there and they're just
waiting to rear their ugly heads but
having to deal with these has prompted
me to rediscover the best zit product
out there and it's clean and clear Percy
jelton I've had this on hand for so many
years not this exact tube but you know
I've been using it for a good long while
it's a 10% benzoyl peroxide acne
medication and I just use it like a spot
treatment on any zits you know when you
know they're coming when you can feel
them coming on you put some of this on
there basically what I feel like it does
is it speeds up the lifespan of the zit
like instead of it sitting there and
festering on your that that's an awful
word I think the word fester why did I
say that so it's good stuff it's
drugstore I've used it for years and I
really like it let's talk problem area
number two for Emily right now dark
under eyes and I want to mention my
benefit erase paste I am always in this
continual rotation of the peachy tone
correctors on the under eye like if
there's a day that I go not wearing a
peachy corrector I feel like I can
always see more darkness but one that
really has been getting better and
better for me and I think I've realized
why this time of year is my benefit
erased pace this is like Holy Grail
amazing concealer but I feel like as my
skin tone has lightened up a little bit
the peachy pigment in this product is
able to go even further for me and be
even more corrective and a lot of times
I'm recommending this product and
singing its praises and whatnot but I'm
rarely mentioning that I wear this in
number two medium and I do think that's
important because you might think with
my skin tone maybe I'm gonna go for the
lightest version but the medium is
really so richly peachy and it really
does a good job on the bluish tone or
even reddish toned under-eye circles
use it on age spots basically any kind
of dark skin discoloration that you
might be experiencing this is really
good but the number two the medium think
about that if you've tried this and
maybe you've been using the light and
feel like it hasn't had enough of an
impact the medium so that's like a go to
daily concealer step but I also want to
talk about like a concealer that's nice
to use if you want full-on brightening
like if you enjoy baking your concealer
which I did that today and I do that now
and then not every day and by that I
mean putting on my concealer blending it
out topping it with a healthy amount of
powder and just kind of letting that
powder sit and the end result once you
sort of dust away some of the powder is
a really smooth finish
ideally good coverage just a flawless
looking under-eye area primarily for me
that's the area where I'll do it but a
surprisingly good concealer for that
method or just a good spreadable
concealer that'll go over a large
portion of skin if you like to really
highlight and brighten is from makeup
revolution I got this little palette
it's the ultra cover and concealer
palette in light/medium and this
contains a lot of shades that are a
little lighter than my skin tone I can
tell by looking at bounced around
through like all of them I know I used
these two down here quite a bit but I'll
go into these with this little brush
from Real Techniques it's called the
pointed foundation brush I kind of liked
something flat for just spreading it all
out and then I may just tap over it with
my finger to really blend it in so okay
it's a concealer palette what's special
about it
I think what's special about it is that
they're so creamy they may not be the
fullest coverage concealers I've ever
used
however they're not super thick and dry
and hard to blend they're creamy they're
a little thinner but not too thin they
never look thick on the skin they
actually look very natural
skin-like once you blend them in so
under the eyes down the nose any high
points of the face you want to brighten
might consider that it's a pretty big
deal but it's gonna be the kind of thing
that I want to set with something and I
thought this might be a good opportunity
to update you guys on the by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder my super
expensive loose setting powder type
product that has like hyaluronic acid
microspheres that are going to erase all
your lines and your pores and just make
you look super flawless they say I've
used this in so many ways and I told you
when I first bought it that I was
struggling with the best application
method it's truly the lightest weight
powder I have ever owned it goes
airborne so easily sticking any kind of
brush into this I feel like really makes
it go poof and I feel like I'm just
wasting powder but just next-level light
and silky and so when I was first
talking about this I got a lot of great
suggestions from you guys in the
comments section for how to best apply
it and control this powder and two that
have worked really well for me I've been
taking like a slightly damp Beauty
Blender and getting some of this on I'll
like tap it into the cap first get a
little bit of powder on and then Pat it
on let's say the under eye if that's the
area I'm looking to set but I think
probably my favorite thing to use is a
flat foundation brush so I tap again a
little bit into the cap I pick it up
with my foundation brush and if I'm
baking I'll take a pretty generous
amount of it and I will just tap it over
my concealer on the under-eye I'll also
tap it around my nose area because it
can be good for camouflaging the pores
and in those two areas those places that
can be problems owns for many of us this
does really well um it does really well
for the long haul like later in the day
because I can do the baking method and
feel like immediately things look
fabulous and it's so nice and smooth and
perfect on the under-eye let's say and
then I like catch a look at my skin in
the rearview mirror or just in some
really harsh daylight daytime lighting
and I'm like you know like I don't like
that look can you start looking crepey
and bad and
this looks so fresh I was I was honestly
shocked it really does kind of fill the
lines and I'm a very facially expressive
person especially when dealing with a
baby you know I'm scrunching my face all
over and I was so surprised at how well
this did over fine line areas in the
under eye
also really great around pores in the
nose area and sides of the nose so this
does seem to be delivering on some of
its claims and I have been using it like
I said so so much here but now what this
is kind of making me want to do is go
back to some similar powders that I have
that are a little less pricey and maybe
do some side by sides and see how well
they do later in the day couple things
about this powder this does not add
coverage this does not also add
brightness sometimes that's what people
want with a powder like if they're doing
the baking method or just what just
sucked in a whole bunch of air there
that was not pleasant but sometimes you
want whatever powder you're putting on
top of concealer to do something extra
for you and with this the two things
that I think it does are number one it
smooths out any tacky finish that you
have so it really makes your skin feel
nice and silky and it also lessens the
look of any uneven texture if you've got
little bumpy's and lines on the under
eye for example large pores things like
that it lessens the look of those things
but it's not gonna add coverage and it's
not going to really brighten in those
respects it really is like a true
translucent powder it doesn't go on your
skin looking white rediscovered thing
Revlon skin lights I remember doing a
happy dance when these were like
re-released was it a year or so ago and
then they kind of worked their way into
the back of my highlight drawer and
didn't come out to play for a while but
they're back now each light is kind of
my main man right now but I also have
bear light bear light is something that
I'll use more on tops of the cheekbones
it's very subtle these aren't like
shimmery super sparkly but they just add
a nice little bit of glow while bear
light is subtle it creates a little bit
more of a contrast with the skin but
peach light the way I like to use this
either with a small stipple brush or
just my ELF angled blush brush I'll
squeeze out a bit and these are nice
little oops can I open it
squeezy tubes squeezed out like a drop
or two on the hand spread it out first
dab into it with a brush and then what I
did was just patted it exactly over
where I put my blush and I feel like I
get a little more glow going there it's
subtle it's fun it doesn't look like an
extra layer of powder topped on the skin
and I think I think I have more to say
on liquid highlights so I think that
maybe a whole new video in general lip
products I kind of talk lip products to
death a couple videos ago where I was
mentioning for new ish lines of
drugstore lip products and the certain
shades that I'm loving from each one I
have lip liners lipsticks just really
really great products I lip swatch them
all out I think all of those count as
favourites material but if I had to pick
maybe one that I'm just kind of
especially head-over-heels for from that
video it would probably be my Bert
speeds lipstick and Russert River really
beautiful deep shade it's kind of like a
brick red you know dark red but with a
healthy amount of brown thrown into it
the packaging on these is so cute so
yeah they've got me wanting more but
these are comfortable these aren't super
shiny on the lips there's no shimmer in
them but they just don't have like a
glossy finish by any means they're
really nice if your lips have been a
little bit chapped lately and doesn't
travel outside my lip line which I like
and like I was saying in the video this
dark shade whenever I put it on I feel
like my eyes just go pop what I've got
it on so resset Ripper major gold star
for you and in like the sassy salty mood
today I don't know what to do with
myself in case anybody was wondering
another much-loved lip product that I'm
wearing in this video is the Revlon
Ultra HD in seduction so you got your
wand applicator here with this one and
yeah nice matte wearable nude not too
nude nude but not too nude love that
characteristic in a lip product and
another lip kit that I had mentioned in
my gift picks video I have a huge gift
picks recommendations thing put it out
on Black Friday it's like my tip top
pallets and gift set recommendations and
one of the lips sets that I talked about
was from colour-pop and it was their
full-size lippie stix and one particular
shade that I think is really fun from
that set is called last call it's a
cream formula and it's like a winter
pink soft mauve very cool kind of
similar to the look I've got on my lips
right now actually very wearable for
this time of year kind of surprising I
just really loved all the kind of
unexpected in different shades in that
kit I mentioned at the start that I had
some good product combos I'm real proud
of myself for discovering this one and
you guys I think you're gonna love this
I know I've talked about how much I love
the soap &amp;amp; Glory sugar crush body butter
cream this smells like line this smells
like a margarita ice cream float I've
never actually had one of those but when
I smell it that's what it's gonna smell
like what I do have one other people
have told me this smells like sprite or
you know one of those citrusy pops or
sodas and I see that I can I can get
where they're coming from but I feel
like it's still got something kind of
vanilla ish mixed in with it so really
lightweight but still moisturizing body
cream here love putting it on after the
shower but you guys I found the ideal
body spray to mix with this for you to
make yourself into cranberry lime and
you might not think you even want to go
there
but you do because it's this crazy for
cranberry spray from Marc or maybe you
know of another like cranberry body mist
that's out there I don't know if Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works had what has one but this is
the one that I have and it's awesome
layered together like Tyler and I could
not believe how good I was smelling what
is the cocktail that contains both
cranberry and lime
cranberry one cocktail that's all I'm
seeing here I thought there was a like a
fun name for a cocktail with cranberry
line anyway if you like smelling fruity
and sweet with just a little bit of bite
and a little bit of something
interesting and also kind of something
that gets me in the mood for holidays
for whatever reason these two together
and I'm going to go
ahead and just pat myself on the back
for that right now I have a couple of
little duds here this pain in the butt
duo brush on adhesive I think I
mentioned it in a haul how it's similar
to the Revlon precision lash glue but a
little different it's a little thinner
but overall not too terribly different
well when you have to use this
consistently for a month
lash application after lash application
you start to become very in tune with
the nuances of why this is not a great
lash glue it's too thin and after at
least a month's time it's not really
thickening up for me when I go across
the lash band it like beads up instead
of giving me one continuous like nice
little sweeping of glue it's just it
beads up and then I got to go back get
more out try to build it up do something
so I can get even inconsistent lash glue
application when I don't go the extra
mile to do that they will start to come
off like they'll loosen up faster on the
inner corners or maybe just right in the
middle and stores in my area always seem
kind of inconsistent with having the
Revlon precision lash glue in stock the
two that seem to always have it I'm not
always there all the time so I think I
might just make an order off of like
drugstore calm I'm pretty sure they
always have it another mention here and
this was so sad these are adorable okay
these colour-pop they're the double
ended with a lippy stick on one end and
a lip liner on the other it's a little
holiday set and there are five of them
in here and I think this one is actually
sold out but if you have these or if you
receive these this is just a public
service announcement be very careful
when you pull the cap off especially on
the liner side but several of these I
could tell that the little liner stick
the little lip liner stick was loose in
the product and I thought okay I'm gonna
have to be careful err that's gonna fly
out well time passes a few days go by
and I'm forgetting to be careful I take
this cap off I go up and the liner I
still haven't found it the whole stick
of liner I mean I can twist up nothing
it
completely gone out of this one this
happens to be the shade called Tootsie I
looked I didn't know if it flew into a
box or a bag or if it's somewhere on the
carpet just waiting to get ground into
the floor by a toddler or a cat or a
human I don't like thinking about that
but I don't know where it is it's like
knowing there's a spider in your room
but not knowing where it is and like I
said several of them in the kit I
noticed them being loose so you want to
be like real soft and gentle as you take
that off it's unfortunate because I
think this is an awesome little set you
may have noticed I didn't mention any
eye palettes right now because I'm
really bouncing all over the place using
different ones I happen to use my busy
art palettes both the matte and the
sultry news one in this look which I
have full reviews on those in another
video if you want to see the full scoop
but I did like a navy blue smokey eye
today and I was pretty happy with the
way it turned out so anyways I'll let
you guys go thank you for watching and
I'll see you later
