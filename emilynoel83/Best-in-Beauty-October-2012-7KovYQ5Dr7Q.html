products with you and things I've really
been loving a lot over the past month
and I've really got kind of a
well-rounded group of products in this
video without even really thinking about
it I've got some face products some eye
stuff some lips tell ways love watching
these kinds of videos they kind of
remind me of like the the editors
favorite section of a magazine like if
I've got a fashion or beauty type
magazine that's always the first place I
go see what makeup products they liked
for the month um but for me my first
thing I'm going to tell you about is
this elf eyebrow kit this is from the
elf Studio line it was $3 I got mine at
Target but you could definitely get this
at eyes lips face com if you don't have
access at your target my shade is medium
and this is an interesting little
product because what you have here is
like a tinted wax that you can use to
fill in your brows and also a nice matte
powder so it comes with this little
applicator and I actually use the
applicator as well and that has let me
show you here has a little angled tip so
it's kind of like an angled liner brush
and then the other side is just like a
small brush that might seem like it's a
sponge tip but that's actually a little
brush and what I do is I just go into
the wax part first with the angled side
and I'll just go through and kind of
fill in my brows a little bit I don't
have eyebrows that really need a whole
lot of like reconstructing like they're
pretty thick brows to begin with but
sometimes it's just a matter of evening
out you know from one side to the other
just any places that are a little more
sparse and so this is just a really nice
little tinted gel wax feeling Prada take
the other end which is that little bitty
brush and I go into the powder and then
I just go through and top it off and I
feel like you get a really natural
looking finish that way I only talked
about this a lot but I'm just going to
mention it again because it has been
like probably the only kind of lashes
I've worn for about the past month and
they are the salon perfect lashes and
they're called Deni wispies and I know
our del probably makes the same exact
style but they look like this this is a
4-pack that I
at Walmart and cupcake has just jumped
on the table but I just love the style
the shape of them how they're a little
flared out at the ends I'm wearing them
now and I just love these lashes I think
they are nice because they're not cut
like as blunt you know they really have
kind of a natural hair like look with a
mix of shorter and lashes and longer
lashes on the strip I haven't even
touched the bottom pair yet and I've had
this for quite a while so you can
definitely reuse your lashes I have a
blog post all about how you can do that
next a really great blush and the
packaging is super cute as well it's
from the balm and it's called hot mama
and if you look at the girl there on the
front I mean she's got her little
maracas her red bikini
I mean flower in her hair ready to party
but the blush inside is really really
nice as well and this is kind of like a
peachy coral blush with a great little
bit of golden shimmer I don't feel like
it looks too shimmery on the chose these
blushes from the balm I never really
paid much attention to it before but
they all are labeled as being a shadow
slash blush I don't know if you could
see that right there
not only if I've been using this as a
blush but I've been using it as a shadow
more these days so I'll just take like a
fluffy crease brush dip it in here and
you could do this with other blushes as
well but I just kind of go over this
area kind of right above my crease shade
almost to my to my eyebrow and I feel
like it warms up that area and just
gives it a better look that kind of
coordinates better with the cheek and
the lip usually then just a stark matte
highlight maybe up there just a white
light color and because I do have a lot
of space between my eye and my eyebrow
so it's kind of nice to put something up
there that gives your face a little
something extra I get some of my blushes
from the balm on HauteLook
because they're really marked out like
you can always get these at the balm
calm but usually when the ball is on
HauteLook they will offer some blushes
at a great discounted price so that's a
good way to check them out because I've
got several others that are really great
there's cabana boy and down boy and frat
boy like they're all really nice quality
blushes but hot mom is the one I've been
using a lot late
the bomb also has something that I'm
going to be probably talking about and
when I do a video on like holiday
pallets and gift sets but it is just a
killer palette love this it's the rock
star palette bomb Jovi get it Bon Jovi
Bon Jovi Angie you lift it up here the
packaging is so cute you get a big
mirror you get all these shadows
two-faced products too like a blush and
a highlight down here a couple of lip
products slash blushes so it's really a
lot of things but such a compact little
package there and I just want to point
out a few elements of this that I think
are just so smart shadows they're
getting like some really highly shimmery
even metallic colors here and you see
how that all the shades are like a play
on words for a band or something like
that the middle is the classical section
and these are all matte and then you've
got the alternative section which are
just some kind of different unique
colors actually you've got like a mob
and a pretty lilac that's got a little
bit of a golden tone a gorgeous and the
camera is not doing this justice but
this is a gorgeous deep rich navy blue
and a pink so these are great quality
just like I've raved about the bombs new
to palette this is like nude tude but
with a few more colors so have this
highlight called disco disco and this
reminds me a whole lot of mary-lou
manizer it's like almost identical so if
you don't have that and you want that
but you want it in the palette you're
getting that there and then this pop pop
blush is pretty close not exactly
dead-on but pretty close to the frat boy
blush that they have it's a kind of a
matte blush matte peachy color maybe a
little bit of Sheen but not much this
little part at the bottom is magnetic
and that's kind of protecting your cream
products which I love so you got all
your powdery products and then nothing's
happening to those creams which are
called milli and Vanilli and they are
like a lip balm lip gloss type thing or
they can be a creamy product on your
cheeks so you get a great moth and then
a deep berry color and I love the little
detail down here set up to look like the
Billboard chart and then they tell you
all the combos loving it so far I will
most definitely
give you more information a review maybe
a tutorial on it if that's something you
want to see but I just have been using
this non-stop since I got it
you can get this right now at the balm
comm another product a MAC lipstick that
I've been really liking is called cream
in your coffee and this is a cream Sheen
lipstick that I featured in a hole I did
very recently but this is what the color
looks like it's just creamy there's no
shimmer to it it's kind of like a dusty
berry type color it has a nice depth to
it I've worn this quite a bit and I feel
like it's just a great fall color I
think it's so wearable works with so
many different circumstances and I've
gotten a lot of compliments when I've
had it on and another lip product whoo I
love this so much
it's the NYX plump it up lip plumper and
the shade is called Jessica this is
something I just randomly decided to try
in it Ulta and it's a lip plumper you
actually do feel a little bit of tingle
on your lips so if you hate that maybe
don't try this but the shimmer is
gorgeous and that's the reason why I
probably like it the most is just the
appearance on the lips it's just
beautiful this is the thing I've been
racing for constantly just to top off
any kind of lipstick or lip liner I
might put on this is the kind of
reflective quality that it has you can
see it's just so pretty it's like a kind
of a golden e champagne color a little
bit of bronze in there too but still
very light this one kind of made me want
to try another one so the next time I
was at Ulta I got this shade called
Lindsay and this is a really light mist
shows up even more light on the lips
when you put it on but both you can see
they're kind of sheer like when the
lights not hitting them they are
relatively sheer so that's why I like
using them to top off a product even if
I put them on top of a lipstick I still
feel that little bit of tingle and I do
sense that there's a little bit of
plumping going on I've got this one this
pink toned one just in the center of my
lower lip and I love the amount of shine
that it gives and I just think these are
really nice glosses they're not sticky
and if you felt like the buxom lip
glosses which I also love but if you
felt like those are a little too thick
this is a plumping gloss that is not as
thick feeling as though have you watched
my iheart drugstore makeup tag
what a fun video that was I've seen so
many others since then I think they're
so fun to watch but in my dupes section
of that video I mentioned this this is
the pixie correction concentrate and
brightening peach total favorite of the
month for sure um this is a great
drugstore I'm saying drugstore it's a
little bit pricey compared to some
drugstore things I mean it's not like a
seven or eight dollar concealer it's
like fifteen bucks at Target but it's
less than the alternatives I had been
using like benefiting race paste but
very same color tone a great peachy
salmon colored concealer and this is
ideal when used on your darker circles
like their dark discoloration right on
the inner parts of your eye it's so good
there I mean works really well
creamy but not too creamy um coverage
just really hangs in there it's not one
of those concealers you blend in and
then it sheers out you're like okay did
I just put anything on there or not this
really does work so if you are looking
for something you know some alternative
to those high-end concealers but want
the salmon color this is really where
it's at at the drugstore right now I'm
probably the cheapest alternative I can
find so that wraps it up for my
favorites for this month I promise I
will have some tutorials coming soon my
weekends have just been so busy and
that's kind of my key tutorial time but
I've been away here for the past couple
or have had people here or this or that
so I will definitely have some new ones
coming up soon I tutorials face
tutorials and lots of people want more
one brand tutorials so I've got you
covered on that too so thanks so much
for watching guys and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
