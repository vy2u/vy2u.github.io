the glasses glam today as you can see
and its best in beauty for the month of
October already and yeah this is
basically my favorite products from the
past month the things I've been using a
lot just the things that I think are the
best I've got a lot this month so let's
dig on in first thing is the covergirl
stay fabulous 3 in 1 foundation I know
this has been around for a while I
reviewed this not long after it came out
on my blog and had used it and enjoyed
it thought it was a really long wearing
foundation great for oily skin really
nice coverage as well and I just kind of
rediscovered this recently I'd been
using a lot of my Estee Lauder Double
Wear and then kind of started pulling
this back into the rotation this happens
to be a really good shade for where my
skin is at tone wise right now this is
what's a shade natural beige 840 and
it's just / I just love the amount of
coverage and even more than that I love
how fresh it continues to look
throughout the entire you can get oily
in my t-zone this totally stands up to
that any pictures where I've been
wearing this I've got some nice
compliments about my skin but I gotta
say credit goes here this is a great
great foundation if you're looking for
that coverage staying power or something
that works for oily skin my skin
actually this time of year isn't it's
oily as it usually is but this still
works for me so yeah love it super
awesome blush that I've been using quite
a bit story here this went from being
like my least used blush from the balm
to my most used recently I love this
cabana boy this is kind of a slightly
shimmery plum colored blush and I think
at first I thought you know maybe only
certain situations I'm gonna wear this
but I'm actually wearing this like
everyday white everyday but a lot of
days and I just think it gives the most
beautiful like glowy soft berry look if
you're wearing tons of berry lips I
think this is a great coordinating blush
concentrated it's looking like that but
obviously you're shearing it out more on
your skin I just use a regular old blush
brush and just really lightly buff that
in and I think it's such a pretty look
and a lot of the balm blushes they say
shadow / blush shadow / blood who I can
enunciate today but I normally don't
double them up that much you know I
think okay I just gonna use this as a
blush right but this one is actually a
really pretty shadow too let me show ya
okay I can't really see now that I've
taken my glasses down but kind of right
above the crease I blended a little bit
of this and it's very pretty like that -
if you like these berry colored
eyeshadow check it out if you have a
chance the blush is from the balms
regular line like this are frequently on
HauteLook
drastically marked down I mean it's just
such a great quality nicely pigmented
blush I think you'll like it a lot so
I've been traveling quite a bit in the
past month and as I go places I really
think about what I'm putting in my
makeup bag and I think it says a lot you
know the things that you feel you must
take with you when you leave you know
your little makeup safety zone here I
think it says a lot about those products
those are must-haves right and if I've
been traveling for some sort of event or
something special you know I've got
maybe my hardcore foundation that I want
to wear to look nice full coverage and
glam but I'll also throw in a powder
foundation so maybe the next day or you
know for a lighter look I have something
that I can just throw on with some
concealer and look you know matte and
finished but not as heavy and so one
that I've been using a lot is my NYX
stay matte but not flat powder
foundation I've talked about this for a
while I have it in medium beige I
honestly cannot believe this is not kick
the bucket yet into my empty smitten
because there's not much left but this
is a great coverage product
natural-looking on the skin you know and
definitely a fan of a perfect matte look
on the skin but it's even better if it
doesn't look dry and chalky but it
actually looks somewhat skin like this
can be very pretty you slightly over
your foundation for extra coverage but
I've really been getting back into this
- just as powder foundation you get a
chance and you're in Ulta and they have
the nice little testers where you can
see the exact shades you can feel it
just feel it you know these feels so
and silky I mean coverage is just grand
with this stuff also on the topic of
travel I am one who doesn't like to be
without a full spectrum of lip products
to choose from is anybody else with me
no no you can't just take one or two
lipsticks what you're traveling
somewhere you've just got to have
options right so I take this little bag
this is a Mallee bag it came with a set
from a while ago and I always put my
travel lip products in here whatever I'm
gonna take with me so what I've just
been taking with me is this entire set
of tart pear delights and this is the
lip surgence said I reviewed it on
beauty broadcast Express swatches there
tried them all on my lips so you can
really see what they look like but yeah
I just dumped them all in here then I've
got you know eight different shades to
choose from everything from neutrals to
pinks to reds there are format there are
four kind of shiny two did lip balm type
colors I'm wearing one of them now this
is probably the deepest one as a bunch
and the matte ones have awesome staying
power - it's called destined that's the
shade I'm wearing now let me just do a
real quick swatch of them all on my
hands just so you can see there's a look
at the range just so you can get an idea
there and I've got like I said a full
review on these on my other channel but
I also really love this read called
enamoured this is one of the shiny ones
in that print and you might be saying
like well instead taking all these
individual ones why don't you just take
some sort of lip palette and that does
make sense but yet if you're traveling
and then you're gonna be going somewhere
how easy is it to take the one that you
settled on wearing for that day and just
pop it in your clutch you know these
take up no space a lot of kind of pinky
tone shades in this bunch but I just
love them when I take them all with me
just mirror my in kind of a weird mood
in this video I feel kind of like
hyperactive today you guys are probably
thinking yep
er okay this thing here this NYX love in
Paris 9 pan palette the shade is let
them eat cake
love this love love love this listen up
all you ladies who say can you talk
about more matte eyeshadows good matte
eyeshadow option this has
great natural matte colors and a nice
pinky tone to some of these which i
think is gorgeous I think that blends
into skin tones so well there are some
shades with shimmer in here too but it's
not so much that it's like overpowering
or looking really foiled and metallic on
the lids I mean just such a natural kit
I was wearing this in my hidden gems of
the drugstore video recently and got
lots of nice comments about it I mean I
can knock out an eye look with this in
no time it's like okay let me take one
of the light shades put it on the lid
there's this really cool like plummy
Brown that's matte that it's just
awesome
the pink is fun to work in there's a
little coral peachy shade in here these
sort of maava pink borderline neutral
type colors are great for blending
things out I'm wearing that plummy Brown
and the whitish shade and the look today
you know super you think I'm reaching
for this even more than my Sonia Kashuk
eye on neutral palette the quality is
great let me do some swatch just
gorgeous you know it's like your neutral
palette but not your typical neutral
palette it's got a few little fun twists
thrown in and I think you will love if
you have not experimented with kind of
the the pinky mauve there's also a neat
like deep rosy color in here too if you
haven't tried a lot of shades like that
I think you're gonna be pleasantly
surprised with how nice those look on
your eyes my memory card ran out my
battery ran out my camera fell off its
tripod
am I getting a sign that this video
needs to be over I feel out more though
more to talk about this is from Jordana
it's the 12 hour made to last I shadow
pencil and it's the continuous almond
shade I actually have this from Milani
as well they came out with like the
exact same product these two brands are
like under the same ownership a Milani
shadow eyes and these Jordana Stix are
essentially the same thing I have a blog
all about that but Jordana is going to
cost you less and be the same hardcore
staying power and you know awesome full
coverage type products so there that is
and this makes such a nice base for your
eyelid rod on kind of blend it in with
your finger a little bit I don't have
any you know creasing issues with this
it makes a wonderful long wearing base
for your powder shadow and I'm like
overloaded with jumbo shadow sticks that
have shimmer right now that they're not
pretty but if you're doing a matte look
like maybe say with something out of
this you want a base for that that's not
shiny so that way then that can really
stay true to itself or if you're
wondering like Milani or Jordana
I mean gotta love Milani but the price
on this is like half as much for just as
good of a product it tons of questions
about eye creams and I have run into
something that I'm really really liking
lately and I feel like it's been making
some sort of difference in my eyes and
like little fine lines around them and
it's from rock and it's the multi
correction nourish stress repair eye
cream and I got this I bought the allure
fall beauty box and this was in it I'm
sure this is something you can find out
in the stores and buy on its smooth
wrinkles nourishes brighten and it says
you can use this AM or PM and I just
keep this in my bathroom so it ends up
being my PM type prod I really think it
could be fine for like daytime wear
under your makeup because it's not too
heavy you know it's got a nice amount of
moisture to it but it's not super thick
so I haven't tried as many eye creams as
I have say lip glosses but I have been
trying to branch out a bit and this is
one that I've really been enjoying I
think it gives just a great level of
moisture and I think I've seen you know
an effect on my skin with it too my
go-to scent lately loving this mist I
got from Victoria's Secret it's the
Victoria's Secret bombshell body mist
probably one of the strongest scented
body mists that I've ever used I mean I
love the scent of bombshell
I had the perfume I just kind of wanted
to try something new and there's a
little deal to buy several of the body
mists and I just love this so if you're
looking to experiment with something new
and this is a very rich scent I feel
like it it makes me think of kind of a
nighttime scent although you could wear
it any time of day but it's just a
little bit deeper than a lot of the
light fresh clean scents
I normally go to like philosophies inner
Grace or philosophies unconditional love
a bit more intense and I really like it
finally if you take nothing else from
this entire video listen up here milky
way caramel apple caramel apple Milky
Way this is so good I bought these among
some other candies for my
trick-or-treaters let's just say a good
amount of these may have been consumed
by Tyler and I last night they are so
good like Milky Way needs to have these
out like non freaking stop it's the
nougat it's caramel they've thrown in
some apple flavoring it's got chocolate
around it it's just perfect and I'm
pretty sure it's fat-free and light it's
probably not fat-free no it's definitely
not that Infinite's so so tasty run

mine at walnuts it everybody that's best
