of the month some of my most loved
beauty products and by the way I got a
haircut it's got some like long layers
in it but just a lot simpler cut than
what I was dealing with before
yeah something new there I'm really
enjoying it but I'm gonna jump into
these favorites and the first one I'm
going to talk about is something I
mentioned in my sonia kashuk video but
it is this all covered up concealer I
have it in the shade ivory and if you're
interested in a lot more Sonia Kashuk
related information I did that brand
guide video here recently this concealer
is so so creamy and I've been using it a
lot on my under eye area I think it's
really good coverage it reminds me so
much of the texture of benefit erase
paste so if you like a really really
creamy concealer or if you're extra dry
on the under eyes this works so nicely I
gotta say I do feel the need to set that
and the thing that I've been setting it
with is actually something from a
different Sonia Kashuk concealer thing
it's the hidden agenda concealer palette
and it comes with the most fabulous
little setting powder it is just a
really super pigmented creamy powder and
I really love using it on top of this
concealer because I think this totally
needs something to kind of even out the
texture at least on my skin make it a
little less tacky but I'll use these
concealers as well especially this shade
if I want something a little lighter I
can practically use it as a highlight
type shade these are a little less rich
and creamy compared to this but I'm
liking all of these concealers so much
from Sonia Kashuk if you're wanting some
really good coverage but not wanting to
spend a fortune these are great but I
totally wish that like this concealer
could have somewhere attached to it like
this little setting powder because I
think it would make an awesome product
another thing that I'm loving as a
powder just for setting foundation or
wearing it on its own for just a quick
look like paired with concealer is the
it cosmetics celebration foundation but
it's the illumination version I have
this in light and I've been comparing it
to you know the regular version of this
powder foundation and I'm feeling like
this is so much more like rich in
texture more creamy more pigmented I
feel like it kind of adheres to the skin
a little bit more whereas the other one
feels like a little
or dry and powdery I still think they're
both like good coverage powders but this
just offers that little something extra
to the skin makes my skin look a little
less dry when I've got it on and I know
with the word elimination in there that
makes some people freak out a little bit
but I don't notice like a bunch of
shimmer in this powder I think it just
leaves a little healthier fresh or look
on my face for being a powder it does
remind me quite a bit actually of the
next stay matte but not flat powder
foundation so I love that too but just
here recently this is the one I've been
using the most and really enjoying that
now sometimes when I'm doing my makeup
especially with a baby now it's like I
won't always do it in this room
sometimes I'll run upstairs and like
grab a few things and do it wherever
else in the house it's convenient and so
when I'm gathering up brushes I tend to
grab for ones that I think can multitask
for me a bit more and one that I'm
really loving for that reason is the
Real Techniques blush brush I can get
away with using this for so many
different things this can be face powder
this can be bronzer blush highlight and
I think what makes it so versatile is
the cut you can see here it's way way
tapered down the side so if you want to
like cover a larger portion of your face
at one time like maybe for face powder
and stuff you can just kind of lay it
flat and work the side of the brush but
if I want to contour and maybe get a
more precise area I'll be used more just
the tip of the brush and same goes for
like highlight or blush it's just a
really nice size for me this would be a
little bit smaller than a lot of my
powder brushes but just a little bigger
than different blush brushes so if I've
got this this can pretty much multitask
and take care of so many different you
know steps on the face the only thing
that I don't love so much about this is
that the base is so wide so sometimes
when you're putting this in a little cup
or you know whatever a little container
alongside other brushes it really takes
up a lot more space than I think it
needs to because the base of the brush
is so wide but you could also stand it
up somewhere for decoration if you want
to do and that one I've had in my
collection for a while but another
really important like newer brush find
for me is this elf crease brush and they
only just recently added this to their
studio line you might glance at it and
say oh it's just a crease brush what's a
big idea but
actually this is quite a bit smaller
than a lot of crease brushes I have if
you look at it here up close you can see
it's got a nice you know taper to the
bristles down the side you can really
work the side of the brush or just the
tip of the brush so for applying shadow
to your crease if you feel like a lot of
your crease brushes are way too big this
will give you some more control there
but the reason I really like this is
because it's striking me as something
very similar to a brush that I've never
thought I had like a duplicate brush for
and it's the Sigma precision a 36 this
is the little wispy brush white wispy
brush that I'll use so much right up
here like above the crease and when you
compare these two size-wise they're
actually not that far off especially if
you get a good look at them like head on
at the tip so I've also found that this
elf crease brush is really great for
that SuperDuper light application right
above the crease so a transition shade
or whatever kind of color you want to
sort of rise above the eye this can do
it really well also if you've been
looking for a cheaper option compared to
the Sigma one this one is three bucks
I'm not saying it's an exact dupe for
this brush but it's really about as
close as it gets in my collection I've
got a ton of different brushes but this
one's working really well for me a
couple of things that I would highly
recommend looking into are the fierce
effects eyeshadows actually this is just
one product they're sold in groups of
two for I think it's just five bucks at
Walmart and anybody who's a fan of the
L'Oreal infallible shadows can tell that
these are really really close to that
packaging it's kind of that pressed
pigment style of eyeshadow duo that I'm
holding up here is soft and sultry and
so one is a golden shade and one is kind
of a mint or like a soft sage green type
color and the way they're packaged it's
the exact same thing as the L'Oreal
infallible so you've got that little
stopper there that you don't want to
throw away and then here's your shadow
and I am wearing this gold actually
today all over the lid for that nice
shimmery pop and then I mixed in some
other matte shadows and the other stuff
I'm wearing us from this cool palette
from pure minerals and it's the sole
mattes my buddy Kristin game on here
sent this to me totally by surprise and
I love it so much it's those berry and
moths
matze and they look so pretty with a
gold don't you think so anyway just
tried that for the first time today and
loved it
but these hard candy and duo's here I
think are just an awesome deal if you
want that fabulous pigmentation that
you've come to know and love frankly
l'oreal infallible shadows those are
gonna run you around eight bucks a pop
you know just for one and so this is the
only color combo that I've tried from
this hard candy line is the soft and
sultry with the green and the kind of
bronzy gold but it's definitely
something I'm gonna look into more and
buy some more of and for lips I have a
couple things I want to mention as well
one of them is this Mac Viva Glam lip
palette I showed this in the haul video
with some Mac and Ulta stuff and I am
enjoying this so much especially when I
find that I've got a little extra time
to work on my face this gives me so many
fun color combinations I can get a great
reddish lip with this I can get kind of
a mauve more neutral lip a great berry
toned lip as well so if you're not
familiar with the way this is laid out
its Viva Glam one two and three here and
then four five and six down the other
side I think it's just such a fun lip
and like today for example I'm wearing a
mix of two and three on my lips and then
over the top of that I'm wearing my NYX
butter gloss and tiramisu I think this
is good for somebody who maybe knows
they like this collection of lipsticks
or you just feel like you're get in a
rut of using the same kind of shade all
the time here I mean they're just
countless ways you could combine these
colors and get a little different twist
on those classic shades and for a more
low-maintenance lip thing that I've been
using a lot also I've been taking my
Benetint and layering it with the been a
balm
there is a set that comes with a larger
size of Benetint plus the been a balm
and also the lolli balm and lolli tint
so that's called sweet temptations and I
have a full review on it but the thing
I've really been liking to do kind of
inspired by that kit is take my Benetint
this is the small size that I've had
forever and just start my day with a
layer of that on my lips and then put
some of the been a balm on top and then
just throughout the day continue adding
more of the
so my lips get drier I just want to add
a little extra color I think this is
such a nice bomb to put on top it has a
lot more color to it than the lolli bomb
does I think and when you do layer it
over the tint or this liquid stain it
really shows up nicely so there's a look
at that as BOM has a really nice rosy
scent and just like the classic Benetton
it has and I just think it's a really
easy way to go about it because when I'm
reapplying this I'm not feeling the need
to look in a mirror you know I've
already got that base color of the stain
and this is just a nice little finishing
touch has a lot of shine to it as well
which i think is really pretty and
that's not the most you know full-on
vibrant red lip but I would say those of
you who like a softer sheer red lip you
would like this kind of combo as well so
that my friends is my best in beauty for
the month just some products that have
really stood out to me some fun little
finds that I wanted to either follow up
on or tell you about for the first time
