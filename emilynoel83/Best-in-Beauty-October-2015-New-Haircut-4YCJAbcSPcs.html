for the month of October and yes I am
joining you with a new haircut I'm
enjoying it so so much I just had so
much length and so much thinness you
know with the hair that I've lost post
pregnancy and all that it just really
needed a fresh cut and my mom cuts my
hair by the way that's what she used to
do for a living she's always cut my hair
and we just went with like you know one
length at the bottom and then just some
long layers along with that so it
definitely adds the look I think a lot
more fullness to my hair and in terms of
styling it like just for this I had
washed it last night and so it was most
of the ways maybe just a little bit damp
this morning when I got up so I hit it
with the blow-dryer and that was it I
actually put a little bit of I think it
was from living proof it was a little
like sample volumizing thickening mousse
type thing I work that into the roots
and that gave me a little more umph here
but like I didn't put any kind of roller
at the root or anything like that and
I'm pretty happy with how it is just you
know for this quick easy style but it
can still go back into a ponytail so
that's awesome but I would love to share
my favorite products with you so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that the first
thing is a mask and I love a good
cooling mask I used to be all about in
my very very early masking days years
ago I would go for those really
clarifying like clay type masks things
that would really harden up on the face
and shrink the pores and after you'd
wash them off your face would feel like
so squeaky clean and those are nice to
do every now and again but for the most
part I think the most pleasurable
matsing experience is one that leaves my
skin feeling really refreshed and just
soothed and nourished and so soft and I
guess really hydrated when it's all said
and done and so the one that I've been
loving for that is from glossier and it
is the moisturizing moon mask so this is
the same brand that makes that rose mist
that I love and I have talked about a
couple of masks that they have on
snapchat this is by far my favorite mask
that they do so and by the way they do
little stickers like when you do an
order you will get all these stickers
that
can personalise your mask with but it
just looks you know white and creamy and
you put that on leave it for 20 minutes
they say and it feels so cooling I
always end up doing this at nighttime
but I really think this would be an
awesome way to start the day as well if
you find you have a little extra time
some morning I think this would be a
great prep step for makeup because your
skin just feels so plumped up and nice
and it feels so cooled and refreshed
another little post shower thing that I
have been loving I got this from Ulta
this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory sugar crush
moisture extreme body butter cream the
scent is called freshly squeezed sweet
lime fragrance and I would have never
thought that I liked that scent this is
a scent that I did not realize I loved
until I got it and tried it and I
ordered this online so I wasn't really
sure what I was getting into I just
wanted to try some things from this
brand I feel like I've used a good
amount of this so far but there's still
much more to go this is a let's see 10.1
fluid ounce container lime and almond
oils and kiwi juice water oh my god it
is just so refreshing and this would be
a great like starting the day type
moisturizer but I always again find
myself using it after a shower at the
end of the day and it's it reminds me of
the scent of a margarita and ice cream
put together again it's not one of those
scents that you sit around thinking oh I
love that scent it's not one of those
scents that you put an exact label on
and people just go around talking about
how much they love it it's something
that you try and then you realize oh my
gosh that's great and as far as the
consistency of the lotion if this were
like a frosting you were mixing up you
get peaks when you just kind of go
through it with your fingers you can see
that but it's kind of surprisingly thin
but it's every bit as moisturizing as I
would need it to be this scent is just
really amazing and it's kind of strong
and sometimes with heavily fragrance
stuff if I put it on after the shower
and I've just shaved my legs like there
will be irritation but I don't have any
of that with this it doesn't cause any
like eczema flare-ups for me it's just
been a totally great product one other
thing here before we get into the actual
makeup makeup is this
covergirl outlast stay brilliant nail
polish in the shade perfect penny and I
know I've talked about this before
because this is not new to my collection
it's a really pretty like kind of rosy
taupe shade because it's not really as
bright and coppery as you'd think of a
new penny being it's just a little more
toned down in neutral than that but I've
got this on my toes and I've been
wearing this on my toes and it's just an
awesome no fuss toe polish and it's
beautiful on the fingers as well I've
been doing jamberry on my hands and I'm
gonna do a new jamberry what do you call
it not a coat of it but a new wrap later
on today is my plan I got the actual
heater to try with that so I don't have
to use a blow dryer so I'm pumped I'm
gonna be experimenting with that and
I'll probably do a review eventually
that's been what's going on in my
fingers but on my toes I needed a new
coat of something and going really dark
you know can be fine
dark colors bright colors we all have
our favorites but when they start to
chip off it can really show and if
you're a little lazy like me with
getting a new coat on there all the time
this is a great shade for you first off
my toe nail polish will never chip off
as quickly as when I put it on my
fingernails but this shade in particular
it's just so neutral and the the kind of
metallic shine that it has you can have
chips and it's just very hard to see
this is so neutral it completely goes
with everything so if you're looking for
that low-maintenance thing to put on
your toes that's not really gonna show
when it starts to chip this is great
next thing I've been loving and I know
this is gonna be such a like travel
thing for me we like traveling for
Thanksgiving this is totally going to
have a spot in my travel makeup bag it's
my Becca afterglow palette now I did a
video in case you missed it I did a
video comparing this one a little face
palette from bareMinerals and a face
palette from the balm so if you're
interested in those glowy kind of
highlighter blush combo palettes check
that out but this one from Becca really
interested me because everything in here
is something that you can buy full size
so it's an awesome sampler of the
brand's existing products that are
already really popular like the
shimmering skin perfecter
those are these first three it's
moonstone rose gold and topaz and then
these blushes the mineral blushes are
wild honey and flower child wild honey
is such a deceptively beautiful shade
because it just looks almost bronzer ish
they're in the palette but I've got that
on my cheeks today that's the main color
I'm wearing and I love it I did a little
pop of flower child on the apple and
then I did moonstone on top of that but
I swear I do something different all the
dang time with this palette it's so fun
to layer you know the blushes with
different skin perfectors or just you
know use these with other blushes you
have in your collection and I love that
each shade looks distinctly different
from the others you know each highlight
shade is totally different both of those
blushes totally different from each
other nothing annoys me more than
getting a palette of shades be it a face
palette and eye palette a lip palette
and so many of the colors end up
basically performing the same on your
skin here it's really fun because
everything has its own special look
another palette that I just can't get
enough of is my Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette I got this
after seeing glowing recommendations for
this from Dominique here on YouTube
she's a news anchor in Houston she's
awesome and jess AKA lola marie 7 was
talking about how much she loved this
and i kind of held off on this palette
because basically i saw it as just you
know another bad neutral palette what's
so special about it when i got it i
thought you know if nothing else even if
I don't love using this over and over
again
I could definitely pair it with brighter
shades you know shimmery colors that I
already have blah blah blah and that's
actually what I did for my look today
but to be honest with you I love using
this all on its own like I'm so
surprised at how much I love doing looks
with this palette and bringing nothing
else into the picture I use this in and
get ready with me videos so I'll link to
that if you want to see just kind of an
example look but cool looks warmer looks
the peach shade is awesome this kind of
rusty shade is super great all the
brownish color variety that someone
could need
but then the highlight shades are all
spectacular
and I think the reason why I love using
this so much I was kind of trying to
hone in on this as I was sitting here
doing my makeup today and I think the
thing I love most about it it's not so
much that every shade in here is so
incredibly unique but the experience of
applying them and blending them is so
good it's so easy it makes doing your
eyeshadow really fun because you just
get such nice looks all the time because
they're so easy to use and part of the
reason I think is that the light shades
are every bit as opaque and intense as
your deeper colors you can throw a
really dark shade in the crease and you
can start blending over that with a
mid-tone shade or a light shade these
shades have so much pigment to them that
they can really start to overlap the
darker colors and stand out creating
such a great looking blend they can
really smooth over the edge of a deeper
color and really soften it away I chose
to wear it today I was actually just in
the mood for a little color so I did
some green on the lids this is my golden
emerald infallible shadow great shadow
to work with by the way I did that on
the lid this in the crease a little bit
of this in the outer part of the crease
a little bit of the rusty shade just up
above as well as the peach and then I
put a little bit more of that resti
shade just with a pencil brush on the
outer part of the lower lash line so
very easy look it came together just so
simply now you may have seen the video I
did a few weeks back where I redid the
top drawer of my makeup storage to
actually give a home to my shop my stash
items my rediscovered products things
that I've pulled from my collection that
I really want to make a point to use and
one of the things that was in there was
a matte color sensational lipstick from
Maybelline the pink color lust for blush
and I've had that in there it's a
beautiful shade I love it
but really all that did was inspired me
to go through the rest of my collection
and pull out some of my other matte
color sensational lipsticks because it's
such a nice formula very velvety very
full color and I just happen to love the
particulars that I have and these colors
even more than the pink one that I threw
in my drawer I've been
loving so what I'm wearing today
actually daringly nude such a great
matte nude awesome awesome awesome so
I've got this on and then I just kind of
blended in with that touch of spice I
know I've talked about touch of spice
before probably my most worn in this
particular formula these two together
creates this look on the lips I love it
talk about a look that's gonna work well
with so many different eye looks that
you might be thinking about for this
season you know going really dark and
smoky wanting something light ish on the
lips but not to super nude these two
together are great daringly nude touch
of spice and then on Halloween when I
was Rosie the Riveter and Belle was
Rosie the Riveter and Tyler was Rosie
the Riveter I used this red this is my
siren and scarlet so a great matte red
wonderful holiday shade if you're
needing something like that it's kind of
a tough favorites video to draw the line
with because I've had so many things
that I've tried like just recently that
I really liked but I haven't really been
using them throughout the entire month
so I'm not quite ready to mention them
in this video but I would say the newest
thing that crept in into this video is
my true match pressed powder
rediscovered favourite this was
repurchased because I had this was
almost running out of it and I had the
Sun beige shade which is a little dark
for me now so buff beige and for is
pretty much perfect
fabulous drugstore powder really soft
smooth texture it mattifies without
looking too heavy
it could really double as powder
foundation I think in a lot of cases if
that's what you need but it's also a
great on-the-go powder not too heavy for
touch-ups massive shade selection for
the drugstore you know that the True
Match Line has that basically since I
repurchase this this has been like my
setting powder my thing that I've been
using all over my face just to set
foundation I've been happy with the look
I've been happy with the staying power
so just can't argue with some of those
Holy Grail long-term favorite products
so thank you guys so so much for
watching my best in beauty video I hope
you maybe discovered a few new things I
have been getting requests for more
tutorials so yes I will be getting on
that and I've still got more holiday
stuff to review so they
again and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
