me we are talking about October
favorites already and it seems like that
crept up on us kind of quickly
especially because there have been so
many dang holiday things that I've been
trying out so it really causes me to
focus in on the few things here and
there that have gotten consistent use
over the past month believe it or not in
the midst of all the experimentation
there are some things that I feel like I
kept going back to formulas and things
that I've really enjoyed so I'm going to
focus on those in this video for ya the
first thing that I have really liked and
it was something I started using because
I was testing it out but I kept using it
because I truly liked it it's this uLTA
Beauty complexion perfection blending
sponge and setting spray set doesn't
that look exciting no I got the sponge
here it looks a lot like a regular
Beauty Blender on this one I used today
so it's kind of like blown-up to its
fullest size also comes with a smaller
one which I did not use today but this
one ends up expanding to be a lot like
the size of the Beauty Blender blusher
and then it also comes with a matte
makeup setting spray which you know
that's that's okay for me it's not
really the selling point of this little
kit I love the sponges though they're
really extra soft I feel like they've
got a little different texture than a
standard Beauty Blender I feel like I
sense even a little more softness to
them and they're just great you know
blending out foundation blending
concealer whatever you want to do this
size is very very versatile I've used it
in cream contour cream blush so this kit
I believe was $14 so if you're looking
to try a couple of sponges that are of a
really good quality you might want to
check that out next thing I've been
using a ton of is my Anastasia Beverly
Hills concealer I think I mentioned in a
video where I was using this how it's
really super creamy it reminds me of the
consistency of benefit erase paste but
it's in more of an overall skin tone
type color well I love you race paste
for its peachy tone corrector type
quality I think this can be even a
little bit more versatile just used
wherever you need it on the skin and I
have it in the shade 2.5 it's still
hanging strong for me I still feel like
it's doing a good job concealing on the
under eye area but it's so so creamy I
think my dry skin people who feel like a
lot of concealers
they look good right after you apply
them and you feel like they start like
just you know sucking the moisture out
of your skin and making you look older
this is a nice concealer that gives back
a little bit of moisture and then you
can set it as much as you feel like you
need to and I've said it before but this
shade is working for me right now but I
may need a lighter color eventually also
my blush blush I have been wearing so
much lately has been a real like neutral
blush that does not interfere with
anything like some days I'm not even
sure yet like what I look am I going to
experiment with what lip color do I need
to use today and so my blush has been
one of like the color cosmetics of my
look that has really taken a backseat
lately and been sort of boring and kind
of neutral most of the time not that I
think this is a boring shade I think
it's a super universal and really
wearable shade but you know what I'm
saying and the blush is not like
stealing the spotlight for my looks
lately and what I've been wearing a lot
is my Mac mineralized blush and warm
sole this is not like some new product
to hit the market it's been around for
quite a long time I'm sure it's loved by
many the glance it's the kind of blush
that I look at and think is that even
going to show up on it but it really
does make this soft like neutral blush
impact and I'm wearing it on this cheek
on this cheek I'm wearing the thing that
I feel like is I'm not gonna call it an
all-out Duke because I feel like dupes
should be freaking exact okay if you're
gonna throw around the word dupe let's
make them dupes but by the time it
sheers out on my cheeks it really does
look very similar to the Mac and it's my
covergirl soft mink have I talked about
this before as being really close to
this one because they are just super
close this one ends up being just a
little bit rosier if you see them side
by side in a concentrated swatch I feel
like this one has a hair more pink but
I'm wearing that on this side this one
on this side I've got a little highlight
on as well that I'll talk about in a
second but they're so so close I'm just
loving my neutral easy blushes these
days and and both of these do have a
little bit of glow to them as well so I
love those and then my highlight that I
think is so great and I've been trying
like some different highlight kits and
products and stuff and this highlight
still stands out to me as being
fantastic and it's the essence pure nude
highlight
the shade is called 10b my highlight and
it's so good and at a glance you might
think it's that like beige is it too
deep but I feel like what's special
about this highlight is regardless of
how it looks in the pan and many of you
guys can vouch for this I think if you
have it and you've worn it
when this sheers out on the skin it's
kind of like invisible soft glow I've
got it on the top of my cheeks and it's
just like a remarkably invisible
highlight that's the only way I can put
it you don't see this thickness of color
you know some products they pick up just
a ton on the brush and then you put it
on your skin and you're seeing kind of
like this swath of color going across
this is not like that maybe in a swatch
you can really get it on there thick and
feel like okay is it a soft beige
highlight I'm not sure but by the time a
brush goes into that product and sheers
it across the skin it's like this
invisible softened glow - any glitter -
harsh metallic shimmery particles it's
like the softest pearlescent glow I love
it let's talk liquid lipstick for a
moment and what I feel like is my
favorite liquid lipstick formula on the
market and my gateway into this line was
actually a little duo it's the bare
minerals Jen nude liquid lip color and I
had tried to do overhead shade called
boss in it which I really like and it
also had a gloss with that and so I
thought for around the holidays are they
coming out with some kind of big set of
their liquid lipsticks that I can latch
on to well I did find a trio and I found
this at Ulta it's called nude and nice
and they give you three of their Jen
nude liquid lipsticks I'm sorry but what
I like about this formula is it's so
light and it does not get cakey dry
ugly-looking on the lips basically when
it fades down which it does I own one of
these colors yesterday and I noticed
like after I ate lunch I thought well
the color has faded substantially but at
the same time it looked completely even
still on my lips like I wouldn't have
glanced at that and thought ooh you know
that looks funny or even anything I
really need to mess with like I didn't
mind the look in other words I think
these are the most comfortable matte
liquid lipsticks I don't
they'd ride down to like a deceptive
color that you weren't expecting so like
these are the three in this little set
and I've got swatches here so the
lightest one is called wink the one in
the middle is called infamous and then
this is juju over here this is a really
nice classic mauve and today I am
wearing a mix actually of the lightest
two I first put on wink all over I would
say the look is mostly wink and then I
added a little bit of infamous which is
just a just a tiny bit deeper I kind of
blended that in on the outsides and I
like the look and I do find that these
are very easy to blend with one another
because they don't have that like
instantaneous dry down I mean you can
pull a little bit off on your finger you
know they're not a 100% set product
because of that I think you're getting a
little bit more moisture and for me like
well I like these shades I think these
nudes are pretty the mauve might be my
favorite in this set for me I think it's
more of a formula thing that I love like
I would wear this formula in just about
any shade they had to offer I think I
haven't really like gone into Ulta and
given the entire spectrum a good look
but I'm sure even though they're called
Jen knew they probably have quite a few
shades at the deeper end of the spectrum
that might be sort of interesting to try
out but if you're looking for a good
value on a few minis I think this $18
kit is nice you're a nude lip lover and
you do like a matte but not drying
finish I think you're gonna enjoy it and
that is really important when it comes
to the lighter nude shades because I
think that's where sometimes dryness
shows itself most in the lightest end of
the spectrum and the darkest end of the
spectrum
sometimes with formulas that I'm not so
cracked up about with liquid lipsticks I
can wear something in the middle and I
feel like it wears better and it just
looks more natural on my lips like the
really light and really dark are where
the problems show up so if I can wear
shades this light on my lips and still
feel like everything's looking kind of
smooth and nice and not too dry it's a
good thing like I say in every video I'm
trying a ton of holiday stuff so I
bounced around a lot with eyeshadow
palettes but there is one that I've been
coming back to it smell like my little
secret here over I don't know
passed more than a month maybe two
months I've been just dabbing into this
occasionally and I really like it and I
thought it was time that I mentioned it
to you it's a little ten dollar palette
from ELF actually it comes from a kit
that's ten dollars I saved the box it
looks like this I got this off of ulties
website it comes with an eye primer two
brushes one is like a flat liner type
brush and then one is more like a packet
on the lid type brush but it's just
called the called the all about eyes set
it's a thirty two color palette and
Elvis put out different types of
palettes that are put in this format
that this particular one I do love you
know just the color selection everything
is very full like there's some super
rich and pigmented colors in here I'm
not kidding with you it's really good I
think this is great if you like a
burgundy or plum look because there's a
lot of options where that's concerned
today I've got like a lot of this color
working in my look a lot of that plum
like on the outside
a lot of this Brown kind of blended up
above and that was also in the crease a
little bit of this shade on the inner
part of my lid and they're just easy to
use it's fun it's approachable the
shades are too wild and crazy' but I
think you can kind of see I've dipped
into a lot of these and gotten quite a
bit of use out of this palette the other
day I did more of like a greenish look
on the lid and it was very soft I truly
liked it and it's not one of those like
big-name holiday palettes but it's
affordable and I think it's quite nice I
mean look at these fun kind of shiny
metallics that really have some
dimension to them if you really like
your Burgundy's plums bronze shades I
think this is gonna be a great fall
palette for you little random things
here I know I talked about this in a
recent video but the Clinique Moisture
Surge overnight mask this came in the
dewy you set it came with the regular
Moisture Surge Moore's mooster Iser and
also a chubby stick but then you got
this mask and I've been masking a lot
lately as I've tried out some of the
Peter Thomas Roth stuff and different
things here and there and this has been
like my final step even though it's
called a mask in itself I kind of treat
it like a night cream and I feel like
it's a great replenishing moist
your eyes or if your skin's even a
little bit dry you definitely wake up in
the morning and feel like okay you know
it's gotten rehydrated overnight my
skin's pretty normal occasionally on the
dry side and I feel like I've had less
like dry patchy areas since I've been
using this consistently at nighttime so
I love that I'll link to the little kit
because I think the kid is a nice way to
just try out a small size like I've been
doing and then for my hair I've been
playing around with my hair a lot just I
feel like I'm still discovering how the
heck to style this stuff but one thing I
knew I wanted was something that I could
use to really get me some volume at my
roots I just picked this up from
Walgreens it's from the organics are
they calling it oh gee X now this line
but it says strength and body bamboo
fiber full thickening fiber cream smells
really good first off which is always a
plus and it also has a little pump and I
just pump out a tiny like pearl sized
amount because I've got really fine hair
here product can sometimes be a good
thing or a bad thing it's a fine line
that I walk with too much product and I
just get it all over my fingers and work
it in there at the roots even just you
know flipping my head over really
massaging it into the roots and then
brushing my hair back I feel like does a
lot but I've also done that and hit it
with a blow dryer quickly and that
really does something and it's
especially useful when my hair I tend to
wash my hair at night and if I get up
the next day it will have this super
clean super slick you know feeling to it
and just a little bit of this worked
into the roots makes it a little more
style able and manageable so I've like
that I'm gonna leave here today on a
negative note don't leave you with one
product that I just I don't see the
appeal and I've used it I've used it
you've probably seen it in the
description box of my videos if you
check that I've been trying this
Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour where
hydrating foundation for what seems like
weeks now and I've got it in the shade
2.1 and I just don't get it I have seen
people promoting this on Instagram I
would totally put this up against my
Rimmel lasting finish or my Revlon
Colorstay and I feel like I see
more on my skin after I get done
applying it even when I blend it in with
a dang Beauty Blender
I look at my skin and I think well it
just looks kind of like a foundation
it's not particularly luminous it just
doesn't do a good job of becoming like
one with the skin Rimmel lasting
finishes so much better about that as I
wear it I don't feel like it's getting
much better I'm not putting it on like
the driest skin ever I mean my skin is
moisturized as primed I put this on it's
ready for foundation and it's just like
I feel like I'm seeing the makeup the
coverage is medium just straight up
medium it's not doing anything extra and
frankly I've tried the concealers from
this line as well I feel hoh-hoh about
those two I just don't get the appeal
that there needs to be more coverage
there needs to be more something about
this formula that's either making my
skin look a little more radiant or just
really really nice and natural and skin
light I also feel like I want it to
cover more I'm sorry but any day of the
week Rimmel lasting finish beats this
one out hands-down
it's just how I feel I'm sorry but thank
you guys so much for watching this video
I hope it was interesting for you it's
really random stuff but definitely some
much loved stuff and I'm kind of looking
around the room here thinking I will be
having some sort of video focusing on
like budget-friendly gift sets like more
into the drugstore range I know I did
one on NYX but stuff even more
affordable than that
that kind of video will be coming and
also just an overall best of the
holidays type video will be happening as
well so thank you for watching guys I
really appreciate your time and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
