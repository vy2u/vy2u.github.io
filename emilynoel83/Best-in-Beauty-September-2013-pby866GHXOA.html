for my sep tember best in beauty video
so these are some of my favorite
products of the past month and after I
kind of made my list because I write
everything down all the time realized oh
my goodness these are all like kind of
oldies but goodies you know these are
favorites that I've had in my collection
for a long time really and they just
been working their way back into my
makeup routine lately so I'm really
happy to share those with you the tail
end though is something new which I'm
really really liking but let's just
start off I'm going to talk about this
elf eyelid primer this is the one dollar
I primer I got mine from target I
believe if you're surfing elfs website
it will be under the essential category
so this is the one this is not the
mineral one that's three dollars this is
the one dollar one and guys this just
makes me feel foolish because I have
talked about loving oh I love Too Faced
shadow insurance and Urban Decay primer
potion and all these other you know
really expensive I primers but I must
admit to you I must confess that this is
just as good for me on my eyes with many
many different eyeshadows this works
just as well and it's just a bus one
with you know the wand and it's kind of
a nude shave you can see that there it
blends into your skin to where you can't
even really see it anymore and love this
so much and it only takes a little bit
sometimes people get frustrated with
their eye primers or they think their
eye primers are having a reverse effect
on staying power make sure you're only
using like the minimal amount to pretty
much cover your eyelid up through your
crease and to the brow that way you're
that whole area is covered it all has
some sort of base but don't go overboard
with products like just a little dab you
know and then blend it in usually works
fine this is just one of those things
I've had in my collection for a while
came back and started using it regularly
and realize what the heck it's only a
dollar and it works awesome go along
with that an eyeshadow palette that I
kind of rediscovered and just you know
fell in love with its awesomeness all
over again is the balm nude tude yeah I
love this palette I've talked about this
as being one of the best of the best
when it comes to all those naked nude I
pallets I just love the shades in this
and I know that some of these have the
cute little like pin-up girls behind
there I wish mine had that but I guess
there's a couple versions and when I got
mine on hautelook I think it was one of
my first ever hautelook purchases um
this was just the plain one but whatever
all the shadows are the same and I just
love them I love the whole shade
selection in here day I am wearing it
and probably my most go to style I take
this shimmery white I put it around the
inner corner I go all over my lid with
selfish and then I put sophisticated a
little bit in the outer corner blend up
through the crease with sultry aren't
you loving all these adjectives and just
kind of create sort of a soft crease
look there and a little bit of
standoffish as my highlight and then
just a touch of sophisticated underneath
my eye as well so very easy over the
weekend to I was using the shade sexy
which is a gorgeous burgundy berry plum
type color and I use that in a real
concentrated way in my crease but then i
sheared it out and it shares out
beautifully like I'd never really
thought to make this dark of a shade
more like a transition color but when
that is done really sheer you get the
most beautiful berry I look I love the
way there are lots of directions you can
go with this palette they've got super
light shades super dark just been
coming back to this and realizing man
these are so darn easy to blend the
shades are so saturated and lovely I
love this palette do a bronzer that I
love is from laura geller and it's
Bronson Brighton talk about another
thing that I've just been going back to
and using a whole lot this is a really
cool product because as you can see it's
not just one flat bronze shade it's got
some really deep Browns some beige some
pearly white colors and some pink in
here you have the potential to get a
really nice deep bronze color that's
Matt or possibly sometimes I feel like
I'm getting a little bit of a satin
finish out of it but I love this so much
and I actually went through an entire on
smaller size of this which if you ever
experiment with Laura Geller's smaller
sized products that are about like that
big they still lasts forever it took me
so long to hit pay
and or hit the terracotta tile this is
baked on so I was really excited when I
started on the guess I have kind of
flattened out the dome that was once on
there's love this so much because we're
into the fall months now and you still
want to keep up that glow a little bit
but I feel like you can use this with a
fluffy ish brush get your glow all over
and kind of a subtle way or you can take
like a blush brush and use it for a
little bit of contour like I did today
another thing that's really nice and
brightenings I've been coming back to is
my dream lumi in ivory so this is one of
those pins that you know the product
clicks up through and I consider it like
a concealer anymore I've really been
liking to use 2 concealers 12 really
correct and cover and one to brighten
and this has been like one of my go-to
brightening think I just love that it
has some coverage to it get it brightens
and it really can bring those parts of
your face forward that you want to pop
out like your cheekbones down your nose
you can put it on your brow bone I know
I'm like a light to medium skin tone but
ivory is definitely the shade that gives
me the most contrast and makes the most
difference if you're really wanting to
like highlight key features I have come
back to a classic much-loved mascara and
it is the almay one coat ripple effect
still love my get up and grow but I was
just browsing through the store several
weeks ago and I stumbled across this and
thought I need that back you know I
really want to try that again and it's
got a really interesting brush I believe
julieg was the one who first got me
going on this the brush is really
interesting it's completely like teeny
short bristles on one side and then a
little bit longer bristles on the other
I would definitely call this a dry ish
formula mascara like it does something
unique because it catches all the lashes
like it really gets product on all of
them and it thickens them and lengthens
them and and can I say anything more but
I do feel like it helps with the curl of
the lashes as well it seems to hold that
brethren I sleet I love this mascara I
loved it years and years ago and now it
just kind of feels like I'm coming back
to an old favorite I can also vouch for
the fact that you can do a ton of like
really intense napping with this on and
still no flakes on my face
I have been making a point to rotate
through tons of different lip products
not wear the same thing all the time but
something that's found its way into my
bag and it's kind of stayed there
because it's so basic and just such for
me a really classic shade is the Revlon
lip butter and very smoothie I love this
this is one of my favorite shades from
the lip butter a little bit of shimmer
to it I've used it a lot it's a really
pretty pink yberri type color if you
don't think you can wear Barry um this
is the shade that will prove to you that
you can I mean it's just really gorgeous
and has a nice amount of shine they
actually I was just playing around and I
used this elf lip stain which is in the
shade what is it crimson crush this like
a marker form it gave me a really nice
long wearing base and then I just put
this on top to make it more of a berry
red and more of a shiny shade the shade
I've just talked about a lot in the past
I don't think anyone can go wrong with
it and if you are looking for some
specific shades for fall some ways to
maybe deepen up your lip look a little
bit check out my top 10 favorite
lipsticks for fall and then I also did a
companion blog post recently on my top
ten lip glosses for full and you can see
them all on my lips and decide for
yourself what you might want to try
lastly something new um yeah look at
this big old thing I had this sitting on
my coaster over here i'm not sure what
it usually is that for drinks about
whatevs this is the tree hut Shea sugar
body scrub I got this from walmart it is
a big old tub bonus fifteen percent so
um 21 ounces for the price of 18 ounces
and this was not expensive at all i
think it was probably less than five
button just tropical mango um whoo it's
so good i need even as we're getting
into fall i still love my intensely
fruity scents like this product is also
really loaded with the little scrubbies
you know the little granules in there
that really slough off the dead skin
I've gotten different body washes that
claim to be scrubs and it's like there's
five granules in there and your think
you're really going to do something
awesome for your skin they like it
smells up the shower in the bathroom so
much after I use it just awesome used it
before I went and got a spray tan
recently I hadn't done that for a long
time
but you they say you're always supposed
to exfoliate before you do any
self-tanning it makes the tan hang
around longer and also I think when the
tan starts to wear off it does so in a
more even wet I confess I have looked
like a leopard a few times because I
didn't exfoliate well enough so this
really works 3 thank you so much for
