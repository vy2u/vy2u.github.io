and beauty better late than never and I
really wanted to fit this in because I
haven't been doing videos as
consistently on here with the baby at
all yet I have still been using products
so I thought this might be a nice little
round up of some things that I've been
enjoying thank you thank you so much I
can't say it enough for all the warm
wishes I mean seriously I'm just blown
away by all of the sweet comments toward
me Tyler Bell even cupcake it's just
really been appreciated I thank you guys
so much I want to jump right in and tell
you about the things I've been loving
first off several brushes all are really
affordable so that's great first one is
the elf complexion brush I know I've
talked about this before but this is a
really nicely shaped brush definitely
tapered on sides and down the sides here
as well and really pinched in at the top
of the ferrule so it can be nice just
for applying some face powder that's
what i normally use this for it's also
nicely shaped if you wanted to contour
with this as well but I've just been so
impressed with this brush like other
brushes from elf studio line I think
it's so soft it's very durable has held
up well throughout multiple cleaning but
this is definitely been a go-to just
where face powder is concerned and then
I've got a couple that you've probably
seen me using a lot whether it's on this
channel or in demos over on my beauty
broadcast expressed channel with the
reviews and everything these are from
targets up and up line they've come out
with some new brushes there is a
complexion brush set that includes this
brush and a few others i have reviewed
it but this angled brush is really the
one that i've been using so much i think
this is just fabulous for contouring it
is so soft so dense it's just really
nicely sized for me for right there in
the cheekbone also around the hairline
and then a brush that I got individually
that's so nice is the blush brush brush
really reminds me of a miniature size of
this elf complexion brush it's again
very pinched in at the top of the
ferrule just the perfect size for blush
I really don't think you can go wrong
with these just a few bucks apiece on
these and like I said the angled brush
was part of a set who says you can't
find great brushes at the drugstore
because I absolutely love those
that I wanted to mention that I've been
playing with a lot lately it's actually
an under-eye corrector and it's from it
cosmetics it's just called bye bye under
eye corrector and I have this in media
using it a lot in the latter part of the
summer started the fall as you can see a
very peachy toned concealer and you can
just add this to the list of concealers
like this that I really enjoy and the
amount you're getting in here this is
what I really wanted to mention this
this reminds me so much of the
consistency of my Bobby Brown corrector
in bisque but with the bisque you're
getting point zero five ounces and in
this one you're getting point 17 ounces
so a lot more product and I think it's
just a few dollars more I also wanted to
mention this because the consistency is
so different from the picture that I saw
on altas website of man you would think
this is a straight up like liquidy
creamy type thing judging by the picture
but it's really kind of solid you know
it's even more solid than benefits ear a
space still I don't find it to be drying
it all and it does a really good job of
correcting under-eye circles or maybe
you've got some melasma type
discoloration age spots dark spots this
kind of a concealer works really well
for that I've tried erased taste and you
thought maybe that's a little too creamy
there's a little too much moisture in
that product you felt that way you might
enjoy a product that's a little more
solid like that another face product
that I'm wearing today that I must
mention is benefits majorette four of
you on this over on the Express channel
but this is a cream blush it's a
fabulous cream blush texture because it
goes totally like cream to powder does
not remain tacky on the skin at all it's
this gorgeous peachy coral shade this is
all I'm wearing on my cheeks they even
marketed this as something that you
could you know put on first and then
layer different blushes over the top you
could totally do that but I don't even
think you need to the color on this is
so pure and wonderful i just love it on
its own you love this cute really
old-school looking packaging I think
it's just darling you have a
rediscovered product to mention and it
is my Mally volumizing mascara it's
funny how maybe you back off from a
product that you loved and you start
trying it again it's like oh yeah I
remember why I love that
and the key time for this mascara to do
its best work like let's say you've been
using it consistently but when you get
to that two to three week time frame
with this mascara it's like it gets to
the perfect level of dryness in the tube
and it just goes on beautifully really
layers and builds on top of itself so
what's super rich and dark it doesn't
leave the lashes feeling dry and brittle
and the brush is just fabulous for
highlighting all of your lashes not
clumping them to guess like I always
knew this was a really good mascara but
hadn't used it for a while and about a
month or so ago opened up a new tube and
I'm like oh yeah this is great I need to
be using this more for lips I know I did
a big old lip liner video not too long
ago recommending some great ones I have
one more that I must add to that list of
things I love it's from Rimmel it's the
exaggerated lip liner this is a
retractable lip liner and the shade is
obsession I must mention this for all
the fall deep lip lovers out there this
is a great kind of walking the line
between brick red and berry type of so
smooth and creamy it's very easy to fill
in your entire lips with this which is
what I have done I know in the video
where I mentioned all those great lip
liners I referenced nixes plum as being
a really nice deep shade this is on the
same level darkness wise but it's just a
little less berry and a little more like
just deep burgundy red going on in this
line so I love that and if you're
wondering what else is on here with it
this may as well be a favorite as well
because I really love the L'Oreal glossy
bombs and I got the one in petite plum
feels so so comfortable on the lips
gives that little bit of shine and so
here's just a swatch of that and you can
see how nicely it coordinates with that
liner recently tried a new kind of lash
with my last order from Lady mass comm I
tried the cocoa lashes number 201 you're
getting a lot from this empty box aren't
you on my eyes right now I love how
thick and full these are would compare
these to my red cherry number 43 but
less length don't get me wrong I love
the number 43 s but if you want to dial
that length a little bit but keep the
thickness you might try the cocoa 201 so
a couple of my eye palettes that I've
really been gravitating toward one is
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette this
is just a really ideal full type palette
you can just kind of tell by looking at
it but it's also got a color combo in
here that I've been enjoying the look of
so much lately and it's any combination
of gold and like a burgundy plum type
shade even if you don't have this
palette you might consider just grabbing
those two shades elsewhere in your
collection and trying them out together
I've got that kind of look going on
today I've got this really soft golden a
shade on the lid a little bit of this in
the crease along with a little bit of
this matte brown and it's just a really
pretty kind of soft fall look that I've
been wanting to do a lot lately another
newer palette to my collection that I've
been using a lot and this is really new
to me because I think it's the first
shadow palette I've tried from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills line but it's
the Emory Z palette if you love the warm
matte look on the eyes these shades here
are just ideal for that and then you've
got some kind of interesting and
shimmery pops of color up here with the
purple and the emerald green Lee good
taupe type shade in there but another
kind of unexpected hit where this
palette is concerned is the brush I
absolutely love this little brush that
came with it I mean how often do we fall
in love with the little brushes that are
just thrown in with stuff but it's got a
really nice little flat brush there and
then I love the size of this smallish
crease brush it's so nice for working in
this outer corner doing an outer V or
maybe doing a really smudgy lower liner
love that and last but not least this is
a baby product but I swear it's an
amazing adult project as well it's the
burts bees baby be nourishing lotion I
got this for bill I've been using this
on her but I've also been using this on
me and I just love this scent it is so
good oh my gosh how do I explain this
it's so fresh and clean it's not overly
like baby it doesn't have that baby
powder type scent to it at all but it's
like really really light just a hint of
sweetness there and I love the texture
of it too it's a really
nice moisturizing lotion but I was so
surprised at how much I loved it for
myself as well as for her it is
ninety-nine percent natural says it has
real beeswax sunflower seed oil and shea
butter to keep your baby's skin looking
healthy naturally also I've talked about
having a lot of sensitivity on my legs
like after I shaved my legs I can't just
throw any old lotion on there and this
definitely is super gentle and doesn't
irritate my legs at all so I tried to
bust out this video kind of quickly
because somebody is very peacefully
napping right now but I don't know how
long that's going to last so thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
