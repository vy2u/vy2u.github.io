in beauty time and I'm a little late on
it this time around but I have just had
some other videos that I really wanted
to get out sooner than this so hopefully
you've been occupied watching everyone
else's favorites videos they don't feel
like I have a ton to talk about this
month like compared to other months
maybe it's just because I've been doing
a lot of experimenting and just dabbling
in various things but the things I do
have to talk about I really do feel
strongly about of course the first thing
I want to mention is something that
makes me feel like kind of a mixologist
when I'm you know sitting here getting
my foundation on every day it's
something I can add to any foundation
and kind of boost the coverage up there
the cover FX custom cover drops I have
them in the shade in 35 and there is a
huge spectrum of shades to choose from
and basically you've just got this
little dropper here and it's a very very
concentrated just like liquid pigment
type situation here it's like
straight-up coverage in a little bottle
and you know depending on the amount of
drops you add to your existing
foundation or maybe a moisturizer or a
BB cream or whatever it might be you can
up your coverage and also in the case of
this I felt like you know it's a maybe a
hair deeper than some foundations that I
wasn't able to use because they were too
light so I could kind of make a shade
adjustment with this product also but
here's the thing when people talk
coverage I get really skeptical when
people with like perfect skin talk about
what great coverage something has
because I'm thinking like you know what
are you covering up anyway so I was kind
of wondering exactly how far these would
go but with a couple of drops like a
couple of little like boop boop from the
dropper it really will I think turn
practically any foundation I have to
full coverage even if it starts as a
really light coverage thing for example
today I mix two drops of this that seems
to be my kind of standard is two drops
small drops by the way because I'm not
like taking a full droppers worth and
you know mixing it in I'm just going
like little bitty a total amount that
ends up getting mixed in with my
foundation wouldn't even amount to the
size of a pea I mean it's that small of
an amount that I'm mixing in but like
today I mixed it with my Maybelline
matte and poreless which isn't
like the lightest coverage thing I own
but it really got stepped up with this
product it also adjusted the shade a
little bit which made it even better for
me and while these drops seem to have a
matte finish I don't feel like it adds
you know a lot of dryness to the
foundation I'm adding it to you know it
doesn't like instantly turn it just
because it made a full coverage it
doesn't make it dry and cakey looking
either you guys know I've been a big fan
of the Estee Lauder maximum cover
foundation that was a huge like
lifesaver for me when I was dealing with
melasma and this would be another thing
that kind of like brings other
foundations to that level if you know
what I mean like if you wanted to add
say three to four drops of this to some
foundation you were using you would
really achieve that like absolute
fullest coverage in a foundation and
today actually I just tapped a little
bit around my under eyes and used that
like a concealer basically I've never
done that before the one critique is
that it's a little messy on the dropper
see how that dropper is like completely
covered with product so not only are you
may be dealing with the drops coming
from within the dropper but also product
possibly dripping down from the outside
of the dropper you know what I mean
you just kind of got to get used to
seeing like how much of that is mixing
in with the foundation I'm gonna apply
you know what is my ideal amount and
kind of visually get accustomed to what
that looks like this is definitely a
high-end product that I think was worth
the money I do not regret it a bit and
it's really expanded the use of so many
foundation BB cream you know like barely
there coverage type products it's been
fun to see how this works with those a
little thing I've been getting a lot of
use out of here at my makeup station is
this elf daily brush cleaner this is the
exact same packaging is the elf mist and
set and I almost think they need to like
make a change with that because you
really don't want to accidentally mist
brush glitter in your face so I have
them sitting on two totally separate
parts of my desk here and I love the
mist and set I am a regular user of that
product and I of course I'm all for deep
cleaning your brushes at the sink but
sometimes
like when you're going between colors
and you just need to clean something off
really fast having something like this
that will dry super quickly and just
having it right here at your desk is
very handy this also smells really good
too but I just take like a cotton pad or
a Kleenex and I missed just a couple
times on there then I just take my brush
here and swirl it on the pad you can see
it's picked up some product I can you
know dust it back and forth on the other
side and make sure it's completely clean
it's just immediately clean and dry so
if you're one who's like shooting makeup
tutorials and you need something that's
gonna like clean off your brush in a
jiffy that's the stuff now way way back
in the day back when encore was making
videos I used his recipe to make the
homemade brush cleanser and I used that
for the longest time and I had a little
spray bottle of that on my desk this I
would say dries faster there may be more
alcohol in this but it definitely hasn't
affected the quality of my brushes or
anything but I just found myself using
that a lot I think this is one of the
things you might see sold like in Target
or Walmart whatever stores carry elf and
while I'm added this brush that I used
in my demo this is the elf blending
brush and this was my kind of
game-changer brush discovery of the past
couple weeks so I used this in my recent
tutorial my smokey eye look watch that
video to see it in action because it's
kind of a unique shape and size it's
kind of like my Sigma e25 but less full
and so I'll use it to kind of get that
pulled out that diffused shadow look you
know coming just above the crease and
also under the eye as well so I love
this but it is out of stock on elfs
website and I contacted elf to see like
I hope you intend to bring that back you
know and they said it will be back in
three to four weeks so if you're trying
to get this and haven't been able to
there is hope another thing that I have
been using so so much and I do have a
full review on this product it's the
Maybelline brow satin even though there
were a couple of semi brow fails in my
last little drugstore reviews video I've
got quite a few things that I enjoy brow
wise that are kind of in my rotation but
this one's been getting used a lot just
you know I think the ease of use the
shade
the intensity level it's got the
retractable pencil on one end and I
think I reference this in the review
that it's not the finest pencil ever
it's able to stay relatively thin for
the fact that its retractable but it's
not quite as fine as like that NYX micro
brow or the Anastacio brow wiz and then
on the opposite end once you twist that
off you've got this kind of
spring-loaded powder dropper so it's
going into some powder here and you can
use that to kind of set the brows
there's what that looks like you know
you can get kind of a softer fill if you
want to I do really like what this does
for my brows I feel like I can use it
quickly get the look that I want
the only thing would be this doesn't
offer any additional hold to the brows
like a brow gel would so I do have to
pull in my NYX control-freak
brow gel who would this be for
specifically it might be for those
people who aren't totally satisfied with
the look that only a pencil gives and
they don't like to go strictly with
powder either I do find that this is
really long wearing and maybe that is
that combination of layering the pencil
and the powder I do have a lip product
that has been knocking my socks off over
the past month and it is my colour-pop
lippie stix in poison I did this big
comprehensive like fall color pop
product review video and this is
definitely one of the favorite lip
products from there and it's just been
the one that I've continued to wear the
most in case you're not familiar with
the lippie stix they are a skinny format
lipstick this is matte this particular
shade and I'm wearing it right now and I
just think it's the perfect fall red you
know it's a little bit deeper it's a
little bit more tour to brick-red than
just a classic true red and I just think
it's very appropriate for the season
it's gonna be great around Christmas
time as well now there are a lot of
matte liquid lipsticks floating around
and there's some good ones and there are
some not-so-good ones there are some
very annoying feeling ones and there are
some really comfortable ones well this
particular product might not follow that
liquefied lipstick trend it's still
overall is giving you you know a
finished look that's very very similar
to what those would do you know it's
fully pigmented it's totally opaque on
the lips and I've said it before but
I'll say it again if I'm gonna wear a
deep shade like a deep red or really
dark berry and that finish is really the
way to go because then you're not
worried about that transferring off or
sliding outside the lip line because it
will look very obvious you know when
shades like this get messy but when I'm
wearing a mat I just feel so much more
comfortable about it like I really don't
feel like this is going to go anywhere I
can be taking sips of my coffee and yeah
a little bit might transfer onto the cup
because this isn't a totally like
non-transferable product but I don't
feel like it's gonna get messy
oops outside my lip line and as you can
see my hair didn't stick to my other
favorite of the month is a palette and
it's definitely a palette that I've been
trying before getting into a lot of this
holiday stuff and I've reviewed some
holiday things already I've still got a
lot more to come I've already done a lot
of swatching of some of these other
things and kind of gotten a feel for
some of the collections that I haven't
even mentioned on my channel yet and I
have a sense that even though you know I
love this now just as a standalone
product I really think I'm going to
continue to love this above a lot of
different holiday palettes and it's my
Too Faced stardust palette I have been
trying some of the Too Faced holiday
stuff and it's adorable it's really cute
to look at and normally I am completely
suckered in by that kind of thing but
maybe it's just you know having had this
palette now a little bit longer and
really becoming familiar with it and
enjoying it so much it's like this is
really what I love I feel like this is
such a well thought out palette I talked
about it at length in a palette
comparison video I did recently I feel
like every shade in here is great
quality every shade has a distinct kind
of purpose I just feel like it's so
wearable it's a very educational like
format the way they set it up they gave
you some extras like the primer better
than sex mascara a loose shadow all of
these cards with the different looks
which I have loved and had so much fun
with I mean it's not like they didn't go
cutesy at all with the packaging on this
but it's a really functional practical
like makeup lovers type product you know
I just feel like the specific shades in
here really speak to me I love them I'm
becoming attached to them very much so I
am wearing it today I've got Golden
Nugget on the lid I've got millennial in
the crease I've also got a little bit of
double tap in the crease and a blend of
millennial and girls night very smoky
smudgy on the lower lash
lines nothing gives me crazy sparkly
fall out the mats are just as wonderful
as the metallics are I've just enjoyed
it so so much yeah I got a couple of
things I don't really want to call them
fails they're just kind of questionable
things I just want to discuss them with
you a little bit maybe in the comments
section you can tell me what you think I
got this butter LONDON lip service for
peace lippy liquid lipstick collection
it was $29 at Ulta as you can see four
products were in here first off these
are the products there's no way that
they like stay standing in here if
you're gonna give this to somebody and
hope it's like a pretty presentation and
they're all like looking through these
little windows they immediately like
fall over and all fall to one end and
you've got a nude kind of like a light
corally pink a dark berry and then this
mob shades are marketed as liquid
lipsticks they are thick they're very
shiny they are what some people might
call a little bit sticky I mean there is
some heaviness on the lips with these
and for me it's the kind of situation
where if I like the color enough I'll go
for it you know I won't really have a
problem wearing it but if it's not a
color I'm absolutely crazy about you
know see you later I don't really need
to waste my time with it and there are
two shades in here tea with the Queen
and putting these lighter - I was really
disappointed with how streaky these went
on it's hard to build up like an even
consistent color across the lips with
these shades and I just didn't think
they look very flattering on in these
other two shades I definitely like them
better in the way they apply fruit cake
can be a little risky like I said if
you're going out if you're not gonna be
keeping a close eye on your lips
throughout the day it's kind of a tricky
shade to wear just in terms of keeping
it all within the lip line top I really
like I think top is a beautiful shade
both tough and the nude tea with the
Queen are regular parts of the line and
I really really like this shade it's
just kind of unique it's like a wintery
pink I could call this anywhere for a
mauve to a really soft plum it's got a
ton of shine it just looks really pretty
on the lips and just kind of a different
shade just warning you guys who are kind
of anti lip gloss this really feels like
a
shiny borderline sticky gloss like I
said that the staying power is pretty
good I guess the thumb up here is I love
this shade I'm not wild about these
three this one is sold individually so
if you're interested in that kind of a
color and you may not be worthwhile for
you to go after the entire set and I do
feel kind of funny saying that because
value sets they are a great deal you
know you're getting more for your money
I just didn't love all of them but I
wanted to let you know that Toph is
pretty dang awesome in one last little
thing this is just kind of like an open
question has anybody tried this NYX HD
studio photogenic primer slash base this
is kind of like the primer counterpart
to the NYX HD photogenic foundation line
and those foundations run I think close
to 20 bucks isn't it and this is like a
1516 dollar primer so what's so great
about it I just don't understand it it's
a white primer it doesn't feel
especially silky when I put this on my
skin it doesn't like change the texture
of my skin to make it smoother maybe
feels like a really lightweight
moisturizer going on but I just don't
see it doing any favors for my skin I
don't feel like it's minimizing the
pores the lines I guess my question to
you guys is is there anyone out there
who uses this and loves this and if you
do what should I be looking for what
should I be looking for this to do for
like a 1516 dollar drugstore primer I
feel like it should be doing great
things I'm still kind of experimenting
with it I've been wearing it with
different foundations I don't feel like
it's done anything for staying power for
skin texture for pore size different
things like that but let me know if
there's something I should be looking
out for with this that I'm missing the
boat on it I'm missing the point on tell
me but thank you so much for watching
these videos I've really been trying to
crank out more on this channel and ever
since I've merged this channel with my
Express channel so you've probably been
seeing more reviews here kind of mixed
in with the normal longer videos that I
also do but the reviews will definitely
keep coming for some of these holiday
things while I have talked about some
holiday palettes already that I've loved
rest assured there are some that I have
not loved oh thank you again for
spending some time with me and I will
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
