some of my favorite products will be
discussed in this video I've kind of got
a few different segments of what I'm
talking about so I've got products that
for me personally just like my personal
favorites and then I recently traveled
an in some wedding makeup and certain
things worked out just wonderfully well
for travel and just the whole vibe of
this wedding it was just so perfect so I
wanted to mention some of those and then
also I've got a few little flops to talk
about first and foremost great
affordable affordable primer here from
ELF it's the elf hydrating primer if you
are dry or you have some dry patchy
nasaan your skin which tends to be the
category I come under I don't feel like
my skin as a whole has a super dry
texture but around my nose different
places I think it might be pregnancy
related but the little bit of added
moisture helps but it's more than just
the extra moisture because you could
argue well why don't you just slap on a
more heavy-duty moisturizer or more of
it or something like that and I really
do try to cater extra with my
moisturizer to the areas where I know
I'm dry but this is like a little extra
moisture boost but also smoothness and I
feel like it locks in whatever
moisturizer I have put on a little bit
better than some other primers do and
primers have like a multitude of
different purposes right like I've got
some that are more like brightening
almost highlighters under your makeup
and then I've got some that cater to
hiding your pores and those almost have
a little bit more of a dry consistency
to them so I think you really want to
make sure your primer isn't detracting
from what you really need out of your
makeup so the hydrating primer for me
from ELF is working great right now
I do think this works even more
effectively for me than the Smashbox one
does because Smashbox has a hydrating
version of photo finish it says fills in
fine lines and moisturizes with vitamins
A C and E so good stuff been enjoying it
so much okay show of hands does anybody
out there actually read the description
box because I put a lot of things in
there and something I always put is what
I'm wearing like for basic makeup like
my foundation my blush my eyes my
I put all that down there and something
I have been wearing a lot lately because
I know been typing it down there a lot
is the Maybelline Dream matte Bruce
foundation I know it's like that's been
on the market for so long and I know I
used it when it first came out which was
a long long time ago like was that maybe
even before YouTube days long standing
drugstore product and what brought it
back to my attention I follow a
Katherine Webb on Instagram and she is I
think she does some modeling she's a new
mother she's married to an NFL guy and
frankly I just really like her look I
like her makeup style this her face
she's got a great face okay and one fine
day she posted like a photo of the
makeup that she likes to use and she
said for like quick natural days this is
the foundation she slaps on so I thought
maybe I should be given that dream matte
mousse a second look and funny enough I
was playing with my Catrice matte mousse
before I even had that little finding I
do think I prefer the Maybelline matte
mousse a little bit better for just an
overall finish and coverage and the same
power is really good for me too I wear
it in the shade light for nude wearing
it today
have worn it in a lot of recent videos
the way I like to apply it like you go
into this product if you're not familiar
at all with what this is it's a very
different consistency foundation truly
is mousse like like this could be some
kind of a desert e type thing you could
scoop in with a spoon
it's very very light feeling but it does
give you a matte finish and I like to
kind of go in there with my finger or
you could probably be more sanitary
about it and use like a little spatula
or a little scoop of some sort and I dab
it all over my face and then I just dab
that out with a dampened beauty blender
or Beauty Blender type sponge I've got a
few different ones in my rotation I've
used brushes I've used just my fingers
the sponge is definitely my favorite way
to get it all blended out and make it
look super natural but yet I still feel
I have coverage it's nice for a matte
finish it really blends out super easily
so that was a fun little like kind of
rediscovered find something I knew I'd
used in the past but it's fun when other
people bring that stuff to the forefront
another thing I've been love love loving
and I mentioned this in my highlights
that don't look like highlights video it
is the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
liquid the champagne pop shade in the
liquid so it's a pump you get a lot of
product in here by the way how much
exactly it's 1.7 fluid ounces in here
and I have gotten a little better at
controlling the pump and just getting
the idiot's bit that I want because
usually the way I apply it is I just
want a little bit on my hand I spread it
out and then I pick some up on the small
stipple brush and boom you're seeing
what's going on right there yes that's
the glow I'm talking about it's so
pretty it's so undetectable like I mean
get right up in my business and you
cannot tell that there's actual product
there it just doesn't these things never
look like products if you've got opal or
pearl or various shades that this might
come in they all are so sneaky
so the champagne pop has been my latest
love because I feel like it's even more
umm-hmm it has an even greater tendency
of meshing right back in with your skin
tone you know it's got that little
peachy beige quality to it and it just
looks so good on top of anything or you
can mix it in just straight-up mix it
with your moisturizer mix it with
foundation but I just liked it purely as
my highlight just going right here if
you lip products I've been loving this
bad boy this Almay it's the aged
essentials lip treatment SPF 30 by the
way and it
is rather large if you think that looks
like a big lip balm it is and I've been
using it a lot but it has been like
going down you know what I'm saying but
it's got this little pink core and it
smells ever so slightly like cotton
candy it is really a very accurate take
on cotton candy that light fresh
sweetness and it's such a good lip balm
guys I love putting this on right when I
start my makeup right when I'm getting
my moisturizer and primer and all that
stuff on and prepping the lips with this
my lips have been especially dry lately
having a cold and stuff and it is so so
good
certainly didn't love everything from
that L may age essentials line but they
had a good stick concealer and this is
fantastic as well another lip thing my
NARS Velvet lip glide I do have a full
review on all of these and I would say
my most you shade which I kind of called
this at the start that this would be the
one that I like to use a lot the one
called bound and it's that pretty like
kind of Mavi winter pink as I like to
call it because it's just it comes
across on the lips it's a really pretty
soft pink these are such a special
texture not a liquid lipstick like if I
can put out a little megaphone and say
everybody these are not a liquid
lipstick these are like a lip cream and
they do have a little bit of a staining
tendency on the lips
I think they wear down very evenly they
apply so smoothly like it's really an
experience this is a luxurious lip
product definitely look into that video
I posted where I show every shade oh
quick mention to this product this is
from it cosmetics it's their bye-bye
makeup I have tried quite a few of these
like makeup meltdown type products from
different brands they're like a
cleansing balm that you put on your skin
and they're meant to be really good for
not zapping all the hydration out of
your skin and so I'm like okay how's
this one going to be different I've
definitely put a little bent into this
and I've realized more recently that
more is kind of more with this product
like I started just kind of barely
dabbing a thin layer all over my skin
and it really works a little more
effectively if you goop this stuff on a
little bit you like to to a reasonable
extent and
it's so light like this tub I mean this
feels really really light has anybody
else who has this notice that it's got
like a little bit of a citrusy smell to
it as well I really like that too and it
just feels light as you put it on your
skin but yet it is this balmy like
definitely thicker than a gel cleanser
you know type of feel and so I just
massage that in all over my skin I can
see it just lifting away the foundation
and I get it all up in my eye area too
that's the thing I think I was trying to
go a little too sparingly especially on
my eyes and the last few times I've used
it I've added a little more to that area
and my eyes definitely don't feel
sensitivity to it and it really does a
pretty good job of lifting the makeup
away and then I just get down in the
sink or if I'm in the shower you know
get it all rinsed all I have checked
this double check this multiple times
using my face wash cloths afterward to
see okay how much residue is still left
behind I will find I still have a little
bit of eye residue with this but it
removes the face makeup pretty much
fully I'd say on the eyes it kind of
depends on how heavy I went with the eye
makeup that day frankly how long have I
been using this probably a month or so
now and then I started thinking it's
ridiculous that I'm always following
this up with a face wash cloth because
those face wash cloths cause money you
know and I'm they're not really doing a
whole lot of work for me when this is
removing most of my makeup and I just
want to remove a little extra on the
eyes you know it doesn't make sense so
I've been following this up with a
little bit of my Garnier micellar
cleansing water I've got the pink one in
here which is like the sensitive skin I
still use that at the start of every day
but in the bathroom I've got the one
that has the blue cap and it removes
waterproof stuff and I find just a
little bit of that on a cotton round go
around my face after I've used this my
skin feels so smooth and wonderful after
those two steps and I haven't even put
on any technical moisturizer I mean I
wear some makeup folks I put on some
coverage on my face I've usually got a
pretty good eye going on there and
this does melt it all down quite well
and then just a little follow up with
the cotton round with the micellar stuff
to just take care of any residue and I'm
not meaning like I feel a bunch of thick
sticky residue all over my skin after I
use this because that's really not the
case it rinses really well but just itty
bits of eye makeup that didn't quite get
cleansed away that little two-step thing
has been really nice for keeping a
little more hydration I think in my skin
and then you know go on whatever night
cream and whatnot that I want to use so
those are some big-time favorites and
then I wanted to tell you guys just some
things that I used during this wedding
which was the most beautiful like tones
of blush type of wedding I mean barely
there Pink's cameo like soft beige
pretty colors into a little bit deeper
rosier shades my dress for the wedding I
was a bridesmaid and I had one of the
like darker my dress was almost like the
color of this palette so it was so so
beautiful and I felt like I pulled
several palettes to take with me because
I was doing the bride's makeup and ended
up doing several other people's makeup
too and these things that I took along
ended up working so so nicely with that
whole feel and it's not like oh my dress
is pink my eyes have to be pink my lips
have to be pink no I really liked
accompanying these soft Pink's with
pretty nude just gentle feminine makeup
might be the word to describe it but
something that was so great to travel
with and this would be this is going to
be talked about is probably one of my
top holiday picks ultimately when it's
all said and done it's the it cosmetics
genesee quoi face palette and I really
like this because it contains four
products that it cosmetics actually has
in their line they're not just for
random things but it's a nice sized
space palette here and then they give
you the sunshine and a compact bronzer
this was the only one that I already had
and I knew I liked that bronzer so you
also get the bye bye pours blush in
genesee quoi you get the bye bye pores
pressed powder which I really had wanted
to try so many of you have told me that
that was a good product when I talked
about loving the Too Faced primed and
poreless
then this is a highlight down here this
is the perfect lighting Luminizer it
used to say Janus a quoi but I've
already worked through that I have worn
this a lot my own self I'm wearing all
of these things today and it was just
the handiest thing ever to do people's
makeup you know warm up the skintone
give it a little more life the blush
looks so good in every circumstance I'm
wearing that blush today as well this
was a nice light under eye setting
powder or a little bit of a touch-up if
there was some shine and this highlight
is so pretty I mean it is soft pearly
hangs together not loose and chunky
really really impressed with this
palette and the bronzer is exactly like
the bronzer that's sold in full-size
that's the only one I really have to
compare to a full size and see like is
it the same quality that's the only one
I had beforehand but I really have been
happy with everything I see why so many
of you like this bye bye pores pressed
powder that one really is smooth and
nice to work with everything in here is
matte except the highlight so the
bye-bye pores obviously since that's
kind of like a translucent powder you're
not seeing it a whole lot but that blush
is matte also so so pretty love this the
quality of the combo products and then
the convenience factor is so great for
travel to have all those things in one
few other things that I enjoyed using I
will use this on myself and at least a
couple other people was this becca
hombre rouge palette talk about pretty
tones of rose there all the way to
Burgundy I'm wearing this again today
and I just think it's so wearable so
easy really nice smooth matte eyeshadows
a light cream color a soft like very
soft
pinky lilac dusty mauve this gorgeous
kind of warm brown and then a deep
burgundy maroonish color I find these to
be insanely easy to blend great for that
you know kind of burgundy smokey eye but
just so-so no-brainer you know there's
not a lot to it
I also took my styled by her Uche
palette here because it had a nice
peachy blush in case I wanted to go more
peachy on someone's blush instead of
pink and then I really found myself kind
of stay
with these mats down here on the bottom
there's a mat like soft warm brown a
little bit deeper Brown topi kind of
color and this shape here called smitten
I almost just called it mitten but it's
a really nice texture of a shimmery
shade for just that little pop of Sheen
on the lid I've done a full review on
this product so please check it out if
you have questions but I took my bite
the perfect bite set it's a set of four
amuse-bouche lipsticks so bites newer
formula of lipstick just mini sized and
I loved what was in here because
everything had like a hint of neutral
behind it I felt you're getting a nice
nude and honeycomb a little bit deeper
nude with pepper fig it's like a
gorgeous gorgeous wearable every woman's
pink and then nori is your nice deep
rich brick-red brownish neutral today my
lip color is a mix of pepper and nori
and that's what I love so much about the
set they're great standalone lip colors
but they're awesome to mix as well you
can really get that ideal shade that's
not you know maybe a really pop and
bright color I mean it's certainly not
all of these shades are kind of rooted
in this rosy neutral place so I really
like the set again for more info please
check out the full review but as you can
imagine a set of mini lipsticks very
much an ideal thing to take with you and
it fit the color scheme and just the
whole look of the wedding I thought so
well now I've got a few little fails
number one this I got from Dollar Tree
and they had a bunch of sponges that
look like this I'm kicking myself for
not keeping the packaging because I
don't I don't know where that is now
some dollar trees I feel like had
fantastic selections of makeup
mine has a crapload of nail polish a few
lip products and a bunch of these
sponges that do not work various colors
again I saturate it fully with water at
the sink and it just doesn't grow in
size it doesn't get any softer than it
is currently I had high hopes I thought
maybe this is going to be like that
amazing $1 bargain makeup sponge but
it's just not spongy enough it does not
come close to doing what a Beauty
Blender actually does another little
gripe I have here is the urban D
caper version waterproof fine point I
pin this is a style of liner that's like
it's not a little brush tip it truly is
the felt tip I have had some even more
inexpensive felt tips that don't give me
this problem but this one has been just
in a continual state of fraying a little
bit at the tip let's see how good the HD
is my friends can you see the tip right
now there's even a little bit of stuff
fraying off the end just that little bit
of felt tip you know fabric and I find
myself having to go in there and I try
to get it off and it's just a problem
and it's been that way from word go it's
just given me that little obstacle and
it's not good when you're trying to be
super precise like right in here or get
a really nice wing and you feel like
you're constantly getting pieces of a
felt tip coming off what you just saw
there was probably to the lesser extent
of what I've dealt with and then I feel
like it's been worse than that at times
but it's really nice in black and it
seems to last well and it dries down
matte and it does a lot of things that I
like but I just can't deal with that
fraying type aspect last little thing
it's not like a full-out fail but it's
more just a little word of caution here
on the tardis Pro lash glue this is an
all-out black lash glue it's not even
like you know that some of the duo dark
tone lash glues that start grayish this
is actually black right out of the tube
and I would definitely caution any false
lash beginners from using something like
this because if this gets a little bit
off like if you place your lashes down
and then oops one end of the lashes just
hit me on the eyelid and now I've got
black glue there it's not so easy to
just pick it up right away and remove it
like I have had to actually redo
portions of and I look like get out some
remover get the glue off go back in with
eyeshadow patch over the problem area
it's not cool it takes a lot of time and
if you're very confident with the strip
of lashes that you're using you know
they are a perfect fit for your lash
line maybe you've used them a lot and
they've just kind of bonded you know
with the shape of your eye that's one
thing you can put this dark glue on and
apply with some confidence
but if you're experimenting with a
different kind of band and maybe they're
a little bit unruly and hard to deal
with go with your clear lash glues and
then if need be go over you know any
visible glue that remains after most of
its dried with an eye liner you know you
can always do that the nice thing about
it being black is that as soon as you
set it down I mean it really does become
invisible that's kind of the bonus of
using something like this your lash line
as a whole just looks nice and dark and
there's nothing even potentially showing
through so I kind of like that but even
me who's use lashes for years I don't
feel like I can get away with this on
just any kind of lash because some are
difficult some lashes just don't bend
the same way and they give you trouble
and that has caused me a lot of extra
work on some eye looks on several
occasions so I do love my Revlon
precision lash glue the clear that works
super good so that is it everybody that
is my best in beauty for this month
can't believe we are now on to October
but that means even more exciting fall
favorites and more holiday releases gay
thank you so much for sharing your
review requests with me I really
appreciate that and I will see you guys
next time
