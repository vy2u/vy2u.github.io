is going to be a little bit different
kind of best in beauty video because I
feel like I've been talking about a lot
of favorite things lately I had my
rediscovered favorite products so just a
lot of new finds that I recently hold
and so I wanted to focus this video on
spring lip colors I was planning to do a
spring lip colors video anyway so these
are some of my favorite shades for the
season now these exact products I not
only like the shades but I think the
formulas are great as well but I'm a big
advocate of shopping your stash and
using what you have so maybe this will
just inspire you to look through your
collection and find some comparable
shades because while I like the really
bright colors for spring I love those
rich deep kind of reddish orange deep
coral colors I've got some of those to
recommend I also really like the softer
more delicate shades for spring as well
so I'll show you all of these on my lips
and the first thing I want to mention is
this la girl glazed lip paint and the
shade is called elude this is a gorgeous
nude with a very glossy shiny finish and
these remind me a lot of the OCC lip
tars and I'm really surprised for the
popularity of nude lip colors that I
haven't heard more about this particular
shade because it's like the perfect
balance of a little bit of peach in the
shade a little bit of pink but still
very neutral now if you like a matte
finish on your lips but a really muted
pink shade I would totally recommend the
elf matte lip color and TIROS this was
one of my rediscovered favorites I
really like the format of these matte
lip products these twist up sticks are
super easy to apply and that lip colors
are fun because you can stick with that
matte finish or you can play around with
it and apply a gloss on top another soft
shade that I really like from bite is
called fig and I know I mentioned this
also in my rediscovered products video
but this totally reminds me of Baby Lips
literal lips of a baby and I see those
lips every day on bail and it's just you
know that soft pinky color that you're
born with just that wonderful flush
pretty look to the lips and this is that
shade basically in a lipstick so I love
this color from but I love the formula
as well I've talked the luminous cream
lipsticks to death but fig is a really
nice one and actually this particular
duo I don't use this other shade as
but it's got date at the other end which
is a nice kind of nude shade and I was
so thrilled because I've got this double
ended bite lipstick and another one to
talk about and I got these in a multi
pack set you know around Christmas time
but I found on sephora's website that
this one than the other one I'm going to
mention are actually still available
individually in these duos so you can go
for this one or a brighter one that I'm
going to talk about speaking of bright
and moving into some colors that have a
little bit more of a pinky purple vibe
to them this colour-pop lippie stix in
the shade wifey this is a satin finish
shade and I love this color this is so
fun for spring a great statement lip
color I pictured this on with like a
nude I may be just some winged liner and
then this on the lips it would be so
pretty it's a great pop of color I have
quite a few of these lippie stix that
could come under the category of great
spring lip colors any of the ones from
the in bloom collection I really like
those as well but I did show all those
off in my color pop all now something
with a really different finish than
stuff I normally talk about is this Too
Faced melted metal liquefied lipstick
and this is the shade melted metallic
jelly and I've got to admit I have not
really loved some of the lighter shades
from this collection because I just feel
like they come off too frosty sometimes
they look okay like here in my house but
then I go out and you do that rearview
mirror check and I'm like woah you know
that's way too frosty this shade though
I really think pulls off that metallic
finish really well I was wearing this on
my blog recently getting back to
blogging folks so check out those posts
but and this is a gorgeous shade on't
think you need to rule out your deeper
berry shades for spring and summer I
think a way to really keep them relevant
so to speak or keep them very wearable
is to pop a shade like this on the lips
and then go very bronzy you know on the
skin and on the eyes now the shade that
I've been wearing throughout this video
is from bite and it's called lingonberry
it's a beautiful kind of fuchsia pink
type shade and I've done a few
side-by-side swatches lingonberry is in
the middle right over here I did a
swatch of bite Palomino which is a shade
I've talked about a lot it's another
gorgeous kind of berry pink color but
lingonberry has a hair more purple in it
beside that this lightest shade that's
wifey the colour-pop lippie stix that I
mentioned so that's gonna be a little
bit lighter might come off a little
brighter on the lips as well but I
absolutely love this tone I think it's
so beautiful and then on the other end
of that is a great shade for those of
you who love those bright pops of coral
this is tangerine and these bite
lipsticks are just a really creamy
formula there's no shimmer in them
they're just pure color they go on so
full color so velvety on the lips but
not matte they do have a little bit of
shine and I just think that's a really
great duo for spring now if you do like
that orange e tone and more of a matte
finish you might want to check out these
new things from Rimmel I found this at
Target but it's the show off lip velvet
and this is the shade called orange
ology and this is really beautiful it
kind of gives me that old-school glam
kind of effect when I have this on but I
think this shade definitely goes more
toward orange less toward red so just
keep that in mind but these feel so
great on the lips for a matte finish you
know it's the kind of thing that has a
wand applicator so it goes on feeling
very very creamy but it does go down to
a matte finish so I think those are
really great now an awesome
low-maintenance
warm reddish color is rich girl red from
Revlon this is the shine finish of their
Super Lustrous lipstick I'm really all
about these reds that I think look so
nice and summery because they have that
hint of orange in them and this is a
great kind of low-maintenance lip color
because I think it's the most sheer
thing I am going to mention in this
video so it's giving you that color
punch but in a slightly softer way I
really like that and also loving my
Estee Lauder pure color Envy lipstick in
blossom bright this is the shine formula
and this shade I would just describe is
watermelon it's a great kind of pinky
red it really pops on the lips I have a
full blog post about this shade as well
I just think it's gorgeous also I think
what's really special about the pure
color and the sculpting lipsticks from
Estee Lauder is the fact that the
formula is so long wearing but it never
feels drying on my lips I mean if you've
tried these you probably know what I'm
talking about they go on there's a lot
of creaminess softness a little bit of
shine but they stay
feeling so comfortable for so long so
that's a really nice option if you're
looking for something bright and I want
to wrap this video up with a gloss that
I think is just tremendous for this
season loved all those deep burgundy
Reds brick Reds for fall and winter but
this is the L'Oreal gloss and Rouge
Allegro this particular shade kind of
reminds me of a combination of a cream
and a gel but it's still very pigmented
it's got a lot of color on the lips and
a lot of shine but it's not an
overwhelming red to apply it has that
little bit of Sheerness you know it's
not 100% fully opaque and I kind of
liked that about this product I think it
makes it very user friendly and just
very appropriate for this time of year
so that's my best in beauty lip edition
I hope you guys enjoyed this and maybe
got some new ideas for some lip products
to try for this time of year some great
bright colors but some really nice light
delicate tones also so thank you so much
for watching I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
