some of my favorites from over the
course of the past month and I know I've
mentioned it in some of my vlogs I can't
remember if I mentioned it here on this
main channel but we are in the process
of moving we're very very excited about
our new home fits within our same towns
so we've been slowly you know getting
some things together getting them over
there before our big moving day coming
up soon so it's kind of changed my
beauty routine a little bit I am looking
for like really simple things
multitaskers this is all kind of
no-brainer beauty stuff I put together
all my favorites and I realized wow this
is all really simple stuff really good
like quick solution kind of products
great for summertime some of them are
even kind of cooling during pregnancy
it's really nice so I'm just gonna jump
right in and tell you about what I've
got here first off a couple of lip balms
one of them is kind of noon it's the
soft lips cube some of you may enjoy the
soft lips that are in like the really
skinny kind of short twist up tubes well
now they've got these cubes and they
kind of do remind you of the EOS Style
lip balms called vanilla bean and it's
five in one lip care and it has an SPF
15 and as I realize going out the other
day you know lips can easily be
neglected from you know the SPF you put
all over your face you don't always
think about your lips so it's nice to
have that in there but this is really
the same kind of texture you may know
and love if you're a fan of soft with a
really nice sweet vanilla bean scent but
yet it has that slight cooling feel when
it goes on your lips so really really
smooth I think very hydrating if I'm
just sitting here around the house this
is the kind of thing I want to grab and
pop on or maybe I'm just starting to do
my makeup and I want to get my lips kind
of pre hydrated before I go on with
other lip products this is a really
really nice one and just very refreshing
like it does have the really nice feel
on the lips and super smooth and then
the other one that I like also this is a
great texture don't get me wrong
but the scent of this is like so
energizing if you're a fan of citrus I
mean this pink grapefruit scent from the
body shop is just killer I love it but
basically just a colorless lip balm and
the scent is so intensely fruity like
the body shop I mean I don't know where
I've been but I guess I haven't had a
lot access to body shop products like in
person just to browse but I think last
month I was talking about the vineyard
peach body butter loved that peachy
smell and then this pink grapefruit is
just so dead-on like if you had me close
my eyes and stuck a grapefruit under my
nose you know it could just as well be
the real thing
next thing super refreshing love the
just the sensory experience when I apply
this and I got this little size when it
was on HauteLook and I'm totally going
for the big size whenever I can
it's the Josie Maran rosy myth says
refreshing rose water it's just kind of
a mist you can put on any time really to
refresh your skin rehydrate it a little
bit I don't see it as a super hydrating
product like if your skin is parched and
you give a light mist of this it's not
gonna change things drastically but for
my purposes it's kind of like you know a
midday pick-me-up or I even like to just
spritz it on after my moisturizer just
cuz I love the scent clean crisp floral
rose scent it's not like spraying a rosy
perfume in your face there's something
just very light about it and I love that
size is gonna be handy to keep in a
purse or you know have on the go but it
just feels so cooling and so refreshing
I could see me getting a big size of
this putting it in the fridge and
throughout the summer just pulling it
out and giving a nice refreshing mist
don't think that's been really nice for
me as kind of a skin prep step and I
know I've mentioned this before but I'm
still like this has been my go-to primer
pretty much as of late and it's the
Garnier five-second blur I do have a
specific review just on this product but
this has been so nice for really getting
the texture of my skin in the place I
want it to be before I put foundation on
because you know we're apply
moisturizer maybe that contains your
sunscreen or whatever you got to get
that on and sometimes these different
moisturizers leave my skin even after
you feel like you've given them adequate
time to really sink in they still leave
your skin feeling a little bit tacky and
I don't really love putting foundation
directly on top of that kind of texture
because I feel like I don't get as easy
of a blend first off or as even of a
blend so with this it's like silky
smooth it's really lightweight
there were times early on where I was
mainly like focusing this just around my
t-zone because I do think it has an
impact on areas where you have pores or
visible pores lately I've just been
taking like a pearl sized amount size of
a small pearl or a small pea maybe and I
just dot that all over so if you've been
looking for a drugstore primer that
might be one to check out mentioned
packing up a ton of my makeup brushes
and so I've left myself with some things
that either I just must have day-to-day
or things that can be really good
multitaskers and by the way if you are
interested in my most used makeup
brushes I made a video all about that
it's a tutorial and a kind of brush
favorites video rolled into one but one
that's been so awesome is this elf
complexion brush $3 brush I have several
of these elf studio brushes that I'm
just completely amazed by I mean for the
cost you're getting great quality this
is such a soft brush really dense as
well but the thing that makes this such
a good multitasker I think is the shape
you can see it's really pinched in there
at the top of the ferrule creating a
slightly more flat powder brush so while
this can put on my powder really nicely
it can also contour very well in the
pinch this can do blush too I mean come
on it's just a total multitasking brush
when you're going through products
really quickly don't have a lot of time
or maybe you're traveling you just need
something to throw in there that can do
a lot of face functions for you this
would be ending this out with a couple
of products one for cheeks one for eyes
that I feel like had been so universally
good for me
regardless of what the look maybe what
the outfit might be or whatever rush
that I'm talking about that I think is
just been a total go to is the bombs
frat-boy blush here all of these classic
blushes from the balm they've got down
boy they've got hot mama these are all
great blushes this one though I feel
like you know no matter what lip color
I'm going after this looks really fresh
and just like it was meant to be on your
cheeks you know with whatever the look
is this is a matte blush and I would
call it kind of a soft warm pink quality
of all of these blushes from the balm
it's just outstanding whether you're
talking about the insane blushes or the
ones from just the regular original line
but this just works with anything love
it and then total summer must-have for a
quick eye look
this product has been mentioned before
it's going to get mentioned again for
good reason I mean it's just such a
great little shadow to have in your
collection
it's the L'Oreal infallible shadow in
bronze taupe okay this is one just a
wonderful shade for a one shadow looking
it looks super shimmery when you get it
concentrated but the whole point of a
one shadow look is that to me you can
pat it on your lid and you kind of get
one effect from the product but then you
diffuse it and you apply it more sheer
in the crease and it practically looks
like a whole different color so this is
the shade that I'm wearing packed on my
lid blend it up into my crease and
smudged a smudgy liner on my lower lash
line it's so easy all you need are like
you know a few different brushes that
you can work with and then one eyeshadow
if it's this right kind of mid-tone type
shade with a little shimmer it can
totally take over your whole eye look
and be just a really simple thing guys
those are my no brainer favorites these
are the things that I have needed to
work quickly for me to be effective for
me work well in the summer just really
easy great beauty products to have in
your stash and I would totally recommend
them to you guys so thank you so much
for taking time to watch this video and
I will continue to hopefully have those
daily reviews still coming on my Express
channel as our move goes on I've been
trying to work ahead we do have some
painting going on in the new house so
I'm not sure how that may affect going
into the next week it all kind of
depends on when that gets done and how
soon I can get all my stuff in there so
thanks for being patient with me I
appreciate it and I'll talk to you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
