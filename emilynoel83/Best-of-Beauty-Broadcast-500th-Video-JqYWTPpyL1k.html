even saying this right now but this is
my 500th video I mean thinking back to
late two thousand seven when I first
started making videos I mean I had no
idea it would have grown to be what it
is today and that I don't know that my
passion for it would be at the level it
is right now I thank you so much for
over the years tuning into my videos
giving me feedback telling me what you
want to see because often times people
will ask me you know how do you get
ideas to keep making videos like you do
and I say it's the viewers it's you know
people telling me what they want to
watch well I want to take a look back at
what I consider my top 10 video videos I
have done that I really have liked the
most and that are some of my personal
favorite back I rewatched a lot of
videos I and you know notice the video
sounds like wait I did that video my
number 10 video is one that I did
somewhat recently and it is my
surprisingly awesome makeup products
makeup products that you make all under
rated things that there's just not a lot
so that video is just sort of bringing
to the forefront some products that
might get swept under the rug from being
you know chief or not good or just
assume to be not that great but things
that I've tried and I really feel like
her valuable parts of my collection
today and it was just interesting I got
a lot of good feedback on that video a
lot of people you know kind of agreeing
with me or people saying hey I'm
surprised at that I'm gonna try that out
any people as drug store and not good
enough it's covered for number nine is
my super simple taupe shadow tutorial
ever have those days where you're in
such a rush you just wish you could
maybe reach for one eyeshadow to create
your whole look well that's i'm going to
show you now this video i did quite a
while ago and and the concept behind
this was taking one shadow and basically
using that to create your entire I look
and you're just using different
different brushes and stuff to put it on
to get a different effect and so that
that shadow that tapestry tote from
covergirl is really a great shade and so
and it's just kind of a different way of
going about a tutorial so many times
we've watched them and there are so many
products used in this just really a
simplified look but a pretty look and
one that you could do on just a daily
basis really easily multi-dimensional I
look just beat by using different
application number eight is the
five-minute face alright that concealer
under your eyes with your ring finger
how long do I have for this week only 20
seconds i'm using this smart shade so i
got this book it's by Carmindy and they
suggested these steps of how to go
through and get all your face makeup
done in five minutes and I just I mean
Tyler was really there for necessity I
needed somebody to be on that stopwatch
to get me through it and it was a you
know a early morning on a weekend and we
just went through it and busted it out
and those kind of videos are so fun
where I think I am you know
experimenting and you're seeing happen
as I do it you know it's like okay I
have not tried this before we're all
discovering how this works at the same
time I think those videos are bringing
to it yes there we go Oh Tyler thank you
so much for timing me out on that um I
remember seven on my list is what's in
Kaylee's makeup but is just awesome
great friend and we always have fun
whenever we're together and she's been
here for the last couple days and we've
been having so kayla is one of my very
best friends and i find that those are
some of my favorite videos looking back
the ones i like to pull up and look at
again are those ones that incorporate
you know the people in my life that are
really close to me and so having Kaylee
there I mean yes we did a lot of goofy
stuff in that video as you'll see in an
upcoming video that I will have on my
list um it may show up again intent but
what's in caylor's makeup bag was just
so fun because she just has some
products in there that she just loves
and then you know she's just kind of let
that point learning about new products
she likes and doesn't like it's just
kind of a hilarious way of going through
her packing and snooping around at what
she has she turns my hate for makeup
into an ex okay
and that like I want to learn more I
can't number six is em's world to the
second m's world I ever did in its
titled lights camera action my checkups
from mo Mic Check one two three okay
here is a Kevin putting its maker and
quick cover girl a girl basic we are
going on the air in minutes 45 seconds
once we go in HD baby Kevin will let me
be as makeup artists absolutely will
absolutely so this video is a hole
behind the scenes look at what happens
at the TV station and basically what my
typical morning is because I'm a warning
news anchor so I have really odd hours i
wake up basically in the middle of the
night so you see me when I'm standing
there with no makeup on right in front
of the mirror that morning and then I
take you through basically how we
prepare for the newscast how we go
through it and just what it's like it's
something you may never see if you don't
work in news and you don't maybe know
somebody that has or you've never taken
a tour of your local TV station this is
kind of a pretty good indication of what
it is like to be working these hours and
doing what I do so I hope you enjoy that
we sit at work taping a behind the same
video for my youtube channel and that's
what you're doing that is exactly what
I'm doing see I don't live with my
tweets I'm doing exactly what I say I am
stands number five is my 300th video
blooper extravaganza this was a
celebration video when I hit that 300
video benchmark forget about the sky oh
the eyelash curler close your eyes a
little bit well not all the way just
look forward look it looks like right
here okay oh we did a good job I just
had to put this on the list because of
any video that I go back and watch of
stuff that I've done this has got to be
one of the main ones I turn to if I want
a good laugh because I'm laughing at
myself I'm laughing at my friends at
Ryan Kruger who also works at the TV
station with me he is in this Kaylee
Tyler I mean lots of people contributed
to the great bloopers in that video and
I just makes
laughs there are so many moments when I
when I'm taping these videos that are
just laugh out loud funny at what you
know did I just say that you know did
did I try to just make sense there and
it totally didn't make sense at all so
if you haven't seen that I think you may
get some laughs at you as well Vic fist
book 2 6-packs MN out there let's uh
let's save a foundation you know like
you're building a house you know it's
all right you have you gotta be on manly
and construct that layer of foundation
on the face ok so manly like you'll
you'll put on the beige foundation what
Brian I use covergirl number four is my
easy outer V shadow technique the
intensity of the shadow is going sort of
out like this from the I sort of in like
a sideways V my like interesting about
this video is I had been doing videos
where I was showing you know here's how
your eyeshadow your tank at the outer V
but it wasn't sort of until this time
that I had created this strategy where
you were putting your liner on before
your darkest eyeshadow and using that as
a guide for where to do the outer V so
it's really helpful I thought I really
like the look I had in this video i was
using mac eyeshadows as well so it kind
of gave people and a different
perspective beyond the drugstore
products that I so often use and I just
really like the look of created and to
this day that will be something
especially when I'm getting ready kind
of in a hurry in the morning hours and I
want that polished finished lifted great
look on the eye area but I want to do it
fast I just think that this is a
technique I just used over and over
again just really helped me to make sure
that I'm getting it even on both sides
and all that number three on my top 10
countdown is my Katy Perry Russell Brand
halloween makeup tutorial
I could not leave this video off the
list because this is probably one of the
most original ideas that I have put into
action I can't say I came up with it
because my sister challenged me to do
this it was one of those ideas where I'm
thinking oh my gosh how am I going to
possibly pull this off and then I do it
and I'm like wow this is weird but this
is fun because I did Katy Perry on one
side Russell Brand on the other I
figured out a way to make it look like
whiskers on my face i mean i was given
myself quite the eyebrow it was just a
really really fun tutorial and it's the
type of thing that i want to do in the
future is just something totally
different totally off the wall and
definitely a good time this is more for
fun than anything I'm not a professional
I'm just having fun with the products I
had on hand at number two is my m's
world 18 going back to college so this
video brought back so many memories for
me because I was going back to Monmouth
College we went to a football game Tyler
and I we met up with a bunch of friends
we got to walk back around campus and
look at all the changes that have been
made since we were there which wasn't
all that long ago but this is a school
it's really growing and changing just in
the past few years and it was definitely
a spot at the stadium there were we kind
of were able to relive some memories
that was where Tyler proposed and so
that video took you through all that and
this was a really involved editing
procedure on this video I spent a lot of
time with this cuz it's just
event in my life that was so memorable
and it was awesome to get to share that
sort of thing with you your YouTube
video
hey
number one on my list is a video called
viewer favorites asked what of the
products that I have recommended on my
channel over time what sorts what things
have really worked well for you now this
video is really special to me because
not only is it a unique topic but
basically what I did here is I said you
tell me the products that I have
recommended to you that have really been
a success for you so I mean I think that
really says something when you're
watching this video it's it's this is
the reason why I really hope you will
take the time to watch this video if you
haven't already because it's not just me
saying I like this stuff it's other
people kind of validating that and
what's awesome is I went back through
and I watched and I'm like yeah i still
love all these products that are
mentioned here so i would really suggest
you go back through and watch that i got
all this feedback that i collected
through the facebook page and stuff and
it's something i kind of want to do
again or periodically do because i do
think it's a very easy way for people to
see what on a wide scale has been a very
workable product right up in my videos
so here you're going to be seeing not
just what i like I mean
so thank you guys so much like I said I
would never imagine that would be
sitting here saying this is my 500th
video on this channel I mean when I
started I was doing that first little
elf brush review and I'm sitting in my
extra room of my apartment just kind of
quietly doing the video like this
because somebody might hear me in the
next room and I'm kind of scared now i
feel like i am looking at this camera
but i am talking to so many friends that
i have out there and so thank you for
sharing in this with me giving me ideas
following me on facebook twitter here as
a subscriber you mean so much to me and
you have this channel wouldn't be what
it is without the suggestions you've
give so thank you again so much for
watching I appreciate all your support
over these pests just over three years
now so keep on watching and I will keep
on making videos have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
