to sit down here and shoot something
other than the Emily Awards because
that's what I've been working on so much
for the past couple of weeks so if you
haven't seen those videos they're all
there the face eyes lips and the finale
which is a lot of random stuff like
brushes and tools and fun categories and
stuff like that but thank you so much
for the sweet feedback on those videos
because Tyler and I worked really hard
on it and we had a lot of fun too but
I'm just so thrilled that you enjoy
watching those and look forward to those
every year right now I really have some
things that I've been wanting to talk
about for a while because I got some of
this stuff at IMATS and then also the
week before that Kristen was down here
staying with me and we shop for some
things as well
IMATS by the way it was super fun and I
still need to get together a little
material on the vlog channel that was
shot while we were there but it was just
so so nice I'd never been to LA before
it was great to meet so many of you
there's like you watch your videos and
you see comments and you chat with
people on Twitter and stuff and you have
a sense that there are a lot of nice
people watching but then you see them in
person like oh they're really really
nice so I love you guys thank you so
much for chatting with me there and it
was just a lot of fun I was at IMATS I
made sure to stop by the Knicks area by
the way I've got glasses glam today
I just needed a break from my contacts
but there's a big Knicks booth and of
course things are really majorly
discounted when you're I'm at so I made
sure to pick up some things that I
wanted to review a couple of them are
these newer pallets that they've come
out with these six color palettes one of
them is the adorable shadow palette and
the other one is the sex bomb palette
and this one I actually did post a look
on Instagram with these shades I was
really intrigued by that red it's a nice
matte red it reminds me a lot of the NYX
cherry shade and then you've got some
neutrals some maths some shimmers I
wasn't like blown away by this palette
not every shade is just amazing like
this taupe is actually a little bit
disappointing kind of
most likely do some sort of review on
this oh and I meant to do my nails last
night but it was Superbowl and I just I
couldn't make that the other one the
adorable palette again I mean it's a
decent palette but I'm not like over the
moon with the pigmentation of these or
anything like that there are some nice
really basic mattes in this palette all
in all I mean there's just tons of
neutral palettes out there right now so
I can't really see this as something
that I can't live without you know what
I mean so I'll make sure to follow up on
those another thing I found at the booth
that was new were the NYX baked shadows
and they're just singles like this kind
of different packaging you know a little
more extravagant than usual and I got
this single in the shade called chance
and it looked like just a really pretty
basic mid-tone shadow to me see how that
it's kind of topi maybe a little purple
in there I thought it might be nice for
like a one shadow Lovings pretty
promising and I think it could be the
kind of shadow that you could put all
over the lid it kind of catched the
light and then you get it up in your
crease and it really looks kind of dark
and smoky when the lights not hitting it
another thing I found that I've been
looking for for a long time because I
hear people rave about this and it's
never in stock I just don't think it's a
shade that gets carried at Ulta but it's
the next blush in taupe and this is
known to be a really good matte
contouring shade see how cool it I've
used this a little bit but I feel like
it's kind of light for me I hardly
notice it when I'm contouring like
contouring my cheekbones with it so I'll
have to maybe you know keep using it a
little bit see what may be the best
method of application is for me but I
was glad to finally be able to find it
it's also making mineral foundation
sticks now this is the one I have it's
called cool tan and it seems to have
pretty good coverage so far I just used
this kind of like a concealer a time or
two I haven't tried this just all over
my face as a foundation stick but the
texture is really nice and creamy it
kind of reminds me of the one from
flower beauty and that's sold it well
more a really cool thing that I saw
this gorgeous radiant orchid color is
the NYX primal colors in hot fuchsia and
this just says face color I think this
could be an eyeshadow I think this could
be used in whatever capacity you can
think of to use it but it's matte and
it's very vivid I mean it's just look at
how that color just pops I just had so
many really cool bright bold colors but
this one just really spoke to me or
screamed at me because it's that bright
another thing that I was really
interested in was the dark circle
concealer this is another new NYX thing
I got this in the shade fair and on the
actual little box it claimed to have
like orange toned pigments and you know
I talked about like those salmony
concealers being really good for
counteracting dark circles so this is
what mine looks like I almost wish it
was even more salmony than that like
because if you compare it to my pixie
correction concentrate see how this one
has even more of like that Orange II
feel to it so I'm not saying this
couldn't conceal I've only used it a
couple times but it definitely doesn't
have as much salmony tone to it as as
this one does there's a new primer
called angel veil and I had not even
heard of this until I saw it there at
the NYX booth it says skin perfecting
primer treat your skin to this ultra
velvety oil-free primer
feels lighter than a cloud and leave
skin looking and feeling divine it goes
on the skin and it really does feel
light almost like a cream to powder sort
of finish those stinked with products
like that that turned to a very dry
finish once you blend them out is that
it may not be the best for people with
like dry patches or issues like that on
their skin I have never tried a NYX
brush but as I was waiting in the line I
was standing right in front of a lot of
brushes and this one seems like a really
good size to me and I have totally been
enjoying it ever since I got it it is
this brush from NYX and it's called the
small eyeshadow brush for smokey eyes it
has a be 31 on it I don't know if that
means anything to
Denson all and it's really soft but it's
got a lot of like mobility see how the
bristles really move around and I just
feel like it's been really good for
getting shadow in your outer corner
really buffing it in somewhat and it's
just a great brush to give you control
the only other things besides the next
step that I picked up at IMATS were
these um Kailen products and this is a
brand I hadn't heard of before but I
walked past and they looked really
interesting and they're tinted lip balms
and they're in like kind of a different
style format they're like this they've
got the brush up here I know some other
products or package this way as well but
the brush is kind of part of the cap and
then you twist it off and you've got
this product and I was talking to the
guy who was selling these and he said
they are a truly like long-wearing
tinted lip balm I question how much
these actually feel like a lip balm I
feel like they're kind of like a lip
paint almost I just don't think they're
really really moisturizing like I would
expect a lip balm to be but they are
very lightweight and they do last a
really long time and the colors are
gorgeous so I have this mauve I mean it
really looks just like the shade here in
the packaging and then the other one
that I got is cherry blossom and I like
the little boxes so I throw those away
yet but cherry blossom is a pretty light
pink I mentioned this whole involves a
few other places and when Krista and I
were shopping we stopped by Target
picked up a few different things and one
thing she really recommended to me was
this thing from NYC and it's the color
wheel mosaic face powder but the shade
is rose glow I have this in pink glow I
think in the past I've had it in peach
but this is the rose and you can see
it's like more of a like a soft neutral
really an interesting little product
here there's hardly any shimmer in it
and it's so light that you you almost
wouldn't expect it to have much of an
appearance showing up on your skin you
know it's very very peachy maybe just a
hint of pink in there but it really does
like give the face just the softest
prettiest glow so I do really enjoy that
that I actually like the look of that
over the top of is this master glaze
stick I picked up another one of these
since I reviewed the first one it's by
Maybelline and this is the one in just
pinched pink love love love the texture
of these cream blushes they're so thin
they're so lightweight and they're just
super super easy to blend out they're
pink that I've talked about is very
bright this one's you know a little more
toned down but it really pairs nicely
with this blush you just thought this
looked gorgeous this new Maybelline
expert wear quad and sandstone shimmer
the colors just totally appealed to
looks like they've repackaged their
quads once again but this was so
disappointing what i swatched teller's
just really seemed flaky and texture not
pigmented I I really think this could
have been beautiful if the shades were
pigmented but unfortunately that was a
big sum Ulta thinks that I'll just
mention briefly because I have reviewed
these already on the Express channel but
the butter lipstick from NYX I have
those in fun sized hunk and mary-jane
really and digging the deeper colors of
these not so much the light one so
picked up the dream catcher palette this
is in dusk till dawn and I literally
just reviewed this on my express channel
so you can check out swatches the other
thing that Kristin prompted me to get
and I just had not explored these at all
until she mentioned it are these bare
minerals like loose shadow I believe
this shade is called moonshine but
there's a little stamp over the bottom
so I can't totally tell I'm like a
little spring loaded applicator here you
end up with the most like shimmery
metallic rich color imaginable I mean it
is just it's practically like a Miss
it's a really really pretty taupe with
like a splash of Plum in it it looks
more plummy when it's not catching the
light but like this was the only shade
left and just this one like they were
completely bought out at Ulta from
Walmart I ran into this cute little
product from Physicians Formula I just
thought the packaging was too darn cute
to pass up
and this is the sexy booster oh so sexy
eye shadow quad and as you can see it's
a quad of neutrals here and they've done
this crazy thing that I just don't
understand they've put like an overspray
of a very very light shade in the center
of each of these that's cool for the
shoot for the lighter shades that it
almost matches when you stick something
totally light and silvery in the middle
of black I just don't really appreciate
that very much I feel like when I put my
brush in I'm just trying to be careful
about where I'm putting it so I don't
pick up the silver but eventually I
guess that will wear down and probably
won't even be there anymore but it opens
on both sides which i think is something
kind of different for these there's a
mirror and an applicator on the
underside of it I did use this today in
my eye look mainly just using the
lighter shades and then that kind of
taupey brown I also found these new
jumbo lip pencils yeah it's about time
Rimmel came out with some because every
other brand Azzam and these are the
lasting finished color rush and these
are long lasting intense color bombs
they say I have them in the shades on
fire which is like a super hot coral
type color the one I'm wearing today is
called boom Chicka Boom and it's this
really bright pink this has already come
off like I just blotted a little bit off
on a tissue to see how much would remain
and it's definitely going to be
something that hangs around for a while
I think this is like my first day just
even experimenting with these so that's
a really bright pink and then this other
one is called Viva violet and they're
all that format where they just twist up
this one looks a lot like that cranberry
one from Jordana watching these one
thing I can tell you is they're
absolutely really vivid and really like
true to the color you would expect them
to be judging by the packaging so
athletic rounded those up and finally to
finish out this hull of a couple of
things that I found at CVS I have a
hunch that these are limited edition but
a couple of new l'oreal infallible
shadows this one is in burst into bloom
and this one is purple priority both
shimmer we thought this was a gorgeous
kind of different shade of purple that I
didn't already
then you know how do I justify this one
it just needed a partner I guess that's
just a roundup of some of the new things
I've been wanting to tell you guys about
and if you have any specific questions
on some of these things that I haven't
reviewed yet things that you'd like to
see addressed in a future review that
stuff's always helpful to me so I can
really take that into consideration and
focus in on it for a review and I will
make sure to link below to any related
stuff that I've already done on these
products and linked to the Emily awards
videos if you haven't seen those yet so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
