is a big one I've got a lot of things
that I'm trying a lot of the newer
things that have come out fairly
recently elf seems like they are always
coming out with new things if you browse
the website I think there's a new tab
and it seems like there's always
something different on there but a lot
of people have been telling me hey you
need to update your elf favorites you
know favorites from the whole brand and
I really do but I wanted to try some new
things first so I could have more you
know if I'm going to update it I want to
have an updated idea of the new things
in the line and I am going to be doing
like updated favorites for a lot of
different brands coming up soon so be on
the lookout for that as well that I get
asked about that kind of thing all the
time so I'm happy to do it let's get
right into it because we got a lot to go
through and I'll try to give you as many
little reviews as I can I got the eye
makeup remover pads these are sold and
just as you can see a little packet here
of 24 I got these because I wanted to
see you know if they would be as good as
the Almay eye makeup remover pads one
thing I've noticed is that they're not
quite as saturated with remover but they
can do the job for just like I don't
know touching up in the morning if you
notice like I wash my face but there's
still something under there you know
it's a nice kind of refresher type step
and I think these could be more travel
friendly since they're in the little
packet like I would use those two to
sometimes clean off my false eyelashes
and with these I don't think there would
be enough liquid in them to make that
happen guys know I like the studio
blushes in this one I believe has been
around for a while but it is the blush
and twinkle pink and yeah really does
twinkle there's some glitter in there
and if you are not a fan of glitter in
your blushes I would say steer clear of
this I'm wearing it today and I think
it's a pretty color it's actually the
blush itself the powder is pretty
pigmented but you can see some glitter
coming off on your skin I really wasn't
sure how it was going to look just by
the looks of the website but I guess I
should have taken the name twinkle
literally it's going to twinkle it's
sparkling out the elf angled blush brush
guys say that right blush blush brush
okay that's always so hard you say
but this is a really soft brush I'm very
impressed with that when I use it with
this particular blush it can be kind of
powdery and I feel like this sort of
cuts into the product a little more than
I like so I just use a normal non angled
blush brush with this and it seems to I
can more lightly pick up the product but
I actually kind of enjoy this more for
applying some highlight here because
it's a little bit smaller you know it's
not tiny by any means it's very usable
but I kind of like it for this targeted
area up here another brush I picked up
was the small smudge brush and this I
was expecting it to be a little bit
thicker look as I turn it to the side
see how skinny that is it's practically
like the kind of brush that brands like
I think Maybelline will give you with
their cream liner you know it's like a
little just a little flat detail brush
and I think it can be fine maybe for you
know the detailed stuff you want to do
around your eye area wondering if this
might be a dupe for the one by Sigma
that I love so much
that's the e21 and as you can see as I
hold that sideways it's just got a
little more thickness to it and it's
just it's my perfect smudge brush this
one just a little bit thin brushes I got
that I'm really liking is my retractable
lip brush and this is cool it just has
the end there that pops down and then as
you pull it down you get your lip brush
out at the top nothing wrong with that
studio brushes I believe are three
dollars and this is just a nice way to
you know carry a lip brush with you if
you want and it's not going to get all
messed up or mess up your other stuff I
got the elf i refresh and don't you feel
like these deep puffing products are
kind of a trend right now like every
brands putting out something like this
but it's one of those rollerball
products it feels really cool and I
think it kandi puffs the eyes I mean
it's especially if you put this in the
refrigerator it could be very refreshing
that's actually where I'm going to put
this when I get done with this video but
it's not something that could be a
replacement for an eye cream like if you
really rely on an eye cream in the
mornings when you're getting ready this
will absorb into the skin and not really
be hydrating enough to do the job of an
eye cream just in case you weren't sure
on the function of in terms of an eye
refresh that implies that you know
later in the day you might put this on
and I would never really feel
comfortable rolling this on over my
makeup I mean it's just there's a lot of
liquid in that see how liquidy that is I
feel like that could really mess up the
makeup I would encourage you if you want
something to really refresh and
rehydrate the under-eye get the daily
moisture stink I did a whole video on
that and this is you know kind of a
solid moisturizing product and you can
just dab that under your eye takes away
the fine lines and caking that can
sometimes happen there but for the start
of the day to de-puff to kind of liven
up your eye make it feel a little more
awake even for guys I know sometimes
guys and in broadcasting will watch my
videos this would be a great thing for
you morning news anchors are the things
that I still need to mess around with a
little bit to be able to give you a
solid opinion on is the elf lip lock
pencil I kind of got this because I
wanted my mom to try it too and it comes
in just a clear shade it's a twist up
stick and what you're supposed to be
able to do is take this around the
perimeter of your lips and it's supposed
to kind of be a barrier from your lip
product feathering outside your lip line
and up into little fine lines so it has
kind of a waxy feel to we've used
another product kind of like this from a
different brand a while back but I need
to use that some more and let you know
how that is I also was really interested
in the mascara primer this is another
thing from the studio line so of course
it's white and I want to give you a
close look at this brush I am wearing
this under my mascara today I've used
this several times already and I don't
think the formula is a problem with this
it actually reminds me a lot of other
mascara primers but the brush these
brushes that just spiral around and have
kind of I mean relatively speaking
compared to other mascara wands they
have kind of wide gaps in between you
know all of the the bristle clusters
there I feel like sometimes they clump
my lashes together I do not want my
lashes clumping together before mascara
even gets on them you know I want this
to be a lengthening separating kind of
step so it
good with the length but I didn't feel
like I felt like when I went to put the
mascara on it kind of was fighting
against having to break up some of the
clumps that this creative elf precision
liquid eyeliner everybody needs a good
black eyeliner and this has a brush tip
there you can see it's got some nice
black product on there give you a swatch
quality-wise I mean it seems like of the
formula it's nice and rich in black it's
not watery seeming to me at all it's not
a waterproof formula so keep that in
mind this can come off rather easily if
it comes in contact with your tears or
something like that my issue with this
brush is as I go across my lash line as
I continue to make lines with this
mascara the little bristles of the brush
and let's see if the power of HD can
show you here the little bristles of the
brush kind of come apart and to a
greater extent really than you're even
seeing there in the shot you're trying
to get a precise line it really can
create a problem if those bristles of
your liner brush don't totally hang
together if they start to spread out a
little bit then you end up with multiple
lines of eyeliner not just the one you
want so that makes this hard to use for
me and I wouldn't repurchase elf has
come out with lip stains now this is the
one in crimson crush and this seems to
perform like a lot of the different lip
stains do I know NYC has some covergirl
has some it's just that marker kind of
format this is a nice All American true
red look and it's pretty I have no issue
with it I've only worn this one a time
or two I want to wear it some more to be
able to kind of figure out maybe what
the small differences are between this
and another kind of lip stain but really
pretty color very happy with the crimson
crush oh I got the lip exfoliator we
were talking about this on beauty
broadcast live this past week but this
is an interesting little product think
of it as a lip scrub in a stick it's
totally formed like a lip stick and it's
got a gritty texture when you put this
up against your lips you can fee
some scrubbing happening I'm not sure if
this is supposed to leave some sort of
grit on your lips because there was
reference to in the instructions like
you put it on and then you wipe off
whatever residue is left on your lips I
don't have any residue it doesn't seem
to leave anything gritty on my lips it
does leave a little bit of like kind of
a sweet tasting balm but when I use this
I can visibly see it sloughing off you
know the dead skin on my lips and I like
that it works well I'm just not sure
like how this is going to wear down as I
use it with time if you know the
scrubbers and the grittiness like the
brown sugar scrub that this kind of
looks like if that doesn't start coming
up on my lips what's going to happen
this is gonna last forever I don't know
what I'm liking it so far and I'll keep
using it I kind of like to use it at the
start of my you know makeup routine and
really get the lips exfoliated and then
put a nice moisturizing balm on top I've
got a couple of the elf mineral lip
glosses I tried one of these maybe a
couple years ago and loved it it was in
the shade trendsetter love the formula
not too sticky it was really pigmented
really pretty neutral lip shade there so
I got the shades and pageant princess
and that's what I'm wearing now you can
see that's kind of a sheer pink right
it's not um not a real pigmented color I
don't really mind that but I just want
you to know that if you've got real rich
pigmented lips naturally a lot of that
may show through with this color by the
way if you ever been in a beauty pageant
never been in a beauty pageant but I
always whenever I watch the ones on TV I
love the where they ask them the
question and they have to cut like a
current events question they have to
answer it right off the top of their
heads I love that I always wish I could
be in that circumstance I'm strange this
other one is called wild and when I saw
it I thought maybe that's a dupe for max
pink lemonade I really like this shade
it looks like it should it be even
brighter than pink lemon laying it on
thick here and I'm still not getting a
ton of color but it's right there and
when I put this on my lips
not a lot shows through
that's my scar by the way had an oven
incident but there is the gloss and
compared to the mac lipglass in pink
lemonade just let me show you it's a
little more opaque and a little more
creamy there's pink lemonade
there's the elf wild so much more sheer
just just a heads up for you it's hard
to tell with this stuff that you're just
looking at online right other things I
got were a few of the single eyeshadows
the studio collection so these are $3
apiece I believe and I did too a look
with a couple of these this craze a
purple shade this purple passion I have
it on my blog so you can really see how
that comes off in action I did like a
bold lower liner purple look and this is
serious you know this is an intense
color if you are out there looking for a
great purple that's kind of like not
plum purple but a little bit brighter I
think it's so fun it's got kind of a
satin finish to it as well and we're not
seeing glitter and sparkle maybe just a
little bit of a satin finish on that I
really like the other one I got is it
says raspberry I think the name on the
website was raspberry truffle how
beautiful is this color Wow I don't like
a dark brownish burgundy you can see it
has a little shimmer really pretty again
very impressed with the pigmentation
these shadows hand the other shade I got
was sunset I thought this looked like
such a pretty golden peach type color
and this one kind of the most metallic
looking out of the three there's a lot
of I don't know peach enos coming
through and when it catches the light it
looks more gold when it when it's not in
the light it looks PG and there's the
golden I think I might have saved the
best for last these things I'm really
excited about these are the elf lip balm
tints I love how I say it's the elf
before everything I feel like of course
it's an elf all um I got two shades nude
and berry I'm so pumped about these
first off not only do they smell like a
really kind of sweet vanilla scent but
they actually have kind of a taste or a
flavor on your lips so that takes you
back to like your lip smacker lip
smacker days because
lip-smacking days but this is the nude
shade and as you can see it's creamy
it's kind of shiny but it's it's not
sparkly this is just like a creamy nude
kind of glossy balm it's got a really
comfortable texture and nice pigment
look at this
you know what these kind of remind me of
remember when L'Oreal made those L'Oreal
hip jelly balms I think they were called
I love those things they were in little
glass jars they had great colors these
are kind of along those lines with scent
and with texture and this is the berry
shade so it looks like kind of a deep
red and it actually comes off with quite
a bit of color there's that one so
really impressed I'm so comfortable to
wear this is definitely the kind of
thing I could use you know with my
finger to apply or I could use that nice
little lip brush I showed you earlier
but I like these a lot definitely seek
out some other colors of those for sure
so I hope this haul gives you a little
info on some new things from ELF like I
said a new favorites type video from
this brand will be coming soon where
I'll round up you know out of everything
I tried what do I think are the
must-haves from elf so I'll be working
on that thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys later but my
swatch fingers bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
