joining us for this video I'm on
location at pups
hey watch is here pup is my sister in
case you're just kind of getting into my
videos I couldn't sometimes forget that
people are tuning in all the time and
haven't necessarily seen everything I've
done but pup is also Kelly she's yeah
I'm not Irish and we are having sort of
like a re Christmas celebration but we
have a bunch of winter birthdays where
we've combined birthdays and Christmas
to make birth most up wasn't with us for
Christmas time
yeah Jeff and I had the flu just a few
days before Christmas so we had to put
off gift-giving into like Martin Luther
King weekend it's just this weekend but
it did give us something to look forward
to yeah yeah during the most-holy me my
gloomy month of the year we've had
something has always given me for
Christmas time really awesome beauty
related gifts and it's never been a case
where I've asked for something in pups
jizz and got that she just knows and
that's really what kind of started to
get me interested in different kinds of
makeup was when she wouldn't get on
Sephora she knew about Sephora before I
did and then I've got all that going to
just the appetizers long devoured that's
been devoured is 350 of each we've got
some spiced seasonally spiced that
delicious little pies mom made some
sambac cookies and chocolate crinkles
who is responsible for constructing this
little tableau okay can you take one of
those off just so people couldn't see
what this is these are all just we've
just kind of piled them together like a
mountain yeah the rock rocky road it's
got shortbread cashews marshmallows and
a lovely chocolate by the way that's the
Charlie Brown Christmas tree and the
Charlie Brown Christmas and we put a
care of glue in there it looks like it's
yes a lovely caramel yes I thought it'd
be fun to just share with you what
puffer got me Wow Paul Paul Wow
first thing I guess we'll mention is a
little palette from New York it's the
Holiday Collection and it is kind of
just a neutral set of my palettes this
is a little box but the packaging really
takes the game this is like yeah I saw
this I knew I'm had to have this but it
looks like it's like a little patent
leather almost wish the doll baby cool
too happy quilting it's got the little D
sort of embellishment there and then you
pop it open possible mirrors and these
shadows all feel like velvet they're
like a kind of a dark brown and then
just some other neutral shades but you
almost want to eat them yeah and then I
haven't even used them yet but I can
tell I've started to get to where I
think kind of tell by the feel of a
shadow whether it's going to really go
on well and be easy to work with and I
think these will so look for upcoming
videos using this see that's what I love
so just you getting it but it's become
something that can turn into like a
tutorial yeah yeah maybe help people so
I'll be thinking about this one now
ready to go through the individual birth
mistakes could you just tell us what
kind no cupcakes these are okay so who
decorated all of these cakes by the way
and she should be given full credit for
the awesomeness although I did buy all
the special things that you see on the
cakes is responsible for putting them
together
hi Frost me okay so this cake is a
carrot cake there's a carrot cake for
Mom and we just blinged it out link it
up with a little fake little kid rings
yeah this is this is putz lemon yogurt
cake and it may be plain looking but it
packs of mighty women punch and puff is
an art teacher we decorated with all
kinds of crayons
yes running a little low on the memory
card so I'll have to peruse through okay
there's a strawberry cake for dad who's
making all the money and it's now
retired as there's our next we've got
poof's cake obviously with all kinds
with some rings and girly stuff this is
for Tyler it's a new lawyer new man of
the law and we got the zoom here okay
we're good next that's for Jeff's
daughter Melissa it's got all kinds of
compasses and random stuff some rings
that's another lemon cake for our
brother who had way more former National
Guardsman now pen designer now pen
designer and finally that's for Jeff got
whole buncha airplanes out which he
thinks is kind of a stretch next thing
let's talk about this one next this is
from lorac it's another brand available
on Sephora right is that where you got
that how you pronounce it I mean I'm not
very familiar with this I really regret
repair pronounce because I just I think
I've tried like a few stray products
here and there maybe that Chema's free
gifts but I don't know much about it
either baggage yeah this will get me an
America
introduced to the brand and it's called
double booked and what you've got here
is this awesome little sort of like mini
train case little thing and it's got the
adorable buckle if you look really close
at
can see that it's got this sort of
lizard pretty mystery and it pops open
kind of a magnetic snap and suede line
very good and so you can keep I mean you
could take that is a little travel thing
with your skin shears no bird yeah oh
yeah maybe great jewelry box but it also
comes with another neatly packaged
little pallet and so the these are kind
of like magnetic little book thing and
you can see it's got a bunch of
different shadows here on the top layer
I think core if you look horizontally
those sets are designed to be used
together and one was sort of a plummy
color and I think we've got some like
blues and smokey shades a couple of
blushes and a couple of lip glosses but
that would be enough that would be
plenty you know but then you flip it
open again and there's even more colors
and you've got some more like neutral
neutral tones I really like I'm really
glad that it came this way because
there's a lot of like burgundy tones as
well which I think are really pretty
with all different skin types and
there's a mix some of them are matte
some of them are shimmery which is nice
some could work like as eyeliners you've
got a blush and what looks to be maybe a
light colored bronzer and a double-ended
brush and a lip liner in there as well
so have an awesome awesome
well that's by some spatula yeah how it
just fits in he's got a little band in
here that will just kind of secure it if
you wanted to carry it in here but I can
see this is just home and more staff as
class this tells the world I'm a
classroom I am classic and then what is
this next gift
this is the gingerbread house that made
this year you can find out more about it
on our blog
Christmas wig is a hi dad do you have
there I have the strawberry cake I think
they're like mother little coins on a
diva chef is handling the fire here
glamour revolution though this actually
there's a box but the palette actually
looks exactly like just like the box but
this is so cool this is the kind of gift
you open up and you're just continually
noticing more things like it it's not
like okay there's a shadows and blushes
you just discover as you open it so open
up you've got a mirror here that
actually comes out there you can see
that mirror it's yeah it's a magnet it's
a magnet back in and I wish I could show
you in more detail just all of the nice
like illustration a lot of it on here
really cute and then within all this
there's some makeup there's like three
lip glosses which are the mirror mirror
lip glosses that are actually sold
individually which pop got me last year
in full-size square you've got a blush
right there it's a good blush for
somebody pale like me and then you've
got the chocolate bronze are right there
so really dark bronze are probably
darker than anything I have and describe
the smell of all of Too Faced stuff
smells really good
like but what's interesting I think I
mentioned this last year when pup gave
me the little box it looked like a
little jewelry box and had all the stuff
and the powder stuff smells good just
like the lip glosses do so there's a lot
of attention paid to all that detail
another neat thing you might think this
could hold business cards or something
there are cards in here but they are
telling you all the different looks you
can do with the shape I provide are you
going to do a tutorial based on this cuz
totally there's one this is called this
is like your lighter type look then you
got a cool nighttime look giving you a
hint of what some of those eyeshadow
shades are wait there's more there's
more Mel has a beautiful fun on the
candles you just blow it out as we want
make it better because Jackie why don't
you go and make your wish okay you got a
little tag here pull that out
tada it's a whole eyes shadow palette
with nine shadows in it and cheer colors
and say yeah yeah and a little more very
just you know some are neutrals some are
bright you also get a miniature Faced
shadow insurance which you know is my
favorite and then you've got all these
different fun shadows which the camera
really isn't doing them justice right
now some are bright some smoky there's
fun what's this you do you mean to get
to
no I did not to them how you arrived I
did support if you're watching I paid
for too but I really should only had one
but Pub kept hers I couldn't not I was
so intrigued by it and tell me kind of
what you thought about some of these
different things okay little thing all
right well I'm not really into eyeshadow
that much but I really love this brown
there meg dirt you'll find these if
these are real individual shades that
they sell to they're not just limited
and you get a decent amount it seems
like I've been using this for a couple
of months yes label for my favorite all
right I'm gonna do a little swatch of
this shape here this is so unique we're
gonna try to let you know what it looks
like it's this one right here so to look
at it in person it seems kind of like a
charcoal sort of kind of green catches
the light see it there on my finger okay
kind of a metallic a little bit of green
but then as I as I transfer let's
pretend that finger as my brush and I
transfer that onto my hand I'm getting a
really neat Brown neutral yeah and like
I've put this on my eyes and so it looks
mostly brown but then you kind of turn
your head in the light a little bit you
see a little flicker green it's like
there's like somebody there's there's
different finishes you've got a matte
shade up here you've got really really
freakin sparkling Bay desperately
glamazon plate I would be for evening
could that's cool
yeah you know and you could wear these
you know lighter or more concentrated
it's something I've noticed with some of
these is the more concentrated you wear
obviously the more color they're going
to give off so if you want a little
lighter look use a fluffier brush that's
not going to pack it on as much I went
our order much smaller chances
I've already anyway yeah but really what
I tried play one more almost as like a
joke hey look this is gonna look like
and I was a little worried about how
awesome it was and oh there's I love how
it's just a big variety and you got you
could have like a layer these two
together me I am that's the options here
and like I said that on the little cards
it took you gives you ideas on how to
use everything in the palette but opens
up just like a little book that slides
right back in there yeah and you've got
your of course the lip glosses and all
the rest so I think this is a great gift
this is pups painting of her husband
Jeff what this was when you guys were in
you were in Venice and so this is taken
this is was a photograph then it just
created it the first morning we were
there we got through literally I started
taking a bunch of pictures so Jeff is
actually taking a photo while I was
taking this photo that's odds he looked
very intense and across I because he was
looking at the little screen a lot of
people say Jeff looks kind of like
George Clooney

watercolor yeah and this is not done
