quick little announcement I want to let
you know that tonight at 9 o'clock
Central Time I will be on blogtv I
haven't done a whole lot of blog TV
stuff just a few times just kind of
testing it out and seeing how it works
but I wanted to officially schedule one
for 9 o'clock Central Time tonight
Friday night it actually coincides with
Friday night beauty on QVC it is kind of
fun to watch them go through all the
different beauty brands and you see
different beauty experts and stuff like
that on there talking so it'll be fun to
maybe have that going on in the
background of our chats and fun
discussions on blogtv personal stuff and
you know just favorite makeup products
and it's just a lot of fun so I'll have
the link down below and just click that
around 9 o'clock Central time tonight
and we will have some fun and I also
thought while I was doing this video I
would show you my outfit of the day cuz
I really like my little sweater I have
on so I thought I'd show you alright I
don't have the greatest high set up here
in terms of a mirror to show you my
outfit but you can see it's kind of this
longer sweater this is from Wet Seal 3/4
sleeves and it has this tie around the
waist I thought it was so cute
especially paired with you know
contrasting color on the tank top I
thought red would be nice and so yeah
that's my top half but on the bottom I
am wearing some skinny jeans from Wet
Seal and these are just some kind of
taller nude wedges they kind of
crisscross across the front and I
believe I got these from Shoe Carnival
but that was a year or so ago for my
jewelry and this is a little watch it
kind of looks I think more expensive
than maybe it actually is but I got this
from Kohl's it's just kind of a little
puffed watch so I like wearing that when
I'm wearing any sort of gold-tone
jewelry this by the way is what the
sweater looks like up close you can see
it's kind of got some units have a loose
weave I'm not even sure what the
terminology is but yeah it definitely
lets some air flow through so it's not a
real like wintertime sweater my other
bracelet is just one of these like kind
of stretchy I have a set of ten of these
these actually came from QVC for like 20
bucks you got 10
for an awesome bracelets and sometimes I
just like to stack them up so I added
that in there on my nails this is a
Polish from Etsy I can't remember the
name right now but I will post that and
these are my earrings that I wear a lot
these are gold buy these are from
Claire's I wear them all the time so
anyway yeah that kind of wraps up my
quick outfit of the day please join me
on blogtv i'd love to hear from you and
hopefully I'll do a good job of keeping
up with the chat and that kind of thing
it gets a little difficult sometimes but
thanks a lot for watching and hopefully
I will hear from you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
