serve as a quick reintroduction to my
blog a few small things have changed you
may have noticed them already the web
address is also changed so I just wanted
to update you on that information and
just kind of walk you through what
everything means and there may be more
changes to come but I just wanted to
give you all an update so when you visit
my blog you know what's going on so
let's take a look at everyone we are
looking now at beauty broadcast dot blog
spot.com that is the actual web address
the original web address of my blog here
but what I want to let you know is that
I've changed it to make it a little more
straightforward for everyone and the new
address is actually beauty broadcast net
and currently both of those addresses
will work they'll both take you there
actually I got a little message from the
blogger people saying that your blog is
in transition right now so beauty
broadcast net is working for me right
now to take me to my blog but be aware
if it doesn't work for you right now it
will work soon and if beauty broadcast
net does not work just try the original
web address which is of course beauty
broadcast blogspot com now there are
also some changes to the overall look of
my sight this will be changing very zoom
those kind of uninteresting header here
but I know you guys are most interested
about the content you know what's
underneath and I'm pretty proud of that
so anyway this will be a changing in the
near future but another change
appearance-wise is right off the top of
my blog here right over here you'll
notice a little cluster of icons and
this is sort of self-explanatory but
really I just wanted to let you know
that this is just an easy way to link to
all of the beauty broadcast stuff of
course this youtube link right here is
going to take you to my YouTube channel
this T will take you to my Twitter page
and you can follow me there f takes you
to the beauty broadcast Facebook page
and then this is a way you can access
the beauty broadcast RSS feed and if
you're not familiar with that like if
you have your own personalized google
page for example if you subscribe to the
RSS feed like i have here you'll just
get
the instant headlines there when a new
blog pops up another way you'll notice
my blog has changed a little bit is this
little on icon right here that is in the
upper right-hand corner of every blog
now and it says zero tweets and tweet
and basically if you click tweet it will
allow you to link to this particular
blog post on your Twitter page so if you
saw something you thought was cool if
you liked this entry on favorite neutral
eye palettes you could just go over here
and click that and it would broadcast it
on your Twitter page and that way more
people could find it there so this one
has zero tweets so let's get some tweets
going on on that but also you may notice
I think there were some past blogs where
there are some tweets showing up on
there so anyway just one more way to
kind of share the information and make
it a little more convenient than having
to copy and paste and a huge thank you
for all of these little updates here
that you're seeing on my page to my
brother-in-law Jeff because he was able
to get a lot of get the ball rolling for
that for me and kind of introduced me to
some new things there so we scroll down
a little bit and we get to the end of
the blog and here is where you're going
to see another new addition you'll see
this share this section sets add to
facebook tweet this and all these
different links here depending on the
different sites you use dig this stumble
this you know whatever I know Facebook
and Twitter probably a couple of the
more popular ones but basically you
click that and you can once again easily
share the link to this particular blog
post again it's posted at the end of
every blog post so that way you are only
sharing the the post you're interested
in so you'll see that again and again at
the end of the blog and so just click
whatever one of those you want and it
will help you do that the comments
section remains down there as usual as
well as the labels for the different
ones depending on what I'm what I was
talking about there so other than that
guys that blond hasn't really changed a
lot there's still all those great
features like broadcaster beauty
question of the week the Mac dupe forum
and all that my my Twitter updates show
up on the side
I've got a little counter there and
stuff like that so a lot of that stuff
has remained the same not to say it
won't get updated in the future as well
as my little header there but I just
wanted to let you know what is new and
that isn't one for tuning into this
video I know my youtube channel gets a
lot of visitors a lot of feedback and
interaction and things like that but my
blog is really special to me as well and
it's just one more way for me to get out
information to you and some in in some
instances is a more convenient way for
some people than watching a video so
thank you so much for tuning in taking
the time to learn a little bit more
about it and i hope you will become a
follower or just book mark it on your
web browser and tell your friends so
thanks for tuning in guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
