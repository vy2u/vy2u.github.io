the much awaited Claire's eyeshadow
tutorial it's going to be a blue and
purple look so um forgive me because
this is I've been working with my
lighting so much and I cannot get the
true color that I'm seeing in my mirror
here to really come through on this so
you're just gonna have to kind of work
with me and if you've got these colors
and you using yourself you'll know what
i mean by you know how it turns out but
this is the look that I've got on there
right now it's just it's smoked out but
not with really dark colors instead with
more colorful colors and I've already
done my face with mineral makeup and
blush and my lip gloss and just in case
you want to duplicate that look I used
neutrogena mineral shears in neutral to
medium which is honestly not my favorite
mineral foundation but i'm just using it
cuz i have it and i'm using the
maybelline mineral wear or mineral power
bonds are in sunkissed and everyday
minerals blush in Sunday brunch and my
lip color is amused tinted lip plumping
in raspberry okay so i also have already
applied a base on here it is my hip
cream shadow paint in secretive it's
just a very light color that kind of
blends right in with your skin tone and
i'm just gonna take my eye shapes things
over I take my ELF I shadow brush and um
the color I'm going to dip it into is
this is that palette I was talking about
this is where my colors are coming from
and this is the blue right here it's
like a baby blue shade that I'm going to
use and so just dip it in there and I
was going over my entire lid with it
really get the color in there
and this you kind of used sort of a
padding effect like you're going to just
Pat it onto your lid not necessarily
blushy back and forth stroke or a pad in
stroke okay so once you've got that
light shade all over your eye I'm going
to take my fine crease brush and dip it
into this darker blue shade right down
here at the bottom and for this I'm
going to just concentrate this in on the
outer corner both on the lid and in the
crease
and I'm just kind of working this out
just so it just kind of gets on top of
the brow bone they're actually just
blending it in going back from war not
one that really puts on a ton of product
right at the get-go I kind of go back
and build it up as I go alright and once
you've got that then you're going to
take a more fluffy contour brush and now
we're going to start in with the purple
part of this look and so I'm going to
use this shade right here it is a a real
pretty not so sparkly but more so just
shimmery um violet shade and what you're
going to do is kind of create this
little upside down see over that blue
that you just use there ok so we're just
going to going over it and and this is a
light enough shade that you really can
kind of work it up kind of hi there and
now you're starting to get it pretty and
what's what's hard about this is the
closer at the camera it kind of washes
me out so this is kind of hard to see
but I'm just overlapping it with this
lighter purple shade and then next we
want to work with this little outer V
thing we got going and we're going to
just start overlapping that with a
darker purple shade so think of light
blue what we're doing here is basically
light blue on our lid darker blue right
out in the corner a lighter purple up in
here and then we're going to overlap
with some darker purple and blend our
own kind of unique shade in that purple
shade is right here
ok so just dip into that and kind of
work over that outer half look over what
is some pulling out to make this kind of
cat eye look and you'll find these
colors all kind of meshed together and I
wish this color would come out 2222
color on the camera because I love the
way this is turning up
okay so we basically got the look going
right here and then the last step take
one of the lighter shades in this
palette what I'm going to use is this
shade it's like a light purplish pink
and I'm just gonna go just up under my
eyebrow with this
okay just kind of pulling your whole
look together and then under take your
liner brush give it into that darkest
blue shape we used and you're going to
just line just with that powder shadow
under the out side outer half of your
lower lashline really easy there and so
once you've got that then take that
lightest blue shade that you put all
over your lid it's like a baby blue
start at the inside and wine right over
to it so this is kind of a unique liner
technique if you've seen the liner I
usually do so this is kind of like
that's almost like a fairy sort of look
it's pretty colors that you know our
pastel in some parts of the look put a
little more intense than others okay so
once you've got that going on we are
going to use a liquid liner on top and
it's going to be the wet wet and wild
mega liner and it's the purple shade
it's 864 it doesn't actually have a
color written on here but um this is my
little close up mirror that I here um
and then just line your upper lash line
really easy
and I extended out just a teeny bit and
then come back down in that corner so
it's kind of like you're making a little
upside-down check mark in the corner of
your eye but this comes off slightly
metallic so it's really really pretty
with this look and it gives you a little
bit of definition without taking away
from all the color that you've worked
with already alright so the next step is
to curl your eyelashes I'm going to use
my elf eyelash curler I typically hold
them in here for like 15 seconds we're
going to shorten that time purposes here
and I'm going to use my voluminous
carbon black and then putting it up top
right now just kind of wiggling it from
root to tip and what I think of this
look this mascara it kind of creates a
look of like dolls eyelashes you know
what I mean like it really gives you
that that doll eyes look and we're
especially going that for that because
i'm actually going to put it on my lower
lash line to and I kind of like doing
that sometimes when you do a lighter a
lighter liner down there because it
gives you like still some intensity to
the bottom and it really does make this
what kind of like a fantasy look
I really like it okay so now that you've
got your mascara on and you've done your
eyebrows which i already did beforehand
also make sure if you will sometimes
have a little fallout with the shadows
so it's nice to have a lights and brush
around just to brush away the excess and
here we go here's the look guys don't
want to shut my eye too much there i'm
going to get my mascara down on there
but um it's a pretty look and it slipped
eclairs I shadow palettes and I really
do like this palette it's a lot of
different colors and you can get it for
10 bucks at Claire's and some smoky
colors too rosy blues pinks Browns you
name it they're really fun to play with
and blend like we did today kind of
blend it on top of the one on top of the
other and created your own shade so
thank you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
