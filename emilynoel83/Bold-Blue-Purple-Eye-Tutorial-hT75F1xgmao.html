this video I think you're going to like
this look it's kind of a dramatic look
at you incorporate some navy blues some
Purple's some shades that are Matt and
shimmery so it was fun to put together
definitely a dramatic look for a night
out so I hope you enjoy this video and
keep on course I went ahead and applied
my Too Faced shadow insurance all over
my lid and then I'm going to go ahead
and sort of also prime the lid with a
shadow stick it's the wet and wild
idolized pencil in distress and it's
kind of a deep royal blue shade and so
just kind of apply that just kind of
dotted all over your lid is usually what
I do and then I kind of go in with my
finger and blend it out a little bit
next we're going to go to our coastal
scents 42 shimmer palette and so we're
going to be looking at some of the blue
shades in this palette today let me see
here which way was I hold it okay I
gotta make sure i'm picking the right
color i'm going with this blue right
here i'm going to take that with my elf
shadow brush and get that all over my
lid and a little bit up into the crease
as well so just any on I shadow brush
that you prefer kind of pact that color
on and then just pack it right on your
lid
I'm getting it all the way down into the
corner of course on the lid and then
also a little bit into the crease as
well if you just want to kind of flip
your brush the other way around and just
get it in your crease just like that
next we're going to work in a darker
shade of blue you'll notice at the
bottom of the palette there's more of a
navy blue shade you can see it's quite a
bit darker in relation to that other one
and I'm going to take my Sonia Kashuk
medium shadow brush it's a little bit
more of a flat brush that can get right
in there right in that crease a little
easier so I'm going to get that right on
the tip and then just kind of start
working that into the crease and doing
the technique I sort of like to use just
kind of pulling that shadow outward just
a little bit there
now once you've sort of got that shadow
shaped how you want it I'm going to go
in with a matte black shade i'm going to
be using mac's carbon no sparkle to it
at all so it'll provide a little
contrast here i'm taking my fine crease
brush just getting a little bit of that
on the tip and then taking to my crease
right there mainly only putting this in
the outer corner just to deepen it up
just a bit and you may have noticed on
this side you can see sort of a little
bit of a purpley halo on the outside of
this look and that is max sketch you can
see it's a it's a velvet shade it does
have a little bit of sparkle there to it
but not a whole lot I'm going to take my
medium crease brush so a step up from
what I use for the carbon get some of
that sketch on there and then that's
going to be sort of our border on this
look
and with this sketch I'm really um you
know not being not straying away from
this inner corner with that either and
while I was putting it out here as well
you know go ahead and get some right in
here too now it's really going to set
this look off and bring it to life I
think is sort of the shimmer we've got
going on right in through here and also
it'll come again underneath after we do
the liner but that is this shade right
here just kind of a sparkly white shade
or shimmery white there's not really
glitter in it necessarily but I'm going
to be taking that right up under the
brow and basically just you know
covering the whole distance of my brow
here and I'm going a little bit thicker
with this white shade than I usually do
but I think it's just really pretty in
contrast with the purples and blues and
stuff and one more step to kind of add a
little interest to this look I'm taking
one of the pink shades in the shimmer
palette I'll show you in a second and
I'm just going over this inner part just
a little with that it brings out more of
the purple and sketch and it just looks
really pretty there I use this shade
down at the bottom it's like kind of a
pretty pink Imam just blend that right
in it's kind of a last call's or a
decision I did on this side I almost
forgot about it we're going to revisit
some of those shadow shades in a second
when we get to the liner but for now I
am going to go ahead and line my upper
lash line and it will do some more
colorful stuff on the lower lash line
but i'm using my revlon liquid eyeliner
pen and what I'm going to actually do
here is bring that down just a little
bit there and we're kind of elongated
the eye by doing that and it'll make a
little more sense when I come to meet it
on the lower part
for the outer part of the liner um
basically this whole way I've just kind
of kept it close to the lash line and
you know your typical thing but once we
get towards the edge we are wanting to
wing that out sort of along the lines of
what's going on with the shadows so kind
of keeping it in line with that I'm just
going to take it up and making sort of a
little triangle there on the outside you
can see how it's sort of swooped up now
and it's getting that really elongated
look coming the eye is now very long
between here and here but it's a really
pretty look I think too here's what I've
done with the liner I just took that
Revlon liquid pin just because it can
define this area way better than just a
pencil can so I just you know how I drew
it down a little further I just kind of
connected it got it started there on the
bottom and then I'll hook up with that
with my own Elm a liner pencil in black
so I'm just going to go basically from
here to here with that overlap exactly
what you did with that liquid and then
connect it up right there in the corner
I'll take an angled liner brush and I'm
going to go into that navy blue shadow
and just basically top off that liner
right there just really serving to blend
that in and go about halfway with that
and then take the blue that we put all
over our lid which you'll recall is a
little brighter and continue to the
inside and you may notice like that's
not really differentiating itself much
but when we go over this with a little
bit of the white sparkly shade and the
blue will come through a little more as
well and I'm going to go back to our
teeny tiny brush go into that white
shade and basically yeah we're just
going to get it right here around our
teared up just going right around and
the the darker liner we've got going
there I'm just continuing that in I only
went you know I probably went halfway in
kind of just trailing right underneath
the regular liner you could use a liner
brush to apply this as well I guess this
little brush just seems to work really
well alright our last step guys it's
lashes and it's a big part of this look
I'm gonna be taking my ardell 105's
pretty typical strip of washes fairly
thick and I'm going to apply those on
the top lash line i'm going to use
Maybelline lash discovery on the bottom
just to make our bottom lashes stand out
a little bit more and then I'll join you
with the finished look and let you know
what's on you guys here's the finished
look I just think this is a really fun
way to do a smoky eye with while
incorporating color some deep blues on
the lid fading up to sort of a purpley
look and one more way to incorporate
sort of a highlight is to take any sort
of smallish brush that you have even a
liner brush and i took that sparkly
shading almost like drew a line like
right there almost in between the color
and it just brings that do we affect
back to the look
I think this is great for a night out
great for a dance or something like that
that you really want to you know be
dramatic about it but to it with some
shades other than you know gray and
black so I hope you guys like this video
oh one more thing what I have on my lips
I have on the L'Oreal lipstick in Ferris
nude so just a nice nude lipstick there
and then I topped it off with my NARS
lip gloss in Turkish Delight so a really
light sheer pink on the top of that just
gives it a really new look doesn't
really compete with the eyes at all so
thank you guys so much for watching this
tutorial and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
