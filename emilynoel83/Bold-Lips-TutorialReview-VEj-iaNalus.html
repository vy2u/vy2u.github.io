opportunity to do sort of a half
tutorial half review on a bold lip look
um and I don't think this is necessarily
when I say bold it's not like it's not
anything you couldn't wear to work or
anything like that but it's just a step
up from the new look that you might have
seen me wearing in a lot of these videos
and I just wanted to give you an idea of
how you can achieve a look like that
because I think it's something that
people almost see it as a risk like oh I
don't want to do too much on my mouth
but you know you can and you can
actually have a pretty natural look with
it without going nothing left there's
anything wrong with bright red but
without going you know bright red or
bright pink but you can have a deeper
tone on your lips and it can actually be
really really flattering for your skin
tone and your eyes and just your whole
face in general so what I'm going to do
is focus in on a couple of products as I
do the application that I want to review
one of them is something that I have um
you know a product i've used for quite
some time that I really like and another
is a new product that I'm really really
excited about just out in stores and I
want you to know about that too so first
off let's just go through the process
here real quick um what I would do when
I'm starting to do my lips is put on and
some kind of a lip primer or really just
a good lip balm will do I like to use
the Burt's Bees lip balm but I have like
a whole drawer full of lip balm so
really any of them would do you just
want something that's not too slick um
you know the texture of a lip smacker if
you're familiar with those those are
bordering on a little too slick you want
something that's got a little more um
uh I don't want to say stickiness but
it's something that it feels like it's
adhering to your lips a little more
something a little thicker maybe and so
I think burt's bees beeswax lip balm the
regular or they have the pomegranate
kind that I like to but my first step
i'm just going to flick this on my lips
like i normally would and this could be
a good stopping point for you if you
want a natural look but then we get to
the phase after this where we could
either line all around and fill in or we
can go ahead and put lipstick on and
then kind of outline after now this is a
personal preference thing this depends
on do you have a liner shape that you
really really like and you want that
color to come through more if so I would
tell you to go ahead and line your lips
all the way around and fill it in with
your liner if you have a clear liner
which some of you may have heard me talk
about that before that's a great option
at this point you could go ahead and use
that if you want to but for the purpose
of this look I'm going to go ahead and
start with my lipstick and the one which
I will be doing more of a review on as
the video goes on but this is revlon
colorstay lipstick and the color is
fabulous fig okay this is the color I
hope you're getting a decent idea of
what that is it's it's somewhat deep
it's kind of because when the light hits
it it almost seems lighter than it
really is but it is kind of a deep I
want to say brownish plum almost okay
this would be a pretty flattering color
for a lot of you with medium skin tones
or even darker skin tones if you have
fair skin very fair skin and you're
watching this use a very light touch
with this you might also want to even
just use a lip brush because that can
give you a little bit more sheer
application of this you don't want it to
be too strong if your skin is very light
so I'm going to go ahead and apply this
and
has the nicest like vanilla scent I
think but I'm going to go ahead and just
apply it on my lips
just like so so you can see it's pretty
deep and when you put it over that lip
that lip balm it does have kind of a
shine but this is semi shiny anyway I
wouldn't say it's a totally matte
lipstick because it still feels like
it's really moisturizing and it is a
colorstay product so it does have pretty
good staying power I won't say it's
necessarily what like you know some of
those really really long wearing
lipsticks and lip glosses are but it'll
stay pretty good for you so at this
point I I don't want to alter the shade
of this too much but I do want to kind
of define my lips a little bit more so
I'm going to use a neutral colored lip
liner and this is the Mary Kay lip liner
in a neutral and by the way what I'm
talking about these products if you know
of a color that you feel a similar by
all means go ahead and use it up I'm not
saying these are the only products that
can give you this look but it's what I'm
using today so um and what I'm going to
do since I really just want to sort of
give my local my lips a little bit more
defined look and I know this color is a
little bit lighter I'm just going to
work in around the I guess Cupid's bow
area here just give that a little more
definition and also just go over it's
like I'm outlining it's like when you
colored something as a little kid and
then you went back and outlined it and
it looks a lot better ok so that's just
what I'm doing there it's really easy
step and you might assume you might be
getting concerns like oh I don't want to
lip line to show outside my lipstick
that's not at all what we're doing here
we are making sure we use a lip liner
that is not darker than the lipstick so
that's a key there then over the top of
this for just a little more shine and to
also make this go from more of a
brownish aid to give a little bit more
of a berry tone I'm going to take my
L'Oreal hip jelly bomb and the color is
succulent
and if you can see what color this is
it's kind of a I want to say a berry
toned pink smells like cotton candy I'm
not even kidding yeah this is so good
this is this is really new out in stores
talking about my old favorite that was
the color state lipstick and this is the
new one and i'm just going to use my
finger you can use a lip brush as well
but just kind of have it you know glide
over your lipstick and this look it's
not overly shiny but it is something
about the texture of this feels so
moisturizing on your lips and it's also
just the slight tint of this plus the
more brownish shade it's it you can't go
wrong with that if you're wanting kind
of a deeper lip look so I just want to
talk a little bit more about the color
stay lipstick it's got a really really
smooth texture this is not a lipstick
that's going to feel heavy at all on
your skin or on your lips or if you want
a word on your skin I guess it's not
going to feel heavy there either but you
can see is I just put that on my hand
see that little bit of a sheen it has it
feels very soft like that on your lips
and I also don't feel like I feel like
when I wear it I don't have that odd
kind of like lip peeling thing going on
with with my lips so I enjoy that it's
it's fairly long lasting it is not
drawing and I'm sure there's other
shades and a fly that are good begin
this is a Revlon Colorstay and fabulous
fig and then this L'Oreal hip jelly bomb
this is something that i got from
walgreens i believe both of these
products are probably in the six seven
eight dollar range depending on where
you shop for them at or what kind of
deal you get and this is the same
container as the l'oreal hip cream liner
so if you're familiar with those so
you're getting kind of a little glass
little glass a tub here and the label is
on the bottom of that and the snow the
snow I've heard people reviewing this
seen seeing her dread and I heard people
say that the set was so good and they
were really right um you can kind of
think almost like caramel sometimes I
guess if you're thinking about caramel
but I instantly just think cotton candy
and I look at it I think that too so
this is good alone to all these products
i use can stand alone the Burt's Bees
lip balm the lip liner if you even
wanted to do that for a really matte
look the lipstick and this this is going
to be a sheer just give your lips a hint
of berry color I have heard this
compared to Mac tender tone lip gloss I
don't have that so that doesn't really
mean a whole lot to me but if you're
watching this and you're familiar with
that product a lot of people say this is
like that so anyway I hope you found
this tutorial flash review you school on
these products I hope maybe this will
help give you guys the courage to do a
lip look that's a little more bold just
a little step up from the normal neutral
look that you might wear on a day to day
basis so thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
