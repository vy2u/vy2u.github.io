fun party look it's going to utilize
that 88 shimmer palette a few shades
there a few other products that are
going to really do some neat things with
purples and blacks and overlapping and
blending it's going to be really fun and
I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial as
always let me know at the end if you
have any questions and enjoy okay step 1
i'm going to take my be less Chado
magnet primer and light and just use
this as an ice cream shadow based sort
of thing just to really emphasize the
color that the purple shade that we're
going to be putting on here in a second
if you just have a light colored cream
shadow that you can put on that would
work well here we're going to grab our
88 shimmer palette and I'm really only
using a couple of shades out of here I'm
going to be using this purple shade
right here and to make sure I was
pointing at the right one it's about 1 2
3 4 up on that sort of deep purplish row
there on the shimmer palette and this is
I've noticed that there's actually
variations in the amount of shimmer in
some of these different shades so this
one isn't maybe as shimmery or sparkly
as some of the others so that's just
something I observed as I chose this one
but it's the purple I wanted to go with
so I'm going to take my ELF shadow brush
pack on some of that color and get right
here on the lid this is such a pretty
shade of purple I love it so just get it
excuse me all over the lid from inner
corner to kind of um there's going to be
an interesting effect that happens here
with the darker shade that we kind of
put over this so that's why I'm taking
it up just a little bit higher because i
really liked what that did on the other
on your palate again we're going to go
up to the top here to this lightish pink
shimmery shade any light pink shimmer
shade that you have will do and these
are just kind of suggested colors you
don't have to have this palette to pull
off a very similar look so just keep
that in mind and I'm just going to take
that light shade again with my elf I
shadow brush and I just want to lighten
up the purple but we have right there on
the internet we want to use a black
color and there is a pretty deep black
shade there in the shimmer palette but
it's a little more shimmery than I want
to use for this step I almost want
something that's not going to be quite
so metallic in finish so I'm going to
grab my and this is gonna you're gonna
laugh when I show you this since I don't
want something so shimmery I'm gonna
grab this it's my makeup forever
diamondz shadow its this black sparkly
one the actual name of the shade has
worn off but although this seems
extremely sparkly it actually goes on
fairly um that sparkle doesn't really
come through that my Sonia Kashuk it is
the medium shadow brush kind of a flat
shader brush and this is just a real
easy technique to get some depth in your
crease and form your outer V you're
going to take that and just kind of
start patting it into your crease and as
and you're letting it kind of like I'm
putting it in but I'm letting it lay up
sort of on that bone right there that
frames our I so as you do that you're
going to get the perfect location there
for them you'll notice as you go over
that um purpley color that we brought up
a little higher there this is not really
looking like black it's more so looking
like a really deep plum so that's so
interesting you know how these two
colors combine this black and the parade
guys grab your shimmer palettes again
and we're going to use two shades I'm
going to just point them out for you
right here together we're going to go
back to that same purple shade that we
used on the lid and then
just up here it's 3 over from the
right-hand side right here is just a
kind of shimmery peach shade that's
going to be our highlight just so we
don't get on purple overload even as
much as I love the purple I'm going to
use my essence of beauty crease brush
here it's kind of a little bit it's the
chubbier of the two that come in that
2-pack from CVS I'm going to go back to
the into that same purple shade that we
were using earlier and I'm just going to
you can see how this has been kind of
softened up with that that's exactly
what I'm going to do over here I'm going
to go to the outer outer portions of the
black and just go over it kind of like
where Sam sandwiching that black right
in between the purple on our lid and the
purple that we're fading it into this is
just a gorgeous fade effect that you can
create so easily just with a light touch
and a little bit on you know a crease
brush you could even use a more fluffy
crease brush if you wanted to and
they're really i'm going to reach for my
sephora rounded crease brush a little
bit fluffier go to that peach shade that
we're going to use as a highlight and
just dust this right up to your eyebrow
pretty pretty shimmery shade to use up
top there now it's time for our liner
and i'm going to use my old faithful
revlon colorstay in blackest black the
liquid liner with in with our little
applicator like this and you know this
kind of liner sees the shimmer and says
no problem it's going to go over this
just as black as it has ever been and
that's why I love this product ok so I'm
just starting on my inner corner and
you'll notice I'm concentrating a bit
more here but that's ok so we're just
drawing this line out to the outer end
here
and I'm just extending it out slightly
past my natural life lower liner i'm
going to take revlon colorstay pencil in
black and just going to concentrate on
connecting up to our liquid liner in
there just kind of flicking it upward
and then we're just going to carry that
all the way underneath the lower lash
line to our inner corner just like so
just to go over that lump bottom liner
and set it i'm going to use that make up
forever diamond shadow again with my
angled liner brush and just just use
that to go over what you've just done
and as always whenever we're winging out
our liner just a little bit and another
thing that I always like to consider is
the shape of the shadow after I've done
that so I'm going to go back to my black
I always tend to do this and I just want
to redefine the shape just a little bit
that we've created here with the outer V
so I'm just kind of coming right off of
the direction of that lower liner I'm
just bringing it out just a little more
and this is with my fine cream now I'm
going to go ahead and give my lashes a
curl I'm going to use my ELF eyelash
curler and hold it there for about 15
seconds now i'm gonna get my lashes
ready for those false eyelashes i'm
going to use my covergirl LashBlast and
i'm gonna put a coat on my top lashes
and also a very very light coat on the
ball right guys and now for the purposes
of keeping this video somewhat concise
i'm going to go ahead and put my false
lashes on and then i'll come back with
the finished look but as always if you
haven't seen my false eyelash tutorial
you need to check that out i will put a
link in the side as well as a link to my
blog posts that i did a while back which
sort of addressed how to clean and care
for your false lashes the ones i'm going
to be using art the ardell invisible and
they are the demi lovey
alright we'll see how right guys there
is my finished look inspired by my kind
of fun purple shirt here just a fun
purple and black look using that 88
shimmer palette and a few other things
on my lips is the revlon matte lipstick
and nude attitude and on top of that is
might be luscious liquid lustre lip
gloss and pink champagne so just a nice
really lightened on kind of new lip and
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
