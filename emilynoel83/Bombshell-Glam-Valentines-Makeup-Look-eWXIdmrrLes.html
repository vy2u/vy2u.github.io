today
look is a Valentine's look I decided to
just go extremely dark do something a
little out of the ordinary on the eyes
and it incorporates some very smoky
colors as well as some burgundy reddish
type tones I was really pleased with the
way it turned out and I did use my
Coastal Scents revealed 2 palette and it
will be a start-to-finish full face
tutorial so here we go I did a test run
of this look the other day I was so
happy with the way it turned out but I
was able to get a little insight on how
well it actually wore throughout the day
and I can make a couple changes for this
video so yeah I have been using this
makeup forever step one on trying out
the nourishing primer really really
liked it especially if your skins a
little on the dry side I mean your
moisturizer can handle a lot of that but
it's one of the few moisturizing primers
that still has a nice um oh no silkiness
once it absorbs I am using the new
Maybelline Dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation in the shade nude
I've been trying this on and off for a
little while but I wasn't quite ready to
talk about it when I did my new
drugstore products video it just I
hadn't quite come to a conclusion yet on
the best way to apply it and yesterday I
used that Real Techniques sponge just to
blend it out and I thought yes this is
the method for this foundation for me
anyway it kept its matte look but it
just really looked skin like I was just
very happy with the finished result with
that so I really like using the flat
side of the sponge and I mean to me the
effect I get from it when I use it I
feel like it's just as good as the
Beauty Blender if not a little better to
me because of this nice flat side you
get to work with and then you can still
use a little pointy tip in here around
the eyes or you can bring in the micro
mini Beauty Blender which I do like that
a lot too for concealer
and that's probably kind of old news
because I know this Real Techniques
blender sponge has been around for a
while but I've been a brush user a
hardcore press user for quite some time
so certain foundations though I really
see the appeal in using a sponge like
this now I'm gonna use my Estee Lauder
perfectionist
it says youth infusing brightening serum
plus concealer and I wear this in the
shade to see light medium so it does
have this end that has your little wand
applicator but you don't really want to
use this like full on like I'm gonna
paint on a whole lot of concealer
because this is just kind of like I
think of it as a priming step for the
stick end of this concealer like it just
I don't know preps the skin a little bit
keeps it from looking too dry so I don't
really even think of this step is doing
a whole lot besides that I really rely
on the other end to do the do the dirty
work as far as concealing goes then the
stick that comes with this it's a pretty
large stick as far as stick concealer
schoo I don't know it just seems pretty
substantial and I just use this all
throughout the under eye area you'll
notice I didn't even really feel the
need to use a corrector today so either
that could be a reflection of me
sleeping better at night with the baby
not waking up so much or this is a
really good concealer maybe a little bit
of both and I just kind of put it where
I want to brighten as well and I don't
find that stick to be too terribly thick
and difficult to blend but just because
I've got this dampened Beauty Blender
handy and I'm just gonna use it to tap
out that concealer
then I'm experimenting with a new powder
to set the under-eye area
continually in search of something that
performs as well as the by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder so what I have
here is by beautycounter it's the
mattify skin finishing powder and this
brand I don't know how many of you are
familiar with it but it's really really
conscious of ingredients I've read
they've outlawed like over a thousand
ingredients that are commonly and other
makeup products but you know they're not
letting them in their products to keep
them extra safe and natural so if that
concept appeals to you this might be a
brand to look into I've purchased
several other things as well I may do a
video on that but I haven't gotten to
try anything much besides this but it's
got the little lock here over the shaker
which I like and I'm actually just gonna
use this sponge and pick some of that up
and just dab it on the under eye area I
feels like baking a little bit but more
of a light approach to it I'm not really
taking on the powder too terribly much I
was wearing this on my under-eye
yesterday and I really liked the
finished look of the makeup and it also
it wore fairly well it was a very dry
day yesterday I could feel dryness
elsewhere on my skin but I didn't think
my under eyes looked too dang bad so
that was nice
next I'm gonna do a little contouring
with my ELF contour palette here I love
this shade it's a great cool tone
contour color and I'm just gonna take
this in the hollows of my cheek first
and this is the Sigma small contour
brush it came from like a travel set
from long ago but I will list all of the
brushes I use down in the info box as
well as all the products
and for blush I'm using this city color
and B matte blush in the shade Sweet Pea
it's kind of a neutral type tone when
you look at it have a rosy neutral blush
I'm using my Milani blush brush
yes Milani has brushes I did a video on
that just recently so you'll have to
check that out see what worked what
didn't this one definitely did work
these are really pigmented blushes
though I have some more intense shades
in my collection and they definitely do
pack a punch and then I am going to take
a tidbit of this matte shade in the
highlight palette and just go like right
over the border here to keep it nice and
bright and I am going to go in with a
more luminous highlight but I'm going to
do it after I finish the eyes for now
little spritz of the glossy a stopped
talking first the glossy a rose mist
and then for my brows I've been using
this combo a lot from NYX it's their
micro brow in the shade espresso so it's
a nice rich dark brown that's still very
cool
this product it does have the little
spoolie brush on the other end it
reminds me so much of my Anastasia brow
Wiz I mean the size is just the same
just the same precision and then this
NYX tinted brow mascara I have it in the
shade black which really is like a dark
dark brown and I just love the hold that
this product has it doesn't have like
the little big you know microfibers that
really attach into your brow hairs like
benefits gimme brow does but as far as
just being a good long wearing great
hold tinted brow gel this works really
nicely there are a lot of shades that it
comes in so my friend Norma had sent
some makeup my way including this a
little pamphlet and I was just really
drawn to this look here which
incorporated dark burgundy reds but they
were just used full on you can see how
they're practically pulled all the way
up to the brow you know and so I thought
I'd like to do a dramatic type look like
that and this came with some Lee Swati a
palettes I believe that's the way you
say well that was my inspiration I am
using my Coastal Scents revealed 2
palette one of my favorites of the
revealed palette family but before we
get to that I'm gonna prep the lids a
little bit I've got some Too Faced
shadow insurance which shadow insurance
I've talked about this over the years
but I feel like it's gotten more liquidy
or it just doesn't stay as good as long
in the tubes you know what I'm saying I
don't know sometimes it gets really
ready sometimes it's fine though but I'm
gonna apply that all over the lid and up
into the crease
and then I've got this NYX jumbo eye
pencil in the shade black bean and I am
gonna use some of that on the outer part
of my eyelids
this is just a little synthetic
up-and-up shadow brush that I can use to
blend that out a little bit just into
the crease but primarily on the outer
part of the little lid
I'm also going to take this Maybelline
lasting drama pencil in cashmere white
and I'm going to take that a little bit
around my tear duct I don't want it on
there quite as heavily as I did it
yesterday but I still want that
brightness it helps out the shadow just
with the staying power a lot too
then I take a q-tip and just soften it
out just a bit
first shadow I'm going to is the satiny
finish white or kind of off-white shade
right here I'm going to apply that on
the inner half of my lid and take it
right around the inner corner as well
then I'm taking this shape which is kind
of interesting it's sort of like I don't
know a brownish mauve very interesting
shade with my Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush and I'm going to just Pat that
first on top of my dark base
then for my crease we're just going to
be layering up the Mavi reddish tones so
I'm gonna start with this shade over
here which is kind of a mid-tone Matt
I'm just going to get that in the outer
part of my crease first and just work it
all the way inward and as I blend you
know slowly working it upward as well
next up I'm going to pull in this matte
black really nice black in this palette
with my makeup academy 315 this is a
very pinpointed brush I can put the
shadow exactly where I want it and I do
want it right here in the outer corner
and I want it to pull upward with a
really nice outer V
airbrush for blending and keeping the
blending on the top side of this shadow
and here's where the magic starts to
happen I am taking this color right here
I do think it's kind of the brightest
boldest of the berry wine reddish colors
here I'm using my Milani blending brush
to pick some of that up and I'm going to
just take this on the border of that
black and create a pretty intense
reddish look right up here between the
crease and the brow and I realize we've
all got varying amounts of space in this
area I have quite a bit of space there
between my eye and my eyebrow so you may
lessen the amounts you know relative to
the size of your eye area but just like
the picture you know I'm really wanting
this reddish color to pretty much meet
my brow something I really notice about
you know when you're applying shadow in
this way and you want it to still be
kind of soft but you want to make an
impact and your shadow is very pigmented
really pay attention to the amount of
pressure you're applying to your skin
with your brush because I feel like I am
barely touching my skin what I'm doing
this step and I'm still getting color
applied because it's a very bold shade
so just keep that in mind next I'm going
to take my Maybelline master precise
skinny this is in the shade defining
black and I'm going to apply that to my
lower inner rim
I'm also going to draw that down like
just between the lashes a little bit
here
and I'm just gonna use my smudger brush
to go over that a little bit that liner
does set but it gives you just a little
bit of time to play with it then I'm
going to use my pencil brush with this
matte red that's a little less bright
I'm going to use that on the outer part
of the lower lash line here
as we go inward I'm going to use this
shade that's got a little bit of shimmer
to it a little bit of brightness and
just take that in to meet that highlight
type color
then speaking of this shade I am going
to sort of reinforce that color a bit
more um just now that we've blended so
many dark things around the eye I'm
going to take a little bit more of this
pull it inwards so we've got a little
overlapping there
and with that same shade and same brush
I am going to go right around the brow
area and just give a little bit of
separation between the brow and the
shadow then I'm just going to do a very
thin line across the upper lash line
using my Physicians Formula eye booster
pen
I'm just gonna curl my lashes apply a
little bit of this covergirl plumpify
mascara not because I love it but
because I just have it and I'm gonna put
on false lashes anyway so might as well
go ahead and use this
and a little lower lash mascara with my
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
and these are the salon perfect 614 I
believe that's right yeah 614 false
lashes they've got a lot of length to
them but they're not quite as thick as
my huda beauty lashes and I kind of want
that because I want a bit more of this
look the shadow look to show through so
I'll just apply some glue to these and
put them on and then I'll be right back
all right so lashes are on and you ever
find that once you get your lashes on
it's like it gives you the guts to do
more things with your eye look than you
initially plan the same thing happened
yesterday it's like I kind of had to put
the lashes on see the lay of the land
and then go in with a little more shadow
and that additional shade that I'm going
to go with is this red right here so
while this one has a little more
brightness and intensity this one when
sheared out is still going to give us
that nice reddish look we're after so
again with the Milani blending brush I
keep wanting to call that a crease brush
very small amount on the brush I'm going
to focus it on the outer part here and
yeah just add a little bit extra to the
look
another thing I loved about this look in
the picture was just the intense high
light coming off the cheek there so I'm
going to use my L'Oreal True Match Lumi
um this is the one in Rose I really love
this highlight like this was my favorite
drugstore highlight for the Emily awards
featured on my blog picking up both of
those shades with my up and up highlight
brush and I'm actually going to take the
color closer to my eye than I normally
do with highlight and I really like the
effect from that it just creates such a
contrast with this dark dark eye and
bring it down onto the cheeks slightly
as well
and then on the lips I'm using a combo
of my NYX high voltage lipsticks this
nude is called Mirage and it's a real
full-on nude and these are very like
creamy lipsticks by the way that's not
matte not drying at all yet they're very
long wearing it's a really great lip
product from NYX as you can see I just
focused that shade on the inner part of
my top and bottom lip then I'm going in
with flutter kiss which is kind of a
soft like dusty rose and I'm pulling
that shade in from the outsides they
practically blend like glosses on your
lips it's interesting it's not that I
don't like the full-on nude nude
sometimes but I really am into the
definition that something slightly
deeper is going to give me plus I just
think this works with the eye really
well
alright guys rollers are out here's the
finished look very very rich deep smoky
eye but a light lip I'm really pleased
with the way this look turned out it's
very dramatic
I do like pairing it with the lighter
lip though I think whether you have a
Valentine or not whether you're doing
anything remotely fancy for Valentine's
Day or not it's still fun to just get
dressed up even if you're around the
house how many days am I in full glam
makeup just around that it's just for
the love of the makeup you know so thank
you guys for sharing in that with me
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
