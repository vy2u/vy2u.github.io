this video this is going to be a book
review so I hope you enjoy it even
though it's not about makeup but it is
about a book that i have read over the
course of even less than a week and i
love it so much it's made a big impact
on me and if you guys can get your hands
on it i think you would really love it
too it is the book by robin needed this
just came out it's called morning
sunshine and she is the anchor of
headline news on CNN Headline News
morning express it's a four-hour morning
show program available I you know
throughout the USA and other countries
as well I believe and she has just been
a real source of inspiration to me just
watching her on the news ever since I've
been anchoring I anchor a morning
newscast as well and she just does a
really great job of being so
conversational so passionate about the
story she's reading and just really has
just a great personality on air and it's
just a great example for myself who
doesn't morning show and I'm probably a
lot of others that watch her to but she
put out this book and the idea behind
the book is how to to radiate confidence
and feel it too and this is so
interesting because this is you know
naturally this would be a book that I
would care about because she's in my
same profession but at the same time as
I read this I think wow this would be
good for anybody to hear some of the
advice she gives in this book she talks
about how she's really had to overcome
some hurdles to get into her career in
broadcasting at a national level and she
talks about how she herself has gone
through some some major self-confidence
issues and like basically like
practically to the point where she was
having panic attacks at one point at a
station she was working at before she
would go on the air like psyching
herself out over I guess the pressure of
what she was about to do and and
basically how she overcame caring so
much about what people think thought
about her it seems like when especially
if you're in a career like broadcasting
a lot of your opinion of yourself can
come from the feedback you get from
viewers or
the people you work for and stuff like
that and it can kind of help I mean it
can kind of shape what you think about
yourself and well it's a positive thing
to take that feedback and turn it into
something good sometimes it can almost
control you and so Robyn kind of goes
through this phase where she really
cared about being liked being liked by
all the viewers and if something came
about where she felt like that wasn't
happening it would really really get to
her inside you know one bit of negative
feedback from one random email from a
random viewer and she would really let
it get to her and so she went through
you know just a lot of stages in her
life she goes to different stations
she's had a lot of different experiences
and over time she really overcame that
fear of people not liking her and she
gained a lot of confidence and there are
some real life lessons in here it's not
just all about reading oh hey that's
cool how that happened for Robin but she
actually takes you through some
strategies and techniques that are
really like confidence building and just
a new way to look at your life and live
a more balanced life that's another one
of the big messages in this book is
living a balanced life and being
balanced in your thoughts and it's just
such a great book like I seriously went
through this in less than a week and i
am doing these YouTube videos and
blogging and working and all this stuff
but I found the time to read this and it
is absolutely great there are even some
pictures in the book of Robin when she
was you know at various stages in her
life there's Robin I mean isn't she just
beautiful she's just a beauty
inspiration too but she has had just so
many awesome experiences at the national
level but she's really just had worked
her way up through the ranks of
newscasting and smaller market stations
and it's just a huge inspiration to me
but the message she's getting out here
is absolutely valuable for anyone I
would recommend this to guys to read I
would recommend it to girls whether you
are high school age to you know
however old you with you you could
possibly be I really think it's never
too late to hear the kind of message
she's bringing across here about
self-confidence and just loving yourself
and really basically caring about your
opinion of yourself and not putting
everyone else necessarily ahead of that
so um anyway there's so much in this
book I really can't like totally
summarize it for you but it's fantastic
you could get it on amazon.com you can
check out your local barnes &amp;amp; noble or
wherever you like to buy books it's a
fantastic book again it's called morning
sunshine by robin meade and i would
recommend it to any of my viewers here
so thank you guys so much for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
