this video I'm so excited to show you a
new liner technique that I'm
experimenting with and it is that a
double winged liner looks so basically
you know you go about your shadow the
typical way but you just do your liner a
little bit differently and I'm going to
show you how I did it I'm sure there's
lots of different techniques but I'm
also going to be using mainly I products
from this kit from bourgeois Paris so
it's kind of the perfect products to
create this oops excuse me to create
this look there's a really pretty light
purple cream shadow product that we're
going to use but the look is pretty in
Paris vol.1 you can find this on beauty
ticket calm and of course all the
products are out of here right now but
it's like a little book and it has the
it comes with the shadow that I used
here which is a pretty kind of black
shadow the cream shadow in the lilac
shade you also get a purple liquid liner
mascara that you'll hear more about as
the video goes on as well as a couple of
brushes here that are coming in very
handy for me right now so one is sort of
a smudge brush and one is a definite
liner brush so I'm just going to walk
you through basically how I use the
products to create this look so I hope
you enjoy it and keep on this thing i
did was applied my Too Faced shadow
insurance all over my lid and up through
my crease area and then I'm going to
take a cream eyeshadow the one that
comes in this kit and it's like a lilac
a purpley kind of shade and I'm just
gonna squeeze some out of the tube here
onto my finger just a little bit use um
somewhat of a flat brush to just help me
spread that evenly on my lid so just
take that shade and spread it all over
your eyelid so at this point you should
wind up with a pretty purple um shimmery
lid and it's just a nice light lilac
shade and what's also neat about this is
this is a waterproof cream shadow so you
don't have to worry about it slipping
and sliding around next I'm going to
take a single eyeshadow and this is nor
it
number four in the bourgeois i shadow
and you can see it's kind of a shimmery
black but it does seem to me like it has
almost a little bit of a purplish
undertone to it which is interesting and
I like how these little singles have a
nice mirror there in the palette as well
and the kit also comes with like a small
smudger brush and I'm just going to dip
the tip of that in the shadow and take
this basically right to our crease and
really just concentrate on getting the
dark color right there in your crease
I'm going in pretty much most of the way
in there and then blending into my
crease and sort of circling it up just a
bit as well now once we come back and do
our upper liner we're going to intensify
this shadow a little bit but for now
we're just going to leave it like that
we've sort of got a little bit of an
outer V going we've just thickened sort
of the darkness there on that side we're
bringing it down onto our lid just a
little bit as well so just get a little
bit of Darkness going there you can see
on this side the outer part of the lid
isn't quite as bright and shimmery as
the inner part on our lower lashline
we're actually going to use that same
this same shade only we're going to
intensify it a little bit by sort of
making that a liquid liner so I'm going
to take some of my mac fix+ spray and
i'm just going to spritz a little bit of
that on the back of my hand here just to
get a little moisture going and I'm
going to use that as sort of the you
know mixing medium i guess you'd say to
moisten my brush so you can see my hands
a little moist there i'm going to dip
this brush which also comes in the kit a
nice little fine eyeliner brush which
would be great for your gel liners as
well getting it in there and then i'm
going directly from there to the product
and you'll see the product gain a little
intensity now as we use it as our lower
liner so i'm gonna start on the end i'm
just going to stay right there right in
the lash line i'm not going on the
waterline with this
and if you need to pick up more shadow
to kind of even out the distribution you
know if you if your brush is a little
too wet you might need to pick up more
shadow and this will just dry like a
normal liquid liner would dry so take
that all the way in right to the very
inner corner and you might want to
thicken that line a little bit now once
you've got your desired intensity there
on the lower lash line I'd suggest
taking that smudger brush that we used
in our crease as well and just kind of
running under that and sort of muddying
that line just a little bit next we're
going to line our upper lash line with
this purple liquid liner that comes in
the kit i believe the shade is prune and
you can shake that up but it comes with
a little brush tip applicator which is
really i think easy and smooth way to
use a liquid liner um so hopefully I'm
not shadowing myself too much as I do
this but starting at the inner corner as
you can see staying extremely close to
the lashes and then just pulling it out
and if you have trouble with liquid
liner I mean just think about taking
short strokes you don't have to make it
all the way across your eye in one
stroke so I'm just kind of looking down
into a mirror here picking up where I
left off with a little more product
because I keep thinking you know that
this is a black liner and sometimes
black liners go on in a more intense
fashion all the way across but with this
purple to make the color come off a
little more strong I'm sort of going
back more frequently to kind of reload
my brush with the with the color so just
take it slow there's no rush if you rush
yourself that's kind of where you run
into problems you know it's so strange
how that works because you know you're
in a hurry you're trying to get through
your makeup as painlessly as possible
but then that's when you end up making
the mistake so this has a little bit of
a metallic finish by the way and what
we're going to do once we reach the
outer edge of this is instead of
following the curve of our eyes it would
curve down we're going to go straight
out
so from right about here you'll see that
line going straight out from the eye and
then I'm going to get a little bit more
and we're going to just connect that
from the very outer corner here this
would be the outer corner draw it up and
connect and then just fill the gap now
comes the fun part we're doing a little
different liner technique on our lower
lash line we're actually going to create
another wing that's going to go parallel
to the top one so you can see over here
how the lines have an even amount of
space they're not instead of being out
like this sort of like one of those
greater than less than signs it's more
like an equal sign okay so i'm sure you
guys love my math terminology there but
anyway i'm just going to take the brush
and I'm going to the outer corner here
but I'm going down a little bit because
you'll recall to make this upper on
outer V we want we use the outer corner
so we're going a little bit below that
and we're going to draw a little line
and we're going to draw it straight out
just like so you can see what's going on
there it's just a line right under the
wing so you want to stay perfectly in
line with your wing so if it's going out
a little more up than this one we're
going to go a little more up if this one
was even for some reason tilting down
you would want the lower one to tilt
down I mean there's of course different
ways I mean fun other ways you can do it
but just for this look I'm trying to
lead you down the right path here so
once you've got that line that initial
line just maybe go over at a time or two
with this since like I said it is purple
it's not black so to get these and it is
a little bit metallic so to get the
intensity you want you may have to go
over it just to touch like that now we
have some finishing touches for this
look so I want you to grab the smudger
brush or any smallish brush that you
have and dip the tip of that and when I
say the tip I mean go directly down on
top of the product there get a little
bit of color on it and we're going to go
right under that a little wing and
just going to smoke that out a little
bit under the lower wing then on the
upper lashline this is where I mentioned
after we did that we're going to go back
and provide just a little more depth
based on how far our wing went out so go
to the corner of the wing with a little
more of that dark eye shadow that's what
I've been using this whole time just
that one shade of shadow and of course
the liquid shadow we first put on but
just kind of intensify the the darkness
there in the outer corner as you can see
we didn't do a huge outer V we just made
it a little bit darker and there's one
finishing touch you can do here with
this liner that's going to make it even
more of a contrast that you have two
wings there and that's to take a lighter
shade i'm using a light pink from milani
called illusion it actually has sort of
a golden tone to it as well take any
small detail brush time this one that I
have is from Coastal Scents and I'm just
going to go right in between my two
lines there with that lighter shade you
can just just use any light color you
want and you're going to create more of
a division between them and it's going
to make them stand out more and since
this kit doesn't really come with much
of a highlight shade you can take that
same color and just kind of go right up
to the brow bone next I'm going to apply
a couple of coats of the volume glamour
ultra black mascara that also comes in
the kit and I'll join you with the
finished look
hey everyone I'm back with the finished
look I applied a couple of coats of that
mascara to my upper lashes and like one
light coat to the bottom and one tip I
wanted to pass along in terms of the
wings here if you do just a short little
stroke of like the liquid liner and you
feel like you want it extended more I
would recommend taking an angled liner
brush and just sort of putting your
brush in some shadow of a similar shade
and then you can kind of put it on there
and sort of flick it outward I didn't
really do that just just kind of barely
on that side to sort of even them out
but um yeah that's pretty much it as you
can see like as I'm sitting back here
further away from the camera it's harder
to detect that liner but if you really
see somebody from the side you can see
it and it's kind of a cool touch so you
could do some false lashes with this
look but I kind of think sometimes false
lashes can take away a little bit from
the eyeliner if you did something
special so I sort of wanted to keep it
as is and on my lips by the way I'm
wearing the jordana lipliner in tawny
it's just a very neutral shade all over
my lips and then i'm using the Rimmel
moisture renew lipstick in sunset which
is a pretty you can see they're sort of
neutral has a little bit of a metallic
feel to it and it has a some definite
gold like little shimmer to it so it
really kind of warms up the face a
little bit and on my face by the way I
used the palladio on mosaic powder it's
sort of a peachy shade and I also did my
covergirl cheekers in golden pink is
kind of a contour there so hope you guys
liked the look it's something a little
different but something you know you
could totally do your own way if you
wanted to make the wings a little
different or not do the wing the liner
at all and just do the regular shadow
part of the look so thanks for tuning in
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
