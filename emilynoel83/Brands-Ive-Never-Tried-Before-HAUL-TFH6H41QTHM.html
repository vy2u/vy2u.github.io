I can hardly take it this has actually
been like one of those videos that I've
been plotting for weeks and now I'm
finally bringing it to you I wanted to
use these products for a little while
before actually doing this haul but keep
in mind this is still a haul these are
not full-on reviews just yet but I
wanted to do something where I just did
a haul of products from brands I have
never tried before like it's not just
that I haven't tried these products
before but these are brands I have never
touched I just thought it would be
interesting for you the viewer to get
you know a new perspective on some
different makeup products but also just
for my own personal makeup education
let's say I really think the more you
try the more you know and the greater
spectrum you have for drawing
comparisons with other products for
example I know anytime that I try a
really expensive luxury item and I love
it it kind of puts a little goal in the
back of my mind for you know this is the
kind of thing you want to look for and
try to come up with at a drugstore price
as well so while this video is going to
be talking about various luxury items I
have by no means abandoned the drugstore
I am just trying some new things and
will probably be able to give you an
even more informed perspective with
every review I do down the road the
first brand that I tried a few things
from is Charlotte Tilbury I got an
eyeshadow quad and a couple of lipsticks
the palette that I got is the luxury
palette in the Dolce Vita and it's
beautiful packaging like kind of a
really really deep burgundy with rose
gold and then these are the shades
inside it's a very fall looking color
scheme as you can tell all of the shapes
in here have a little bit of shimmer I
would say three of the shades are more
of a soft you know a little bit pearly
finish and then this one here has a lot
of sparkle they are beautifully
pigmented and soft but I can tell you
know just by touching them and in my
experience applying them on the eyes
they're not as shadow that gives you
more than you need you know what I'm
saying like there are some shades you'll
tap into
and it's like that shadow can achieve a
range of looks you know you can pack it
on really thick it'll look one way you
could apply it very sheer and a look
another way with these I feel like when
I put my brush into them
I get enough I'm not struggling to build
up the look but I don't get too much if
that makes sense
three of these shapes like I said are
kind of satiny a little bit pearly in
the finish and they just looked so soft
and smooth on the eyes the highlight in
particular you know sometimes they can
look very frosty this really had a nice
amount of smoothness going on and I love
the shade that's kind of like a burgundy
brownish shade love that the shade down
here kind of like just swampy green as
you brown you know you're not getting
pure brown out of it you're not really
getting a lot of green out of it
sometimes I like shades like that other
times I find what I'm pulling it in
alongside the burgundy it just kind of
muddies things up a little bit now the
shade I've not yet mentioned is the
glittery shade it is a straight up kind
of coppery glitter I used it a couple
days ago Pat it all over the lid on top
of an eyeshadow primer and it really
clings when you do it that way and it
was a pretty look because while it is
glitter the glitter is very fine however
that's the shade that kind of makes me
regret this purchase a little bit
because I think you're kind of confined
with a shade like this it's like that's
gonna be a shade that's pretty much
gonna have to be worn on the lid I can't
think of any way I would really want to
wear it unless I really maybe like laid
it on thick as a lower liner pop type
thing I almost would have preferred that
be like a highly highly shimmery
metallic shade as opposed to something
in glitter form I'm not gonna stop
playing around with the palette I again
think it's gorgeous it's beautiful
packaging it's really nicely textured
eyeshadows so this is not the last
you'll be hearing about that little quad
the other two things that I got are
lipsticks
brace yourselves the packaging beautiful
rose gold like old school type packaging
it reminds me of when Estee Lauder put
out their Mad Men collection and they
released a lipstick I think was called
pink Adele ik and it had this beautiful
like it's almost like a ribbed kind of
style on the outside
and it just looked so like old-school
glamour and that's what these are like
as well they've got the Charlotte
Tilbury logo right on the ends and just
a beautiful weight to them the feel is
just nice these are lipsticks for people
who like the whole lipstick experience I
would say I was only going to get one
lipstick I was going to buy a Bond girl
and then I saw that they had some
lipstick duo's available as well and
this other shade sucked me in so first
off just talking about a Bond girl these
are the matte revolution lipsticks it
says on the box
luminous modern matte long-lasting
lipstick you look at the shape first off
and I thought how is that gonna work but
really this little squared off shape
shapes up your Cupid's bow just
beautifully I actually love the way that
fits in there and it's gonna be sad as
this starts to wear down some it will
probably lose some of that precision the
most unique thing about this is when I
first touched this to my lips I feel
like it's dry and I think oh I'm gonna
have to go over that it's like just my
instinct in my mind is that I'll be you
know sweeping over it again and again no
not at all even though it has like this
dry a little bit velvety feel but there
is some definite dryness to the lipstick
it gives you full on color and does not
pull at all okay so it's so hard to
explain this it gives you the full on
matte finish but my lips do not feel dry
and you guys I'm coming off of a cold
I'm coming off of some of my driest lips
ever I feel like my lips have all the
movement and mobility they ever would
have with any kind of lip product on and
when I press my lips together
I can feel moisture there is moisture on
my lips but I'm still having a totally
matte finish why this shade the spon
girl color I was really studying
everything on the website and I thought
this would be a color that I would wear
a lot if I'm going to invest in a more
expensive lipstick I really want it to
be a shade I'm gonna want to reach for
often and as I wear it now I feel like
it's kind of a deep rose but if you wear
it more on the sheer side apply it with
a lip brush it's kind of like a your
lips but better
or just a hair deeper type of shade so
I'm really really happy with this I
think this is going to get tons of use
throughout the fall and winter and again
the packaging is just dynamite I love
that now the other shade that came with
it in the duo that was kind of the
afterthought shade for me is called
Glastonbury and this is a really really
deep shade it looks so deep and dark
there in the packaging but when you see
it's washed out you see so much kind of
unexpected purpley tone come out of this
color again like the Bond girl shade
it's going to be able to pull off
multiple looks you lay this on thick it
looks so dark and vampy or apply it with
a lip brush where you have a little bit
more control over the Sheerness of the
application and you're gonna have much
more of a berry look coming through it's
beautiful so extremely impressed by the
matte revolution lipsticks if there is
more from the Charlotte Tilbury line
that you're like oh my gosh you have to
try this let me know in the comments
section really anything you know if
there are any brands that come under
this heading of things I've never tried
before that you'd like to recommend to
me I would love that next thing that I
got was from sephora's website and it's
a product called nudes Stix they seemed
to have a series of different concealer
type shades different eyes Stix what I
was really hoping for was a set that
would allow me to try multiple things
but I wasn't finding it so I just went
with something that I thought could be
kind of multi tasking so I went with the
lip and cheek pencil and it gives you
the shades whisper and mystic and it
comes in a little tin like this there is
a mirror on the inside they've got a
little info sheet in here about the
product and also a little sharpener as
well everything is like a stick format
from this line and as far as the lip and
cheek pencil it's got vitamin E in it
it's got shea butter and they say to
like outline the lips and fill them in
and there's your lip look and then also
apply like a few little dots of this on
the cheeks and there's your blush so one
of these shades more of a classic nude
one a bit more rosy and they do look
beautiful like kind of paired together
and blended together on the lips I'm
wearing this deeper shade called mystic
on my cheeks today and it's a very soft
look you know
just did the three little lines of it
and I actually blended it out with my
small stipple brush just because I feel
like that's a little more foolproof way
for me to blend out cream blushes on the
cheeks but they are super soft easy to
work with shades like I don't have any
complaints about the formula these are
probably going to continue to get more
use from me as lip products just because
I think it's more handy that way
I like the colouring of it the whole
color payoff of that kind of a lip look
better but I would definitely be open to
try some more things from this line just
to learn a little bit more about it the
last couple of things came from Beauty
lish one of the brands I hadn't tried
anything from is called by Terry and the
thing that I chose to get is called this
hyaluronic hydra powder please listen to
the description for a second and tell me
this doesn't sound like a miracle
product it says a true cosmetic
innovation this colorless micro fine
hyaluronic acid powder is the new Beauty
step that can be used day and night
after foundation or skin care its Hydra
comforting formula combines ultra
filling and plumping micronized
hyaluronic acid spheres and super
absorbent silica microbeads to slip into
the slightest creases to resurface
wrinkles fine lines and enlarged pores
with a sheer touch apply it with
fingertips on two zones in need of
correction or apply all over the face
with a brush so the thought of applying
a loose powder with your fingertips yes
I have tried that with this it's
interesting I can see why they say that
because this is absolutely the finest
powder I have ever used to touch this
with a brush
seriously just it looks like it's done
smokey
like if you've tried the HD finishing
powders from elf makeup forever any
brand that has something like that this
is much much lighter even than those if
that's even possible it's like how are
they even packing micronized hyaluronic
acid spheres into something that is so
like light as air literally light as air
so I shake a little out you know into
the cap when I use this and put my
finger into it and I can see why they
say that because the finger does kind of
pick it up better
and a brush does because when I put a
brush into it I have to be so careful or
it just goes into the smoke cloud around
you so using my finger I have tapped
this you know on my under eye area I've
tapped it around my t-zone so those
would be places where I see fine lines
or pores and it does blur those areas it
does completely smooth the texture and
makes your skin feel so soft but that
application is kind of hard you keep
feeling like you're going back I mean
it's just awkward with the fingers so
I've been experimenting with different
brushes a large brush absolutely will
not do it will send the stuff everywhere
so I've been kind of trying my ELF small
tapered brush like that's what I used
today and I just very very carefully
tried to pick up some product and I did
will blot it on the under eyes as my
under eye setting powder and I used it
just basically in my t-zone and what I
can say is that the skin looks beautiful
with this product freshly applied I have
not yet really honed in and paid enough
attention later in the day to how it's
wearing then because that's always when
the pores the fine lines start to become
more visible you know under makeup and
stuff like that so does this make a
difference in the way products wear
throughout the day that will be the
question I seek to answer as I continue
to use this this is a fascinating
product it has huge claims I will
definitely keep using it and report but
have any final products to tell you
about I got a couple of the visor or
visi art I shadow palettes I also got
these on the Beauty lush website and wow
wow these are $80 pallets each one I
have heard so many wonderful things
about these kinds of eyeshadow palettes
they have a series of different options
there's like a matte nude one there's
this one called dark matte I also got
sultry museu and satiny finishes in it
and there were a couple of other options
available as well and they are really
amazing eyeshadows
we feel I can sit here and say they are
some of the best I have ever used for
sure the best way I can describe it is
you know when you sit down to do your
eye makeup and you're starting to apply
the shadow and you've kind of got a
vision in your head for how that's going
to look how it's going to go on the way
it's going to apply these apply and the
way you hope they will in your head like
there is nothing unexpectedly bad about
these at all I think it comes from the
fact that they are so true to color so
exactly the way you see them in the
palette they're capable of looking that
very same way on the eyes to be upfront
with you again this is not a review I
have used these together every time I've
used them I've used them together and
I've done three looks with them so far
so I have only scratched the surface of
what these can do well a full review
becoming absolutely but I'm gonna have
to experiment more and just really dig
into these I would hate to do a
premature review and only know about a
fraction of the shadows and the palette
you know when I was reviewing them I
really like to know about the things I'm
talking about so this one is on that
this one is all shimmer I would say one
downside initially is the fact that if
you're a person who likes to be able to
take one palette and do an entire look
from it and you may not feel like you
can do that at least definitely not with
this one because as you can see every
shade is either medium to very deep so
you're not gonna have any highlight
shades in here but I have so enjoyed
pairing it with this palette that's full
of the you know the soft shimmery shades
there are so many gorgeous shades here
in this sultry music this right here and
you know you just touch into them you
just put your finger in barely move it
and you've got so much color coming up
from these even in this shimmery palette
not every finish is identical like there
are some that are true metallic shades
there are a couple in here like the
silvery one this one up here that have a
very very teeny tiny what would you call
it like mini glitter micro glitter in
there
and then some have just a little bit
softer just pearlized Sheen to them
these shades are beautiful the textures
are absolutely amazing but I would say
the dark matte palette is probably the
most unique thing happening here because
just looking at this grouping of colors
it's like what do I own that really does
this you know all of these shades are
really intense these couple of shades up
here are great like more neutral creased
tones and then you've got all of these
other you know realms of color to get
into I did a look the other day where I
used kind of like some of these orange
shades and the purples it was so pretty
today I've actually got on one of the
shimmery shades on the lid I've got this
one on most of my lid and then I pulled
in this green color just softly on the
outer part of the lid and this this
brown in the crease where I was talking
about the Charlotte Tilbury palette and
how it kind of has one level that it
operates on you know it's nice but it's
only like kind of gonna go one way it
doesn't give you too much it's not too
sheer these are examples of palettes
with colors that have many layers to
them like to one individual shade I can
wear this green very very softly in this
look I could pack it on and wear it
really thick as well part of what also
made this look softer today and I wanted
it to do this I kind of overlapped a
lighter color as well so it softened up
the green but just in themselves these
shades have such a range of looks that
they can pull off like yesterday when I
was playing around with some of these
kind of berry type tones whether it's
the burgundy or the purples
you know those sheer out so nicely and
they bring off a whole different look
than they do when they're worn really
dark in the crease am i having fun
playing with these palettes absolutely
again some of the best eyeshadows I've
used but I'm not quite ready to review
them just yet just because I don't know
the full scope of what these can do yet
I was so tempted to get the matte
neutral palette because I thought you
know that would be such a nice pairing
with either of these
then I kind of held back a little bit
because I thought I have so many just
neutral shadow palettes I'm really in
love with my Kat Von D shade and light
palette right now so I just couldn't
constitute that as a purchase but these
were the two that especially caught my
eye and just made me think yeah I want
to explore those so that is my haul
brands I've never tried before as you
can see some interesting finds I would
say the most exciting finds as of this
haul right now the most exciting things
to me would probably be the Weiser
pallets probably the Charlotte Tilbury
matte lipsticks as well most intriguing
or most mysterious kind of product that
I really am gonna have to work with and
just really experiment a lot with
application is the by Terry hyaluronic
hydra powder because it sounds like a
dream product but if you can't get it
applied properly what's the point but
I'm not done with you I'm going to keep
trying thank you guys for watching and I
will see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
