may know me as emilynoel83 from my
youtube channel beauty broadcast and in
these videos I'm going to take you
through some tips and tricks for makeup
and hair that are going to really get
you through your wedding day in a
beautiful way as a TV news anchor I'm
used to getting ready for news in HD
every single morning so I've learned a
lot about what it takes to look good on
camera I even did my own wedding day
makeup using a lot of really inexpensive
products so grab your brushes in pallets
it's time for today's lesson that I've
created exclusively for bridal guide
magazine
this video is going to be all about the
hair i'm going to show you two different
styles the first is very relaxed with
some nice loose waves that are going to
give you a great natural soft touchable
look for your wedding day other is a
little more structured but it still
looks like a really effortless look and
what's really neat is that it actually
builds off of the steps in the first
look I show you first I'm going to prep
the hair with a heat protectant spray I
love this one from suave professionals
then gather up a section of hair right
above your forehead just a small section
that we're going to roll up in a large
sized roller i'm using my remington t
studio heated clip rollers the heat
eclipse are great but sometimes the heat
can leave sort of a mark on your hair so
i'm going to be using the Conair pro
clips that comb right into your hair
just for the front sections follow up
that first clip with two more right
behind it and then for the sides we're
going to do something a little different
we're going to roll them in vertically
for a different kind of curl so clip
that in repeat the same thing on the
other side and follow it up with another
roller behind each side ultimately you
will have three vertical rollers on each
side now we're in the home stretch
you're going to section your hair into
three different parts one on each side
and one right in the back once
everything's all rolled up this is what
it should look like and then we need to
wait I like to wait a good half hour for
the curls to really set in and then you
can start taking them out to see what
you have
once your hairs out of those rollers
it's time to play with it a little bit
start running your fingers through the
hair and start breaking up the curls
flip your hair around and work some air
into it and then once you've got things
basically how you want them style the
hair a bit with your fingers and spritz
on some hairspray I love tresemme trade
too for a really nice long hold and now
you're ready for the big day if you want
to take those curls and switch up the
look a little bit pull up a section of
hair in the crown and just spritz some
hairspray right behind it take a comb
that you can use for teasing your hair
and gently pull down on the hair just a
little bit from behind you'll notice
you've got a lot more volume and you can
just start smoothing that out and really
building the look that you want with
your comb then you're going to secure
the hair behind your head with two bobby
pins just crisscross them and start to
pull your hair around one shoulder if
you'd like to have a side part with your
bangs you can adjust that as well then
twist a section of hair right at the
nape of your neck and we're going to
crisscross two bobby pins there you'll
find your hair will kind of cascade over
those pins so just spray it in place
where you want it and you're good to go
so whether you're looking for loose
flowing curl or something it's a little
pinned up and different you have that
option thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
