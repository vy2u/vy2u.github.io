beauty broadcast on YouTube and in this
bridal guide exclusive video we're going
to talk about five of the most common
beauty related wedding emergencies that
you could have and how to fix them or
even how to prevent them even if you're
not getting married these are some
really common issues I know we all deal
with so keep on watching
you feel a blemish coming on in the days
leading up to your wedding you
definitely want to start treating that
as soon as possible a product I love is
clean and clear Percy gel this is a ten
percent benzoyl peroxide acne medication
you can just use it on the spots where
you need it it will find that it will
have a really fast effect on your
blemishes you may even notice an
improvement overnight if you wake up on
your wedding day and that blemish is
really developed and it's become red and
swollen you can ice that down to take
down some of the swelling and then you
definitely want to use a full-coverage
concealer to use the smallest amount you
need sometimes using too much product
can just attract even more attention to
that area as a patting motion for the
ultimate amount of coverage right on top
of your blemish
running I make up is a wedding day
disaster but you can deal with it try to
get your hands on some eye makeup
remover and in a pinch you could even
use olive oil get a q-tip put a little
bit of that remover on the q-tip and
just kind of run that underneath the
area where you've got some smudges
happening then use the other end of the
q-tip to blot the moisture away take
some concealer dot that under the eye
area and then set that with just a light
light amount of powder having that
powder there is going to continue to
absorb any oils that run from your eye
makeup and will help your eye makeup
hold on throughout the day prevent this
kind of problem in the first place
you've really got to be using the right
products they must be waterproof and I'm
talking both mascara and eyeliner
shiny skin is something you really got
to keep tabs on on your wedding day
because as the day goes on there's lots
of pictures being taken and naturally we
all get a little bit oily to keep
yourself from piling on more makeup all
the time have some oil blotting sheets
on hand that can kind of take care of
the excess oil and then if you want to
reapply some powder keep it very very
light also another product that's really
on the cutting edge right now is from
malli and it's the ever color poreless
face defender this is great because it's
going to make the skin look really fresh
not oily and not as if you've caked on a
bunch of makeup
if you're noticing an uneven tan or
maybe even some errors that you've made
with your sunless tanning exfoliating is
a major key you may want to exfoliate
even a couple of times in the shower if
you can using a puff like this will
really help to move along some of the
dead skin cells so you can have fresh
looking eat more even skin but it may
not take care of the problem entirely so
you may have to use some other products
to even things out quick demo here on
one of my own tan lines use some
foundation mix it with a little
moisturizer to dilute it just a bit
using a foundation brush run that right
over the tan line and kind of blend that
in with the surrounding skin you're
going to notice a much more even
appearance and then another great
product you can use is called baked body
frosting from Laura Geller any sort of
bronzer that you can put all over that's
got a little bit of shimmer and glow to
it is going to really blur the lines and
blur of any blotches that you might have
on your skin if everything is really
falling apart a low side ponytail can be
a really classy way to go so just pull
your hair all the way over behind one
ear secure it with an elastic band and
then take a portion of the hair at the
bottom of that ponytail and wrap it
around secure that with a couple of
bobby pins and you will have a finished
style that you don't have to worry about
there you go everyone thank you so much
for watching and I hope this video helps
you prevent or fix some common wedding
day emergencies see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
