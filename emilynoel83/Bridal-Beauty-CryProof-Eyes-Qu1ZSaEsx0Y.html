may know me as emilynoel83 from my
youtube channel beauty broadcast and in
these videos I'm going to take you
through some tips and tricks for makeup
and hair that are going to really get
you through your wedding day in a
beautiful way as a TV news anchor I'm
used to getting ready for news and HD
every single morning so I've learned a
lot about what it takes to look good on
camera I even did my own wedding day
makeup using a lot of really inexpensive
products so grab your brushes in
palettes it's time for today's lesson
that I've created exclusively for bridal
guide magazine this lesson is all about
the eyes and I know the eyes are one of
the first things I noticed when I look
at a person and for your wedding
obviously you want that gorgeous look
you want the great shadow the beautiful
lashes and all that but you also have to
create something that's going to get you
through a really long day and possibly
last through some tears that you might
have here and there at those emotional
moments so stay tuned because throughout
this video I'm going to take you step by
step on how to get a beautiful smoky eye
that's going to be soft natural and
great for your wedding day okay i'm
using palladio herbal i shadow primer
all over my lid to really help the
staying power of this look then a jumbo
eye shadow pencil malli ever color
shadow stick in gunmetal is great for
developing a smoky eye dab it off with
your finger a little bit so you don't
get too much product then using
covergirl drama eyes I'm using the
silver shade on the inner part of the
lid and the black shade on the outer
part of the lid just Pat it on so you
don't get shadow all over the place flip
the brush over and you can use the same
brush to get that darkness all the way
up into your crease as well for some
added drama then buff it out with a bare
fluffy crease brush next go to the
lightest shade that's going to be your
highlight apply it right under the
eyebrow very simple and then we're going
to go to the burgundy shade they sort of
blur the line between the light and dark
colors we've been using next I'm taking
a liquid liner Revlon Colorstay is super
long wearing and extended
just past your natural lash line then
take a nice dark pencil liner go just
about halfway in and then top it off
with the dark powder shadow you can buff
it out with a pencil brush to get a
little more smokey effect and then using
a q-tip take the light shade just dab it
right around the tear ducts for a nice
little highlight there then i'm taking a
face powder use a concealer brush get
this right underneath your liner it's
going to absorb any oils it's going to
create a very long wearing lower liner
look so it's not drifting south curl
your lashes apply some Malley waterproof
volumizing mascara and how about some
false lashes these are from Revlon
you're going to put some Revlon
precision lash glue on them very easy to
use Center them up with the center of
your eye and lightly press them down on
both the inner and then on the outer
corners you want to make sure they're
really on there and then you want to
sort of push up on the lashes so they
dry in an upward curved up fashion apply
one more coat of mascara to fuse the
real and false lashes and hey here's one
bonus tip covergirl outlast lipstain all
over the lips topped off with Nick's
mega shine gloss and chandelier
hopefully this gives you some ideas for
how to really bring out your eyes but
also some products to use that are going
to make it through your entire wedding
day through the cake in the reception
and the dancing and everything like that
so thank you so much for watching and I
will see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
