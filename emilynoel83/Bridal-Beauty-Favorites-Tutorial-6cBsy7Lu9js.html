weekend I did my friend Kaylee's makeup
for her wedding I also did several other
lovely ladies makeup including her bomb
it was such a fun weekend I really
enjoyed getting to you know be part of
that special day I was a bridesmaid
myself so I did actually this basic look
that I'm wearing on myself is the look
that I did on me I did the same basic
look on Kaley and variations of this
look on several other this videos kind
of packed with stuff I've got a tutorial
on this I look coming up also I just
wanted to go through and talk about some
of the key products that I used you know
on Kaley on me or on others that I just
thought really came off great in
pictures had great staying power losses
of the look that that I think people
should know about if they're going to be
involved in Bridal beauty or if they are
you know just needing to be photographed
for any reason or just need a great long
wearing makeup look the basis of all
this stuff is it's stuff that's long
wearing and it's also stuff that comes
off great on camera so I did do a blog
post before I went to the wedding in
case you haven't seen it yet and it
showed you know how I packed up my bag
and how I you know got my whole makeup
kit together to go down to the wedding
it was in Alabama it was so much fun it
was a gorgeous gorgeous wedding but and
then I did like a recap blog post of how
Halle the whole weekend went so if you
want more pictures and stuff like that
definitely check out Beauty broadcast
net for now into the product
recommendations a big big must-have and
I knew I loved this product but when I
saw some of the like professional
photography pictures that were posted
shortly after the wedding I was like wow
I love this stuff even more is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation
doesn't come off shiny I think staying
power was great something I love and you
know a lot of the weddings that I've
done makeup for I've also either
attended or been part of and I love kind
of spying on super puffy and seeing like
you know okay how how well did
everything last you know I know she's
been crying what happened to the eye
makeup and you know it's just so
fulfilling to see her face at the end of
the night still look pretty much like it
did when
put the makeup on I just love another
product that I was really glad I had for
the ultimate coverage for anyone who had
a blemish or you know just a key you
know spot concealer type need
I love the Estee Lauder Double Wear
concealer I was so glad I had this the
shade I have it in is warm light medium
and it says stay in place flawless wear
concealer so it definitely you know
could buddy up with this long wearing
foundation and work really well and it
just kind of I don't know it covered but
I felt like when you use a really light
amount of this it just kind of
disappears into the skin just like takes
the flaw and just does away with it
didn't have to use this on everybody but
in the small circumstances where I
needed heavy duty coverage this was
great terms of a great powder
I have several shades in my kit of the
Milani multitasker powders I find this
to be such good coverage and such like
flexible coverage I think you can put
this on kind of lightly just to set the
foundation and you know it can give you
that matte finish that you're after but
if you really want to build up the
coverage with this stuff you can another
powder that I think is great is the
L'Oreal True Match pressed powder but
this is definitely something that I've
made an effort to get multiple shades in
and have on hand in that kit and it's
been just a very valuable product to me
for a really great bronzer that I ended
up using on everyone I love the it
cosmetics vitality glow anti-aging matte
bronzer actually almost the exact same
shade as my essence Sun Club bronzer and
sunny only I don't know I just felt like
I really hit pan on this one and I just
wanted to have a nice fresh one to take
with me but this is very subtle it was
able to take anybody from I would say a
medium to slightly tan skin tone all the
way to lighter skin tone and warm them
up a little bit
provide them with a nice amount of
contour it's not orangie it really looks
subtle coral and turquoise where the
colors for this wedding and a great
blush that I think is so versatile
because it can look so many different
ways depending on how much you build it
up is my blush from the balm it's the
insane blush so of course I was going
long wearing with this but the shade is
called 12 ideo reviewing these you can
see how
it looks here I'm actually wearing it on
my cheeks today and I love how soft it
can look if you've got somebody with a
deeper tan and they want to wear this
too they totally can't just is nice to
have like one color family to kind of
stick to with this Bridal makeup when
you're doing multiple people and I'm not
saying everybody has to look identical
but you kind of want some harmony with
the group I guess and so I thought this
was a really nice one to use major major
rave for this product and this also has
a drugstore alternative but the laura
geller baked highlight and french
vanilla this is just like the wet and
wild reserved your Cabana highlight only
that compact is like I don't know the
equivalent of maybe four of these and
this just saves space in my kit but um
this and the wet and wild both of them I
would classify as like a semi matte
highlight like it's amazing there's
actually a little bit of coverage to
this and it reminds me also just a
little bit of like the lorac spotlight
powder only this maybe is a little more
matte I feel like this was the perfect
thing to use for photography where you
want the face to have dimension but you
don't want any part to catch the light
in an unattractive way and make you look
oily oh I was so pleased with the way
this came out done quite a few weddings
over the past few years and I've
consistently had brides who have cried
you know it's to be expected and their
eye makeups still ended up looking
phenomenal so a few great things that
I've used I always use the Too Faced
shadow insurance I keep you know just a
fresh one of these in my my Bridal
makeup kit also the Mallee ever color
waterproof eyeliners and these used to
be in kind of a green packaging and now
they have white either way either kind
they glide on they last all day they
last through everything I mean they're
great in the waterline if you choose to
use them their upper lash line lower
lash line wherever I keep um let's see
one is called shimmering black but it's
really just you know like a charcoal
color and this espresso Lane which is a
dark brown be happier about this stuff I
feel very comfortable you know like with
Kaylee I remember smudging a little bit
of the brown
underneath here I also use the brown on
her upper lash line and I thought it
just looked great and it totally lasted
throughout the day another great option
for like a really hardcore staying power
black liner is the L'Oreal infallible
lacquer liner this one also the Tarte
Amazonian clay I compared those two in
my dupes video very similar in the
finish in the staying power I'm wearing
this one you'll see it demoed in the
tutorial only some eye makeup you can
count on you got to be able to trust
your eye makeup for a wedding you know
it's really important one of the best
waterproof mascaras is covergirl lash
blast water Peru lots of teary moments
this did not budge and again to show you
the brush I mean in terms of the way I
was using this I was not using this
brush I was using you know individual
mascara wands on people so I wasn't like
recontaminate and dipping back in but if
you're just using it on yourself this is
a pretty large brush it has rubber
bristles really short bristles it's good
for separation too um I was going to
mention eyelashes a lot of the girls
several of the girls that I did makeup
on kind of brought their own lashes
someone had some really nice lashes from
Sonia Kashuk I used the demi whispies on
Kaley Kaylee's mom I think had the salon
perfect 110s so I mean just lashes it's
it's personal preference I would really
encourage you if you're having a hard
time figuring out what lashes might work
best for you
check out my false eyelashes 101 video
because I go through what some of the
more subtle ones are - what some of the
more dramatic ones are because it can be
hard to just look at the packaging until
how that's going to come off on your
eyes so I have some recommendations that
are so blit products this is my personal
one I have another one in my kit but
this is the tarte lipsurgence in sweet
this is probably one of my most used
bridal makeup colors it's a really nice
peach color with a little bit of golden
shimmer I use this paired with a gloss
on Kayle and it just looked grand a
really really nice gloss and this again
is mine I have another one though in the
kit and it is the revlon colorburst
gloss in rose pearl love this because I
feel like it's kind of neutral but kind
of still amps up the lips just a little
bit
you can see it there and I don't know it
just has like the most beautiful
reflective quality to it yet it also has
depth loss I'm wearing today I didn't
use this on anybody for the wedding but
this is saucy mom and this is the
L'Oreal lip gloss that's what I'm
wearing alongside this look and this
kind of reminds me of rose pearl only it
comes off a little bit lighter so um
anyway those are some of the things that
I just really wanted to tell you about
in terms of bridal maker we forgot my
Stila in the light palette this is
pretty new to me and you last saw it in
the haul video I did and I use this on
the wedding on me Kayli a couple other
girls and this whole top row here this
is the look I mean it had the matte
shades I wanted it had the shimmery
shades that just popped in key areas and
I just I love the way these particular
colors work together this shade called
sunset is just dynamite I love that kind
of it's like a rose gold but a little
bit deeper a little bit of taupe in
there almost kitten which is a classic
shade this great matte color called
bliss I mean it's just everything I
needed and you'll see how the matte and
the shimmer complement each other you
want to see a full review on this
palette in the future let me know mostly
the top part of it is what I've been
using lately I haven't experimented a
whole lot with the bottom part but
here's my tutorial and I hope you like I
just did my brows with my ELF studio eye
brow kit I use this in medium I love it
it has the little tinted wax and then
the matte powder you can just put over
it so that works great for me I used my
Too Faced shadow insurance so that's
just all over my lid and up to the
eyebrow then I'm using my Stila in the
light palette and this shade right here
is called kitten it's a classic kind of
iconic shade from the whole collection
I'm just using a flat eyeshadow brush
here and I'm going to pick a little bit
of that up and I'm just going to blot it
right around the tear duct like you just
kind of dab your brush right there and
you've got instantly a little bit of
light to that area I did take just a
little bit more of that
and just pull it up just right on this
innermost part of the lid here then I'm
going to this shape called bliss it's
kind of a dusty rose neutral color a
little bit beige but it is definitely
Matt and I'm going to blot that kind of
overlapping the shimmery shade we did
and this is just going to be like a base
color all over the lid and just to make
blending easier on ourselves as we go
along I like to kind of pull it upwards
a little bit kind of into the crease -
so far so good we're going to go to
another matte shade on this really dark
matte Brown here it's called sandstone
and kind of why I like this palette is I
feel like it's um it's hard to go
overboard with these shades like you can
get a little bit on your brush and it
never ends up looking like too much the
shades are more buildable as opposed to
being something you have to be like
SuperDuper careful with so I like that
especially doing other people's Bridal
makeup it was just just a very easy
palette to use and not go too far so as
you can see I'm just blotting that dark
brown right here in my outermost corner
I'm also flipping my brush over and
really wedging that dark shade right
there in the crease next I'm getting a
little bit of that same shade on a
fluffier brush and I'm going to
concentrate this in the outer corner and
then kind of pull inward so we're just
working a little bit more of that Brown
and as you can see here I'm not doing
any tremendous like outer V but we're
just kind of bringing the shadow just
out from the eye and so like if I'm
looking straight ahead I can see a
little bit of that Brown coming up but
here is my favorite part I get so
excited about this step this beautiful
shade here is called sunset it's kind of
like a rose gold type color only not a
lot of gold in it it's definitely not
brassy but that's what's giving us it's
a shimmery shade and it's giving us this
beautiful bit of warmth coming up right
there just kind of like a nice subtle
backdrop for those lashes I love it
so I'm going to use the same brush or
you could grab you know another fluffy
brush if you want to
I'm going to go from the crease from the
from the inner part of the crease here
and just overlap that Brown that we used
and go slightly up above it okay then we
have a matte shade right here that we
can use as a highlight it's called bear
and I love this color too because I
think something about blending that
right alongside that shimmery shade I
mean it makes that whole area just look
like a flawless blend i I just really
like the way these particular shades
work together for under the eye I'm
taking a smudge brush and going to that
matte Brown again that's called
sandstone and I'm just going right on
the outer corner kind of pulling it up
toward where that shadow is and I'm
taking that you know about 3/4 of the
way in then what makes this a little bit
smoky and a little bit you know it adds
a little interest and I think a little
bit of glow under the eye just kind of
helps the eye pop going back to sunset
and it looked great on blue eyes I mean
I did this kind of same basic pattern
look on myself I also did it on the
bride
who had blue eyes and it absolutely made
her eye color just below the infallible
lacquer liner here in blackest blonde
take it all the way across my upper lash
line I'm making my line a little bit
thicker as I get toward the outside I'm
not really winging it out I just love
how the whole eyes has a certain amount
of softness too and I'm also taking that
liner down just a little bit and I'm not
going like all the way under the eye but
just this outermost part now I have
liner in my waterline over here I'm just
kind of liking that because this is a
border line like smoky look it could
definitely skip it go for a brighter
look and maybe do like a nude liner in
the waterline a really great long
wearing one you guys know I love my
malli that's in my bridal makeup kit I
also love the Estee Lauder Double Wear I
have a double ended pencil here and the
black is just
really does a good job of wearing a long
time so I'll put that right here in the
waterline next I am curling my lashes
and I'm using my clump crusher this is
the water-resistant version I love it
because it goes on and you know doesn't
flake or smear off or anything like that
but yet you are able to fairly easily
wash it off at the end of the day I use
this on the upper lashes and the lower
lashes no issues with smudging down
below with this either as far as lashes
go I absolutely love the look of Salon
perfect demi whispies and I'm using my
Revlon precision lash glue here I have a
full lash tutorial if you want to check
that out it's called false eyelashes 101
and I just think these lashes give a
great framework to the eye I love that
they're a little bit longer on the
outside once that glue has a chance to
get tacky I'm holding it in the center
of the lash I'm going to align that with
the center of my eye make sure that
middle parts down there first and then
just attach your outer end and then your
inner end and my glue is still drying a
little bit but once that gets totally
dry I take a little more mascara just
kind of blot it on the lash line and
make sure that the real and fake lashes
are kind of bonded together as far as
other key products on my face several of
the things I already mentioned I'm
wearing the it cosmetics matte bronzer I
used that kind of around the perimeter
of the face also as a contour I used the
in stain blush in 12 from the balm I get
a very buildable blush product I use
this really lightly and I like the look
that it gave and then the laura geller
french vanilla baked highlight which
gave me you know some brightness here on
top of the cheekbones but not too much
and definitely not very shimmery so I
hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial and
the product recommendations I know it's
kind of a bridal makeup video but again
it's definitely geared toward anyone who
needs a long wearing makeup look or
something that's going to look great in
photographs so thanks for taking time to
watch and I hope you all
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
