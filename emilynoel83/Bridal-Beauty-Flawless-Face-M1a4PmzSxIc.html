may know me as emilynoel83 from my
youtube channel beauty broadcast and in
these videos I'm going to take you
through some tips and tricks for makeup
and hair that are going to really get
you through your wedding day in a
beautiful way as a TV news anchor I'm
used to getting ready for news and HD
every single morning so I've learned a
lot about what it takes to look good on
camera I even did my own wedding day
makeup using a lot of really inexpensive
products so grab your brushes and
palettes it's time for today's lesson
that I've created exclusively for bridal
guide magazine
today we're going to talk about getting
that flawless canvas the beautiful skin
that you're going to look back on in
your pictures for years and years to
come after your wedding it's really
important to get a really good
foundation going and then you can think
about getting that glow with different
blushes and bronzers so I'm going to
take you through some different
strategies to get a look that's going to
come off beautifully in pictures but
it's also going to be very long wearing
and it's going to get you through your
day with minimal touch-ups required so
take a look first step is primer on
using hard candies sheer envy primer
this is a product that's going to go on
silky smooth and allow your foundation
to just glide right on over it speaking
of foundation I'm using rebel lasting
finish it's a product with no SPF and so
therefore it's going to respond really
well in your pictures and just blend
that all over with your fingers then
grab a concealer Revlon Photoready is
great under the eyes and really any
other spots or imperfections you might
have once again great tool is the
fingertips for that then I'm using a
product from bare essentials and it is
the summer bisque it's a multitasking
mineral product that gives you wonderful
full coverage it's going to set that
concealer help it last longer and give
you a super flawless matte look under
the eyes then you want to think about
your powder this is a product you're
going to use all over your faces the
multi tasking powder from Milani it's
great for Matt full coverage again just
dust it all over with a big fluffy brush
take that same brush and use it for
bronzer I'm using too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer this is great using that
fluffy brush is going to really diffuse
the product not make you look too dark
but give you just the perfect sunkissed
look if you grab a smaller blush brush
you can actually use that bronzer to
contour your cheeks and give you a
really nice slim defect on the face for
the wonderful glow on your cheeks the
blushing bride look I'm using this great
blush from Milani it's a baked blush in
the perfect pink color to really make
your cheeks pump and look really
naturally glowing but to ultimately get
a great glow you want to use a highlight
this is great right on the top of the
cheekbones it's
be booster from physicians formula and
finally elfs HD powder use this all over
your face with a fluffy brush to get a
perfectly airbrushed look for your
wedding day so from the foundation to
the concealer to the powder blush and
bronzer it seems like a lot of steps but
all of these steps really come together
to give you that flawless look and a
little bit of a glow for your wedding
day you really want to be able to look
back at those pictures and think man I
did it right that day I was looking good
so hopefully those tips help you and one
of the biggest things I need to stress
is practice you definitely want to take
a little while take the weeks leading up
to your wedding to practice different
looks see if this strategy works for you
and if you need to make any changes you
know before the big day comes so thanks
so much for watching and I'll see you
again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
