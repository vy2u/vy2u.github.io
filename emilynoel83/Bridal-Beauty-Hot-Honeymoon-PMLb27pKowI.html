may know me as emily noel 83 from my
youtube channel beauty broadcast and in
these videos i'm going to take you
through some tips and tricks for makeup
and hair that are going to really get
you through your wedding day in a
beautiful way as a TV news anchor I'm
used to getting ready for news in HD
every single morning so I've learned a
lot about what it takes to look good on
camera I even did my own wedding day
makeup using a lot of really inexpensive
products
so grab your brushes in palettes it's
time for today's lesson that I've
created exclusively for Bridal Guide
magazine another aspect of wedding
makeup that you might not really think
about at first is the honeymoon that's a
time when you're gonna have lots of fun
things to do and you don't necessarily
want to spend a whole lot of time on
your makeup you still want something
that can hold up to the Sun and look
kind of fun and carefree but how do you
achieve that look I'll show you in this
video first I'm using a tinted
moisturizer I love the Aveeno positively
radiant because it has an SPF 30 and
while it gives you a great glow it also
does give you just a little bit of
coverage then from garnier I'm using the
anti dark circle eye roller this goes on
so easily feels really really nice and
cool under the eyes and just blend that
in and you'll notice a little bit of
brightening right there under the eyes
so that helps you look a lot more awake
and really refreshed then we're going to
go for a powder to sort of perfect our
look a little bit this is from Milani
and it's called the multitasker powder
with a big fluffy brush it just helps
even out the skin then also from Milani
this baked bronzer I love how it swirled
with tones of gold it gives you a really
natural look I don't use too much that
fluffy brush is going to really diffuse
the color then from New York color the
blush shovel cream stick this is
gorgeous for a dewy really fresh look
just blend it right into the cheeks then
for the eyes I'm going to be using
Palladio herbal eye shadow primer to
extend the wear of our eye shadow and
then from Beauty rush at Victoria's
Secret
this shadow in bronzing or bra
shades are great to get all over the lid
and also in the crease to give you a
finished look using only one shade
that's a great multi-purpose shade then
take a bear crease brush just to blur
all the edges out and give it a nice
flawless look then I'm using this pencil
from L'Oreal the extra intense pencil
get it right up next to the lash line a
little bit on the lower lash line and
then blend that out with a q-tip then
I'm going to just curl my eyelashes and
reach for my mascara from Mally it's the
volumizing mascara waterproof version in
case you're out in the surf and Sun and
then I'm going to reach for this lovely
NYX NYX mega shine lip gloss in
chandelier it's beautiful so there are
some ideas for getting your perfect
honeymoon look thank you so much for
joining me as I take you through some
different wedding looks for Bridal guide
magazine it's been a lot of fun and have
a wonderful wedding day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
