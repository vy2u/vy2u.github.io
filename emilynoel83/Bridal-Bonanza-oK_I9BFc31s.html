channel um this video is just going to
be kind of a quick little update about
some projects I've been working on for a
couple of websites for magazines Bridal
guide.com and shake comm that actually
approached me on doing some bridal
related videos for their websites so
they've been exclusive on their sites
for a while and now I've made them
public on my channel and I just wanted
to let you know about them in case you
haven't been seeing them in your
subscription box and stuff like that I
know a lot of people have summer
weddings coming up and you might be at
that stage where you're thinking you
know can I do my makeup myself can I do
my hair myself you know are what things
should I keep in mind for the big day so
these are just several little videos
there's a four-part series that I did
for bridal guide and they go through you
know getting a flawless face getting cry
proof eyes also a two-in-one hair
tutorial and also what was the other one
Oh a honeymoon look that's super natural
and quick and easy then for shape I did
something on like the must-haves your
wedding day must-haves like kind of a
touch-up kit what you need to have with
you on your big day so I hope that's all
useful for you I was under kind of the
time limit for these videos of about
four minutes so in some cases it's a lot
of information packed into one short
video so I did have to do some voiceover
stuff kind of did these videos a little
bit differently from my normal video
hope you like them and I just kind of
wanted to let you know that they are out
there if you're looking for some help
and I will have links later in this
video to each one of those and I will
also have them linked all of them on my
blog and down below in the information
box so you can easily access these
videos
you
you
so try to make the most of your planning
experience and one thing that I can't
stress enough is if you are planning to
do your own makeup for your wedding you
know you really should practice practice
practice a lot don't leave it all up for
the big day if you aren't experimenting
with some new products you know take the
weeks leading up to it or the days
leading up to it to really try it out
first and see how you like it take some
pictures of yourself look back on them
and see if it worked or not for you so
um yep that's my advice thank you so
much for watching and I hope you enjoy
the videos have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
