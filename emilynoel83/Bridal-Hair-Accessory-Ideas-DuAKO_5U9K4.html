broadcast on YouTube and in this video
made exclusively for bridalguide.com
we're going to be talking about ways you
can transform your hair from wedding to
reception specifically I'll show you how
to accessorize three different hairstyle
if you do choose to do something
different with your hair for your
reception I urge you to practice
removing your veil or headpiece
beforehand that way you can make sure
you can take that off and transition to
the cute accessories without
compromising the hairdo as a whole this
is just kind of a lacy piece of ribbon
I've cut a generous amount here so just
use what you need but you can kind of
take this around like it's a headband
works whether your head you have bangs
in front or not and just kind of tie
this right behind a little bow or just
tie it in a knot in the back and let the
peace dangle down but it's kind of a
cute little touch that you may not see
all the time here's another really quick
way you can accent your style and you
can take an elastic band and tie a piece
of ribbon this is kind of a little
eyelet print here on the ribbon and this
kind of gives you sort of a retro feel
to your style but you can just tie it on
they hop it right over your style if you
think the band is going to show you
something the color of your hair there
are all kinds of brown elastic bands or
or you know blonde colored elastics as
well but you can just kind of gather up
your style place this on here is a cute
and kind of casual way to style your
updo
if you want your hair up but you want
something lower on the head like maybe
its side bun sort of like this consider
flowers I think they look really really
pretty with the lower styles or the high
Styles be creative make it your own you
can use something smaller like this
little flower that comes on at Bobby
Panther thing to consider is maybe not
going with white but going with the
color that coordinates with your wedding
so let's say your color is you know a
soft yellow shade this is one of those
clips that has you know just that little
claw there and I'm just going to poke
this in really easily this is one
probably one of the quickest ways to
transform your style and just poke it in
right above say your bun kind of a
little bit off to the side and you've
got a really cute accent there that kind
of just draws attention to your
hairstyle a headband can be a great way
to kind of add a little interest right
by the face give a little sparking or
dancing you know it's keeping hair out
of your face and these jeweled headbands
there are so many options
loose waves are a gorgeous romantic way
to go for a wedding but when you get to
reception time you want to sort of keep
your hair a little more under control
first off if you have just a couple of
Bharat Slyke these are just pretty
typical little clips here they have some
rhinestones on then it go from just
above the ear back to right about here
just kind of the back of your head and
just clip it up there and you'll notice
you've got you know a little bit of
fullness around the face but your hair
is being kept back off of your face just
a little bit so repeat that on the other
side and this way your hair is still
really beautiful and flowing but it's
off of your face and that still has a
nice little detail there one more option
that I think is so glamorous if you get
your hair in a side part and get you
know a slightly larger size clothes from
your ear and on up and kind of start
gathering it again right towards the
back of your head not totally on the
back but you know upper side part of
your head and we're going to twist it a
little bit and then give it just a
little push forward and then that's
where we're going to secure our style so
take your clip and just clip it right
over the area that you were twisting
with your fingers and now you'll find
your hair has a beautiful little
addition up there and if you're taking
pictures you know you can definitely
pull this hair forward or let it go back
and you'll have more of a side-swept
look just because this is pulled back a
little bit more so thank you so much for
taking the time to tune in for this
video I have a wonderful day and Greg
