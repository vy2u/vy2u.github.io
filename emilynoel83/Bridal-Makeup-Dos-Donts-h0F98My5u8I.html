opportunity in this video to address
some questions that I've been getting
mostly very recently about Bridal makeup
I'm guessing there's a lot of you out
there that maybe have a wedding coming
up this spring or summer and you're
starting to formulate some ideas for
your makeup and it really is such an
important day obviously I mean I've been
through that and it's and I also found
that it's a very very challenging day
because as the bride or maybe even as a
bridesmaid you know you're getting
pictures snapped of you left and right
and it's happening the entire day you
want to look good in every picture you
want to have great memories um but at
the same time you're kind of you know
wanting to make sure your face and
everything looks how you want it so I
totally understand where those concerns
are coming from and I will be doing a
tutorial soon that may give you even
more ideas in terms of applications from
start to finish but before i did that i
was looking to one of my favorite beauty
resources which is one of my Bobby Brown
makeup books is called the Bobby Brown
makeup manual and it says for everyone
from beginner to pro so I love this book
so much it has gorgeous pictures great
information on literally every topic of
makeup it is so great and the one that I
wanted to focus on there's a nice little
section here on Bridal makeup so section
on Bridal makeup and she gives a lot of
tips and examples and things like that
but I wanted to go through this section
called Bridal do's and don'ts it's just
a little section here a little do's and
don'ts list and I thought this would be
kind of a good way to get into Bridal
makeup and to maybe allow you to see
some of the reasons or motivations
behind you know why will do and not do
certain things in my Bridal tutorials so
I'll go through some of these the first
one is due complete a makeup trial in
other words practice the makeup look you
want to do for the wedding day days in
advance you know take whatever time you
have to to experiment and try that look
over and over again so you know you've
got it and you know
look good on you and also do get as much
sleep as possible on the night before
the big day I know how hard that is
that's the night where you're very like
you know it kind of tensed up hope
worried and excited and all those things
before your big day so that is a very
tough day but do try to get some sleep
because beauty rest there's a real truth
to that I do drink plenty of water
before your wedding day and properly
prepare skin with moisturizer and eye
cream getting on a good skincare regimen
is something you can do a long time in
advance of your wedding you're getting a
good habit I think you're going to find
your skin is going to behave better for
you on that day do make sure foundation
is right for the skin tone your color
may have changed since the makeup trial
so and that can be tough too for a lot
of people who get married in the summer
and you know before you know it you've
out tanned your your makeup shade you
thought you were going to use so just
just be aware that your skin color will
be prone to changing here especially as
we head into the warmer months so be
aware of that if you do have a wedding
coming up during that time frame this
next one I'm not quite sure that I
totally understand it but says do buy a
new mascara for your wedding day but
tested a few days before um I'll for
testing every product you would use on
your face before your wedding day but um
if you've got a mascara that's working
great for you and it's not past like you
know it's not gotten funky smell it's
not time to throw it out yet I mean if
it's working for you I would say go
ahead and use it because oftentimes I'll
get a new brand new mascara and
sometimes I just don't like how they
wear immediately right after I open them
don't know if anybody's experience that
or not but me but um no I mean it
couldn't hurt I guess to buy a new one
but I guess I'm not really sure about
that don't now we're moving on to a list
of don'ts here don't go tan to a tanning
bed right before your wedding if you
want more color use a self tanner test
the product weeks before the date apply
it several days before the wedding in
case you need to make corrections um I
think this may be geared toward people
who maybe never tan and then they decide
I want to be more tan for
my wedding day so I'm going to jump in a
tanning bed and then you wind up burnt
and that's definitely not what you want
what I did before a few days couple days
maybe before my wedding day I did the
mystic tan which is like a spray tanning
booth and that worked out really well I
might not advise that necessarily if you
haven't done it before like way before
like I had dent for some of my sorority
formals and stuff like that and realized
that it was really kind of the sort of
tan that I wanted not like incredibly
overboard but a good amount of color so
you know that may be something you test
out a long time in advance so you know
whether or not you may want to do that a
few days before your wedding don't apply
too much eye makeup you want the eyes to
stand out not the eye makeup so you want
to look like yourself on that day you
want to be able to look back and you
know be able to tell that that's you
that's not somebody hiding behind a mask
so that one totally makes sense don't
use concealer on the eyelid it causes I
makeup decrease I've heard this a lot
before stick with your eye primers that
you know work well a lot of people like
Urban Decay primer potion I'm a fan of
Too Faced shadow insurance or the Mary
Kay eye primer is a good one too it says
don't use a concealer under the eyes
that is too light for the skin tone
it'll make you look like a deer caught
in headlights so um that makes sense i
mean you you do want to sometimes use a
little bit lighter shade under your eye
but don't like go to the store thinking
okay I have very dark circles i'm going
to buy the lightest shade i can find
here it's not necessarily going to work
that way you want to match pretty close
but if you get a little bit lighter
sometimes that can still be good for
under eye area just as a hair lighter
don't experiment with eye makeup you
haven't tried before so obviously it
goes back to test your look out before
the wedding don't think it's all just
going to fall into place on that one day
don't wear frosted shiny are sparkly
shadow as it will reflect camera flashes
and I think there's some truth to that
definitely you
stick to things that are maybe like a
matte finish or even like a slightly
pearly finish chunks of glitter may not
always come off that well in a lot of
pictures so keep that in mind if you had
a really nice look in pictures is kind
of natural with some pretty met neutral
shadows I think that would be good it
says don't apply shimmer all over the
place one or two accents are enough
that's again where you're going to write
and wind up looking shiny in a little
oily if you go putting shimmer powder
all over cheekbones are a good place
under your brow bone is good and don't
go too overboard there don't tweeze or
wax browse on the wedding day I I sort
of tweeze my eyebrows every day I'm
about positive I probably did that on my
wedding day so but I mean I'm used to
that so if you're used to kind of doing
a little cleanup every day on your
eyebrows it's probably going to be fine
but if you if you never never do that
don't decide all at once that day you're
going to do it because you really might
if you're not used to it you might get
some swelling a little bit of irritation
so watch out there also it says don't
wear false eyelashes if they are not
100% comfortable and you are not two
hundred percent confident that they will
stay on so I actually hadn't even
learned or really experimented with
false eyelashes when when I got married
so I I just went with some mascara that
I trusted but I think that's totally
true you know you don't want to have to
be worrying about that on your wedding
day if you're not really comfortable
with using false eyelashes don't do it
however if you are I can see how that
could really enhance you know your eyes
and your pictures and be great too so if
you're comfortable with it do it if not
don't and that goes for a lot of these
little tips for wedding day makeup so I
hope that kind of gives you an
introduction for those of you who are
starting to think about this um I will
have you know tutorial coming up that
will sort of outline this a little bit
better in the future but i hope this
gives you some ideas so thank you very
much guys for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
