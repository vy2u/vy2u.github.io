broadcast on YouTube and in this video
made exclusively for bridalguide.com
we're going to talk about getting your
wedding makeup look for less and I know
if for a wedding your money is going in
so many different directions you want to
find a way to save and doing your own
makeup is something that can really work
for you if you just put some practice
into it and a little bit of your bargain
hunting skills I did my own makeup for
my wedding and I was really happy
looking back at the pictures because I
found some great quality things that
lasted all throughout the day and gave
me a great finished look so this look is
kind of you know your classic bridal
romantic feminine look and half of my
face is drugstore and half of it is high
end makeup and the cost difference is
extreme so to start out i use drugstore
makeup for my face products so my
foundation my concealer and my powder
were all drugstore i use maybelline
superstay foundation maybelline
superstay concealer and Milani multi
tasker powder for a total of twenty two
dollars with those three product for
eyes cheeks and lips that's where it
gets interesting that's where I really
split up everything from one side of my
face to the other or my high end I look
I used three mac eyeshadows to total $45
I used a Lancome a liquid eyeliner it's
called artliner that was twenty nine
dollars and Lancome Hypnose mascara for
$25 that totaled ninety-nine dollars for
my high-end I look alone then for my
drugstore I let me show you how I did
that I used a trio from wet and wild
called walking on eggshells and I use
the beautiful light creamy shade on the
inner part of my lid just patted that on
there I use the brown shade on the outer
part of my lid and then kind of patted
it up into the crease and used a fluffy
brush to really blend that out and get a
nice blended diffused law also smudge
the brownish shade just down under my
eye to give some soft definition there
and then i use the slightly pinkish
shade as my highlight that's just three
dollars there then I used my Maybelline
line still
Oh eyeliner a total dupe for the Lancome
version that's five dollars just went
all across my upper lash line and winged
it out a bit and for my mascara i used
l'oreal voluminous carbon black for five
dollars so that's thirteen dollars for
the drugstore I look and ninety-nine
dollars for the high-end look and they
turned out basically the same now let's
talk cheeks I really like these fresh
blushes that have just a little bit of
glow to them so it's practically like a
blush and highlight and one gives you a
great kind of blushing bride look I used
to blush from tarte on the left side of
my face it's the Amazonian clay 12-hour
blush in peaceful it's a gorgeous shape
I found a great drugstore alternative to
that blush it only costs seven dollars
as opposed to 25 and it's from Milani
it's the baked blush in coralina so I
just swirled that on the apple of my
cheeks and on moving on to lips now I
actually did do my lips half and half so
on the left side I used mac angel
lipstick it's a classic pink it's so
light and feminine and beautiful but elf
has a lipstick for just one dollar it's
called classy and it is the exact same
shade so I use that on the other half of
my lips I don't know if you could tell a
difference at all but it definitely
makes for a gorgeous beautiful lip it's
the same texture it's the same finish I
just love that lipstick so there you go
guys I hope you enjoyed this little
make-up experiment where we really took
different parts of the face and show
just how similar the look can be with
drugstore makeup instead of using
high-end and I hope this gives you some
inspiration as you're looking through
the drugstore trying to figure out what
works for my wedding while these
products not only look beautiful but
they also we're really well and I hope
you have a great time getting ready for
your wedding practicing with your makeup
and experimenting with a new look so
thanks so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
