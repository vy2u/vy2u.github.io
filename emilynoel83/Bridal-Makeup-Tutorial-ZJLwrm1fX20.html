Bridal makeup look I'm so excited about
it I'm going to take you through how to
do this look all the way from beginning
to end
starting with you know the foundation
and going all the way to the false
eyelashes that I have on in case you
want more Bridal information I do have a
sort of another video that I just
recently did talking about some Bridal
do's and don'ts from one of Bobbi
Brown's makeup books so you might find
that helpful and also if you're
wondering about my nails that you see in
this video they're kind of like a a
French manicure with a little silver
glittery stripe on them I posted a blog
about the products I used and how I did
this look so visit my blog for that I
also have a link to my wedding pictures
and stuff like that because I did a
video a long time back just kind of
putting together all my wedding pictures
so if you want some ideas from that
check it out so again this is a look
that I think would be good for brides or
bridesmaids bridesmaids can get kind of
get away with maybe having a little more
fun with the colors I'm not a real
stickler on do this do that don't you
know you can't or can't do this but I
think overall this is a pretty wedding
appropriate look for those involved in a
wedding so thank you guys so much and
keep on watching to see how I pulled off
this so to start out I've gone ahead and
applied my moisturizer all over my face
and I've also put on a primer
I like Smashbox photo-finish I put on
that really lightly just cuz I love how
it smooths out my skin but another good
drugstore brand is Rimmel's fixed and
perfect so then the next step is to put
on your foundation and I think this
really proves that you don't feel like
you have to run out and totally revamp
your whole makeup collection just
because it's your wedding day because
chances are those items that you like
and use everyday will be good for the
big day so I'm gonna use my Rimmel
lasting finish I've yet to really
finding this or Revlon Colorstay are
really up there for me my shade is 200
soft beige and I'm going to just apply
this with my Coastal Scents duo-fiber
stippling brush so I'm going to put a
little bit of this on my hand
and the reason why I'm doing it this way
for this particular look instead of just
my fingers is because um a little hair
in there um I'm doing it this way
because I find that I get a more shear
finish and don't use as much product and
you might say well don't you want a lot
of coverage well this is still going to
give you good coverage even with a sheer
amount but it's also gonna be longer
wearing if you don't have as much on
okay so that's kind of a strange thing
to wrap your head around but with
foundation it really does last
surprisingly longer if you don't have as
much on it's like there's not as much to
go away so I'm basically just tapping
this all around and after you tap it
kind of blend around in circular motions
we're gonna handle our eyes here in a
second so don't worry too much about
that right now
now concealing your under-eye area is
very important for your wedding day I'm
going to be using a couple Bobby Brown
products that I have raved about in the
past um it's my Bobby Brown corrector
first is what I'm going to be using in
bisque and this is actually kind of a
salmony shade so I'm going to use it my
own essence of beauty from CVS concealer
brush and for this product that has that
sort of salmony tone I'm gonna put this
on the most discolored areas I can find
around my eye so that tends to be I have
a little bit on that outer corner and
then right in the very inner corner
right in here so I'm just using that to
apply and blend a light creamy concealer
kit it has powder on the bottom and the
product up top my shade is my shading
this one was bisque I don't know if I
said that this one I am natural and this
is a little more yellowy and so I'm
going to use my same brush and I tend to
go down around the bottom of any dark
circle I see so like right around there
and then blend up onto the circle and
then bring some of this right up
directly under your lash line you're
going to take care of pretty much any
discolor
raishin you have if you follow that
little pattern also if you feel like
you're extra dark right up in here go
over that area the outer corner and then
finally you want to set that with a
little setting powder they give you if
you don't have this just use oops
use whatever concealer you like and then
just take a sheer loose powder and make
sure you go over it this is just a
little brush I got from Big Lots it's
kind of like a jumbo contour brush or
you know that you might or blending
brush that you might use for your eye
area but once you set that I mean you
really can't get much better in terms of
concealing those under-eye circles with
that pattern I just went ahead and did
the Bobbi Brown concealer products on
this eye as well and I went ahead and
dotted kind of around my nose area and
any other imperfections on my face with
the Maybelline mineral power concealer
at my shade is mediums 0-1 and that's
just a good general concealer that's not
going to irritate any blemishes and
things like that that you have now you
want to since we've got our foundation
on our concealer said all that this is
again with the mindset of you want this
to be very long wearing find a loose
powder that you like I'm going to be
using my mary kay signature loose powder
and beige one I just um pretty much nuts
about this shade that just works really
well for me and the powder I mean I
haven't had issues with staying power
with whenever I use this combined with
that Rimmel lasting finish makeup it
really works well so I'm just using this
brush this is just a Walmart powder
brush that I've had for a long time and
have kept it actually in really good
condition through regular cleanings and
really been enjoying that okay guys next
step for the rest of the face color some
including bronzer and blush I'm going to
kind of be breezing through these
because I don't want to take too much of
your time with this but I'm going to be
using this is my Milani sunset duos and
sunset breeze this is a matte bronzer
Bonnie Belle also makes a good matte
bronzer and the reason why I'm saying
matte is you're going to be taking a lot
of pictures and filter the
course of an entire day probably and
shimmery bronzers can sometimes give way
to a shiny look especially if you
accidentally overuse it a little bit you
know you may go a little overboard
thinking oh it's my wedding day I need
to use more well not necessarily so I'm
putting a light wash of that all over my
face and then focus it in on areas you
want a contour or slim down like maybe
the bottom for me that's like down in
here cheekbone now it's time for blush
I'm going to use a 2-step blush process
which is the type of thing I would do
daily anyway I'm first gonna use my
covergirl cheekers blush this is in
golden pink it's a great great contour
shade so that's what exactly we're gonna
use that for to create a little more of
a contour here on our cheekbones so you
just kind of suck in your cheeks their
cheek area and they appear and then you
just kind of go over whatever shadow you
start to see there you just kind of
enhance that with this boy and this is
my Milani minerals blush in my tight
look at that gorgeous kind of deep peach
shade so I'm going to use my blush brush
again with that and put it on the apples
of my cheeks and just slightly blend
backward I just love this shade I get so
many questions and comments on this
particular blush shade it is just
fantastic
now that we've gotten all our face
makeup pretty much done I would like to
go over it all with a finishing powder I
really like this from everyday minerals
even if I'm not you know choosing to use
the everyday minerals line for this look
this start to finish in soft bronze as
you can see it's barely bronze it's just
kind of like a skin tone finishing
powder and I just really like this is
meant to the start to finish kind is
meant to take away shine and keep you
know keep you shine free throughout the
day and just give you a nice kind of
airbrushed look to your entire face so
in it really has no shimmer to it so
that's good for this guys we're gonna
get started on this eye look that we've
got on this side
here so the first thing I did was apply
my Too Faced shadow insurance all over
and then just to have an extra light
colored base I'm going to use my B
luscious shadow magnet in light and I'm
just gonna adopt that um basically all
over the eyelid area the next thing I'm
gonna do is pull out my Coastal Scents
neutral palette and I'm gonna be using
this shade right over here and this is
just kind of a neutral you know white
shade it's got a little bit of sparkle
on it but it's not overboard by any
means so that's the first shade I'm
going to use that's one down from the
left hand side of the palette and i'm
gonna use my elf shadow brush and this
has a little bit of a it's like overall
a a soft creamy looking shadows but it
has a little bit of gold's sparkle to it
that's really subtle the next step is to
take this kind of darker brown shade
that's right next to the black and the
corner there and I'm gonna use my Sonia
Kashuk medium I shadow brush and I'm
just going to start to build our crease
shade here so just get some on the tip
of that brush and then what we're gonna
do is start to get that color worked
into our crease and this is a matte
shade as well so um you know keeping it
kind of soft and a little more natural
through doing it that way deepen it a
little bit right in here in the corner
I'm going to take my fine crease brush
from my essence of beauty crease duo
ship set and I'm going to use the shade
right above the black now it's kind of a
sparkly deep brown once again there's
not a lot of sparkle that really comes
through on these unless you're like
packing them on and we're kind of using
them more in a
little bit more subtle way so I'm gonna
take this right here in the corner and
just kind of using almost a swirling
motion just deepening up that corner
just it creates sort of a warmth all
around this I'm going to use a really
pretty shade at the top of the palette
it is one two three over from the
right-hand side and it's sort of a a
mauve with a little bit of sparkle to it
I really really like this shade I'm
gonna take my crease brush that is just
a little bit the bigger of the two from
that essence of beauty set tap it in
there tap off the excess and just kind
of apply that all over the border of our
of our shadow here really really pretty
my light I'm gonna take the shade right
up here in the in the corner there sorry
the closer I get that to the camera the
more washed out it gets it's actually
just a a light peach shade with some
gold tones to it and I'm gonna use my
eye shadow fluffy or eye shadow brush
just to sweep that from the last shade
we put on all the way up to the brow
bone to the eye brow liner I'm gonna be
using my Revlon Colorstay in blackest
black on the top lashline and this color
stay products tend to claim that they
will last 16 hours now Revlon Colorstay
whiners I can tell you from experience
they will last through some tears but
you know I can't really make guarantees
as do I don't know how much you're
planning on crying how much you might
surprise yourself by crying at your
wedding so I just keep in mind that this
is still somewhat resistant to tears and
I'm just going to take this and extend
it just a little ways past the outer
edge here on my lower lash line I'm
going to be using Revlon Colorstay
eyeliner in black brown and I'm just
gonna lightly put this all over the lash
line and then
we're going to this isn't an extremely
smudge able eyeliner and that's a good
thing because it's so long wearing you
know you don't really want it to smudge
much but I am going to use a smudge tip
on just to soften it up and then we'll
top it off with oops with another shape
from our Coastal Scents palette I'm
going to use my little smudger tip here
and this is going to do a couple things
it's gonna soften the color just
slightly and it's also gonna sort of
take away any excess product from any
certain area going back to our neutral
palette I'm going to take this medium
brown shade this was the one we used in
our crease so we're going one next door
to that and I'm just gonna use my liner
brush and sort of just Pat that color
all along this shadow so not to deepen
it up but to help set that that shadow
that we're putting on or that that liner
next I'm going to curl my eyelashes I'm
going to do this and hold for about 15
so I'm gonna use my Too Faced lash
injection mascara which is actually a
waterproof formula so that'll help our
cause a little bit you know if we're
thinking some tears might happen so just
put on you know a coat or two of this
will be fine and I know in the Bobby
Brown book from those tips that I was
giving she said don't use false
eyelashes unless you're absolutely sure
that they are going to stay on and
whatnot and so I am going to show you
how in case you want to use them I'm
going to use a half strip here in a
second and show you how I put those
things this is my little half strip it's
the Andrea Mod lash 301 and it's just a
little half strip of lashes so I'm just
gonna place that right on the outer
portion of my lash line there and let
that get dry
then apply one more coat of mascara over
the top and you've got a nice little
winged out effect all right guys here is
my finished Bridal makeup look I hope
you like it I really didn't do anything
special with my hair I literally just
balled it up and clipped it back and put
on some pearl earrings so you might have
a little more effect than just my room
t-shirt here but I like I said it goes
all the way from face to eyes I think
it's a really workable look it's very
similar to what I did on my wedding day
also on my lips here I think it might be
showing up actually a little brighter
than it actually is but I used my Rimmel
exaggerate lip liner in ravish it's a
pretty red tone and then I used my
Amber's Mary Kay Amber's wave lipstick
and and that's sort of like a deeper
gold Andy red and so I lightly lightly
put that on and then I went over it with
the georgeanna lip gloss and lovely and
you can see it's just squirt of got a
little bit of sparkle it's kind of a
neutral shade actually so um anyway I
think the look comes together I think
it's very wedding appropriate the false
lashes are totally optional like I said
they're just a half strip so if you're
comfortable with that kind of thing go
for it if not you know no biggie I
didn't wear any false lashes for my
wedding I had no clue about how to use
those at that point in time but anyway
guys hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
