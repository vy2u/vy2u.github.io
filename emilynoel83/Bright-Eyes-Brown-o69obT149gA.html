that is really going to help brown eyes
pop I have brown eyes so I kind of this
thought I'm going to make it easy on
myself and start with this tutorial but
I am going to be doing other tutorials
for each different eye colors so if you
have hazel eyes blue eyes green eyes I'm
going to have a look for you and that
will allow your eyes to maybe pop a
little bit more maybe put more of an
accent on your own eye color but it's
definitely a tutorial anyone can do so
if you're thinking about tuning out
right now and like well this doesn't
apply to me I have blue eyes nope
definitely hang on and watch because I
think it'll be good for you as well you
can totally do this no matter what I
color you have I'm going to be using the
covergirl palette here and this is
actually made for brown eyes this is the
eye brightening shadow in vibrant Browns
so these are the shades that they give
you to really make your brown eyes pop a
couple of these are a little bit bluish
like a light blue silver and a dark blue
but what's interesting is not too long
ago I don't know it may have been
actually last year sometime I did a look
using the Smashbox of glamour eyes kit
for brown eyes check out how similar
these are this is from Smashbox this is
from covergirl you're getting basically
the same idea here with both kits so I
love that if you guys saw that tutorial
and you thought man I want to get that
palette but I don't want to spend
Smashbox prices well now cover girl has
something that's almost exactly the same
so if you want to see how I put these
colors together and created a look on my
eyes to really accent brown eyes keep on
worst thing I did i primed my eyelid
with my Palladio herbal i shadow primer
a really really good drugstore primer if
you're trying to save money and still
find a primer that really can get you
through a day of watery eyes or you know
whatever you encounter i think this one
works really well i reviewed it not too
long ago but then i'm going to take my
palette from covergirl and this is the
eye brightening shadow palette and its
vibrant Browns ok so the shade you're
getting in here and I believe these two
shades are borderline blue colors it's
of like a light shimmery silver blue and
then like a blue black with some sparkle
this shade reminds me a lot of golden
sunrise that's a single covergirl shadow
that I love so that's great and then
you've got a matte kind of butter cream
shade that we're going to be using as a
highlight so let's go ahead and get
started first you can just grab that
sponge tip applicator that's in there
use the pointy side and I'm just going
to pick up some of this silvery silvery
blue grey kind of color and get that on
your applicator and put that on the
inner part of your eyelid any time we
use light and shimmery shades on on our
lids you know that's functioning to kind
of brighten the eye area and on the back
of this palette there's a little diagram
that kind of explains where to put each
of the shades but I am NOT at least for
this particular look I'm not following
that see there's a little like it labels
the colors one two three and four and
then shows where to put them but I feel
like I kind of like the look I've
devised here a little bit better excuse
the coughing in the background Tyler has
caught my cold but anyway I'm going to
put that on my lid here it's kind of
sparkly and I like that effect so then
I'm going to just flip it over and use
the other side and go to the darker
shimmery blue black and for that i'm
just going to partially layer and and
cover the outer half of the lid i think
it's fine to use a sponge tip applicator
for this because you can get a a
flawless blend on these shades just by
flipping it back over and kind of
running back over that with the lighter
shade sort of where you've overlapped
very very easy and simple um easy and
simple very nice anyway i'm going to
take a fluffier brush now i'm using my
Sigma SS 224 and I'm just going to start
kind of running that in my crease here
and I feel like it kind of starts to
pick up some of what's on the lid so I'm
kind of like doing a little up and down
a little side to side just kind of
starting to get some of those colors up
in there and then I'm going to actually
dip that tip down like this right in the
darkest shade there the dark sparkly
shimmery shade i'm going to look down
into a mirror and we're just going for
kind of a light wash of that color here
in our crease you could get really
dramatic you could do a big defined
outer V this is just a nice shade I
think to have in anyone's collection but
um we're just kind of using it in sort
of a subtle way because we're really
going to get intense with the liner on
this look so and this could definitely
be used not you don't have to have brown
eyes to pull this look off that these
these are basic shades that would look
good on anyone but I do think that they
cater nicely to those with brown eyes
like myself so kind of pulling that up
ever so slightly on to not quite on top
of the brow bone but you can see we've
sort of come out from under the crease a
little bit there next we're going to go
to the shade that I compared to golden
sunrise from UM from covergirl and it's
a shimmery gold and bronze and so I'm
going to use my same fluffy brush that I
just used pick up a little bit of that
color and just kind of run that along
the border of what you just did and just
softly blend that up to your eyebrow if
you were to use the sponge tip
applicator with this shade you would get
a dense very gold like if i swatched on
my finger very thick gold color but if
you use a fluffy brush you're just going
to get a nice wash of golden color so I
kind of like that I think it warms up
you know another wise kind of icy dark I
look so I'm just running that all the
way up there very good and then we're
going to dip the tip of our brush that I
sort of say that when I want a more
targeted application for something you
can get that if you just put the tip of
your brush down in the product I'm going
to do that with this light matte cream
shade and I want that to be closest to
my eyebrow so I'm going to get a little
more on there and just follow the arch
of the brow with that shade next comes
the liner for this
and I really think that blue navy blue
eye liners can make brown eyes look very
vibrant as specially if you do some
water linings so I'm going to do that as
well here in a second first I'm going to
use it on my upper lash line this is the
jet-set waterproof eyeliner in midnight
blue and this is a really really long
wearing liner I'm going to use my liner
brush from bourgeois Paris you can see
it's a very fine tipped liner and this
is nice and creamy so this is going to
be a fairly easy job here just pick some
up on the tip of the brush and I'm going
from inner corner to outer corner just
following my natural lash line with this
product continuing to just apply this
deep dark blue shade and as we start to
get to the part of our I where we've put
the dark shadow you can kind of see the
two almost mesh and and you know one
isn't too isn't really popping that much
from the other and I kind of like that
it adds to the smokey effect of this
look so I'm just stopping at the edge of
the eye with this liner here and then
I'm going to pick some up on the same
brush and put it on my waterline it's
going to glide on there fairly easily
and like i said this liner is designed
to be very long wearing on the waterline
so as you can see it's very rich and
very blue and once you put that navy
blue on there it really makes the whites
of your eyes pop that goes for anyone
with you got brown eyes or whatever that
Navy liner really does a good job of
making it stand out but if you're not a
waterline person or if you feel like it
bothers your I personally with this this
really locks on there and it doesn't go
anywhere and I don't even feel it or
notice it's there but if you don't want
to do that step you definitely don't
have to so once I've got it on my
waterline I'm going to go back to my
natural lash line just on the very
outside there and get a little blend
going with what I did on the upper so
you can see just kind of working around
that corner just a bit this is going to
kind of lock in there if you don't blend
it quickly so I'm going to take my q-tip
to kind of smudge just a bit but you
don't have a ton of time to work with it
because it will get to where it's just
going to stay put and that's that next
I'm going to use another brush from
bourgeois Paris this is kind of like a
pencil brush or a smudge brush and I'm
going to go tip down with that into that
darkest shade in the palette the dark
blue black and just get a little bit on
the tip and then I'm going to use that
try to open my eyes really nice and wide
and kind of just use that to go on my
natural lash line and we get this nice
kind of smoky fade coming down from
what's on the waterline so really other
than that outer corner we haven't really
put liner on our natural lower lash line
is just on the waterline and then this
is of course just shadow very easy to do
but it looks like you've done a lot of
blending work if you want to go over
that outer corner just a little bit
darken it up be my guest next we're
going to do some mascaras so I'm going
to curl my lashes I'm going to apply
probably two coats of this lash blast
length on my upper lashes and one coat
on the bottom you can see we're going
for that nice kind of thick and long
gated look on top and then when you've
got that very defining mascara on the
bottom it adds to this smokey effect
we're getting here but while the whites
of our eyes and I feel like the Browns
are still really popping as well so I'll
put that on and I'll join you what the
finished look and let you know what's on
my lips and cheeks
alright joining you now with the
finished look um it's all complete and I
really like how it pulled together I
feel like it does bring out brown eyes
but it's maybe you know you might think
ok I've brown eyes i'm going to use
brown eyeshadow but i think this palette
goes to show you don't necessarily have
to on my lips i am using revlon
colorburst lipstick and soft nude and
this is a really nude lipstick like this
is going to give you that classic nude
lip but i went over that and it's not
shimmery at all it's like a creamy
lipstick and i went over the top of that
with the NYX lip gloss and frosted beige
which is a very similar color but it
just adds some shine so it kind of makes
your lips sort pop from your face a
little bit on my cheeks just to give a
little accent of color but not not too
much i used the covergirl cheekers blush
in plum flush so a plum colored blush
just kind of used it right in here and I
feel like it you know helps the cheeks
pop a little bit but it's not a
traditional shade I really like having
fun with blush colors and i used the
cheekers in golden pink as sort of a
contour shade there to add a little
dimension to my face so thanks so much
for tuning in for this video I hope
you'll continue to watch the other looks
in this series where I show looks for
different eye colors I think it's going
to give you some new ideas whether you
have brown eyes or whatever color these
are looks that can work on everyone but
i do get that question so much what's
the best cut shades for me to use for
eyeshadows so i think this will clear
some things up so thanks so much for
tuning in and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
