that is really going to help brown eyes
pop I have brown eyes so I kind of this
thought I'm gonna make it easy on myself
and start with this tutorial but I am
going to be doing other tutorials for
each different eye color so if you have
hazel eyes blue eyes green eyes I'm
going to have a look for you that will
allow your eyes to maybe pop a little
bit more maybe put more of an accent on
your own eye color but it's definitely a
tutorial anyone can do so if you're
thinking about tuning out right now and
like well this doesn't apply to me I
have blue eyes no definitely hang on and
watch because I think it'll be good for
you as well you can totally do this no
matter what eye color you have I'm going
to be using the covergirl palette here
and this is actually made for brown eyes
this is the eye brightening shadow and
vibrant Browns so these are the shades
that they give you to really make your
brown eyes pop a couple of these are a
little bit bluish like a light blue
silver and a dark blue but what's
interesting is not too long ago I don't
know it may have been actually last year
sometime I did a look using the Smashbox
of glamorized kit for brown eyes check
out how similar these are this is from
Smashbox this is from covergirl you're
getting basically the same idea here
with both kits so I love that if you
guys saw that tutorial and you thought
man I want to get that palette but I
don't want to spend Smashbox prices
well now covergirl has something that's
almost exactly the same so if you want
to see how I put these colors together
and created a look on my eyes to really
accent brown eyes keep on last thing I
did I primed my eyelid with my Palladio
herbal eyeshadow primer a really really
good drugstore primer if you're trying
to save money and still find a primer
that really can get you through a day of
watery eyes or you know whatever you
encounter I think this one works really
well I reviewed it not too long ago but
then I'm going to take my palette from
covergirl and this is the eye
brightening shadow palette and it's
vibrant Browns okay so the shades you're
getting in here I believe these two
shades are borderline blue colors it's
of like a light shimmery silver blue and
then like a blue black with some sparkle
this shade reminds me a lot of golden
sunrise that's a single covergirl shadow
that I love so that's great and then
you've got a matte kind of buttercream
shade that we're gonna be using as a
highlight so let's go ahead and get
started first you can just grab that
sponge tip applicator that's in there
use the pointy side and I'm just gonna
pick up some of this silvery silvery
blue gray kind of color and get that on
your applicator and put that on the
inner part of your eyelid anytime we use
light and shimmery shades on on our lids
you know that's functioning to kind of
brighten the eye area and on the back of
this pallet there's a little diagram
that kind of explains where to put each
of the shades but I am not at least for
this particular look I'm not following
that see there's a little like it labels
the colors one two three and four and
then shows where to put them but I feel
like I kind of like the look I've
devised here a little bit better excuse
the coughing in the background Tyler has
caught my cold but anyway I'm going to
put that on my lid here it's kind of
sparkly and I like that effect so then
I'm gonna just flip it over and use the
other side and go to the darker shimmery
blue black and for that I'm just going
to partially layer and and cover the
outer half of the lid I think it's fine
to use a sponge tip applicator for this
because you can get a a flawless blend
on these shades just by flipping it back
over and kind of running back over that
with the lighter shade sort of where
you've overlapped very very easy and
simple easy and simple very nice anyway
I'm gonna take a fluffier brush now I'm
using my Sigma SS 224 and I'm just going
to start kind of running that in my
crease here and I feel like it kind of
starts to pick up some of what's on the
lid so I'm kind of like doing a little
up-and-down a little side to side just
kind of starting to get some of those
colors up in there
then I'm gonna actually dip that tip
down like this right in the darkest
shade there the dark sparkly shimmery
shade I'm gonna look down into a mirror
and we're just going for kind of a light
wash of that color here in our crease
you could get really dramatic you could
do a big defined outer V this is just a
nice shade I think to have in anyone's
collection but we're just kind of using
it in sort of a subtle way because we're
really going to get intense with the
liner on this look so and this could
definitely be used not you don't have to
have brown eyes to pull this look off
that these these are basic shades that
would look good on anyone but I do think
that they cater nicely to those with
brown eyes like myself so kind of
pulling that up ever so slightly on to
not quite on top of the brow bone but
you can see we've sort of come out from
under the crease a little bit there next
we're going to go to the shade that I
compare to golden sunrise from from
covergirl and it's a shimmery golden
bronze and so I'm going to use my same
fluffy brush that I just used pick up a
little bit of that color and just kind
of run that along the border of what you
just did and just softly blend that up
to your eyebrow if you were to use the
sponge tip applicator with this shade
you would get a dense very gold like if
i swatched on my finger
very thick gold color but if you use a
fluffy brush you're just going to get a
nice wash of golden color so I kind of
like that I think it warms up you know
an otherwise kind of icy dark eye look
so I'm just running that all the way up
there very good and then we're going to
dip the tip of our brush that I sort of
say that when I want a more targeted
application for something you can get
that if you just put the tip of your
brush down in the product I'm going to
do that with this light matte cream
shade and I want that to be closest to
my eyebrow so I'm going to get a little
more on there and just follow the arch
of the brow with that shade
next comes the liner for this look and I
really think that blue navy blue
eyeliners can make brown eyes look very
vibrant as specially if you do some
water lining so I'm going to do that as
well here in a second first I'm going to
use it on my upper lash line
this is the jet-set waterproof eyeliner
in midnight blue and this is a really
really long wearing liner I'm gonna use
my liner brush from bourgeois Paris you
can see it's a very fine tipped liner
and this is nice and creamy so this is
going to be a fairly easy job here just
pick some up on the tip of the brush and
I'm going from inner corner to outer
corner just following my natural lash
line with this product continuing to
just apply this deep dark blue shade and
as we start to get to the part of our
eye where we've put the dark shadow you
can kind of see the to almost mesh and
and you know one isn't too isn't really
popping that much from the other and I
kind of like that it adds to the smoky
effect of this look so I'm just stopping
at the edge of the eye with this liner
here and then I'm going to pick some up
on the same brush and put it on my
waterline it's gonna glide on there
fairly easily and like I said this liner
is designed to be very long wearing on
the waterline so as you can see it's
very rich and very blue and once you put
that navy blue on there it really makes
the whites of your eyes pop that goes
for anyone whether you got brown eyes or
whatever that Navy liner really does a
good job of making it stand out but if
you're not a waterline person or if you
feel like it bothers your eye personally
with this this really locks on there and
it doesn't go anywhere and I don't even
feel it or notice that it's there but if
you don't want to do that step you
definitely don't have to so once I've
got it on my waterline I'm going to go
back to my natural lash line just on the
very outside there and get a little
blend going with what I did on the upper
so you can see just kind of working
around that corner just a bit this is
going to kind of lock in there if you
don't blend it quickly so I'm going to
take my q-tip to kind of smudge just a
bit but you don't have a ton of
time to work with it because it will get
to where it's just gonna stay put
and that's that next I'm gonna use
another brush from bourgeois Paris this
is kind of like a pencil brush or a
smudge brush and I'm going to go tip
down with that into that darkest shade
in the palette the dark blue-black and
just get a little bit on the tip and
then I'm going to use that try to open
my eyes really nice and wide and kind of
just use that to go on my natural lash
line and we get this nice kind of smoky
fade coming down from what's on the
waterline so really other than that
outer corner we haven't really put liner
on our natural lower lash line is just
on the waterline and then this is of
course just shadow very easy to do but
it looks like you've done a lot of
blending work if you want to go over
that outer corner just a little bit
darken it up be my guest next we're
going to do some mascara so I'm going to
curl my lashes I'm going to apply
probably two coats of this lash blast
length on my upper lashes and one coat
on the bottom you can see we're going
for that nice kind of thick and long
gated look on top and then when you've
got that very defining mascara on the
bottom it adds to this smoky effect
we're getting here but while the whites
of our eyes and I feel like the Browns
are still really popping as well so I'll
put that on and I'll join you with the
finished look unless you know what's on
my lips and cheeks
all right joining you now with the
finished look um it's all complete and I
really like how it pulled together I
feel like it does bring out brown eyes
but it's maybe you know you might think
okay I have brown eyes I'm gonna use
brown eyeshadow but I think this palette
goes to show you don't necessarily have
to on my lips I am using revlon
colorburst lipstick and soft nude and
this is a really nude lipstick like this
is going to give you that classic nude
lip but I went over that and it's not
shimmery at all it's like a creamy
lipstick and I went over the top of that
with the NYX lip gloss and frosted beige
which is a very similar color but it
just adds some shine so it kind of makes
your lips sort of pop from your face a
little bit on my cheeks just to give a
little accent of color but not not too
much I used the covergirl cheekers blush
in plum flush so a plum colored blush
just kind of used it right in here and I
feel like it you know helps the cheeks
pop a little bit but it's not a
traditional shade I really like having
fun with blush colors and I used the
cheekers and golden pink as sort of a
contour shade there to add a little
dimension to my face so thanks so much
for tuning in for this video I hope
you'll continue to watch the other looks
in this series where I show looks for
different eye colors I think it's going
to give you some new ideas whether you
have brown eyes or whatever color these
are looks that can work on everyone but
I do get that question so much what's
the best cut shades for me to use for
eyeshadows so I think this will clear
some things up so thanks so much for
tuning in and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
