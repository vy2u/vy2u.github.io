series today for a look for those of you
with green eyes and obviously I don't
have green eyes so you're going to use
your imagination a little bit there but
really it just goes to show that this is
a look that anyone can wear I have brown
eyes if you have blue eyes you could
wear this look too but I think the
concept is that these particular shades
in the quantum using today can really
especially make green eyes pops so it's
another one of the kids from covergirl
it's the eye brightening a shadow
palette so i'll show you how i used all
four of these shades in this look it's
kind of a mixed berry palette so it's
really pretty i think this would be a
great it's kind of a nice romantic sort
of look but i think it would work for a
lot of different occasions so if you
want to see how I pulled it all together
keep on line one is to prime your lids
and really this whole area up to your
brow I'm using my ELF mineral eyeshadow
primer that's a really inexpensive
drugstore eye primer you can use if you
can't find it at your drugstore you can
go to eyes lips face calm I get a lot of
questions about eye primers and I like
the palladia one and and I think this is
a really good inexpensive one as well
but moving on to the eyeshadow I'm going
to be using this quad from covergirl and
it is the the vivid green squad for the
eye brightening shadow palettes they're
so as you can see we're kind of dealing
with some mixed berries sort of shades
here nothing is extremely sparkly but
they do have kind of that satiny finish
so a little subtle Sheen with these
shades but nothing that's like all out
glitter and I'm going to go about this
look a little different way I'm trying
to keep these looks really wearable but
I don't want them to all you know come
off in the same sort of shadow pattern
on the eyes so this one's going to be a
little different I'm going to use the
sponge tip applicator to start and I'm
going to use the pointed side and we're
going to actually start with the darkest
shade here which is sort of like a cross
between a burgundy and a plum it's
really really pretty kind of reminds me
of Max sketch so I'm going to get some
of that on there and this I really like
the cover of the sponge tip applicator
that come with covergirl stuff because
the pointed end
fits right there into the corner of the
eye really nicely so we're kind of
getting this smoky plum look just all
over the lid and while we initially got
that application there right on the
inner corner and that's going to be more
intense we also want the outer corner of
this to be more intense as well in a
little bit we're going to sort of
highlight the center of the lid but we
want either side to be a little bit
darker so just go ahead and do that and
I don't think I mentioned this in my
first video but these I brightening
quads for each eye color from covergirl
do come with a little brush and it's
actually not a bad brush it's kind of
full and it's going to be a little
difficult to like used to precisely
apply your shadow but it is good for
kind of blending it out so I'm just
going to stick this in the crease and
that shadow is just going to diffuse a
little bit and I don't have anything on
my brush either as I do this I'm just
kind of helping that darkness sort of
work into the crease just a little bit
next I'm going to take my essence of
beauty fine crease brush still with the
dark plum and we are just going to build
up a little more color right here and I
wouldn't quite call it a distinct outer
V but we are just pulling that darker
shade to our crease and beyond mainly
focusing on the outer half there so it's
kind of a nice faded look and then if
you want to go back to your little
blending brush that came with the quad
and and blend that out go for it next
I'm going to take a fluffy shadow brush
and we're going to go to the pink in
this kit which is actually really pretty
I like this pink shade a lot it's got
about the same amount of shimmer as all
the other shades but it which is not
very extensive in fact I think it comes
off on the I this whole look comes off
somewhat Matt which is sort of
refreshing when it comes to a drugstore
palettes a lot of them look pretty
shimmery a lot of the time so I've got
some of that shade on my brush and I am
just going to dust this
primarily on the border of what I just
did and you can see it kind of you know
we're building up a little bit of warmth
a little bit of that pink tone it's not
like pink eye or an infected looking
pink that's kind of nasty but it's just
a soft pink that I think really works
great alongside the plum and as you can
see as I continue to blend and there's
less and less on my brush I start to
work it up to the eyebrow now back to
the sponge tip applicator and we're
going to go to the lightest shade in
this palette which is actually I would
say a super light light pink lilac shade
and I'm going to use the rounded part of
that tip get some product on there and
then we're just going to take this right
up under our brow this is a really soft
shade so you're not don't expect to see
like a big white swath of color up here
it's very soft and it makes a nice
progression from that pink that we just
put on I'm really concentrating it sort
of under the highest point of my eyebrow
next we're going back to the darkest
shade I'm going to use my antec lon
liner brush my angled brush from coastal
scents and I want to use this around the
lower part of the eye as opposed to
using a harsh you know other sort of
liner of some sort we're going to put
this on here and then we're going to
buff it out anytime you want sort of a
softened look on the lower lash line
it's a great idea to just take the you
know darkest shadow you're working with
put it on there and then just blend it
out its gonna smudge for you even easier
than a cream is going to or a you know a
cream pencil or anything like that okay
so now that I got that on there I'm just
going to take I'm going to grab my brush
from Sigma the SS 219 and it's kind of a
pointy pencil brush the brush is bare
and you can see I'm just taking it right
along the lash line to where we're
benefiting from that pretty plum color
being there but it's not like a distinct
line then I'm going to go to the one
shade we haven't used yet in this
palette which is right here and it's
I have a dusty lilac color it's a little
deeper than your typical lilac and seems
to have almost a taupe twist to it and
I'm going to take that a little bit of
that on the pencil brush now and blend
just below what we did there I'm going
to keep the look really soft kind of and
not not the most noticeable step of this
look obviously but I think it does
function to blend that out a little bit
better last step with the shadow before
we move on to liner go back to the
lightest shade here and I'm going to use
my teeny tiny brush from Coastal Scents
this is a little like detail brush you
could use a q-tip for this step as well
if you want to i'm going to pick up some
of the lightest color i'm going to dot
it right in the center of my eyelid here
instantly we get a little bit of
brightness almost a dewy kind of a
glossy look here so just put as much of
that on there as you want and if you
want to blend it out kind of what i
would do is sort of get the light off of
that brush there and then if you want to
blend it out you've got more of like a
bear brush and you can kind of go over
the edges on our lower lash line or our
lower waterline actually i'm going to
use my soft kohl eyeliner from Rimmel
the shade is pure white going to use
this here you can see the difference
between this eye on this side this one
just looks a little bit brighter a
little more wide awake and I think that
putting a little white eyeliner there
can really do the trick or that's
concerned this is really soft it has
decent staying power there and it just
really takes away any look of redness
that you have on that area i think when
we use a lot of these warm Burgundy's
and pinks we want to stay away from the
eyes looking to read so that's why we're
doing that step and then I'm going to
take a liquid liner from la girl it's
the fine line pen I've used this quite a
bit before got a really fine tip and
I want to do that because I really want
to show off this nice look we've got
going on here on the lids so I want a
liner that's going to give me a super
thin line so it doesn't cover it up so
we're going to just start very close to
the lash line here getting or you can
see just how fine that line is and just
continue that on over all the way to the
other side when you do get to the end
you know it's really your option if you
like to wing out your liner that's fine
for me you can see I'm just kind of
thickening it toward the end I'm not
doing a big cat eye but that's totally
personal preference if you enjoy that do
whatever you want and that goes for the
entire tutorial just because I do
something one way does not mean you have
to do it that way on yourself next for
mascara I'm using a new mascara that I
just picked up from the drugstore the
other days you can see it's super
lengthening it is the grow luscious by
fabulous mascara from Revlon and I'm
usually not too impressed with revlon
mascaras but this one this is the very
first time I've used it and I actually
really like the brush is huge brush
totally reminds me of your show and the
concept behind this mascara just to give
you a little info i'll probably review
this but it's at mascara and lash
enhancer in one so it claims to grow
your lashes longer and give you more
fullness to your lashes so yeah I guess
I'll you have to keep tabs on how well
this works over the course of time here
but I am going to use it for this
tutorial so I'll put that on and I'll
join you with the finished look and
what's on my lips
all right guys here is my finished look
lots of pretty pinks and purples in this
look and while I think it's something
that definitely would look great on
green eyes I think it works for brown
eyes as well I obviously have brown eyes
and I think it just goes to show these
are just some ideas that can really work
for anyone with these looks I'm trying
to keep them wearable and something you
know you feel like you could just wear
on a daily basis you don't have to have
a special occasion to wear this look but
it could work for that as well so again
the quad that I used for the eyes was
the eye brightening shadow palette in
vivid greens from covergirl there and on
my lips I'm using a lipstick I really
like that it came in a like a gift set
that I got during Christmas time it's
the color design vintage rose lipstick
from Lancome and so it is kind of that
pretty rosy color has actually a little
bit of a bluish undertone and was just
really soft and I think it's you know
doesn't really compete too much with the
eye look we've got going on it really
works and then on my cheeks I did sort
of a light muted pink blush because we
do have a lot of pink going on here so i
just used the shade in rose silk from
covergirl it's the cheekers and this
isn't too bold it's just a really really
soft natural pink actually with just a
little bit of peach in it as well so um
thanks so much for tuning in for this
video guys and I will keep you posted on
how this grow luscious mascara from
Revlon works out its supposed to grow
your lashes over time so I will let you
know thanks for tuning in have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
