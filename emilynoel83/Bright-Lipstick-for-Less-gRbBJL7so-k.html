with me for this video all about bright
lipsticks very excited about this said
actually the idea for this came to me
over the weekend we were at my in-laws
so that explains sort of the gap in
video posting here he had a Wall Street
Journal out and the article there just
really caught my eyes about bright
lipstick and just the trend women are
sort of leaning toward in terms of just
throwing on a bright lipstick keeping
the rest of the face fairly simple and
neutral and the tendency toward women
feeling more comfortable spending you
know between thirty and forty dollars
for a single lipstick and how different
brands are really kind of latching on to
this trend and turning out some
beautiful bright colors and one of the
first things I noticed was that there
was maybe in this whole article I mean
they had many different lipsticks sort
of displayed here and there but it was
primarily high-end lipsticks so you all
know where my head is going there I'm
thinking oh my gosh how many gorgeous
bright beautiful drugstore lipsticks do
I have that I would like to you know let
people know are out there that are
really you know great ways to follow
this trend is I've rounded up actually
my top favorite orange coral red and
pink lipsticks as well as a couple of
things that I would suggest to those of
you who say I'm really not comfortable
going there with a bright lip color a
couple of things that can kind of
transition you into getting a little
more comfortable with also I surveyed my
facebook page to see what colors you
guys were most interested in and I said
the question was you know what bright
lipstick color would you be most likely
to wear and a lot of people said pink
that was the number one answer
followed by coral then red and then or
so we're gonna go in that order and I'm
going to give you some really
inexpensive recommendations that still
pack such a punch these are not just
shades that I like but these are
formulas that I really enjoy the texture
I love soos are a really fun way to kind
of use your lips as an accessory
I'm gonna jump in and talk about Pink's
bright Pink's that I really like and the
first one is vivacious fuchsia and this
is a Milani HD advanced lip color really
like how nicely these go on this shade
as you can see it's just creamy it
doesn't have any sparkle to kind of see
the almost purpley tones in that one but
it still strikes me as just a really
nice bright place rounded up also more
of a pure pink this past weekend I was
out with my sisters-in-law and I was you
know still like thinking about this
article and I'm like I want to get one
new bright lipstick in light of this
article and I got fuchsia fever it's one
of the Nabal in color sensational
lipsticks and it's such a bright pink
but I wore it out later that night and I
thought it was actually really pretty
and you can see the difference between
these two this is a little more pinky
and this one has a little more of like
that purple undertone the brightest of
the bright one that I've always
considered one of the brightest in my
collection and I love the revlon
colorburst lipsticks this one is fuchsia
all the names include fuchsia here but
that is really you know bright bright
pink and it's right here as you can see
it's kind of similar to the Milani but a
little bit deeper
quarrel was something you guys said you
were interested in and that's what I
would call what I have on right now it's
not full-on orange but it's kind of
walking that line between orange with a
little bit of pink or red tone thrown
into it so the one I'm wearing now is
from NYX and it's one of their round
lipsticks which are really affordable
and this shade is called femme so really
pretty maybe a little intimidating
looking but these go on really smooth
they're creamy all the ones I've talked
about so far you know there's no shimmer
in there but I love this color really
brightens up the face pair it with a
coral tone blush and you're good to go
now this one is a revlon colorburst in
peach I'm calling it kind of a coral
peach it's not a total orange and it's a
little bit lighter but it still has some
bright it has a slightly pearl finish to
it another kind we brought up in terms
of bright lips are reds and one that I
recommend to a lot of people and so many
people have come back to me and said
thank you so much for telling me about
this lipstick it's so inexpensive
it's the NYC ultra moist lip we're in
sheer red works on a lot of skin tones
instead of just being you know bright
tomatoey Reds so I still feel like it
gives a bold lip it may not be the
brightest color that I've put on my
hands so far but it's a very wearable
wreckage of a little bit brighter red
one that I want to tell you about it's
from Wet n Wild and this is the mega
shield lipsticks I really like the feel
of these I've talked about them before
this one is called salsa lessons and
this is one of my favorites of the bunch
see how much difference there can be
between reds you know when you talk
about a red lipstick that's why I think
people get turned off sometimes because
they've maybe only experimented with one
kind of red there's so much out there
and this is more of like a bright kind
almost a little more towards a core and
finally a Revlon lip butter that I love
so much and this one is cherry tart this
is kind of like a classic red with a
little bit of a berry twist but it's you
can see see the difference how revlon
colorburst lip butters are giving you
that little more glow
finish she didn't get a lot of love in
my Facebook poll but I do want to share
one with you and this is from
wet-and-wild and this is one of their
like matte finish lipsticks which I'm
not nuts about I have to wear these in
conjunction with a ball or a gloss for
them to feel comfortable and not look
too dry on my lips but this one is 24
karat gold is really pure orange
saturated color right here so totally
great orange eco I also want to mention
a couple of things for people who are
thinking I don't really want to go there
with my lip look or I you know I need
something to kind of transition me there
a couple of products I love are the
Maybelline Baby Lips and also the
Neutrogena revitalizing lip balm in a
couple of colors in particular this one
is cherry me and I love this as a pretty
red in fact I just recommend it to
someone on Twitter who said you know how
do I kind of try something without going
all out and this gives a nice tint of
like cherry red color other one is sunny
berry from Neutrogena this is a lot of
color this is really really pretty for a
you know a berry toned lip glossy type
finish on it but not have quite as full
of coverage as some of these other
lipsticks because just intended to give
you some low cost ideas when you walk
into a drugstore and you've got like a
zillion different you know lipstick
brands and shades to sort through it was
my hope that this would just kind of
minimize the decision making process and
give you some colors that have been
tested and approved at least by maybe
yourself thanks for watching again guys
