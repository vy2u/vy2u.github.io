beauty broadcast on YouTube thanks so
much for joining me for this video in
this video I'm going to show you how to
get the perfect bronzed Bridal look I
know a lot of people want to really
stand out and look great in their white
dress but how do you do that without
going overboard and without looking
streaky or just really unnatural first
up let's talk sunless tanners there's a
great one for the face from dr. dennis
gross skincare it's called the alpha
beta glow pads and these are really cool
because they have an anti-aging element
and an exfoliating element in there as
well as the sunless tanner and this is
honestly one of the best sunless tanners
for the face because it really gives you
natural color that you can noticeably
see ch one of these pads contains alpha
hydroxy acids which will exfoliate the
dry dull skin and also minimize the
appearance of any dark spots and pores
so it's really a great skincare item as
well as the sunless tanner does not have
any tint to it so you just take the pad
out and rub it all over your face
there's plenty of juice in these pads to
also cover your neck and your decollete
area perfectly let's talk about a couple
of great sunless tanners for the body
one is available in the drugstore it's
from banana boat and it's called summer
color self-tanning lotion I have the one
called deep dark color this is really
great because as you continue to use it
I feel like it continues to build and
give you deeper and deeper cut this is
tinted so when you use it you'll be able
to see kind of where this is going on
your body and when it comes to getting
your back area you may want to have
somebody help you out with that because
it can be really hard to sunless tan and
get everywhere on there on your own but
one great tip when you're using sunless
tanner and you're using your hands to
apply it keep your fingers together and
advise whoever is helping you to keep
their fingers together that way you
really minimize the chance of streaks
really rub the product in and once
you've been over one area there is no
need to go back over it again
so kind of keep track of where you've
been and where you're going and you will
be on your way to a great streak-free
tan another great tanning option is from
bare essentials and it's called fo tan
the interesting aspect of this tanner is
that it comes with a great thick brush
this brush is so soft and so dense and
this basically takes the hands out of
the equation so when you're putting this
on you're rubbing it on and it's
covering a really wide area of skin and
you can get it you know right down onto
your hands with the product and not have
to worry about even you know washing
your hands off because you have used a
brush looks great it has a nice kind of
cherry almond scent to as you continue
to use this you can achieve a very deep
dark tan finally a couple products you
can add to your makeup look for your
wedding day that can really finish off
the bronze look and come off great in
pictures from Laura Geller and it's
called bronze and brighten you've got
tones of pink light creamy colors deep
bronze tones when you swirl a brush over
all of this and apply it you get the
perfect color you will find that this is
not an overly shimmery product it's just
these perfect tones that come together
to really brighten the skin and if you'd
like the appearance of a slimmed face
there's something you can do with
bronzer to contour and get a really
great look this is actually the
contouring blush and bronzer from ELF a
bargain beauty product you can just use
a blush brush in the contour side of
this product go just under your
cheekbones go just under your jaw as
well you can even contour your forehead
area it'll really slim the face give you
a very toned look use a combination of
these tips I think you'll be really
happy with the look you have on your
wedding day it's just really important
to not neglect any one area if you're
using sunless tanner on the body you may
want to take steps to also use a sunless
tanner or some bronzers on your face so
everything is looking at some of these
tips I think you'll be really happy with
the finished look thanks for watching
I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
