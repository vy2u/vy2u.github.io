tutorial with you today this is gonna be
a bronze smokey look and I'm using the
NYX bronze smokey look palette to pull
this off this is a really neat little
palette as you can see it's so small
it's awesome for travel you're getting a
nice mirror and also nine shades in here
plus a couple of lip colors as well so
in this video I'm going to show you how
to use these shades to get that smoky
look utilizing some of those shapes to
get a smoky liner look while the shadow
is not overly harsh at all so if you're
looking for maybe smokey eyes that work
for daytime this would totally be right
up your alley so if you want to see how
I do it keep watching first step I'm
taking a flat eyeshadow brush these come
standard in a lot of kids - from the
Sigma kit it's the SS 239 and I'm gonna
be going right down here to this classic
gold shade in this palette so pick some
of that color up and kind of Pat that on
primarily the inner part of the eyelid
then I'm going to go with this shade
that sits right next to that gold in
this palette it's right here and it has
a nice gold shimmer but it's more of a
Browns so I'm gonna get some of that on
my brush as well and Pat that and I'm
using this patting motion so the shadow
really stays concentrated right where I
want it to go rather than doing a lot of
back and forth motions at this point
that would cause it to kind of float all
over my face I'm gonna use my SS 217
think of just a fuller brush that works
for you this one is a little bit pinched
right here at the top so it can be a
little more flat just barely and I'm
gonna go into that same brown shade that
I used on the outer part of my lid and
just buff that up right into the crease
and when we're going into the crease go
in but also we want some of this to be a
little bit visible up on top of our brow
bone just a little bit so think of just
blending it up a little bit higher this
like that next we're gonna do a couple
little highlighting steps with this
gorgeous kind of golden light gold right
here in the center of the palette so
take any fluffy eyeshadow brush I'm
using my head has 224 and going up under
the brow and just I mean you'll find
this brightens but not in a really
obvious you know like white highlight
way but in just a really natural way I'm
taking all the way in here as well that
if you have a really small brush or a
q-tip get a little bit more of that
color tap off the excess and go right in
here around that tear duct with the
lightest shade and it's going to cause
this area to really pop with golden
bronze tones last thing I want to do is
work in a really nice dark shade just to
give this a smoky effect but yet
something that's still very wearable for
daytime and it's this shade right down
here in the corner it's not the richest
darkest black I've ever seen it's kind
of like a deep charcoal color and so
pick some of that up on your flat
eyeshadow brush I'm going to Pat that
right at the outer corner here just to
deepen it up a little bit you might have
to go back I mean I I try to build up
the color a little bit because I'm not
quite sure you know don't want to get
too much darkness there right at the
start so I go back a couple times and
build the coat and remember that large
brush we use for the highlight you can
take a brush like that just kind of all
over this look when it's relatively bare
the brush is and you can kind of keep it
all blended and buffed out next I'm
going to get out a pencil brush and this
is my SS 219
this is a very stiff brush and I'm going
to be using this dark shade once again
right under my lower lash line and so
this is this is where smoky looks come
from you know it's not by using precise
liner brushes but brushes like this that
can really give it a out appearance so
I'm going to go about 3/4 of the way in
on that until we start hitting our light
little highlight that we put in there
and then I'm gonna go to the brown shade
right next door and we're gonna do that
and this is gonna be you know you don't
want to go too much but just under this
shake / blending over it you know what I
mean creating more of a smokey effect
there next up we're gonna do liner I'm
gonna line my waterline with my malli
ever color automatic eyeliner and this
isn't onyx it's a really nice blood then
I'm gonna take my wet and wild cream
eyeliner in black and I'm gonna use a
pointed tip brush to apply this this is
really super long wearing and I'm just
gonna apply this all across my upper
lash line so I'm not really winging out
this liner at all I'm just kind of
pulling it to the outer core next you
can use your pencil brush in that
darkest charcoal shade in the palette to
kind of go over your line there it'll
just soften it up a little bit not too
not too much I mean you're still gonna
have liner there obviously but it's just
gonna soften it next I'm going to curl
my lashes I'm going to apply my ma one
coat nourishing mascara a triple effect
a couple coats of that on the upper
lashes and a couple coats of Maybelline
lash discovery on the bottom lashes
because this is such a small brush and
I've never had smudging issues with it
so I'll put that on and then I'll join
you with the finished look alright guys
here's your finished look I hope you
like it it's really not that
intimidating kind of scary smokey eye if
you're not used to doing smokey looks a
whole lot because we're using bronze II
colored shadows which can really blend
nicely with those deeper charcoal tones
so I really like the configuration of
color you get here because you're able
to take deeper shades like this and work
in lighter tones of bronze as well so
definitely a fan of this look but there
are a few key products that'll help you
pull it off and pull your whole face
together with this and I love the hard
candy so baked bronzer and heat wave
this has a little bit of shimmer but it
can be really nice for a wash of bronzy
color all over your face your decollete
area anywhere on your body you want
bronzer grab a big big kabuki brush and
just go crazy because this gives a
really pretty natural
and then I'm using a blush that is
actually matte it does not have sparkle
in it and it's Milani minerals in my
Thai one of my all-time favorite peachy
pink just for that little bit of glow
going on there and then a great
Luminizer highlight shade is from lorac
it's the perfectly lit powder in
spotlight and this is great for being a
highlight you can kind of see the sheen
right there that doesn't give you too
much but just enough so you don't have
to be scared of looking too scary and
sparkly when you go out in the daylight
now for lips as like as you saw in sort
of this bottom trap drawer here you have
a couple of shades I used this bronzer
shade just real lightly with my finger I
dabbed it all over then I decided I
wanted a little more gloss on top so I
used the Beauty rush lip gloss from
Victoria's Secret it's simply called
bananas and it smells great and it just
gives a nice golden gloss over the tops
so not a hard look to achieve it's just
you know getting used to doing liner
techniques that really take away the
harsh edge but really give you that
smoky look instead so thanks a lot for
watching have a wonderful day and I'll
see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
