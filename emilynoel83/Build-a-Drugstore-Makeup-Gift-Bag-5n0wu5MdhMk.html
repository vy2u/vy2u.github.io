I'm really excited to do this video
because this is something I have done
for my friends over the years and I just
thought it's a great gift idea it's a
great way to do something that is low
cost but is also somewhat more
meaningful than just buying one you know
high end pallet or one one big products
that's already prepackaged and the idea
is to make your own drugstore makeup
gift bag for someone so you could take
maybe a gift bag that you already have
or you could go out and you know buy
something special if you wanted to or
you could just wrap the stuff
individually and put it in you know a
regular gift gift bag type thing but
this for example came with like a
Clinique kit and so it's just a really
cute makeup bag and something about this
size will fit everything I'm going to
tell you about in this video and so the
idea here is not that you necessarily
need to follow every you know product
suggestion that I give but if you're
looking for sort of a guideline or some
some ideas of what might be good this
could maybe give you just a little bit
of a basis for that or if you just want
to say hey I'm going to take all your
suggestions and tell my friend hey
there's this girl I watch on YouTube her
name's Emily and she requested she
suggested all these items you know I'll
take the responsibility for that too but
basically what I tried to do with this
is pick some fun products that I thought
would make good gifts items and kind of
stay away from those products where you
have to know their skin tone exactly to
match them some way foundation like this
this is just kind of an all-encompassing
gift bag and you could go obviously more
or less what I put in this gift bag goes
will run you somewhere between thirty
and thirty five dollars I would love to
receive this is a gift so and I do plan
to give these items as a gift to someone
I'm not going to say who in case they
might be watching but I'm just going to
go through right now and tell you
everything I put in here and so these
are some personal favorite products of
mine one of them is only a dollar and it
is my ultimate favorite eyelash curler
and it is the elf eyelash curler you
will find this at Target stores or at
eyes lips face comm and it is just a one
full little tool for eyelashes and it
just fits my I really will use that
every single day next up for the red
lipstick lover or the person who is
trying red lipstick for the first time I
think this is a great gift because it's
very cheap there's not a lot lost if
they don't turn out to like it but I
just have found using this on other
people that this is one of the best
universal red lip colors that's out
there I have it on my lips right now and
it is the NYC ultra moist lip we're in
sheer red again it's another drugstore
fine just head out to your drugstore and
pick it up I'll do a swatch hair in my
hand that's what it looks like it is
definitely a moisturizing feel and it
just gives you a great red lip I mean if
you're not gonna try it around the
holidays when are you gonna try it you
know so this would just be a nice little
thing to throw in there help them try
red lips for the first time anybody can
wear next up is a product that I know
for a fact works on a variety of skin
tones because I have used this on my
sisters-in-law if you saw the twins
video where I did their makeup I use
this on both of them and it's the elf
contouring blush and bronzer so they
have a very very fair skin and I think
this would work well on dark skin also
it's a buildable product and it's
something that you know if you just use
a little bit you're going to be good for
fair skin you can build it up for darker
skin tones but you get that wonderful
contouring bronzer there and then you
get this awesome
peachy kind of shimmery glowy blush that
almost can act as a highlighter when you
get it right there in the right spots so
I think that is a wonderful gift product
because I think your friend is really
going to enjoy that having those two
items there in one just remember if they
have fair skin advised them to use the
bronzer lightly I am throwing in the
mascara that I have been using for
several months now I think pretty
religiously and I just really really
enjoy it and it is the voluminous carbon
black mascara and I just am a big big
fan of this mascara I have tried Lancome
Hypnose and Hypnose drama and this one I
honestly think I might like
and them both and it's just a very dense
brush you will like this mascara the
more you go on and use it so I feel like
as the product gets a little bit drier
in the tube just after you know a week
or two worth worth of use it's going to
perform absolutely perfectly also how
about some false eyelashes you know
sometimes these are the types of thing
to you as a well-informed makeup loving
friend you know might want me to I don't
know sort of get somebody going on the
idea of this and let them see how much
it can change their look for a special
occasion I'm talking about false
eyelashes and I am a huge fan of the
Revlon false eyelashes these happen to
be defining but they have intensifying
they have so many other options it's
probably the most natural option so if
you are going to introduce someone who
didn't wear falsies a lot but wants
something just to add some natural
thickness these are great these are only
about $4 at Walmart and then $4 as well
the Revlon precision lash adhesive I
swear by this this is the only light
glue I ever want to use any more because
it just goes on so easily
it's got instead of squeezing it out of
the tube it's got this lovely wand
applicator it gets just the right amount
on gets tacky quickly it has definitely
expedited the process of putting on
false eyelashes for me for sure
next thing is a lip balm that it's just
a great little gift died and I think
because it's a little bit different
chances are than anything they've tried
before and it is the EOS lip balm I love
the lemon drop flavor and you can find
this in most Walgreens stores has the
most refreshing lemon scent just kind of
one of those you know put it on at the
start of the day just kind of perks up
the senses a great little item to throw
in to your gift
makeup bag last two things I want to
talk about are a little bit bigger this
is five dollars and I think it makes a
wonderful gift bag thing and it is from
ELF and it is their $5 palette I know
you guys have seen me review the big 100
palette and I like that as well but I
think kind of for this gift bag idea
this fist will probably fit right into
mo
bags that you might give and it's just a
little less maybe overwhelming and I
have been using this so often just like
the 100 I used that for quite some time
realized I like this wanted to go ahead
and see what the the five-dollar palette
was all about and it has such a good mix
of neutral bright and smoky colors so I
can do more swatch wise on this on my
blog I definitely need to because I am
backed up on them
not if it's watching on my to-do list
for my blog but just to let you know
basically these colors are pretty
pigmented you're getting a mix of matte
and shimmer there are they all
absolutely fantastic colors no you will
run into a few that you don't maybe like
as well as others but for the most part
I think this is an awesome awesome kit
for five bucks last but not least a
great item to throw in a gift bag I
think are some brushes and I'm going to
throw in a set that I think is one of
the best kinds of brushes you can find
at the drugstore and it's from Ecotools
and this happens to be a little eight
dollar brush set and it's the mineral
brush set so you're getting this little
pouch and then you're getting these four
brushes that go in it a really nice
powder slash blush brush slash you know
great bronzer breast brush as well but I
love so much about the mineral kit is
that you really feel like you're giving
someone a treat because these are
incredibly soft brushes some of the
softest brushes I have found in the
drugstore are the is this Ecotools
mineral set so you can see it's got like
the dual tone bristles that's how you
know these are the mineral brushes so
this is a great size for your you know
your contouring your bronzer your powder
whatever then you've got a little kabuki
brush as well and so if you want that
you know slightly more dense application
of mineral makeup or something like that
or you just want to use this for powder
maybe you've put your foundation on and
this can be the brush that you use to
set that that's an awesome idea and then
you get a couple brushes this one of
course is an eye brush so this is going
to be a good size this is an actually
very good size to use this a blending
brush to kind of like you put the color
in your crease now you want to blend it
out or just a wash of color in your
crease this can do that again very soft
you don't have to feel strange at all
about using this around your eye area
because it really for that that kind of
more sensitive skin zone this is
SuperDuper soft and then you get this
other brush that can be a concealer
brush or I think this can make a really
good flat eyeshadow brush to pack on the
color so whatever you want to use it for
it's great because it comes kind of in
its own little set there and I just
think that is a fantastic way to round
out your gift bags
so guys hopefully this gave you some
ideas for building your own makeup gift
bag again use the ideas that I shared
with you here or alter it a little bit
here and there I'm sure we all have run
across some of our you know most
favorite products that we would love to
share with a friend if we could so take
Christmas as your opportunity to expose
some people with some new great products
that maybe they've never tried before
and maybe would never try unless you
sort of you know steered them in the
right direct so feel free to share what
you might put into you know your makeup
gift bag for someone or what you would
like to receive in a makeup gift bag I
think it's always fun to share tons of
ideas where this kind of thing is
concerned because we're all sort of
trying to brainstorm what the best gifts
might be so thanks again for watching
everyone I hope you all have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
