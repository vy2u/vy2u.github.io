those fun building your collection
videos I don't know if you saw the first
one I did but it was about I shadow and
I want to make it clear that some of the
things I'm suggesting you know some
things you'll see me point out and say
this brand this item this color is you
know really great but other things you
know are going to be suggestions more
just in terms of if you can find
something in a similar color to this
this will be good for you so just and
you know just don't take everything is
like a strict like it must be this
product because not everything I suggest
you know has to be that it can just be
that's exactly that suggestion something
that can give you steer you in the right
direction if you're just starting to
build your collection or maybe you have
a booming makeup collection and you just
kind of wanted to see what another
person does or think about things in a
different ways so this one's going to
focus on bronzers blush and also
highlighter too so basically all the
color products aside from foundations
and concealers that you'll use on your
face and I think I'm gonna start with
bronzer and I think that if you're
starting out your collection a good
couple of basic products that are good
to have is a matte bronzer and a
shimmery bronzer okay and by shimmery it
doesn't even need to be that shimmery
but something that has a little more
luminous glow to it and I'm going to
suggest something I use several um
bronzers Matt bronzers that I like I
like nyc's sunny bronzer um I like
Bonnie bells powder bronze and one that
i've been using recently is the Milani
sunset duos this one is in sunset breeze
and this is actually you'll see maybe
some sparkle on the top that's a little
blush part but the bronzer is actually
matt and i think it's a nice shade it's
not too dark and you really the reason
why i say get a matte one is because
you're really going to get the most
natural look with a matte well
because a lot of times you're going to
use that bronzer sort of is an all-over
face color but at the same time you
might intensify it a little bit as sort
of a contour right in here or if you
really want to slim down your face you
make on tour more you know on the sides
and and on the temples to to kind of get
that slimming effect you can also
contour the sides of your nose and
that's not something you want to do with
anything that has any amount of shimmer
in it so this is nice and it's also nice
to just you know if you want something
for kind of on the go as well because
you get that blush there too which is a
nice in this particular product the
blush is a nice kind of plum color it
does have a little sparkle so these two
work very well together a nice matte
bronzer that can be used for contouring
or just you know lightly all over and it
comes with a nice little bonus bush
there so and as far as a bronzer with
some shimmer and I've pretty much stuck
to the same one and that is the wet and
wild bronzer in either I have a couple
of different ones that are honestly like
identical in terms of the shade of
Tahitian tan and ballet bronze and it's
the wet and wild browsers that look like
this and this is about what the color is
there and you can see it's not too far
off if you're going to compare shade
wise from this to this this made this
just appears a little bit lighter
because it does have some shimmer to it
it's got some you know the lights going
to kind of bounce off of it a little bit
more and if you're trying to really warm
up your skin which a lot of people want
to do that without going to a tanning
bed in the wintertime this shimmery
bronzer is really great for a light
sweep and I'm not talking you know pelt
your entire face real quick with bronzer
but it's nice for a light sweep over
your forehead down your nose chin and
pop serie of your cheeks apples of your
cheeks um that's just a general purpose
that a shimmery bronzer can serve so
once again we're talking bronzer you
want something Matt and something
shimmering so and these are very
inexpensive
I believe every yep everything I'm going
to suggest right now is available at the
drugstore and that follows um sort of
what a lot of beginners ask me about
which is I don't want to spend a ton of
money you know you maybe you know half
way you you may be hatting you into your
career and you're like you know makeup
is not the vocal point in my life but I
do want to have something that i can use
day in and day out people ask me well
why are you always suggesting drugstore
things you only use drug store things no
I don't personally use only drug store
things but I am catering this line of
videos to people who have suggested I
want an affordable and easy way to get
into makeup and this is my answer to you
so I hope you guys can take something
from this next I want to move into blush
though and I think it's nice for
everybody to have a cream blush at least
one on cream blush is not something I
use every day but it is something fun to
use number one if you want to set your
look it's that whole concept of liquid
then powder or cream and then powder and
you put on a cream you set it with a
powder and it's a longer lasting effect
or you can do a more of a dewy effect
you use some moisturizer all over blend
in that cream of blush and you get a
very dewy fresh look with that and one
that I really like and this is going to
be intimidating when you look at it
because it looks like red right it's
revlon cream blush in first blush and
yes it looks red here and pinion you
only use a little so you blend it out
and I'm just going to use a little bit
on my cheeks right here this is
something you would only use you guys
smile and use it on the apples of your
cheeks and it blends to be a very
natural color I have never been
disappointed with the way this color
looks because it just looks like natural
blush you know it doesn't look fake it
doesn't look like you know clown made of
I mean this is actually good stuff you
just have to have a light hand with it
you know don't you
Plus these rev1 ones come with a nice
little pop out near so revlon cream
blush first blush it looks red but that
is my recommendation for a cream blush
and then as far as other kinds of blush
I recommend and this is going to be a
really general recommendation here you
want to have a darker shade and a
lighter shade a darker more neutral
shade that can be used for contouring
and a brighter shade that can be used on
the apples of your cheeks I when I'm
choosing a blush shade let's say I'm one
that I always use just as a standby to
do a quick contour of the cheek is
golden pink from covergirl and this is a
shade that I don't see any pink about it
really it's just kind of a tan color a
little slightly a warmed up Rosie toned
a bronzy shade and I like using that as
a contour because it's not very shimmery
or anything but then when I'm picking
out what's going to go on the apple of
my cheek I try to stay in the same color
family as what's on my lips if I'm using
pink lips or red lips or something like
that I stay in with a pink family of
blush on the cheeks or if I'm doing
something more neutral or nude I go for
more of a peachy nude kind of blush but
one that's I always enjoy in the pink
sort of plum family is covergirl
cheekers plum berry glow and i'm not
sure if you're going to this this is a
more vibrant color than it appears but
it is a nice pink shade I never struggle
to get the color to show up on my cheeks
it always does and these have been have
one editor's awards in magazines
numerous times covergirl cheekers I mean
some people say I had ever girl but I
tell you those blushes are pretty good
and ask for a peachy blush I remember my
mom always tellin me peach colored blush
looks good on everyone and I feel like I
found a good kind of universal blush so
if you just say hey Emily I don't want
to buy two freaking blushes okay you
already told me to buy two bronzers um
ok
you want to just keep it real simple and
go for one I like the Milani minerals
blush in my tie and this is I wish I
hope the colors coming out this is a
perfect peachy pink that I would venture
to say looks good on just about anybody
so if you want to go the easy route this
is a very nice blush milania's been
known to have very good blushes you'll
find they receive very high reviews on
review websites and lastly I just want
to give you a tip as far as shimmer or a
highlighter or anything of that nature
Sally girl is selling these cute little
things called shimmer stripes for less
than two dollars this one is in LOL and
it's kind of a rosy shimmer that is used
to go you would go right on top of your
cheekbones you could use it up here you
can use those as I shadows wherever you
want just make sure one thing I can say
about shimmers and things like that do
not overuse or you will start to look
oily if you if not write as soon as you
put it on as you wear it you will but I
hope this was helpful to you guys and
please let me know what you think and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
