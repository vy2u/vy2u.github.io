good day out there um I don't know if
you remember but it was have a while
back I was doing this series called
building your collection and I'm
actually still doing it it it just kind
of been a while since i posted a video i
currently have building your collection
videos on eyeliner blush and bronzer and
eyeshadow so if you want to check those
out a really easy way to just kind of
pull up only those videos is if you go
to my channel and then where it lists
all my videos it shows like nine of them
or something you go to that area and
then there's a little search box so you
can just type in building your
collection in that box and then it'll
pop up any videos that are of that type
so you can just watch them all so anyway
this one's going to be about concealers
and I just thought you know it's just a
I'm eventually going to get through
everything so I just thought hey I'll do
concealers today so um and I also as I
go through these I'm going to have some
high end and less expensive options just
because we're all in different price
ranges or we all have different
priorities may be about what sorts of
makeup we do want to spend a little more
money on so this will just kind of let
you know what's out there and again this
is this is geared toward people who may
not have really much in their collection
at all right now and are looking for you
know just the right few products that
they can add in and you know get the job
done basically and then for those of you
who already have great collections out
there this may just give you some ideas
about a few you know products maybe you
haven't tried before so anyway I'm going
to start off with a concealer that is
something you could use for
imperfections all over your face whether
that's acne or um
in acne scar or a blotch for some reason
or another you really want to use the
concealer for that type of thing that
can truly match your skin not be lighter
than your skin because I think there's a
misconception that concealers have to be
lighter than your foundation would be
and but really when you think about it
what does light do it highlights so you
want to really get something that will
just kind of mask it and blend it right
in with your entire look okay and for me
for my skin tone I have a medium skin
tone and I think there's a pretty good
range of colors for this but it's the
maybelline mineral power natural
perfecting concealer my color is it's
called sand and it's medium 0 dash 1
this really is good because I don't know
if you can get a look at that but it's
it it really matches my skin so when I
put this on something i usually don't
you tend to use it around my eyes like I
mean if I'm if I'm in a hurry I'll use
it everywhere but I have something
special I'm going to tell you about in a
second that i use for under eye but just
as far as you know a redness around my
nose this is great for that just any
little you know spot that you wake up in
the morning you're like oh not another
blemish you know this will just cover it
up really well so like I said I think
they do have a decent range of colors
for the mineral power concealer and
especially if you're a mineral makeup
user this will fit right into your
regime just fine if you want to keep
with the gentle mineral products so
that's good good bet for just all over
your face no matter what you're doing
now for your under eye area if you're
familiar with my videos you probably
know what I'm going to bring up here but
if you do have the money available in
your budget or maybe this is a gift idea
down the road I really recommend the
Bobby Brown creamy concealer kit it is
so great um what you get is get this
nice little it looks like this
you get the concealer here in the top
and then and my color is natural by the
way and then in the bottom you get a
pale yellow powder which Bobby Brown is
real big on yellow tone powder and using
that to set things and so I've read her
books I want two of her books and she is
totally a believer and you put your
concealer on around your eye and then
you set it with powder and that really
locks it in for the day you know and so
if you want to take that a step further
then you get the corrector to which I
have in bisque which is sort of a salmon
color so if I were using both of these I
would use the corrector which I think of
its kind of the real heavy duty side of
this I'd use that on like the inner
corner here and the outside right there
and then I go kind of under the entire
thing with the concealer so that is a
great option if you you know have the
means to get that that is a really
you're not going to be disappointed at
all with that purchase the Bobby Brown
creamy concealer kit and the corrector
if you can only get one get the creamy
concealer kit so um but before I was
using that I was using a project I was
actually pretty happy with and it is the
NYX or NYX or however you want to say it
a concealer in a jar it's pretty good
quality too i have this in light and
this is nice for using it just the same
way for the under eye i do like using
concealers that are a little more creamy
like like this for under eye not quite
so liquidy because i feel like they
really cover and this is a nice nice
texture a very comparable texture to the
Bobby Brown I mean it's just it really
blends easily and um you know just a
little bit lighter I feel like you can
go a little lighter then maybe your
overall skin tone on your under-eye area
because that is an area you do want to
brighten and especially you know early
warnings if you get kind of dark circles
there you can get away with using
something a little wider and then you
would this doesn't come with a little
powder you had said it lets the money
you
thing separate there but that's the NYX
concealer in a jar that's available for
like five dollars on cherry culture calm
whereas the Bobby Brown is again i
always mention it and i'm like i can't
remember how much is because i didn't
get it for myself Tyler got it for me
you can get it on qvc.com which is where
you might find the best deal and then
you can also go to Bobby Brown's website
but just check that out just it's it's
you know up there with the as far as the
cost of high end makeup it's not it's
out of the drugstore range let's put it
that way so anyway there's your
under-eye concealer options in my
opinion some good ones to try now you
may be thinking so if setting your
concealer is so important what do you do
if you just have this well you'd want to
have a separate setting powder I'm going
to give you a couple options there too I
like everyday minerals concealer in
abbots perk me up is the color and this
is I think kind of described on the
website as a combo of like a peach
powder and a yellow tone powder so that
is ideal for setting under eye makeup
sometimes I'll even use that just in
place of what's down here in the bobbi
brown because I kind of want to conserve
it you know I don't want to use up all
the bobbi brown powder right away so
i'll use the everyday minerals like this
to just set it it works just it really
works almost just as well i would say as
the bobbi brown so it's a good light
tone can use that all over your face or
you could just use it as is since it's
pretty good coverage it's everyday
minerals concealer you know on a day
when you just kind of wanted to do your
face really quick you could just use
that and do that for your under-eye
however this is available on everyday
minerals calm it's not too expensive
less than ten dollars i I believe but if
you want something you know a drugstore
purchased the NYC smooth skin lose face
powder is a very economical choice I use
it in naturally beige and my gosh look
how much you get and you can use this
all over your face is a nice loose
powder to set
your makeup look and you can get this
for you know just a few bucks at your
drugstore so that you can also just use
and as your under-eye concealer setting
powder just be aware that you know you
really do need to set what you put there
because from what I've read and I've
read up a lot about this you want to use
a little brush to do it if at all
possible because when you use and this
this one's from essence of beauty you
can get it at CVS and when I say work up
to your under-eye I mean like actually
like if my liner wasn't here I usually
do this before I would do my eye makeup
you want to get that right up to like up
to your lower lash line because you
would be surprised at the slight amount
of discoloration you can get there just
whether it's redness or just you know
not quite looking up to par with the
rest of your face so that is you know
you're at with your application you
really want to get right up in there so
I use that brush to do that and then I
have a concealer brush that I got a
while back from walmart you don't even
know if it's a brand at all and I would
dip that in the powder and then use this
to go in and actually set it with some
powder and that in turn is going to help
if you do work it up to their set it
with the powder once you put eyeliner on
your eyeliner is going to stay quite a
bit better too so if you're one of those
people that has a chronic issue with
eyeliner you know coming down on your
eye you might consider putting your
concealer on setting it with and don't
be skimpy on the powder you're really
not going to probably with these loose
powders it's hard to overdo it I'm
serious like when I put the bobbi brown
powder on that is some sheer stuff and
she encourages you to liberally apply
that because you know that is what is
locking that in for you and it also
tends to help out with like I said the
liner issues so thanks a lot for
watching this video what a little long i
guess but just had kind of quite a few
things i wanted to touch on with this
but i hope for those of you who are
building your makeup collection this is
some worthwhile
information for you and I hope you if
you try out what I've recommended I hope
you really enjoy it so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
