this video this is going to be a
building your collection video and this
time it's going to be about eyeliner if
you checked out some of the other ones
that I've done if I believe I've done
blush and I've done eyeshadow sorry I
can't remember if there's been any
others i'll have to check through that
and make sure I you know do any others
that I have not done yet but I felt like
I wanted to do an eyeliner one today so
I'm just going to go over some different
types and some suggestions for brands
but more so just the basic type of item
and then you can pick your brand's or
colors or whatever um first off I think
it would be wise for everyone to have a
liquid liner some people are kind of
intimidated by the liquid liners because
they are more difficult to use they
require more control than a pencil liner
or a powder eyeliner or even a cream
sometimes however it's good to have one
even if you're a beginner because as you
start to become more comfortable you
know little by little it's a great thing
to have the practice with and one that i
really suggest that i just continue to
buy time after time is my revlon my
revlon colorstay eyeliner it comes in a
little thing like this in the tip some
of them have had real skinny brush tips
which I have some like that but I
wouldn't necessarily I don't like them
as well because sometimes the brush
separates a little bit and doesn't give
you that nice clean line whereas the
Revlon tip is like a little felt tip
almost so if you if you have used any
other felt tip liners this is somewhat
like that it's a little bit easier to
control in my opinion but I have this in
the color is blackest black from Revlon
but if you I mean really don't like
going quite so dark on your eyes maybe
you're um have fair skin or light hair
or something and you just feel like you
like brown better brown would work too
although I've I do think it's
how just tends to be a little more
natural going with a very dark brown or
a black on your top lashline simply
because it does blend a little more with
your eyelashes sometimes just a
straight-up medium brown color can look
a little bit odd i think in a liquid
just so and so say a dot a dark brown a
real dark brown or black would be good
to have in a liquid liner then there's a
lot of talk about cream liners not the
creamy sort of pencils but an actual
cream liner that you may dip into and
the purpose for those they can make you
know great lines on top but they are
also easier to do on the bottom I would
never take my Revlon like what although
i'm sure some people do it and if you
can make it work that's fine but it's
very hard to do it on the bottom because
you want to go underneath your lashes
and for me I wanted to use some sort of
a pencil or maybe even a cream that I
can smudge just a little bit to make
that work and one that is very nice and
smudge able is the Smashbox cream liner
like this is a cream liner duo in black
oh it's blue black and midnight brown so
it's a very dark brown and also a dark
navy blue so that's it's a nice softer
finish that you can use all around your
eye and it's also easy use under your
eye as for staying power if you really
just want that line that will say that
you can use all over your eye I like the
L'Oreal hip color truth um cream
eyeliner I have this in black and it's
just you know you just dip an angled
brush in there and you know kind of like
that sort of angle on it and just dip it
in there and usually these come with
brushes if you don't like them I mean
there's plenty of angled eyeliner
brushes out there you can experiment
with but this also is fairly easy to put
under your lash line on top and it does
not smudge so I mean it does not if you
work quickly enough you may be able to
smudged a little bit but where I'm
meeting then is more like throughout the
day it won't smudge down on your face so
um
a cream liner I mean it's a good thing
to have it's just a nice option to be
able to mix in there another type of
liner that I think everybody needs to
have is a to kind of go along with your
liquid when you're using this and you
want on top and you also want to have
lying around the bottom it's nice to
have maybe a coordinating shade that
will work for that and i would say have
a dark heavy black and or a dark brown
these are also color say i really like
colorstay products and i have black
brown and black and i will often use
those just under my eye they do smudge
if you want them to but they stay very
well I actually have um the dark brown I
believe on right now under my eye and
it's been on since 130 this morning when
I had to wake up and do my makeup so
it's lasted really well it hasn't
smudged at all so that's something I
really like about colorstay liner so
just going with your basic colors you
know you got your liquid liner yup these
you can use alongside then on the bottom
and then maybe get a cream liner if you
want to be a little more experimental
there but also you know you want to look
out for those liners that are a little
more colorful and a brand that really
sells those at a good price is Jordana
you can usually get them to for three
dollars and they may not be the longest
lasting however you can work with them
setting them with a colorful
coordinating powder to help their
staying power and you know use different
techniques that way but they have some
really fun colors for example this shade
is called blitz and it's like a pretty
turquoise and then I have this nice
green shade called sea green and it's
actually nice forest green color um I
also like my Revlon Colorstay in
blackberry I love this shade it's kind
of like a deep sort of plum shade comes
off really really nice and soft I like
that a lot um so yeah I have a couple of
you know more fun colors
your eyeliner wardrobe I guess you'd say
to sort of switch it up a little bit
from time to time you know it may not be
your everyday look but um you know you
may want a navy blue in that in with
that selection the plunger great purples
you know maybe kind of copied shades or
gold any shades could be fun to silver
as well lilac is a nice fun shade to
experiment with and it's not the type of
line you might even you might not use it
all the way around your you might just
use it on the bottom or just on the
insides you know there's a lot of
different ways to work with your
eyeliner and the last thing I want to
suggest is to have some I shadows that
you can use to set any sort of cream
based liner with it maybe like you want
to set your Smashbox liner the hip
doesn't so much require that because it
dries very fast but mainly why I'm
referring to are these pencils if you
want to set that with the color it's
nice to have and mainly talked about the
deeper colors to have a shadow that you
can set on top of that and what that
does is just it's the same concept as
when you would put a liquid foundation
on and then set it with powder it helps
it last longer there are lots of this is
one of easier things to shop for because
you're just kind of looking around the
store and seeing okay I've got this
great navy blue liner I would like to
have a nice dark shadow that I can
coordinate with that may be wearing my
crease or I can set that that minor by
putting it right on top a nice set which
I've done a tutorial on is this lake
lost reopen then from NYX you get a nice
deep plum a deep this is the plum the
Navy and a nice charcoal actually have a
charcoal deep green shade so those are
just nice powders to have to walk in
with your shadow I recommend you know an
eyeliner brush like this or one that is
angled I really like my Mary Kay angled
one that's probably the best why most
like that I have but for your creams and
things like this you can also use an
angled brush or check out the selection
from a brand like low Cornell Oh
other art brushes this is an art brush
from I've almost rubbed it off I think
it says Simmons or something got for
like a dollar it's a very very fine tip
that I like to use with cream liners
like this like my L'Oreal but basically
just to sum this all up really quickly
and I think you should have a liquid
liner I think you should have a dark
pencil liner i recommend by the way
these are all all the pencils that i
mentioned are like the automatic pencils
not you know self sharpening not the
actual pencil pencil and have something
colorful and have you know some powders
that you can set them with a cream would
be a nice option too so thanks a lot
guys for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
