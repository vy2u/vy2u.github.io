video this is something that is going to
be geared specifically toward my
beginner friends because there are so
many people i think that look to youtube
but it's a great learning tool for
learning makeup and there is no shame in
being a beginner no matter what age you
are I think it's never too late to
become interested in makeup or to learn
new skills I continue to learn every
single day that I log on and launch
somebody's video so I mean we're all you
know learning at different levels but
for those of you who are just starting
out I feel like I field a lot of
individual questions from the personal
messages that you guys send you give me
a little background about your skin tone
or or what if you have problem skin what
you're dealing with and you basically
want to know what do I need to get
started and so I want to build up sort
of a series i know i'm all about doing
me series i don't know why i think it
gives you you guys an idea of what to
expect you know what sorts of videos i'm
going to be turning out in the near
future as opposed to maybe just kind of
not really knowing what to look for so
and plus you can watch a whole chunk
like for example my laying the
foundation series if you want to know a
lot about how to use foundation you
could just sit and watch them all and
see what you like this so for this
series for beginners i want to start out
with some of the best eyeshadow that I
think works well for beginners and keep
in mind many of you and you ask me these
questions you say I want it to be easy
to where I want it to be cheap or
inexpensive not necessarily made cheap
but you know an inexpensive product and
you know I want to be readily available
not something that I have to search
through order or you know any number of
things so what I've got here is let's
see one two three four five I've got
like six different
eyeshadow palette so we're focusing on
some good beginners I shadow palace if
you're building up your collection two
or three of these I mean I'm not gonna
have to get home all of these you can
see what colors appeal to you and then
you can go from there and make your own
choice on what you might actually want
to purchase but just thought this might
be of use to some of you so first one
I'd like to mention that I think is a
great eye shadow palette is from
covergirl and allow me to open this up
here this has got this is a loved
palette I tell you it's gotten a lot of
use the color is on this palette is
golden sunset and it's a three kit from
I enhancers from covergirl and what you
get is you're gonna have to go a lot on
my description here because I don't feel
like you're getting a lot of accurate
color here but this is a golden e brown
tone kit and this color in the middle
you can see that's been pretty popular
for me that is the color that I use
actually as my highlight color every
single day because it's got a little bit
of a bronzy tone to it and if you've got
use bronzer on your skin and then you
use that color of their ties the whole
look together as opposed to using a
really light white highlight just
doesn't look natural so anyway but all
these colors are good you get a nice
golden e yellow light shade and then
you've got that nice coppery bronze and
then a good medium brown and all these
shades have a little bit of shimmer to
them and that definitely makes it easier
for um blending I think I think shimmers
are much more forgiving as far as
blending goes and if you're just
starting out that's definitely you want
something easy to apply so that is the
cover girl I enhancers in golden sunset
this is in stores I mean I know a lot of
these sometimes these these little
palettes get discontinued and whatnot by
happen to know this one is still in
stores have gone through so many
especially going through that middle
shade so anyway I'm off to get through
these kind of quickly so forgive me if
I'm going
too fast but the next one is from wet
and wild and it's the wet and wild mega
eyes in what is the color that is the
question oh dang I'm not sure if this
has the color on it but oh well we're
going to talk about it anyway I'm going
to be pretty specific when I talk about
these shades this is one look to this
middle shade if you're out shopping that
middle shade is like a deep maroon okay
and it's got a little bit of Sheen to it
I wouldn't call it shimmer i'd say maybe
has a slight pearl finish and then you
got a taupe shade which i like to think
of as not really brown but with tones of
gold and beige and then up top you've
got a pearly light pink shade which is
actually somewhat matt i would say that
shade is but the key here is this dark
maroon shade in the in the center that's
a very flattering shade on eyes and I
didn't realize that up until I don't
know maybe year or so ago couple years
ago was when I really realized tape that
looks good and it looks good on almost
anybody and its lips it's a deep
burgundy tone and there's something
about it that really warms you up it
warms up the eye area I don't care what
color of eyes that you have when you use
that as opposed to using gray or using
you know just to deep matte brown
something about that really warms up the
face when you use these colors so gosh i
wish i could tell you what what kit this
is there is not a number or a color on
here to be found so this is that
frustration but these wet and wild trios
do have these neat little mirrors nice
size mirrors that pull out but yeah just
look for these shades it's got kind of a
monush a taupe and a light pink moving
on let's say we want to make it really
easy and we want to go to shades because
you can do it and i look in two shades
no problem
and one of my favorites for this and I
use this in my quick and easy I tutorial
I think it was it's from Jane it's the
be pure mineral eyeshadow in red rocks
now disregard that name if you feel
misled by because there's nothing Red
really about this what you got is a
light kind of a dirty champagne shade I
would say it's like not quite as
outwardly shimmery as a lot of champagne
shades are it's got a little more beige
to it and then the shade right next to
it is kind of tough to explain think
medium brown with a little bit of plum
mixed in it's fun that shade is sort of
it's mostly Matt I would say and it
makes a great great contour shade
because it's so easy to use because look
it's not all that dark it's really not
but yet you still can contour with it in
fact I think I have I'm pretty sure I'm
so I can't even remember quite what I
used on my face today but I am pretty
sure i did use that shadow as my contour
shade today and you can see you're
getting them color with that but it's
not hard to use because it's not so so
dark so think about that one that's jane
be pure mineral shadow in red rocks i
got a few more to get through next i
think i just recommended this to someone
who had asked me it's the Maybelline
quads and if you look closely let me
open this up this particular quad which
I think they're making them all this way
if you can see they have little words on
each of the pans one says lid crease
brow bone and outer corner now can we
get more you know but that's really easy
when they lay it out there for you like
that and another thing I like about the
way Maybelline is doing these pallets is
not all the shades are shimmery not all
the shapes that are Matt and this crease
this shade right here that's pretty
shimmery but then you've got your lid
shade that is Matt its outer corner
shade is Matt and this brow bone is a
say pearly not quite so shimmery but
more of a pearl shade great palette just
for straight-up Browns I think this is
really good easy to use this one is
number 22 um chai latte no it's number
22 in the Maybelline expert wear
eyeshadow next oh gosh I gotta hurry
this one from Revlon is number 14 nude
elements just um good shades of taupe
medium brown shades and what not a nice
little champagne shade and one shade in
the bottom that is actually a medium
smoky blue shade and then if you're
feeling advanced if you want to work
with smokey eyes in your beginner get
the Jane izing mix-and-match palette in
city tones you've got black wonderful
black shade some a light pink blue
silver white it's six colors and it's
great great for smokey eye so I hope you
guys enjoyed this I hope it could be of
help to you and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
