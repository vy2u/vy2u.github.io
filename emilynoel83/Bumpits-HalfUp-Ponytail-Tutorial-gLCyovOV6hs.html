that's tutorial this one is going to
show you sort of two styles in one I'm
going to show you how you can do a neat
half-up half-down look and then I'll
show you how you can kind of convert
that into a ponytail the other look that
I've already done is just using a
headband I thought that was one of the
easiest looks you can do with it and
this is pretty easy too so I'm just keep
watching and let's see how you can
recreate this yourself I know a lot of
people have told me I'm going to go out
there and try the bump it's and I just
think it's a really easy tool to get a
totally different style than maybe
you've ever tried to do before with this
extra height and volume in your hair so
but just be aware it does take some
getting used to and some practice they
do stay in wonderfully well you can
shake your head around and the part of
the key to that is the little teeth that
are in here they look like little bitty
arrows is what they look like
um and it's those teeth you kind of have
to wiggle it into your hair definitely
use some hairspray and it will work
really well for you so just I mean I'm
talking this is from the point of view
from someone who has really has slippery
fine hair so I can definitely make these
work for me and I think you can make
them work for you too but um let's go
ahead and get started what I'm going to
do is sort of think about leaving some
bangs forward for this looks clear it's
sort of some long side bangs here and
then I want to also want to take the the
back section and sort of just start
pulling that all back the section that
sort of is where I want that height to
be when I pull my hair half back okay
so you can just use your fingers or use
a comb or brush and just kind of make
sure um you're getting a section that's
somewhat wide as far as from here to
here but but not too thick in terms of
going back on your head so you want to
kind of thin but wide okay so what I
would do next then is this is what I
like to do that means the idea here
using a bump it is that you don't have
to backcomb or tease your hair a lot but
I find that doing a little bit of that
will honestly um kind of help your hair
grip to the bump but even more so I'm
just kind of holding it straight up and
I'm taking my comb and kind of going
like this right on the back of the hair
okay and then I'm just going to place
the bump it right behind that here that
I pulled back and I put it there
and I'm also wiggling the bump kind of
back and forth like that that motion
really secures it into your hair okay so
following that step I'm just going to
let my hair fall right over the bump
that I put in and I'm using the classic
bump it by the way if you want more
information on what comes in the set I
would suggest looking at my first video
or checking out my blog or add some
pictures so and I also have some links
to more information in those places as
well here I'm taking my little hair pin
um this is something if you don't have
it it's extremely cheap available at
Sally's and you can kind of deal with
hair that you've teased without undoing
the teasing if you know what I mean
you're like smoothing it out but yet
you're not getting rid of it
okay so from here I'm going to kind of
take my thumbs and just kind of put them
by the side of my face and just pull
them back and take whatever here that
comes with that motion and I'm going to
pin that hair right in the center of the
back of my head okay so I'm just taking
my you know I'm literally right in the
middle of the back of my head and I'm
going to take my two bobby pins and
hopefully when I turn around
still be able to see this but I'm going
to quit cross my bobby pins right in the
back of my head here
just like so and if you don't like
dealing with bobby pins sometimes just a
little like plastic hair clip like this
only smaller can be easy to use if you
don't like criss crossing your clips or
whatever but after you do that just kind
of look around and you can sort of mess
with the shape of this look right after
you you know go ahead and pull it back
you can mess with your bangs however you
want to you can go ahead and look at the
bottom part of your hair and curl that
more down in here but one thing I
definitely don't want to forget to do
after I pull that hair back is to
definitely spray it because that is
really going to help that shape stay
with you but the nice thing about this
is is you have that support system sort
of that's what the bump it is if that
support and your your hair that is going
to keep this from falling and that's a
concern that a lot of people have so I'm
just kind of looking in my mirror here
I'm able to look in my mirror which is
behind this camera and see that that is
the shape that I want in the back you
know I can always go back and mess
around with the way that looks but
hopefully um I feel like I'm looking at
you in the camera in there but hopefully
here you can see that you know there's
really no tricks to this it turns out to
be nice and smooth even though I back
combed that just a little bit I still
feel like I'm getting that smooth shiny
look that can be hard to achieve when
you have done some teasing your hair
because really really didn't tease it a
lot
excuse me so I'm just going to touch up
any little places that I want smoothed
out just as easy to do that with um some
hairspray I'm going to grab a little
hair thing here and basically if you
want to take this and make this into a
ponytail you might think well I've got
this will kind of fluffy piece out here
that was pulled back it won't be a
problem
um just sort of put your hands on those
bobby pins so they don't shift and just
brush through that look a little bit so
even though that might be curling or
poking up a little bit just kind of
smooth
with the rest of the hair and then you
could secure that with an elastic band
right here like at your neck or you
could do a nice little side ponytail by
going right behind your ear
this was the look I did in a video not
too long ago I was sitting on my couch
today I'm trying to remember what video
that was what I was talking about it but
anyway I've done this and mentioned that
I used the Muppet and you guys like that
look so that's basically a recreation of
that it's not too dramatic really when
you look at it I mean you've got that
nice height to your hair I mean it's a
cute look I think would be so cute it's
like a dressy look you know yes but yet
if imagine having a bad hair day but you
want a really cute and dressy style I
think this is perfect because you got
pulled back and up
you spray it and you're good to go
and you can totally wrap that little
hair tie that you put on there with your
own hair I have a video on how to do
that too but it really is there's two
easy looks that you can do with this go
ahead and you know curl your ponytail a
little more if you want to but it's
really just that easy and that thing is
secure in my hair I mean I could shake
my hair my head all around it's not
going anywhere I will flip my head
upside down and flip it back I mean the
bump it is in there guys it's there I
mean look at the style after I did all
that it's still the same oops
just hit my knees in but yeah totally so
it it's really really easy and it is
secure and you might be thinking well
that's just staying in there cuz you
bobby pin your hair behind it well I Got
News for you it stayed in when I did the
headband video too so I'm trying to work
on a way that I can create some kind of
montage of me doing all kinds of crazy
things just to show you that the bump it
will stay in and different style so I
just keep an eye out for that in the
future but thank you guys so much for
watching and thank you so so much for
