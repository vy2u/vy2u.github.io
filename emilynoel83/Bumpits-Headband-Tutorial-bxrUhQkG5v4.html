having a good day so far
and this is going to be sort of an
introduction video / a tutorial on one
way you can use the focus there by big
happy errand hats called bumpass and
it's basically a way that you can get
that poof in your hair whether it's the
poof right in the front or you want that
hype in the back it's an easy way to do
that there are a lot of different ways
that you can wear it and get you can see
they look like kind of the girl has
their with that volume in the crown I'll
pull out the little instruction but
there are a lot of ways you can wear
this so this video is going to show you
one way you could wear it and then I'll
continue doing some different looks but
I just don't want to overload you guys
with information so I'm just going to go
you know little by little but hey nice
instructional thing that you can look at
and you can see kind of how they do it
sort of the looks that you can get and
then they go through step by step
showing you how you can do different
updos and and stuff like that I would
also suggest for more information on
this just you can go to Sally beauties
channel I believe on YouTube here has a
link to that this is a Sally Beauty card
you can get through Sally's you can get
it on their website for just under $20
they have different shades like brunette
blonde whatever and I believe that there
may be some I'm not sure you'll have to
check and see if they're still in stock
there some people may have this in stock
in their Sally beauty supply mind is not
but these are available online and yeah
basically it's a really good value
because you're getting in this box
you're getting let me show you okay
here's what you're getting you're
getting this one which is called one
rock star bump it this is for like the
most high
you can get out of it you get two of the
regular puppets and you get two of the
mini bumpass okay so those are all used
to create different looks you can
actually use more than one in your hair
at a time but I thought I would start
with because I'm kind of still learning
about this too I'm regularly playing
with these and trying different looks
but I thought I would start off by
showing you the look that was easiest
for me at first with these now these are
a hard product to use but you know it
just it takes some getting used to
so I just thought I'd show you the
easiest one first and then I'll keep
going through different looks
so you guys have some ideas if you have
one of these or if you just want to
learn more like I said maybe search for
videos about this on YouTube there are
some out there there's also of course
Sally Beauty calm I'll have a link to
that if you're interested in making a
purchase so anyway let's get started
this headband look is really really
simple what I'm doing first is of course
you could pull down some side bangs but
I'm just going to pull it all back
because I find that that is been a
little bit easier for me to do like if
you look at this girl in the front you
can totally wear your hair just down and
have one of these in your hair but you
have to worry about blending the hair
just a little bit more this is just you
just throw it on so I'm just gonna grab
a little skinny headband like this and
this is just how I do it this may not
work for everyone but um basically good
just so your hair is coming straight
back like that okay now I'm going to
just behind my headband so you see where
I've got that place and you could even
like bump a little bit of hair forward
right there
I'm gonna do is lift up a small section
here right at the top okay and I'll turn
sideways in a second and show you just
just how much hair I am pulling back but
I'm just lifting up a section of hair
right behind the head
okay show you what that amounts to it's
not much but I mean it kind of looks so
like a lot going this way but it's
really I still have a lot of herring
left on in the crown area I'm going to
take the regular-sized bum bit and what
I'm going to do is actually if I turn
around for you I'm going to place this
right behind the hair that I've pulled
up and I'm kind of like wiggling it in
there I'm not sure how well you can see
this but I'm just really trying to make
sure it gets in there where it needs to
be and just to give my hair a little bit
of added texture I'm going to just do a
little bit of teasing on it I'm just
gonna backcomb it just slightly here not
a lot not a lot of necessary the idea is
that you don't have to do that really
with this but my hair so fine I find it
can use the added texture so now I've
just taken that hair down over the top
of the bump it and I'm just sort of
arranging it here making sure that that
thing is completely covered up just like
so and a big key to this as you'll find
if you watch some of the videos is using
some hairspray and and just making sure
that as soon as you do this like I'm
still going to do some arranging with it
but this will help the hair sort of stay
in place over the bumper so I'm using by
the way my so gorgeous volumizing
hairspray this is also available at
Sally's it is so good it has really good
hold but it's also volumizing so I'm
just gonna swish around that and I'm
going to take my hair pin now this is
something that I haven't seen used in
the buffest videos but you know if
you're dealing with any sort of teased
hair do these little hair pins can be
really great available also at Sally's
very very cheap and it can just help
smooth out some of this hair to dealing
with so I like to use that just to like
I said just smooth the hair around help
me arrange it over the
but without undoing a lot of the volume
that I've generated okay and you just
like I said this pinkie saw it I did I
just blocked it down back over the
Muppet and it took very little work to
get there to get to that look don't you
show you from the side what it looks
like in the back I mean you would never
know if something was in there you would
just think oh that girl really does have
you were here you know like you just get
that volume and show you from the other
side no crazy tricks going on here it's
just you know just kind of throw it over
the thing and you're good and like I
said you can continue to play with it
you this is the medium one by the way
this is not the one that you can get
even more height out of this if you
wanted to but just you know don't forget
your hairspray spray it on there and
like you can see this didn't take me a
lot of time at all from here from this
style if you felt like doing a little
bit more you could like pull the hair
pull car to your hair back secure that
kind of like in the middle of the back
your head with a bobby pin and pull
around a ponytail if you wanted to or
just go from where it is and pull it you
know do a ponytail there and you would
still have that nice hike back there so
once again I think you will find if you
are starting out with the bumpit that
this is a really easy easy way to use it
these little ones are easy to I'll do
one on that a little bit later but
anyway just a great way to get some
instant results and have fun with the
above it so and by the way if you're
worried about it falling out don't be
this is secure in my hair like and I
have some of the most slippery fine hair
ever so it does help me to write it just
a bit to give it some texture to when I
put it over the top but I'm just really
pleased I think this would make a great
like resi look and like I said you can
do any number of styles from this point
but I think the headband is just super
cute so anyway let me know if you've
tried these what are your favorite
styles to do
I'll have more style coming up but yay
