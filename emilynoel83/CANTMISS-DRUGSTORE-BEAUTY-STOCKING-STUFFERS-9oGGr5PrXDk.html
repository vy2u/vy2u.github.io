here if you're tuning into this video
maybe you're just curious as to what
some good little drugstore makeup
products are for yourself or maybe
you're in desperation mode and you're
just looking for those little things to
round out a gift or throw in a stocking
or whatever I've got some things that
are well within the drugstore price
range that would work for anyone I truly
think they would be pleasing and
workable for anyone on your list they
don't require you to be a pro at
selecting someone's perfect shade they
don't require any like added craftiness
to make them look cute although you can
always throw your own special spin on
things I've done some stocking stuffer
videos in the past where I've really
gone through how to do some cute little
packaging ideas and whatnot but this
year I'm personally coming in tune with
desperation mode a little bit myself
here and I'm all about those things that
don't require a lot of extra work one of
those things that is so adorable the
little Real Techniques mini brushes that
they're doing I found mine at the end of
an aisle in Walmart and this is the
expert face brush the actual expert face
brush but they're just doing it in a
mini sized handle and they will even
point out on this cute little outer box
that it comes in whether it's a full
size brush head or not and this is the
full size brush head on a mini handle it
works great like this is an awesome
brush for blending out your foundations
cream liquid even powder foundations
could work nicely with this you could
dab over your concealer with it it's
just a little bit pinched in here at the
top it could make a great cream contour
brush if you wanted to but it's just a
short little guy and it's great I've
been using mine for weeks now zero
shedding when you're giving a Real
Techniques item I think you can kind of
trust that it's gonna be pretty darn
good quality so amazing softness like I
said they do have a couple of other
brush varieties that the expert face
brush is absolutely a can't-miss item
now while I'm on Real Techniques I want
to mention something that I had been
asked about sitting right back here in
my videos this little pink thing this is
a real techniques like silicone brush
holder and it's clinging to my mirror
you can go back and see that this has
been up here for weeks and any more than
maybe a couple months now it has not
come down at all I do use it I take
brushes in and out of it it works great
it can obviously be wiped down and
cleaned off very easily
techniques is also selling I think maybe
a divided like three cup one as well for
anyone who's trying to save a little bit
of countertop or desktop space
this guy just clinks right onto your
mirror and clearly does a very effective
job had it since it has not fallen down
one time or even come close so I think
that would be a nice little kind of
unusual maybe off the beaten path
stocking stuffer for the makeup lover
that you know here's another can't miss
item the NYX blending sponge which was
mentioned in the Emily Awards this is a
great little sponge even if you know
someone who is a die-hard Beauty Blender
fan just just throw this their direction
and see what happens because this is
combining as I've said before the best
of a couple of worlds you've got your
flat edge much like a real techniques
sponge but then you've got the rounded
bottom of the beauty blender it's super
duper soft you get it wet under the sink
you wring it out it will grow a little
bit it will be even softer and then you
can use it to bounce your foundation in
or a really great way to use this to put
your finger where the flat side is let
that curve just reach every little area
around the inner part of your eye it
works so nicely in that manner and you
like to use the flat side to blend
things out or to bake with I find it to
be just an awesome multi-purpose type
thing like you're gonna keep using it
and keep uncovering new ways that you
like to use it here's another old
diamond in the rough this uLTA Beauty
cooling aloe vera and refreshing gel I'm
s I remember raving on this months ago
bought quite a few of them and I
absolutely loved them they are a great
feeling at the end of a long day and you
want something after you've taken your
makeup off you just put these little
patches on and they feel so cooling so
rejuvenating sets calming aloe vera
hydrating hyaluronic acid and soothing
vitamin E they're not goopy or gooey or
anything there's just like these nice
little patches that you just put on
right here and once you take them off to
the sensation the cooling sensation that
you have here versus you know just the
rest of your face is so amazing it's
really great and I have tested I think I
told you guys I was gonna test some
different masks that ultime had some
different holiday ones honestly I was
kind of underwhelmed by a lot of them
that the refreshing gel eye mask the
cooling aloe vera definitely a great
item and
for men too I mean why not they just
feel fantastic oh and did I say you
leave him on for 30 minutes so it's it's
a nice little treatment finally I want
to shout out to a little bargain palette
and I don't know how you feel about
giving a real low-cost palette I think
you think about the people on your list
and think about those who you would brag
to about getting a really good deal on
something
does anybody have that person in their
life who really appreciates when you
saved a buttload of money on something
or like it was so cheap but it's so good
that's kind of what this next one is
about or maybe it's just like for your
own curiosity's sake you want to get it
and try it yourself but LA Colors has
been doing some good things with
eyeshadows months back I did the video
on the little duo's that were just
killing it like great quality drugstore
eyeshadow duo's well they've got a
couple little pallets out that are
called ice-truck smoky actually this
one's the ice-truck smoky and this is
the ice-truck naked they're available at
Walgreens for $8 they come all like box
stuff you know a little over package for
what they are like they didn't need to
come in a giant plastic tray but they do
but these are 12 color eyeshadow
palettes that are actually quite nice I
am wearing the ice-truck smokey today
he's got a couple of really nice
cranberry shades in here one that has a
bit more pink one that's a little more
rusty surprisingly amazing black for
like a palette like this you wouldn't
necessarily be expecting to pick up a
great black but that's in here some nice
bronzy metallics this brown up here this
kind of kamilly color it does have some
nice warmth to it and I feel like this
palette can kind of go a little bit warm
or cool depending on what mix of shades
you use it's in kind of a plasticy tray
here so it's you know it's not super
luxe but the shadows in here are creamy
and smooth and really really nice so I
like this one this one has a little more
shimmer in it in this one you're
basically getting six shimmers and six
mattes and then in the ice-truck naked
you're only getting four shimmery shades
in here you're getting this kind of
orange e like peaches and cream type
color which is kind of interesting a
cooler shimmer with this taupe down here
a nice warm kind of russet Brown
champagne a shimmery shade up here nice
pigmentation nice smoothness in these
colors just kind of surprising you know
your neighborhood Walgreens for eight
dollars if you hold out till after the
holidays it'll probably be marked down
to like 50 cents I have to
but I just wanted to share that because
I can definitely appreciate a drugstore
bargain you know that's one of the
greatest pleasures I take in the makeup
world is finding something really
low-cost that turned out to surprise me
and be that little diamond in the rough
so check these out LA Colors doing a
good job with their eyeshadows now my
colors just frankly done a good job with
a lot of things lately I'm thinking
about they're truly matte foundation I'm
thinking about that mineral pressed
powder those eye shadow do us as I
mentioned so yeah definitely worth
checking out so those my friends are
just some little last-minute stocking
stuffer type ideas drugstore price range
I'd love to hear your suggestions in the
comments section like what's that last
little thing that just puts the cherry
on top of a gift that you're giving or
what things would you like to find in
your stocking on Christmas Day there are
so many individual things that I
mentioned like in the Emily Awards throw
in an infallible Pro matte gloss throw
in and Besame lipsticks there are so
many little easy makeup e things you can
do for small gifts but a lot of them do
require some shade selection and if
you're not comfortable doing that for
someone else the things I mentioned here
I think are no-brainers and even these
eye palettes yeah they do have colors in
them but they're so basic and so easy
and happen to be really nice quality so
thank you guys for your time I hope
you're having a wonderful holiday season
so far
public service announcement here while
you're rushing around don't forget to be
careful on the road
take your time like keep your mind in
the game don't be looking at your phone

stairs when you've got 8 zillion things
on your mind go down your stairs
carefully because I'm the one who broke
my foot on Halloween night being in a
boot for a month was not pleasant but
I'm reminding myself of this as much as
everyone else like slow down enjoy what
you're doing and remember the reason why
