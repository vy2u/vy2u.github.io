to tell you I love it when video ideas
on my channel just come really naturally
like one just kind of rolls right into
the next idea and when I was doing my
video about long wearing makeup
essentials and I had mentioned using a
chanel powder with an elf brightest
process I refer to this as Chanel but a
lot of you enjoyed that idea I thought
you know that is just the tip of the
iceberg with low end or drugstore type
makeup brands that I love to pair with a
higher-end or more expensive item
sometimes high-end people will look at
certain brands like let's say benefit
and say oh that's not really a high-end
or luxury brand but for the purposes of
this video you know one of the items
that I talk about is going to clearly be
a drugstore price range and the other is
going to be more expensive so let's look
at it that way I don't know if I'm the
only one who feels this way but I really
get a kick out of seeing two products
work so well together and sometimes it's
like they need one another but they're
from drastically different price ranges
I just love when that happens and I know
many of you who watch my channel our
users of both you know drugstore and
high-end makeup so maybe you've got some
ideas of great product pairings that you
can share with me in the comments
section or maybe you have some of these
things in your stash and just haven't
thought to use them together yet so
first combo I want to mention pertains
to my concealer and some of you probably
could have predicted this one I'm
talking about benefit erase paste which
is my creamy peachy corrector for the
under eye area
and my Milani multitasker powder in
light/medium this is just a pairing that
has really really stood out to me as
being perfect for one another because
this concealer is so rich and creamy I
dab it on the under eye area and then I
use this light/medium multi tasker
powder which be warned you can go too
far with this you really want to use a
light hand and I'll use like my ELF
small tapered brush with it because I
feel like it just lays down just the
right amount of product and these two
things are the definition of different
kinds of products that I think need one
another this benefit here a space
it's great coverage and that medium tone
is just wonderful in terms of how peachy
it is but it is so amoliant it really
needs to be set with something and the
Milani multitasker powder can be a
little bit on the heavy side and I think
it performs best when its setting
something that is more on the
moisturizing side and just the wear is
better it looks less cakey less heavy so
these new products together I think are
great just going in order of like
application on the face I have to
mention in case you did miss my other
video the health and the Chanel product
that I put together it's the double
perfection Lumiere powder in 32 beige
rose this is kind of a newer product to
my collection I just decided hey I want
to try a really pricy powder and see if
it's that much better than a lot of the
drugstore powders that I use and this
powder is truly amazing it's so soft
it's got great coverage it looks really
flawless on the skin without feeling
super heavy and I think this brush from
ELF this complexion brush is perfect for
this and don't get me wrong this brush
is perfect for a lot of things like it's
just a very versatile size and shade I
see this often as a powder brush but
it's not one of those super full round
ones it's also very nicely tapered down
the side so when you set it in a product
like a powder and you kind of set it
down sideways it's picking up product
all the way down the side of the brush
and it's ideal for the way I like to
apply this powder because when I'm going
on top of an area that's already been
concealed I just dab it then over the
rest of the face it's more like a
sweeping motion
I haven't found myself really wanting to
buff in this powder in a circular motion
or really lay it on super heavy in that
way I just do kind of a light sweeping
over other areas of the face and that
for whatever reason gives me the most
flawless look if you are and makeups
knob out there you can totally get on
board with this powder but you're
thinning out there's no way I'm gonna
use an elf brush the elf complexion
brush is just fantastic it can be
highlight it can be bronzer it can even
be blush it's just that versatile for
the shape that it is next duo of
products that I love together is from
City color and Bobby Brown so
this is an awesome cheek duo so excited
to tell you guys about this because I
figured this out just a couple of weeks
ago that I love these two together and
the city color be matte blushes first
off fabulous pigmentation I first
discovered these at my local five below
store they had actually quite an
impressive stock of City color stuff
there are some very bright colors in the
line and then you've got some of these
understated little bit neutral shade
that just do the most unexpected pretty
things for your face and this is the
shade called papaya I pop this on with
my Milani blush brush and then just with
that same brush I go into my shimmer
brick from Bobbi Brown in the shade
nectar and I just dab it all throughout
the compact and then brush it on right
over where I've placed the B matte blush
and that combination I think is just so
so flattering I don't think the shimmer
brick goes over the top with the glowy
shimmer but it's just enough and I tell
you since I've had my shimmer brick and
nectar I've been layering it over so
many different things and there are a
lot of things that looks pretty with but
this has been my favorite pairing so far
next product duo is a fusion between
Maybelline and to face and this duo was
born from my shop my stash makeup dorm a
little top drawer where I put things
that are sometimes old sometimes new and
just things I want to make a point to
use and one of those items was this
little loose shadow that came with the
Too Faced Vegas nay Stardust palette and
it's called the glamour dust in nude
beam and it is just kind of a nude light
beige very shimmery loose powder shadow
and so I thought how can I best put that
to use and this Maybelline Color tattoo
from the leathers collection which was a
matte collection in creamy beige I just
hadn't used this product very much and I
knew that I just wanted that creamy base
for the loose shadow so the way I pull
this off is I used this little Real
Techniques shading brush I love those
synthetic brushes for cream shadows like
this and I use the color tattooed not
only all over the lid but up into the
crease as well I swear this is like the
easiest look ever just blend it out so
there aren't any
Edge's and once you get that on you can
take your glamour dust and nude beam and
I just like to use my finger and really
you want the feeling of pressing it onto
the lid and that way you don't notice a
lot of fallout you can do a little bit
at a time and kind of build it up but
this shade is so pretty and this is like
an effortless glamorous look is the way
I look at it so I'm a big fan of those
two together and hopefully that gives
you a little easy super simple idea of
how to use your glamour dust next we are
combining Milani with Charlotte Tilbury
and this is a lip combo that I
discovered during the pageant week when
I was judging and I kind of forgot to
mention this in with some long wearing
lip recommendations a couple videos ago
but these two products I do think are
just meant for each other they are the
perfect lip look if you want to splurge
or you already have splurged on the Bond
girl matte revolution lipstick from
Charlotte Tilbury it's a beautiful shade
I find it to be very neutral just a
little bit on the deep sights like a
deep dusty rose but if you spent your
money on that and you want a more
affordable lip liner that's just perfect
with it go for the Milani color
statement lip liner in spice and I mean
long before the next slide on liners
which I love so much one of my first lip
liner loves was this particular pencil
from Milani in spice and it's the
perfect deep neutral it looks great with
a lot of different nude lip looks just
making a nude lip a little more wearable
but part of why I love these two
together so much is just the totally
locked in staying power both of these
things on their own have pretty good
staying power but I swear it all goes up
a notch when you wear them together I
like a little bit of a balm or something
to moisturize my lips beforehand and
then go on with the color statement
lipliner and spice fill in the entire
lip area and then take your Bond girl
lipstick which I find to be just a
little more rosy than the lip liner the
to coordinate really nicely and just go
over the top of everything and it's like
you've got this pretty matte lip but
it's not too heavy it's not too dry it
definitely feels comfortable on your
lips but it lasts so darn long you
won't find yourself reaching for product
to keep touching out now the last thing
that I want to mention I'm so sad that I
don't have one of the items here because
I just repurchased like the order is on
its way it might even get here later
today but my huda beauty lashes in the
Samantha style I love those lashes I got
those lashes for Christmas I used them
very consistently and they lasted me all
the way through the end of April
so that was one set of lashes very high
quality stuff like a really it's a
beautiful style it's probably one of the
more natural styles offered in the
hooter beauty line but they are a twenty
dollar set of lashes and I do like
wearing them with my drugstore lash glue
the Revlon precision lash glue don't
think that just because you splurged on
a certain set of lashes that you need to
also have an expensive glue to wear with
them because this glue just with
anything I mean I've gotten some
conversations with people at the meetup
talking about false lashes and which
styles are best and you know which
products are best to use with them
whatever lash style you choose I think
it will make the process ten times
easier on yourself if you use it with
this lash glue and what makes it so
special as the wand applicator but also
the formula it doesn't take forever to
dry and when you use the wand applicator
you get just the right amount across the
lash band and then you don't have to
wait but you know maybe between 15 and
30 seconds before you actually set them
on your lash line so it's just a great
thing and I am excited to get my new
Samantha lashes in and you might be
wondering what happened to the old ones
like did they eventually just fall apart
and what happened was I was removing
some of the glue from the lash band and
I think I got a little bit overzealous
with that and I actually pulled off like
the little end segment of lashes that
was on there and so I thought all right
their time has come it's been it's been
a good like season with these lashes I
think I can you know stand to get a new
pair now thank you guys so so much for
watching this video something a little
different but I mean I am one who truly
loves using makeup from all price ranges
and I think it's so like status of eye
when you take that product that you
spent a lot of money on and you pair it
with something just dirt cheap and the
to work wonderfully together it just
goes to show you know you don't have to
just stick to one thing or the other if
you are into high-end makeup and you
love doing your full face of 100%
high-end makeup you know good for you
but just know that there are some
drugstore things floating around that
work really well too so thank you again
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
