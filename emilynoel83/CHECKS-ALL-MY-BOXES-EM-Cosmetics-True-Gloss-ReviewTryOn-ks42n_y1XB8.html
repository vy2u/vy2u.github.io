in this video we're gonna be chatting
about one of my favorite topics which is
lip gloss and you might be starting to
back away a little bit thinking but I
don't like lip gloss as much as you do
but I think you'll want the info we've
got a very interesting formula to talk
about today and it's from a brand that
has kind of been off the scene I feel
like for awhile but maybe is coming back
in and it's M cosmetics which is a brand
created by youtuber Michelle Phan which
I haven't really seen any videos from
her lately I don't know if I've just
missed them or maybe they haven't been
happening I don't think they've been
happening but anyway if you're newer to
the YouTube scene she built a monstrous
YouTube channel and she went off and
created her own brand which is M
cosmetics and when the brand launched I
don't know if you remember those pallets
that had like little circles and you
could take out the pans you could create
your own little like customized palette
and there were eyeliners and lipsticks
and just this full line and now it seems
all that's gone you go to the end
cosmetics website there are literally
three products there are two lip
products one seems to be maybe a matte
lip color like liquid lipstick and then
there's these new glosses there's also
an eye liner but the gloss seems to be
what's new at the moment these are
called true gloss I have all 12 shades
I'm going to be trying them all on for
you in this video so you can see all the
colors there are seventeen dollars a
piece so they're running you know along
the lines of a high-end brand and
they're called a volumizing lip gloss
gonna give you a little backstory in
case you haven't read it yourself they
say it's going to give unprecedented
moisture vibrant color long-lasting
shine zero stickiness and zero
discomfort and then they're talking
about the formula and they call it an
advanced gel base maintains the wet like
shine while adding moisture and
preventing te WL to trans epidermal
water loss are you still with me here
I'm still going a lip plumping peptide
complex stimulates collagen production
in your lips so it's sort of this
combination of a treatment type product
with really effective pigmented color
and I will say there's something very
interesting with this gloss that happens
when I put it on and it feels like as
you apply it you can't really tell you
know as you're putting the applicator
across your lips I feel like it's
something super thin
I would have thought this would have
been running all around my lips and just
being really hard to manage but then you
press your lips together and you
actually feel what it's like and I feel
that thickness and that gel but
absolutely no stickiness not sticky at
all not even a little bit sticky but
thick enough to hang on the lips for a
decently long time okay so that's a big
point in this products favor also the
wear down seems to be very even not
patchy not like clingy to certain parts
of the lips and then you know you've got
this huge like cut out here on the lower
lip where that's the only place product
is worn down no I feel like and I tested
this on that deep has shaded in the line
and it wore so while I ate barbecue I
talked a lot I was doing all kinds of
things and I thought I'm not gonna give
this any special treatment I'm gonna
basically pretend it's not there and
then see after a period of hours what it
did on my lips it did not find little
avenues to drift outside my lip line it
did not look really funky have some of
the shine worn down yes but did I have
still a beautiful amount of color and
even color on my lips absolutely and
they felt great so it's really a unique
formula I kind of feel like if I would
have gotten this line and just tried
them on and they felt like any standard
gloss maybe I would have you know no pun
intended glazed over them and just I
don't know maybe use them here there but
not really gotten into it but I'm really
into the formula even with some of the
best glosses that I have in my
collection that I love I'm still
skeptical of their bright colors
why because I feel like that's a risky
move to put a really bright glossy red
lip on you know and wear that and feel
like no this isn't gonna go anywhere or
this isn't gonna wear down in a weird
way or when every time I press my lips
together am I gonna end up with some
kind of mess happening there and here I
feel like I can wear I can pull off a
deep or bright shade on my lips in a
glossy formula and it's gonna wear a
decently long time and it's going to
wear very evenly and I will still have a
lot of color left over even after some
of the shine goes but I'm gonna be
honest with you the shine hangs on
pretty dang well I don't know the vibe
I'm getting from this line now is that
instead of
like a zillion products at once I'm
doing the sense that Michelle and and
whatever team of people she's working
with seemed to be really taking their
time here and now I'm intrigued I want
to try that other lip color that they
have I think it's called lip cloud oh
the infinite lip clouds and also they
have illustrative eyeliners like I'm
interested now they've got me listening
because judging by the lip gloss I feel
like they're taking a lot of care with
the formula and actually putting out
something really good and some fantastic
colors as well I've split them up as I
do this try on you'll see I like to kind
of sort things out when I do a lip color
Tryon kind of go light to dark group
things together in a way that makes
sense for me to tell you about them so
I've got six shades that I've called the
lighter group and six shades that I'm
gonna call the rich group they're not
exactly like really deep shades but
they're just rich bolder colors oh one
more thing though before I get to the
Tryon I want to talk about scent a
little bit the scent is really really
soft and it's very unlike anything I've
smelled in a lip color before they're
not trying to be vanilla they're not
trying to be candy or anything really
fruity it's a really light like you've
got to be looking for its scent that's a
little sweet and it maybe almost makes
me think a little bit nutty or just like
the drop of like a little coffee scent
but I don't I don't really want to
commit to that I wore myself out on that
scented products video I tell you but
this is you've got to be looking for it
I don't think it would irritate or annoy
anybody we're gonna start off with this
color called truffle haze the website
describes this as a sheer gray nude and
it is definitely a cooler nude and I
don't love it like these first couple of
shades are probably my least favorites
of the whole bunch and I know some
people may love a nude that's you know
not real peachy and just has this real
like beige equality to it for me I'm
just like there's so much better in the
line to me there's so much more that I'm
excited about I don't absolutely hate
the shade but it's not a favorite for me
now shade number two here is the caramel
glaze and this really is like a melted
down Kraft caramel I think that's all it
is they just melted down a caramel and
put it in a tube this is deeper than the
first shade this is warmer than the
first shade it's kind of like applying a
real
tan-colored bronzer all over your lips
it's that kind of a tone again I'm not
in love with either of these first two
shades I just feel like they're not the
highlights of the group next up we've
got kind of a unique shade in ash rose
and this color is a really interesting
cool kind of Mavi pink I do like this
color I've described this type of shade
before as like winter pink it's very
cool it's kind of a little icy feeling
to me I don't know I think that's a
unique shade and kind of a fun shade to
have in the group I think some people
would really enjoy that next up secret
blush one of my favorites
here's your peachy pink kind of nudie
shade one of the most wearable of the
bunch like the first one that I threw on
when I got this whole set and I'm like
let's just try this out and see how this
goes it was this one you know just that
easy soft peachy pink it doesn't look
too light on my skin I think it does
good things for the look of my face as a
whole so that's a good one now if you
want it to be less peachy pink and more
just peachy you'll go for Magic Hour
which is the next shade this I feel like
is a very pure peachy color it's pretty
if deeper corals aren't really your
thing and you like to keep it sort of
light you might look into that shade
again that's called Magic Hour and then
the last one in the lineup that I'm
referring to is the lighter shades is
Aurora pink and this is one of my
favorites overall it's just a perfect
fresh pink on the lips it makes me happy
when I see it on my lips I just like oh
you know it's a very youthful color I
think it gives a lot of life to the face
it's not too bubblegummy it's not too
light there's just the right amount of
depth in that pink for me to really
enjoy it so that's Aurora pink now we're
gonna move into six shades that are very
very bold and one of them I've been
wearing throughout the video that's this
one called Moroccan sunset I love
Moroccan sunset I'm gonna call this in
two words
toasted coral it is coral just bumped up
a notch just burnt a little bit mmm I
love it there's a really pretty richness
to it but at the same time I don't feel
like I put anything insanely dark or
insanely bright on my lips it's just
really really beautiful I love it paired
with this kind of eye look that I've
gone on today you know with the little
bit of rust and orange there it looks so
nice it's a really nice complement to
that now red Jasper very very close to
Rock and sunset like these shades are
the closest to in the whole bunch I
would say red jasper actually seems to
just have a little more depth to it
maybe just a hint more Brown in this
shade actually I like them both I could
kind of go either way on them they're
that close if I sort of feel like
Moroccan sunset is just a bit more
vibrant then we're gonna stay with this
orange II thing here and we're gonna go
to Blood Moon and Blood Moon is real
just your most straight-up
orange of the bunch there's definitely
some red in this shade too but it's very
very like toward the orange end if you
see it in a lineup with the other two
you will definitely identify this is the
most orange shade some people are gonna
love that some people may not but I'm
just laying it all out here for you and
then we have lotus blossom and this is
going to be a lot more pink but kind of
a warm pink it reminds me a little bit
of like the Bekaa Snapdragon shade in
that line and if you look at this
compared to the Aurora pink shade that I
mentioned Aurora pink comes across as
much cooler and then lotus blossom has a
lot more warmth to it but still
definitely identifiably different from
all of those orangie colors I really
like that one and I'm honestly falling
in love with all of the rich shades I
think they're so good but scarlet Knight
here we go here's your red kind of a red
with a lot of pink in it it comes across
as sort of a cross between a pure red
with a little magenta mixed in so cooler
than all those reddish corals we've been
through and I think it's beautiful and
it is a shade I feel safe and wearing in
this formula on my lips these have not
faded outside my lip line one bit and
then the darkest shade is Ruby wine and
this is just your nice rich berry it is
without a doubt the darkest shade in the
lineup
I feel like this leaves a beautiful even
pretty stain on the lips even after
you've lost some of the shine I would
easily wear this kind of shade in the
summer because I love the look of tan or
at least bronzed up skin and then a
berry lip I think looks gorgeous but
also on fair skin and in the winter time
like it's just a great color to have on
hand and to finally have in a gloss
format that I can trust so I like that a
lot so this is the full spectrum of
shades as you can
see we had art kind of nudie neutral
shades up top we moved into some pinky
colors a little bit of peach and then
this bottom row all of the bold really
bright shades you can see how close that
that Moroccan sunset and red jasper are
but red jasper just seems to have a bit
more brown in it your bright orange ii
shade going into lotus blossom which is
a warmer pink than Aurora pink but
definitely not as warm as all the
oranges there's scarlet night and then
ruby wine is your last color so yes
these give off plenty of shine but one
of the most fascinating things about
these to me is with the formula you're
applying it and you're just feeling
applicator to your lips you know and
you're feeling the product go on and
you're thinking gosh this feels really
thin like is this gonna end up actually
feeling slippery but then you press your
lips together and you kind of start to
understand that gel based formula that
they're talking about because it feels
so nice and thick but absolutely like no
stickiness no stickiness if I could
create a lip gloss like this would be
what I would try to shoot for you know
and it does make your lips feel good
even after having worn it and there are
a couple of things that are a little
questionable here it says our formula
subtly plumps the lips which I can't
feel it plumping I think they look
plumper because it's a glossy formula
with a little thickness to it that
absolutely you know eradicate Saul look
of lines so it makes the surface of my
lips look smoother and therefore plumper
so I guess I can get on board with that
I don't know that it's making my lips
plumper but it goes on to say has a
luminous finish and stays vibrant
throughout the day I'm not getting like
all-day wear out of this stuff like when
I wore a softer shade the other day like
Aurora pink did it stay shiny and
present on my lips longer than the
average gloss yes but it's not any kind
of like all day wear phenomenon here
like it's still just a lip gloss people
like after going through lunchtime the
lighter shades that you wear will look
considerably worn down writer shades
however the last six those are going to
be the ones most likely to leave that
sort of stain of color on the lips a
pretty like level of color even though
the shine goes away but your
I'm gonna notice that as much with the
lighter tones in the collection you're
not gonna have one application feel like
yes this is nice throughout the entire
day no you'll probably want a
reapplication after about midday and if
you want all the shades to look their
freshest even the brighter ones you know
and you want that glossy look again
there's gonna need to be some kind of
reapplication happening I don't like to
talk too heavily about staying power on
lip products and give a lot of like
benchmark times because it really
doesn't matter because I'm gonna be
doing different things in my day then
you're gonna be doing and it's really
hard to like pin something down and give
guarantees but I can tell you that the
brighter colors leave more color behind
on your lips than the lighter ones do
and yeah overall I dig these I think
this was a really like well executed lip
gloss formula for me to be able to have
fun wearing a bright shade in this
formula and not feel like now it's gonna
drift outside my lips oh here's another
thing here's another thing I meant to
mention when you like pressure lips
together and you really like mush em I'm
not saying like lightly mama but mush em
okay like
mmm they don't leave any sort of like
Rin you know like this is the thing I
worry about with bright colors and
glossy formats on the lips like you
press them together or even nudes for
that matter anytime your lips come in
contact with one another you end up with
like this rim inside your lips where it
where glosses mushed out a little bit
will not happen with these will not
happen and one of my favorite ways and I
kind of learned it as I went through
rapid-fire like applying one after
another after another you don't have to
watch yourself back closely with these
but just a suggestion for what works
well like apply a full-on amount to your
lower lip give it a quick like blot to
the upper lip and just use the
applicator to kind of smooth it out and
get all to the outer edges of that upper
lip and then boom you're done and you
didn't really need to go back for any
more I feel like that's an appropriate
level of product and you just don't
really need anymore these don't really
need building up to achieve a certain
color you just kind of get what you get
and the applicator by the way another
thing I should have mentioned earlier
but maybe you noticed in the demos it's
a doe foot that's not really super big
it's kind of like a standard doe foot
size but it is pointed and you can
really control like where that product
is going as you're going around your
Cupid's bow and stuff so I appreciate
that but props to Michelle and the em
cosmetics team I think this was a really
really nicely done lip gloss for Matt
I'm pretty sure this is only being sold
on the em cosmetics website but if there
are any other retailers that are picking
it up I will add them to the description
box below but thank you guys so much for
your time today I'd love to hear your
feedback if you've tried these also
because I think they're a really special
lipgloss formula so thanks for your time
and I'll see you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
