joining me this is a really fantastic
video idea from my friend David and I
believe he first brought this up way
back during probably late fall last year
when I was doing all of my holiday
palate reviews and gift sets and
everything and he was like you know when
July rolls around and everybody's
forgotten about all these ballots you
should bring back at Christmas in July
type thing you know how stores always
had Christmas in July sale so I'm like
yes I have totally got to file that idea
away and then I think maybe on July 1st
he texted me he's like don't forget
about Christmas in July he is just the
best I'm like yes I'm honest so here's
what I want to do this is the way I want
to approach this I'm going to do five
looks in one video I'm going to over the
course of five days pull in a different
holiday palette type thing and do a look
with it and it's mainly going to be eyes
because these are like bigger eye
palettes like stuff I recommended back
during the holidays I'm on bring it back
so if you've still got this stuff we
could do some relevant tutorials for you
or maybe if you don't have these things
you might have something similar in your
collection and you can just kind of get
re-inspired maybe not that I do the most
complicated or always super flashy eye
looks I don't know we'll see what
happens this week but I try to make
things realistically wearable I'm just
the kind of looks I like to do and I
just love the idea of getting some of
this holiday stuff back out and please
tell me in the comments section if you
honestly to this day are still using
some of the holiday palettes you bought
because there's no reason why not to I'm
looking at a small stack of pallets here
that I love that came out during the
holidays but we just get so inundated by
all the new stuff that's piling it on
top of it like who has a chance who has
time to go back to the old well this
week we're doing it so now we're going
to move into look number one and it's
using the Kat Von D metal matte palette
one of my top i shadow recommendations
for holiday time I hope you enjoy first
thing I did for this look I applied some
Milani eyeshadow primer all over my lid
and then I use the color suede from the
matte line in my crease just to build up
a little natural color here because
we're going to be layering on
other more interesting shades I also
went just above that shade with fringe
and that's the peachy matte color and
then I'm putting this nice matte cream
color called bone right up under the
brow it gives such a clean look there
and something I really like about this
palette is this range right here - a
yellow - peach - purple type idea so I
use feather with a flat brush and
applied it on the inner third of my lid
very easy just Pat it on and then I went
on with fringe again the peach color
right on the center of the lid and then
I'm going to take a mix of silk and
ribbon and Pat that on the outer part of
my lid keeping it nice and soft this
doesn't need to be a super intense look
here I'm going to wedge my brush into my
crease also and then to further define
my crease I'm bringing in a small brush
again with the combination of ribbon and
silk the two purpley shades in this
palette I'm going to buff that into my
outer corner and then I'm going to go
into ribbon with a smudge brush and use
that just a little on the outer part of
my lower lash line and they'll continue
inward with silk and I'm going to take
my wet and wild under brow highlighter
pencil and use that in my lower inner
rim I'm just going to curl the lashes
and apply a couple of coats of my
L'Oreal lash paradise mascara using that
on the top lashes and then some
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on the lowers because I just love the
way that wears on my lower lashes I love
the end result with this look because
we've taken a palette that came out
during the holidays and I remember
originally doing some kind of intense
looks with this palette because you know
there are a lot of div advised shades
but now that we're doing this sort of
summery look yes I did stay with all the
mess no real reason why the shimmery
shades are great as well but I really
like this range of colors right here and
it makes for a very soft very pretty
look one more thing I did with the
shadow I didn't want to lose fringe on
the lid I'm gonna just start blending
blending blending and you lose some
color so I tapped fringe on the center
of my eyelid with my finger and doing so
brings that shade back to life a little
bit so I love this look I've done this
exact look twice because I shot this
when I still had my old camera and I
thought it's not going to make sense to
like start this series with my old
camera and then by the end have my new
camera
I don't know and I'll let you know also
I hope I remember to do this with every
look what's on my cheeks
with I use my two-faced Papa don't peach
blush on the cheeks just again play into
that peachy color that's coming off of
the eyes and on my lips is my Revlon
Ultra HD Mac in the shade seduction
which I would describe is kind of a
dirty dusty peach you got any dirty
dusty peaches on your countertop right
now get rid of them but yeah I really
like this shade alongside this aisle oh
girl on a soft kind of peachy pink
cardigan and you're all set now for day
two we're using the Kylie cosmetics
holiday palette from 2016 this palette
was barely used by me they started out
by priming my lids with Milani eyeshadow
primer and I used the color called
chestnut in my crease this is kind of a
pinky beige color and I thought it was
just a good starting point then I went
into the burgundy shade and use that to
deepen up the outer part of my crease as
well there's a nice matte cream color in
this palette and I use that as a
highlight under my brows there's a
really like deep dusty dirty bronze
color I applied that on the center of my
lids and then I've used the matte like
black plum color and I patted that on
the outer part of my lids and also kind
of worked that up into my crease as well
as that color sheers out you can kind of
see a little more plum out of it and
then for a little bit of a pop I went
for the silver color and I use that on
the inner most part of my lid kind of
close to the tear duct area and for my
lower lash line I decided I wanted a pop
of blue so I used my makeup forever and
22 liner on my inner rim it's a nice
true royal blue I also smudge that on my
actual lower lash line itself and then I
use the shimmery navy from the palette
to kind of top that off and further
smudge out the look and make it seem a
little more smoky then I did mascara on
my upper lashes with the total tease
mascara from covergirl on the lower
lashes I use my cobalt blue voluminous
because I thought it would just further
reinforce the blue that I had going on
there I used some lashes on my upper
lash line that are very similar to the
red cherry number 43 a little bit flared
out on the outside my cheeks I've got
kind of a rosy bronze thing going on
here so for that I use my pink leopard
from Too Faced I really love this stuff
I've used this for years and really
liked the effect it has a little bit of
glow to it a little bit of interesting
depths just a really pretty shade that
seems to complement any look that I do
and then on
my lips I use this infallible paints
metallic from l'oréal and this is in
the shade moon lust so that's giving a
ton of glow to the lips and then I use
my NYX mahogany lip liner which is kind
of a deep neutral around the outside
just gives the lips a little more
dimension there but thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this look and I will see you for look
number three what's up everybody its day
three and we are working with this
palette from Tarte this was definitely
my favorite holiday palette that Tarte
put out this past year and then I went
straight into the green in this palette
called landscape and just with a flat
brush I patted that on pretty much the
outer two-thirds of my lid and then I
took an e25 brush without any color on
it but just to kind of move that shade
around a little bit then I took the
shade called ROYGBIV and that one has a
little bit of a golden Fleck but overall
it's more of just a warm kind of rosy
Brown I use that with my e25 just on the
border of my green in the crease then I
took a bear brush just blended around
the edge as that and I decided to use on
display.this met very very light pink as
my highlight and then I thought a fun
shade to put side by side with that
green would be abstract and this is a
very shimmery like light rose color and
so I applied that on the inner part of
my lid in on my lower inner rim I use my
wet and wild brow highlight just to give
me some added brightness there and then
I brought in a forest green liner this
is from ELF it's the lock-on gel liner I
use that just on the outsides of the
lower lash line and then smudged it out
and then I went in with landscape once
more with my e21 brush and just blended
that over the top of that liner and I
curled my upper lashes I use L'Oreal
lash paradise on the upper lashes and my
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on the lower lashes and the finished
look I think is kind of natural ish on
the eyes but it's a fun combination of a
couple of shades I don't often wear
together with the really deep murky
green and then that pretty shimmery
light pink and then on my cheeks
actually in the little pull out drawer
that's part of this palette I'm using
all of these shades so I've got this on
it's kind of a bronzer all over my skin
I got this as my blush and then this is
the highlight which is going
nice bit of glow there and I was really
on the verge of going very nude and soft
and sweet and innocent on the lips but
something told me just go dark today so
I grabbed this a retro matte liquid lip
color from Mac and the shade is called
topped with brandy it's got a rich
raisin e-type color I really like it and
so that is the finished look with this
palette there are definitely a lot of
different looks you can do with this
this is probably one of the most
versatile palettes color wise that I've
seen Tarte put out because you've got
all these different directions from warm
to green to berry and plum so I really
thought that was a nice palette that
they put out for the holidays I was stay
tuned I've got another look coming for
day 4 okay guys the day for palette is
the Too Faced Christmas in New York Mary
macaroons vanilla scented palette this
was one of my favorites from this past
holiday season that Too Faced put out
you know the drill we start out with
Milani eyeshadow primer and then I used
the warm Brown called tiramisu in my
crease I just used it all over the
crease area just to get a little warm
brown color going there coconut is a
matte cream color and I use that up
under my crease as a highlight i also
use champagne rose for just a little bit
of shimmer up there on the brow bone and
then with a flat brush i've used coconut
on the inner part of my lid I know this
is seeming like the most basic matte
look ever and it kind of is for the
first part of it then I went in with the
dark brown called almond mocha and I use
the same brush and I just patted that
all over the outer part of my lid and
wedge that into my crease just a little
bit now things are going to get super
fun I'm using a purple liner this is the
L'Oreal Phil kissimmee and pure purple
and going about halfway out on my upper
lash line I'm drawing a winged out here
and we're going to be layering on some
other liner in a second but winged this
out approximately where you'd normally
like your wings to be and then carry it
on the lower lash line as well all
across your natural lower lash line and
on the lower inner rim next to the
gorgeous purple shimmery purple in this
palette I'm going to take that and layer
it with an angled brush on top of
basically everywhere you put the pencil
liner so that's going to make for a
pretty purple pop coming off of the
upper lash line and then covering the
entire lower lash line then I used a
black liner this is the Too Faced sketch
marker in black and I just
made a really fine line starting at my
innermost corner and then it kind of
starts to overlap with where you did
purple and then do a little wing within
a wing here and that's going to give us
a nice spot to place our false lashes
first though curl the lashes I use my
tweezer man lash curler which I love and
then I used voluminous lash dice on the
upper lashes and covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant on the lower lashes and
then these lashes that are a lot like my
red cherry number 43 and then the
finished look when you're looking down
you have this pretty just natural matte
look and then just this fun pop of
purple on the lower lash line I'm not
always like the loudest color wear on my
eyes but I think it's really fun to
sneak it in in the lower lash line like
this for my blush I'm wearing my
Maybelline fit me blush and this is in
the shade nude this is one of my
favorite shades and I think it works so
well on practically any look that you do
and then my Revlon Ultra HD in HD sand
is giving me this awesome
nude lip it's super comfortable I just
love this formula so much so thank you
guys for watching this look and my last
look is coming next
alrighty my friends is the fifth and
final look for my Christmas in July
series and we're using the lorac mega
pro 3 palette which came out right
around the holidays after priming my
lids with Milani eyeshadow primer I went
into the color called rust and yes it
does have shimmer but it's kind of
interesting to use colors like this in
your crease sometimes because they can
catch the light differently and actually
deepen up in a little different way too
when they're in your crease so I really
covered a broad surface area with that
and then I use this nice shimmery brown
called Sequoia and I padded that on the
outer part of my lid and worked that
into the outer part of my crease as well
and use some blending brushes just to
work those shades in together a bit more
and also buff out around the outsides
and I use the color called pink cream
which is matte as a highlight right up
under my brow to brighten things up on
the lid I went into the color called
Bellini and I pad that on the inner most
part of the lid and on my lower lash
line with a smudge brush I brought in
rust once again and just blended that in
a pretty wide swaths kind of all across
my lower lash line I decided I wanted
things a little bit darker in my outer
corner so I used the jet black color
just to bring a little more richness to
this look a lot of times I would
to brown and with these types of tones
but I thought the black made for kind of
an interesting twist
I used a dark brown pencil from Smashbox
called Sumatra this is one of their
always sharp liners I use that in my
lower waterline and also kind of work
that into the lower lash line as well in
between the lashes and then I curled my
lashes I applied voluminous lash
paradise on the upper lashes so skipping
regular you know liner across the upper
lash line I think that allows the
brightness on the lids to pop even more
and then I used covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant on my lower lash line so
a really nice warm Brown kind of rusty
look really pretty easy and this is a
gorgeous palette but just again one that
I have not been reaching for a whole lot
as for what's on my cheeks and lips I'm
wearing my Maybelline fit me blush in
wine and on my lips except the
infallible paints matte version and this
color is called festival so it's a nice
kind of I don't know dusty terracotta
another reason why I was really excited
to do this series was the fact that you
know right after the start of the year
Eve was born and that totally took my
world in a whole other direction so I
wasn't really just digging in and using
all of these great holiday pallets that
I had but thank you again so much to
David for coming up with this awesome
idea I think it's great I hope some of
you out there maybe had some of these
palettes or just some other holiday
palettes and this maybe made you think
okay why not grab one of those out and
get some use out of it thank you for
supporting creative unique video ideas
like this and I will see you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
