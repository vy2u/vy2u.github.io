me today yeah this just has to get done
and this is the time in my day that I
had to do it I slapped on my make up
real quick today so I might have the
time to finish this project and yeah I
just compiled such a mess on top of this
whole l-shaped desk that I set out to do
videos and do my makeup in the morning
it's like it's ridiculous on one hand I
do kind of know where everything is is
anybody else a messy person who's like
yeah but I know exactly what's under
those three levels of palettes right
there like there's that happening but on
the other hand I absolutely despise it
and I know I need to do something about
it but not to make any excuses about it
but no actually I'm gonna make some
excuses about it right now
when I get done shooting videos in the
morning normally that time frame that I
have butts right up to the girls waking
up in the morning so like I shoot as
long as I possibly can or i'm swatching
or I'm doing something pertaining to a
video like sucking every moment I have
out of my morning working time and then
I shut my lights off turn my camera off
put my battery on the charger and I am
done and what it usually leaves is kind
of a mess like sometimes I put a few
things away here and there but there's a
lot of just piling up and then on top of
that I find I'm getting PR stuff and
things to try like hand over fist all
the time here and I'm not complaining
about that it's a good problem to have
when you're doing what I'm doing and you
want to be trying a lot of things but if
you don't take the time to kind of
organize as that stuff comes in it can
just like bury you and so I decided I
would be vulnerable today I feel kind of
funny about it
but I'm gonna put my Brene brown pants
on and be vulnerable and it's not in a
real deep level this is just my mess
that I'm being vulnerable about today
but I'm gonna you know show you what's
going on and I'm gonna try to find some
method to get this cleaned up
oh but furthermore what's the solution
like the long-term solution to keep the
desk from getting this way again I would
say it would be to find at least some
point in the day like now that they're
kind of having coordinating nap times
like get up here and clean up that day's
mess which shouldn't be a long task but
if I can't get it done in the morning
hours just you know straighten it up a
little bit at some point later in the
day just to ensure that I can have a
fresh start for the next day you know
and not build mess on top of mist does
that make sense but I've got brushes
I've got lip stuff I've got new stuff
old stuff it's just it's a mess
okay I think I'm gonna get started with
this thought if it's a lip product it
belongs on the other side of the room in
my drawers so I'm just gonna grab a sip
lock bag and get everything going in
there and then I can you know move over
there and get it all organized because
as you know it's a little tough to get
around my broken foot situation i
strategize about everything these days
like how many trips is that gonna take
is it really worth it to stand down
right now here's an example of like what
I do sometimes when PR stuff comes in
like this was a bunch of Loreal like
matte lip colors and lip liners and
products there that's something stuck to
it but it's like when is it time to file
this away well I feel like I've kind of
gone through this stuff used it we'll
continue to use it and I want to get it
back into my storage so I'm gonna put
anything related back into this bag
anything L'Oreal and then when we move
from cleanup to organization mode I will
put that away over there how about empty
boxes just general trash you know I get
rid of that another really awesome PR
thing that I'm trying to work through
now are these NARS recision lip liners
just a bunch of lip pencils but it's
like every color of the rainbow nice
little compact container there I am
gonna keep this out in handy so I can be
going through those because it's a lot
to work through just for a closer look
here as you can see we've got brushes
and various things all kind of piling up
here brushes come over here this is my
main brush storage I brushes go there
and then even more recently I've been
using a lot of those tart brushes from
the holiday set and then putting just
like everyday quick use brushes in there
which I don't think it's totally
necessary to face and get minerals some
many sizes blush lipsticks lip balms
this is kind of like the divide and
conquer method of organizing you just
got to make it like a small task for
the baby wipes for SWAT removal it's one
of the only things that won't like give
me a rash on my hand this is my pouch
where I keep my memory cards and my
external hard drive because one time I
lost a memory card because I was just
kind of carrying it around loosely you
know to take it from upstairs to
downstairs where I edit and I realized
if I put it in something big I'm less
likely to lose it so I keep it in this
little pouch this is actually from Sonia
Kashuk little double-sided pouch highly
recommend that method in this bag I was
doing a video on um lip toppers and
stuff and so I remember I had just like
thrown all the various lip toppers I was
considering into this so here's another
lip bag that needs to go elsewhere
anybody else fall into the oh that's a
cute box I should keep it no I'm not
gonna use it for anything it needs to go
now their lip broader here's the lip
products I've accumulated so far
palates I've got that woosh Beauty
palette there and I've got a drawer down
low for like larger face type palettes
this honest hacia globe kit can go down
there to definitely have a place for my
lorac pro contour oh my mom was curious
about stuff from number seven so I need
to pass that along to her then I find
this happening here's a product I
absolutely hated this hydrating gel mist
from ELF but it's like I'm probably
gonna save that for some kind of most
hated projects video so it's just kind
of chilling out here but it needs to go
somewhere these are all my clean Beauty
blenders that I washed recently so those
I need to keep handy somewhere I think
I'll sit him over here for now
this is a Beauty Blender that I want to
use soon that I forgot about because it
was covered up some Mac micellar water
wipes when I use these small bullies or
a couple times
this jcat eyeshadow palette there's
another one of those head products it
needs to go somewhere else this is my
NYX lip color remover something like
this I always need to keep handy because
when I'm going between different lip
colors for lip swatches it definitely
helps to use something like this for the
liquid lipsticks to help get them
removed actually Urban Decay has come
out with like a stick one that works
really really well there's like random
hairs on here
several of these little elf lip palettes
that I need to try and this basket was
actually set aside with products that
I'm meaning to test out and I did that
somewhat recently there's the info on
all those NARS lip palettes in there to
notepad this secret sauce moisturizer I
might give this to mom to use she said
she was needing a new moisturizer these
eye stencils totally forgot about those
I've got a little area for palates and
things about this size so I'll sit that
right there so I'll see it got my just
peachy palate my Cara palette that I
really liked from my eye Kate house
whole lorac Pro palette the Too Faced
chocolate chip those all need to go back
that away if you shadow singles to put
away here UI products
here's a little shadow quad that I want
to use so I'm going to put that in there
oh that's that kind of blush e contour
product from Burberry I'll put that with
my bronzers elf blush duo love that this
sweetie pie thing I kind of decided was
gonna act more as a blush than a bronzer
for me so that can go down with blushes
too I think you'll see more of my actual
collection when I go through and
continue the declutter videos this is
kind of a cream bronzer from Too Faced
this is my dr. brandt pore dermabrasion
that needs to go back downstairs because
i want to continue using that
so I'll come in here with some cleaner a
little later and go over the surface of
this table but this is basically what
you know what I expect this part to be
like here's my end of my table right
here and when I turn around kind of this
direction to shoot videos I now have the
surface area to really lay things out
and just use this as a flat surface if I
need to but now the task shifts back
over here because I have a whole other
half of the table that's loaded with
stuff I've got a lot of situations where
there are foundations that I've been
using and they need to go over on the
opposite side of the room because I've
got a drawer specifically for
foundations so I've got the couple of
shades at the peach perfect but I've had
out here way too long and they need to
get back in that drawer nothing I'm not
gonna use them once they're in there but
I've tried them I reviewed them they
don't need to be like a top-priority
desk item right now my ELF foundation is
another one that's been sitting out this
little makeup forever sample the
cosmetics by by lines I'm gonna stick
that back in this basket where I had it
before those are like new things that
are kind of on deck to possibly review
um this la girl pro coverage needs to go
back in my drawer the Armani power
fabric gosh II can't believe how many
I've had out here my YSL all ours this
NARS stick really been enjoying this
lately I've decided more is more with
this foundation like actually like using
a little more product I used it a bit
too sparingly at first wasn't impressed
used a little extra which is very rare
with foundation sticks for me and I'm
loving it but I want to kind of keep
that front burner so I'm gonna put it
there and this is a little basket where
I had some favourites and they can now
go somewhere else although I do want to
keep my gingerbread man handy cuz and
that's just cute too so I'll put it up
kind of on display out of those we're
here shape taping the concealer drawer
this NARS blush has a place down here
that's called for foundations do we have
any other yet we got one more hiding
here oh this was the one I meant to give
to Mom to put that in the give to Mom
pile also this found BB cream and a few
other it cuz
MINIX things sim bye-bye under-eye
concealer the bye-bye redness that stuff
is all like about to be talked about a
little bit more so I don't want to
forget about it here's my found
illuminating blush that I love essence
pure nude highlight we all know where
that goes this little guy I meant to
mention this is a dud but ended up doing
my best in beauty video full face
soldiers tell you now this essence iron
face palette here in rise and shine not
too impressive I don't know if anybody
was like really holding their breath on
that one anyway but it was just kind of
like the law I have a little area where
I've kept these puffs out of different
loose powders and any time bells up here
messing around she grabs those out and
make it life settings where you can go
back here lip product lip product
that need to be cleaned right over here
obnoxiously sized powders that are hard
to store anybody else having that issue
I know it just looks like I'm moving
clutter from one side of the desk to the
other but this is going somewhere
immediately I promise
famous last words okay now I'm
collecting different eye products
eyeliners there's another look and see
where eyelash glue that's kind of right
up there in constant necessity with the
lip remover really bad sponges I think
the key to quick cleanup is just having
some place to go with it even if you're
not like going thing by thing and like
oh this needs to go into my red lip
drawer but just like having a bag sort
of collect it before it goes to its
final destination
it's this little makeup forever blush
combo you can make your own blush
palettes I do want to talk about that
that's gonna go in the to do box
a few little samples here I really want
to try the beauty blender cleanser
liquid I will sit that by my dirty
Beauty blenders this double-ended brush
needs to be clean it's gonna go back and
then my needs to be cleaned brush area
trash what do you do with that broken
blush that you just haven't fixed yet
I'm just gonna stay there
another obnoxious powder but I love it
it's liquid highlight
I've been sitting my mirror on this
giant thing of Clinique Moisture Surge
there's another set of lashes I don't
want to lose some things just have to be
kind of random I need to clean that
mirror I know that I've got a lot of
things gonna be a major dusting event
happening here soon this is how I
achieve beautiful hair looks like this
for my videos didn't use any of that to
develop put it where it can be handy
guys there's a personalized nameplate
offer and Kaboodle's product
registration that came with my caboodle
okay here's a moment of honesty where I
have to ask myself am I really gonna do
this is it free
no it's 250 I kind of want to do that
and now that I'm organized maybe I won't
forget I might put that on my little
notepad here
this was sent to me in my p.o box it
says somebody needs to wash my brushes I
love this I'm not sure whether to drink
my morning coffee out of it or to use it
as fresh storage
I'm hitting a bit of a moisturizer
roadblock here I've got several like a
really great moisturizers and I need I
think I could oh I see I could have a
secret moisturizer compartment here for
the ones that I'm not like using super
constantly like this
see that's no problem to grab that from
back there that's okay I actually got
this little thing where I can store
excess or just extra pairs of false
lashes I'm gonna keep it out so I don't
forget that I did this
7:29 and everybody's still asleep and
that keeps them safe that keeps them
dust free little thing of travel brushes
not sure where to go with that
immediately this goes in my travel peg
this is where I'd come up here right
away and I'm like so I've got a little
overflow drawer where I think I'm gonna
need to go with some of these loose
powders that are well I do kind of want
to use this velvet Iser
I put that in the tea use pile the peach
perfect needs to stay handy because I
use that a lot some of these pressed
powders and the Born This Way gosh I do
love this bronzer too but some of these
others are going to go down into a
little overflow drawer than I've got and
it's very easily accessible so what I
want to get in there and use some of
that and right over here so here I got a
Kleenex box but what I normally do is I
take this big brush thing when it's not
in these and that can be this little
bucket can come out over here giving me
some more surface area wait what's this
oh that's an oldie but a goodie okay
guys so do you see the amount of surface
area I actually have here when I just
straighten up a little bit and some of
this I think is even going to go down
more because as I work through that tub
that's gonna decrease I clean those
sponges I got some little brushes back
behind in that little white trailer
'king back there that I you know need to
clean so I don't know guys if you like
this I can do more of this kind of thing
there will no doubt be more messes and
there are other messes even throughout
this room that I can do this with of
course the decluttering is what I can do
now because I have known an excuse not
to declutter since I have all the space
to lay out my products right got a
register my caboodle and get that
nameplate but if this was completely
boring I apologize thank you so much for
watching anyway
at this point in the video thank you and
I will talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
