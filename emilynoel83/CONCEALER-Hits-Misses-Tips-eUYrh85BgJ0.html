be all about concealers I feel like this
is something that gets touched on every
year in my Emily awards videos when I
share a high end in a drugstore favorite
and those concealers will be included in
this video as well but really when it
comes down to this kind of product there
are so many different reasons why
someone might need a concealer and just
so many options out there so I wanted to
do kind of an update talking about some
of the ones that I really enjoy for
various reasons I don't want this to
drag on forever I've got so many
products sitting in front of me I think
it might but I also want to mention a
few that have been kind of on the fence
average for me and some that really
totally did not work that I've tried
recently so first off I want to talk
creamy concealers think these work
really well around the under eye area
because that's a spot where I think many
of us get dry sometimes right after you
apply your makeup you don't start out
the day seeing that but it's something
that you notice as the day wears on
these are a couple of concealers that I
think are very under-eye friendly and if
you've got dry skin you might find that
they're really nice elsewhere on your
face as well first one that I've got to
mention that has been so good for a
couple of reasons around the under-eye
both this little cavern here where you
can really tend to get some blue tone
discoloration also I've had melasma you
know like right on top of my cheeks I'll
refer you to that video a link to it
below if you haven't seen that that's
something I was dealing with a lot
during my pregnancy very dark
discoloration on the tops of my cheeks
and it takes kind of a peachy salmony
toned concealer to really cancel that
out so I'm talking about benefit erased
paste and I wear this in the shade
medium that is a really nice perfect
peachy tone and I have tried quite a few
other products very similar to this in
consistency I'm thinking about the Bobbi
Brown corrector in bisque if pearls got
a great salmon concealer but I think
this is really the best value I mean in
terms of overall performance they're
very similar but with this one you're
getting so much more product and with
this I feel like it only takes a tiny
amount just dab it wherever you need it
in some cases I just blend it in with my
finger but it's really fantastic for the
under-eye circle or other like age spots
sun spots mullahs
type discoloration on your face another
concealer that's that very same texture
I mean it's so so similar to erase paste
but it's not on in a salmony tone it's
more available in a regular skin tone
range this can still be nice on the
under eye area I think it's really good
coverage just the tone of it I think
lends itself to really like all-purpose
all over the face the moisture content
and this could be really good for dry
skin so it's called all covered up
concealer I have this in the shade ivory
I've used so much of this product but as
you can see let me hold up the erase
face next to it and you can see there's
a lot more peachy tone in this this has
a little bit more of that classic
yellowish beige type color I also wanted
to mention several that I think could
work well just really all over the face
if you want to use these over large
portions of the skin and practically
substitute for foundation if your
problem is blemishes or uneven texture
just a few just general concealers I
wanted to mention first off on the
maybelline superstay better skin which I
have in the shade light/medium I'm
surprised at how much I've enjoyed this
because it really seems like such an
average type of packaging the
consistency of this is probably very
similar to a lot of the you know doe
foot applicator style liquidy concealers
that you've tried for whatever reason I
find that this seems to have really nice
coverage and it stays looking pretty
darn fresh on my skin maybe that's
because I don't think this requires a
lot of powder setting product on top of
it you're just not layering as much on
your skin and it just continues to look
a little bit fresher I know with
blemishes that's a lot of the concern
it's like which is worse just showing
the blemish or covering it up and it
still looks very obvious because of the
way something's taking up on it and this
is an oil-free concealer so I think that
would be very blemish friendly but it's
been nice on the under eyes too or
really anywhere I wanted to use it
another nice one in stick form that is
kind of been a substitute to another
stick concealer that I have loved over
the years I'm talking about
the covergirl plus ol a concealer balm I
thought that was such a nice smooth
fabulous texture stick concealer and
then it's discontinued of course but
this one from Rimmel is called hide the
blemish I've got it in light beige this
particular shade is actually just such a
perfect tone if I want to use this on
the under-eye just anywhere around the
face it's a little bit brightening but
it's very very smooth and creamy and
they actually say you know it's called
hide the blemish but this can be used
really anywhere on the face I've tried
so many drying concealer sticks and this
one is not like that at all and you can
see it's got kind of a nice light peachy
tone to it it works really well finally
one more concealer suggestion for the
person who really likes the liquidy
texture and it's the Mac Pro Longwear
rediscovered product for me I recently
repurchase this I'm in the shade NC 25 I
think this is a nice kind of foundation
substitute type product if you're using
a really lightweight tinted moisturizer
or maybe just a regular moisturizer all
over your skin and you want a concealer
that you know with just a tiny amount
really spreads across the skin and still
maintains great coverage this might be
something you want to use I have heard
people complain a little bit that it can
be a little drying there so again really
my favorite under-eye concealers are the
ones I mentioned earlier I did want to
throw a mention out there for this
because I think it's just such a
fantastic coverage product and it's
amazing always amazing to me how a
little bit goes a long way I'm half a
pump of this really if you want to use
this as your sole concealer that half a
pump can go under the eyes down the nose
you know anywhere you want to brighten
on your face
there are so many liquid brightening
products on the market and I have been
let down by the vast majority of them
the two that I want to mention are
actually super low cost and it just
amazes me how I keep comparing to these
you know when I tried something more
expensive and I keep thinking gosh those
other two those are really the best
first off the maybelline instant age
rewind brightener this has kind of a
pinky tone and it always amazes me how
this is thin but it has a little
coverage to it there are some people out
there who are maybe barely dealing with
under-eye discoloration or darkness and
this might be absolutely all you need
and it's got that interesting little you
know puff type thing up here that the
product clicks up through then people
actually like to remove that I haven't
had an issue with it I just leave it
there but you can just dab it you know
maybe on the high points of your face
maybe you've used a corrective type
concealer a lot of times I'll use like
erase paste to really tackle the under
eye circle and then go on top with
something like this to brighten it up
further the other brightening concealer
that I've more recently come across and
been so impressed by it's the elf HD
lifting concealer and the shade is
called brightening and this whereas this
one is more pinky this has a definite
yellow type tone to it I mean it really
packs a punch I'm picturing people
putting this like in that triangle shape
on the under eye you know really lifting
that area up I've used it that way it's
really a great product and I know for
some people it's not so much about using
concealer to conceal but rather to
brighten so those are a couple of
brighteners that I think work very very
well
some concealers mainly like those first
few I mentioned the cream texture like
this having a little powder on top
really helps enhance the staying power
throughout the day it's not that you
have to use a lot of powder but it's
just enough to take the texture from
being kind of dewy and tacky to being
really smooth I feel like this has got
to be one of the lightest weight powders
known to man I love it so much as the
Ben Nye luxury powder in cameo there are
several different shades that this comes
in there's buff there's the banana
powder but the Cameo works really well
for me that's actually what I used to
set my look today and it can be a little
bit brightening it's matte but it's so
lightweight and there is that technique
floating around called like baking your
concealer where essentially you put on
your creamy concealer you load on a lot
of powder and kind of let it set on your
concealer for a bit and then you kind of
dust off the excess and this would be
the kind of powder that you could use
for that technique if you want to that's
a technique that I personally don't feel
the need to do that often it feels like
an awful lot of product but if you like
to experiment with that this is a nice
way to do it also a quick mention to my
bare minerals bisque or summer bisque
the one I'm holding up here happens to
be the summer bisque but it's basically
the bare minerals powder concealer and
this is a heavy duty full full coverage
type powder and I don't use this as much
anymore whenever I do use this just use
the tiniest amount like seriously pace
yourself
limit yourself but this can be kind of a
problem-solving product because if you
find you've got a lot of liquid or
creamy concealers but aren't getting the
job done coverage wise often times a
little bit of this and I have it in
bisque suburb it's a little warmer a
little deeper it adds to the coverage
tremendously if you're dealing with
heavy duty under eye wrinkles this
product even in light amounts I don't
know it might be a little questionable
but it's kind of a nice little product
transformer
just want to mention a few great brushes
this little it cosmetics double-ended
brush has been my current like favorite
thing I'll use this side for foundation
also
concealer it's very full it doesn't over
blend it doesn't like remove the
coverage although this smaller side is
great for getting on the inner corners
of the eye and around the nose so I
think that's called the heavenly luxe
dual ended foundation concealer brush
it's really nice from up and up from
Target right now the the packaging of
them is actually like this this is an
older one but they still sell the same
style it's the round foundation brush
either great red or large brush that
works very well for patting in your
under eye concealer works well on those
brighteners and then up and up also
sells this cool little duo one is more
domed one is cut at a very soft like
angle up like that but here's about the
amount of space that those cover on the
under eye area they're nice little
buffing concealer brushes great for
dabbing around you know maybe on top of
a blemish or anywhere all over your face
very all-purpose I think you'd find a
lot of uses for those and when I was
talking about the powders I loved using
the Smashbox number 10 and not that you
have to use this specific brush maybe
you've just got an oversized eye crease
or blending brush this works great with
the bare minerals bisque or the Ben Nye
powder because it's just so wispy
another brush this Sigma f-35 elf has
the tapered studio brush and those work
really nicely too to cover a little bit
larger surface area
to shout out to a few concealers that
did not work for me at all this Becca
under-eye brightening corrector
I have the full Express review on this
product but this has so much shimmer to
it you may not be able to tell when I'm
holding it up here but it's like a
pearly pink concealer basically I would
put this on the under eye area they gave
this thing huge claims that it was
supposed to eradicate under-eye circles
it actually was just way too reflective
and it made them show up a lot more so I
didn't go for that at all a couple of
brightening concealers that did like
next to nothing for me the bare minerals
well-rested face and eye brightener so
they put their well rested in a like
click pin and this was just so sheer
literally like I felt like it was no
coverage and when I put it on I thought
it just watered down everything else
that I was wearing and kind of a similar
effect for me with the hard candy shear
and the eye brightening concealer just
so so thin I found when I was blending
it in it just blended away to
nothingness
oh speaking of hard candy I don't know
where it is but their little palette
that has like some different corrective
concealers and also several skin tone
concealers that stuff so so greasy so
low coverage put that product out years
back when hard candy first came to
Walmart and they just repackaged it and
did not improve a thing
I swear this is the most product heavy
video known to man but I just wanted to
mention a couple of concealers that you
may have seen me use recently that I'm
just kind of on the fence about one is
the NARS radiant creamy concealer I have
it in the shade custard this is one of
those products that I think is good I do
think it's really good coverage but I
don't know that it's worth the high
price just compared to some of the other
drugstore things I've mentioned even
that maybelline superstay better skin I
didn't think this was head and shoulders
above that and when I really need to
correct like on the under-eye area I
really take away the discoloration I'm
wanting something like benefit erased
face it really tackles it better than
this so again it's okay but I don't
think I'd repurchase it and also the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye this is an
example of a really really emollient
full coverage concealer that requires a
lot of setting powder for me to enjoy
wearing it some people might put this on
and maybe you don't mind the dewy
tackiness under the eyes but when
eyeliner and eye shadow and mascara are
kind of touching that area you're going
to run into a staying power issue sooner
or later it's actually one that works
decently well under that baking concept
that I mentioned if you put a fair
amount of cameo powder on top of this
you won't feel that texture at all I
just think this concealer is so
contingent on needing that extra step
you really can't get by without it in my
book so that's my epic huge concealer
video everyone I really hope this
answered some questions for you I'd love
to hear about your concealer
recommendations as well but these are
just some of the best of the best for me
when it comes to different needs so
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
