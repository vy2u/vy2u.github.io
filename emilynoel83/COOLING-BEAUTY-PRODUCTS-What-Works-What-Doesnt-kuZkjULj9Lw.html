this video the topic is cooling beauty
products and I got really intrigued by
this idea with the milk cooling water
stick actually this is the obvious one
this is the one that I talked about in
recent videos and how I like this I
think it really does have a cooling
effect I love the way it feels under the
eyes it's just got a nice like flip to
it it really feels hydrating actually
but it's not too overboard it's not like
too much moisture but the on contact
cooling effect is amazing and I've
mentioned how the hard candy sheer envy
coconut water primer stick is really the
same effect as that I can't notice a
real difference between these two
products this is the mini size by the
way of the milk but if you're looking
for a really good value I would go with
the hard candy because that is a cooling
product that really really works so
anyway that product was the catalyst
that little thing was just the whole
idea starter with my fascination of
products that actually do have a cooling
effect on the skin and it's summertime
so it's like the perfect time to be
talking about this kind of thing so I
went further a list of things in my
collection I actually purchased a few
things that I've been trying lately to
see if they are indeed cooling so the
next thing that I mentioned is the Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray this
says cooling and hydrating it does say
chillness creates an instant cooling
sensation and actually chills the
surface of your makeup with our
temperature control technology so makeup
stays looking just applied this is not a
brand new product to Urban Decay's line
it's just part of their whole little
army of setting sprays and I've talked
about all nighter I've talked about D
slick as being I think two of the best
setting sprays for actually extending
the wear of your makeup and I've had
chill on hand for a little while I
haven't really used it much so lately I
have been trying this and I do believe
it does have kind of a cooling effect
just on contact stored at normal room
temperature here yeah I mean I can feel
that that is maybe just a teeny step-up
cooling wise from what some setting
sprays actually feel like when they hit
your skin it's not by a ton though and
honestly and this is not groundbreaking
information here but you could put any
setting mist in your refrigerator and it
really
have a nice cooling feel but just for
this as is yeah I do think it might
actually feel a little bit cooling as it
first hits your skin but what I've
really enjoyed what I found is I'd use
this are a couple of other factors
number one I think this looks a little
bit more dewy on the skin than
all-nighter and D slick do what though
they can do what feels like a fairly
generous amount of spritzes all over the
skin and everything really does stay
looking nice and matte and that might be
what you're after but this with a
similar amount of product applied I feel
like it gives my skin just a little bit
more of a glowy like just slightly more
dewy appearance a little bit more
similar to what the Mario Badescu spray
might be doing or that toothpaste
hangover mist the hard candy shear and B
primer myth and then the other neat
factor of this is I think it really does
extend the wear of my makeup very much
like the all-nighter and the D slick
sprays we'll get outside a lot lately
been wearing this under kind of hot
conditions and I think it's had an
effect like I said I'm very familiar
with what Urban Decay's other setting
sprays are capable of and I was happy to
see that this actually had kind of a
lasting effect without being one of
those completely matte invisible myths
that just gives a little more hydration
to the skin I guess might be the best
term there yeah it's cool I'll talk for
three four minutes on a product and
finally get to the word I want to use
hydration let's talk about cooling
shampoo cooling mint scalp sink mint
shampoo from matrix biologic says for
oily hair and scalp I can sometimes get
that way like my hair is really really
fine and I feel like it has maybe a
tendency of getting oily quicker than
maybe the average bear I don't know but
according to the claims this is
supposedly a cooling mint shampoo that
cleanses excess oil from the scalp and
hair and awakens with a cool refreshing
sensation truly I didn't feel that
cooled by this product I think I had my
hopes way too high maybe for what this
was going to feel like as I really you
know worked it into my scalp and got it
all suds DUP and everything
it didn't feel that cooling maybe it's
just the hot shower just it was no match
for that I don't know was not very
cooling however it did do a really good
job of getting my hair super duper clean
and just no buildup I felt like it was a
really good like clarifying shampoo so
in the very practical sense of like what
is this doing for my hair I thought it
was nice that the cooling sensation was
very small and not going to say it
wasn't there at all but it was it was
minimal it's in the general shampoo
since I've been using that L'Oreal
extraordinary clay and I've been loving
that I feel like that also gives my hair
really really clean but it doesn't over
dry it's quite a bit more pricey than
that and it's nothing I'm in love with
or something I would repurchase okay if
you're spending a lot of time in the Sun
you might need a hydrating after Sun
Jill I got this one from Sun bum it's
called cool down soothing and healing
aloe cooling gel with vitamin E it
claims to moisturize and restore dry sun
damaged skin and when you really got
like kind of sunburned cooking on your
shoulders let's say it doesn't
necessarily take a lot to make that feel
cooled down I haven't really burned
lately but I have been outside quite a
bit and putting this on it does have a
nice cooling feel like any aloe gel that
you use you know it tends to feel really
cooling and I actually put this on
recently after a shower and I thought it
felt fantastic it's cooling and it's a
like body moisturizer in the lightest
sense possible because I just rub this
in and my skin yeah I say it feels
moisturized but there is no tacky
texture on top this is not sticky at all
I have tried some aloe gels that just
kind of leave a stickiness on your skin
that's kind of uncomfortable then they
claimed sunburns Meyer cuts scrapes
minor burns insect bites minor skin
irritations apply generously to all
areas of skin gently massage into any
affected areas and it does say for best
results apply right after sunburn occurs
or before sun exposure reapply as
frequently as you like so I'm not saying
this is like working any miracles but it
is going to soothe your skin and help
those mire situations and just in
general says like I said if you want
like the lightest weight body
moisturizer possible this is kind of a
fun thing to use because it is really
refreshing and I like that it's not
sticky at all so another shower thing I
was going to mention this for Duke Canon
supply company I got this from Ulta it
said cold shower cooling soap cubes and
there are two cubes so I have one down
the
shower and once in here these are
actually meant to be used with a cold
shower and it gives you the benefits of
a cold shower here on the side boosts
metabolism increases alertness speeds
that muscle recovery eases stress yeah
that's a nice thought I don't know that
I'm one who's going to get in the habit
of taking a cold shower all the time for
the purposes of testing one of these
little soap bars I did do some cold
shower action and while that process is
taking place I used the cooling soap
cube and it does contain like some
essential oils I think they said looking
at the ingredients it's got peppermint
and menthol essential oil and it does
smell really minty and actually while I
was taking the shower you know I've been
kind of stuffed up lately dealing with a
cold and so I could still pick up on the
very minty scent of this product and it
was breaking through my stuffiness a
little bit but was this feeling super
cooling on top of the cold shower not
necessarily like I really didn't think I
was feeling it at all cold water is cold
you pull in any soap well cold water is
cold and all over your body and you're
standing there in a cold shower and yeah
I mean I can pick up dumb soap and be
like yeah it's cold it's freezing in
here I tried using this in kind of a
room temperature a shower let's just say
tepid shower water and I could pick up a
little more cooling actually then for
what this specific product is doing you
know because I was able to separate
myself from the water temperature so
much and then in a normal hot shower it
doesn't feel that cooling at all it says
leave one cube in the freezer for
maximum effect
I mean sure as with many things you put
them in the refrigerator this in the
refrigerator this would feel great after
a long hot day I get that trick but that
doesn't necessarily make a product
unique you know let's wrap up this video
with a cooling thing that really really
works and it's definitely one of my
favorite things like I would say top
cooling products you know this love the
cooling water stick discovered some
interesting things about the chill mist
I like the Sun bum Jill I would say the
shampoo and that soap or kind of magic
products but I love this this uLTA
Beauty smart skincare solutions
refreshing gel eye mask and it's the
cooling aloe vera it says that
he's hydrating hyaluronic acid soothing
vitamin E and this felt so nice and
these are kind of like little eye
patches in this pouch this is the very
outer pouch there is a small like pouch
within that it looks like this little
pouch that might contain a poor strip or
something so you open that and then
you've got these two little patch type
things you peel them off of the backing
and the sticky side goes down on your
skin you're going to put them on the
clean skin and allow them to stay there
for 30 minutes and I thought the effect
of these was so soothing I loved that I
could put them on and they weren't
slipping off my skin like I have done
some under-eye things where they're sort
of slippery almost like a sheet mask and
they don't really stay put and these
absolutely no question they're staying
put they're not goopy and liquidy like
you would touch water and get wet it's
like almost a solid type of treatment
I've done some full face masks that are
like this and you're not like dripping
with moisture or serums or things like
that but the fact that they have been on
there in that one place and they've kind
of confined whatever ingredients are in
the little pads to that one certain area
of your skin like it does work it feels
really cooling and even like ten minutes
in or as I continue to wear it I felt
like it was more cooling and let me tell
you immediately after taking them off
after the thirty minutes I touched my
skin here and then my skin down here and
I was like holy cow that feels so
refreshed so good and it was kind of
amazing how I don't know this part of my
skin felt kind of plumped up moisturized
good but it was not dripping with any
actual liquid which is kind of
interesting but I think this would be
great if you're dealing with puffy eyes
they say it's good for darkness as well
it really just tired eyes this could be
a good start of the day type thing
before like a special occasion I did it
nighttime I just thought it was very
soothing and relaxing it felt really
really freakin good
so absolutely love this I will be trying
more I didn't really pay attention to
other kinds that they might make of
these I'm not sure but the cooling aloe
vera is definitely definitely a hit so
thank you guys for watching this does
anybody else have a cooling product that
they enjoy surely there are more things
out there that would fall under this
heading
I think it's sort of fascinating when
it's not just a product that's you know
doing XY and Z for your skin but you
actually have some sort of a sensation
on your skin from it I think that's fun
so thank you guys again for your time
and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
