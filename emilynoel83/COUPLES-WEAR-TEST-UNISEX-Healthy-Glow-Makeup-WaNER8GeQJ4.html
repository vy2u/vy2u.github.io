hey everybody good morning I found a
co-star for this video today it is bum
Tyler my husband in case you're not
familiar and I needed him for this video
because I was recently sent something
from Charlotte Tilbury but here's the
box for your education here this is
called the unisex healthy glow all your
hydrating summer tinted moisturizer so
since it was marketed that way I thought
it would be fun to not only try it on me
but for him to try it on as well now
this is not to say that anybody couldn't
wear all kinds of makeup is out there
obviously there are guys who like to do
makeup and anything's fair game
but specifically for the way this was
marketed I have a hunch that they're
trying to pass this off as something
that's like undetectable or you know
what I mean something to try to like
draw in the other crowd who maybe isn't
as comfortable with makeup or doesn't
wear it as often bring which doubles
your customer base yeah basically first
office does not contain sunscreen don't
you think that's a huge knock against
this product early hope on if a dude's
going to wear this and it's maybe gonna
be all you have on then it just doesn't
contain goes on screen your marketing
most men you want to make that as easy
as possible getting guys to put on
moisturizer at all is is tough but you
don't want them s to a toilet it says
apply on its own or on top of your daily
facial moisturizer for a natural healthy
glow so I think what we may do for this
video bub
is pop on a little bit of this Kiehl's
broad-spectrum SPF 30 this isn't a very
heavy moisturizer and I think if we
maybe put a little bit on right now and
give it some ole time to think in right
now yeah I knew you still holding your
coffee good ask something of you or and
put just a little bit of this on because
I don't want to feel like you know going
all day long possibly doing outdoor
things that you don't have
sun protection so now give up a little
pea-sized amount of this and i'm going
to take some too you see how that's not
like super sick so i don't think it's
going to have a big effect on you know
what we think is that this moisturizer a
tinted moisturizer you are a little
sunburned some were a little bit like
raccoon eyes and going back i caused it
but really some o was like white really
reduce here in red i want to tell you a
little bit more about what this says
from the website by line my healthy glow
tinted moisturizer features ingredients
for healthy natural glowing skin this
fabulous unisex cream is so natural no
one will suspect you're wearing it maybe
there are a few people we can test that
on today
maybe if anybody knows the morning my
face up and there's two you notice this
is a summer in a bottle all year round
they say I've worn this a few times but
you're going to notice like it's got
those little all feeds of pigment that
you notice blending in as you put it on
yeah it goes on it's a natural tan
pigments are revealed once blended into
the skin for a natural looking tan and
we obviously have two different skin
tones going on here so that will give
you a little insight as well natural
moisturizing actives contain a
combination of moisture regulating
ingredients that mimic bouncy lipids
bouncy lipids what those are well it
sounds delightful it's going to mimic
those morphs to your skin tones for the
perfect looking glow for men and women
so here's the application tip so are you
getting ready are you psyched up yet I
can't wait I only go to beard level I
assume we can come into the beard this
isn't going to feel like a real thick
foundation that you're moving on maybe
start with with primarily getting it
where the beard is not but kind of blend
down into an I don't think it's gonna
look weird did I give you all the
instructions apply healthy glow to your
face and neck blending out for a natural
healthy glow
we're either on its own or under your
foundation for flawless dewy skin what
do you think of the packaging though
it's fancy eminence right word
we're opulent it's kind of like good
stuff coming back to that yeah it
definitely fits the vibe of this room so
that's what was only brawn no this was
sent to me by Charlotte Tilbury PR is
that what it was sent to you yet
probably yeah that that's generally
white water company I want to work video
in the background anyway but that's how
this all works them the secrets is this
tree I was bad I came out of bed toffee
has been taken course to put on okay
this is mr. delacro I asked him last
night I'm like so I've got this unit
section cut product for you to do a
video with me about it but I didn't give
him any of the time stipulations but he
knows he knows I could get up a butt
crack of dawn to do these videos so then
this morning he's like still laying in
bed I just nurse Steve and I'm like want
is a strong word I'm going to give you
some of this and I want you to kind of
dot it around on your skin a few
different places like and I'll hold the
mirror for you got it around first and
then you're just going to blend it in
with your fingers
I say dot because I think sometimes
people can Balam on a bunch of product
and it just all goes to one place so if
you're not used to blending something in
this is kind of your own way of pacing
the amount of product and where it's
going you see it changing colors oh and
then it's kind of turning a tan-colored
for the bags under my eyes do you want
any other products in this video love
I don't know if I want but and they need
what do you think of it so much I really
kind of go back and get its positive it
turns out too dark my magnificent I
think you look maybe a bit more bronze I
feel like you looked more pink and like
kind of sunburn this almost cooled his
skin down did it make the difference
between the white or those under mirrors
and make it more consistent maybe a
little bit yeah but you know what I'm
really looking for is any sort of
sparkle or shimmer because I think
that's the dead giveaway that makeup is
on your skin like if they're wanting us
to be undetectable but I'm not seeing
any any particles of anything how about
I put some of this on as well it grew it
is pretty runny so look at this though
can you see it what it's doing here blue
room I'm just going to kind of do this
half of my face shell so you can see
that definite like a skin tone over here
versus the skin tone
but there is a glow to this I can't
explain it I'm not seeing pearlescent
flecks of anything but maybe it's just
the added moisture content on the skin
okay here we are guys our unisex faces I
do like the way this this looks just on
my skin as is you know I've obviously
got some things to cover up like I would
do under-eye concealer I would go on fix
a little bit of them alas there I am
peeking through here and there and stuff
like it's not my 100% perfected face but
like oh did I miss a spot I totally did
bub you're awesome quality control he's
the one telling me I missed a spot
don't underestimate him folks through
porn this a few times and I didn't top
it with foundation eyed spots and seals
in places mm-hmm so I may go ahead and
do a little bit of that and kind of like
finish my makeup look for the day I
would be interested to see how does it
look on you're completely free from Sun
skin and see if that would be really
hard to mix in thank you
I think even on really light skin it can
be fairly easily blended in the more
fair complected you are the more you and
possibly others might see the change no
I wouldn't ask if you've gotten some Sun
and I or the day before or something
yeah does it feel tacky does it feel to
think - does it really feel like much of
anything not really you can do it just
like if you put moisturizer room for
some profile like comment on this from
Gil you pay for from you or from the
product thanks for me I probably -
probably no one will see will see as I
get into my daily activities I don't
feel about it I will see you know from
other people's judgments you know people
going to walk in the door and say dang
bub when that's usually what people say
anyway let's get more in depth on that
oh wait I'm going to get out and sound
hit some golf balls and stuff we'll see
what happens when I sweat I tell once a
song because I've got my brown residue
or something right and here's a tip but
here's a tip if you can block the sweat
off your face as opposed to rubbing
across your face that's going to be a
lot better
lightly blot I wanted you guys to be
able to see that if you wore the tinted
moisturizer all over just spot concealed
some places which that was mainly right
here on tops of the cheeks and the under
eye for me a little around the nose too
I set those areas just lightly with the
setting powder but everywhere else
there's a little bit of bronzer a little
bit of blush but this is the look you're
going to come away with if you're just
using that tinted moisturizer and not
like continuing to top it off with more
foundation or more like heavy coverage
so this is what we're going with for the
rest of the day do you think he's
wearing makeup he doesn't look like he
has makeup on okay so my look has been
on for about 5-6 hours now and I've been
to Target and back hot car but I'm
really not oily like to the touch my
skin the texture of it is pretty much
the way it was when I started and I can
still tell there's there's some products
there so that's good
so bub and I have been wearing this
stuff for about 10 hours now I'm about
to wash my face and then get in the pool
but I think for what it is like a did a
decent job I didn't notice any real-life
smearing or training but for it not
having SPF being something that's
intended moisturizer like oh and I got
to commit to it one hands on the phone
one hand holding a baby somebody's
yelling about Cinderella but what was
the thing oh it doesn't have the SPF and
for $40 like I don't think I'd spend
that on something that didn't have it
you know a bat type of product agreed
thanks lining up the mountain you and
say bye everybody nook I love you bub to
eat a man gonna have to do in this love
you're in the video yes you are hi guys
