we're talking about some drugstore
eyeshadow covergirl has released a new
palette and as a fan of some similar
palettes that they put out previously I
felt obligated it drew inform you about
this newest one and whether or not it
measures up to the things that I've
raised about in the past so cover girls
true naked palettes here they've got the
nudes they've got the Roses here and
they've also got the goldens and I
really was pleasantly surprised by these
palettes when they came out on their 8th
color palettes I feel like the textures
are really soft and easy to work with
they remind me so much of those eyes
studio quads from Maybelline and just
kind of a soft texture to the shadows
nice pigmentation I feel like they put a
good mix of some matte shades in here as
well as shimmery shades but not like
off-the-wall shimmers the shades that do
have a little metallic shine I still
feel like are kind of easy to manage and
work with so I have enjoyed all of those
really and now I see they've come out
with something called the jewels and
this one offers obviously a lot more
color you can see the purple the blue
the green gold happening in here and I
just really wanted to see if this
measured up quality wise to the other if
it was a total must-have palette and
yeah just show you a look with it as
well I am wearing that palette today so
what you're going to find in here is
that they've given you one shade that I
would classify as matte and that's the
kind of pinky or very very light like
dusty mauve color right there and it is
borderline deep enough to give you a
little contrast in your crease but
really everything in here has some
element of metallic sheen sparkle
something going on so I think many of us
would look at this and not see it
necessarily as they want to done palette
a palette that contains every shade you
might need for a look you might be
dipping into some other products to feel
like you had a fully like rounded out I
look just throwing that out there I will
say though the black has a little bit of
fine sparkle to it when you look at it
that doesn't translate a whole heck of a
lot on the eyes but still it's not like
a fully you know rich matte black but
what you are getting in this palette a
pearly white definitely shimmery that
light dusty mauve color that is matte a
very very shimmery kind of mix of rose
gold and Thoth your purple color which
also has some Sheen a royal blue with
kind of a metallic finish there this
olive shade which really really
attracted me to this palette but it's
very flaky has a lot of gold dustiness
happening there
decent metallic gold and then the black
that like I said had some sparkle but
it's not going to be super prominent on
your eyes looking at the swatches they
don't necessarily tell the whole tale I
think some shades I had a little more
difficulty with the swatches might
indicate for example the other day I did
a look with the blue and I felt like I
was packing and packing and packing on
the color and never did I really see the
impact like the way it's coming off in
this swatch I haven't yet used the
purple in a look except as kind of an
outer edge blending type shade but it
does appear to be a decent purple the
shapes that were the most flaky for me
were this color right here that's kind
of it makes me think of like a rose gold
a little bit of bronze a little bit of
taupe at times mixed in with that and
then the green so so flaky and I went
back and I checked some of the colors
that were in like the nudes or the
goldens or the roses palette because I
knew there were some shimmery colors in
there and I felt those again and sort of
a commonality with the colors in here
was that even though some of these
colors were metallic and had some shine
they weren't off the wall in terms of
being unmanageable like they weren't
nearly as flaky as the couple of really
flaky shades that I identified in here
there was a little more like hang
together Nastase Lodge those shades out
when you apply them on the eyes they
packed on more quickly more effectively
here with some of these shades I think
it's going to be very important what
kind of base you're working with you're
going to want something that these
shapes can really cling to and even with
that with today's look you know I used a
bit of a base and I still felt like
things were going a little all over the
place with
all of green so in my opinion I mean at
a glance it's a pretty palette right you
look at you think ooh you know that's
exciting that's fun to see at the
drugstore
I like to see covergirl branching out
and doing something you know just
different from all the new shapes I just
don't feel like the overall quality was
quite satisfying me as much as it is in
all three of these not saying it's a
complete gut product but you've got a
work of a bit more carefully with some
of these shapes you know what I'm saying
they need a little more special
treatment and that may not be something
everybody wants to do I mean I think
this cost in the ballpark of ten dollars
and that might be pushing it a little
bit like I'm not thinking this is
something I'd be repurchasing I do want
to show you the look that I did today so
you can see some application happening
here first thing I did I took that matte
light mauve color I worked that into my
crease just a little bit to get a little
definition going there and then I took a
sort of seafoam green shade it's called
Zulu from colour-pop and I patted that
on my lid because just judging by my
previous watching I felt I would need
something for that green to stick to and
then I used my sponge tip and I just
padded that right on top of my face
and frankly I don't think the base was
even quite sticky enough it did allow
for a little bit of cling to happen here
but I think you want almost like a
really tacky base under some of these
shapes that have so much sparkle I went
with the white shade kind of around my
inner corner and then I also used the
black with my Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush to give a little contrast on the
outer part of the eye I lightly blend it
a little bit more of the mauve on the
edge of my look just to soften things up
and then I went across my upper lash
line with black liquid liner to organic
color Envy and black Envy winged it out
because I thought that really kind of
cleaned up the look a little bit and I
went for a white liner in my lower inner
rim just because I thought that was sort
of fun with the frosty white that was
already around my inner corner I used
the black with an angled brush to sort
of blend my wing in a bit with my lower
lashline applied some mascara top and
bottom used some lashes that leave these
are the salon
fect 113 sir no the are Dell 113 from
the lash lookbook that's what those are
from and you know the look is not bad
overall but it was just it took I felt a
lot of work to get there and I feel like
the impact of the green on my eyes is
not coming so much from that shadow but
even more so from the colour-pop shade
that I use so my bottom line here is
that I'm not totally given up on the
jewels I want to work in my junior high
and high school sports team colors the
purple and gold I need to work with
those because I think those have some
potential here I'll have to update
snapchat Instagram when I do that but as
a whole it's not knocking my socks off
the way the original true naked palettes
were and there's just a lot of shimmer
in here they're really trying to load it
up with glitz and then just give you
that one that was pink shade over there
throwing us a bone if we want some matte
but I hope this provided you some
information on that palette if you were
intrigued by it the way I was thank you
guys so much for taking time to watch
and I will see it in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
