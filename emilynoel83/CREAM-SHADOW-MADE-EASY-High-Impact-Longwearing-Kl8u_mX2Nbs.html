for this video this comes as a request
someone said can you give us some ideas
and just some techniques on how to use
cream and liquid shadows because there
are some great cream and liquid
eyeshadows on the market these days how
do you work them into a look and so
that's what I really want to show you in
this video it's gonna be a pretty easy
you know basic tutorial and then at the
end I want to give you a few
recommendations of some cream and liquid
shadows that work really well and in
terms of working well I think there are
two big factors here you want it to be
pigmented beautiful shade selection but
also you want something that's gonna set
and be super long wearing there are
plenty of cream shadows that have come
out over the years that have not been
that way but then more recently I think
so many brands are putting things out
where you know you swatch them once on
your hand you rub over them they go
nowhere that's a more common thing that
you can actually find throughout the
drugstore these days too but if you're
working with that kind of a shadow this
look can be very easy to achieve so I'll
be showing you how to use your powder
shadows to get like a really blended
nice softness in your crease and then
two ways to work in your cream shadows
and I think you could think of what I'm
doing in this video sort of as a
template definitely plug in any shades
you want different products that you
know you like but maybe this will end up
being kind of a go-to strategy when
you're working with these kinds of cream
shadows and if you're just sitting here
thinking why creams why can't I just use
my powders powders are great all around
as well and I use a lot of powder
shadows but a couple of great advantages
to using creams is that if you've got
the right ones they can be so so
pigmented and vibrant but also they're
offering you in many cases heightened
staying power beyond what you might get
with powder shadows only problem has
been I think that many people see them
as more of a pain in the butt to work
with but it can be very easy and that's
what I'm going to show you now okay so
the first thing we want to do is prime
the lids with eyeshadow primer and even
though some cream shadows that you work
with are just super long wearing and
they may not even require any sort of
primer underneath I am gonna be working
with some powder shadows as well to
develop the whole look so I do want this
on there first and then I'm going with a
matte
shadow palette here this is the baked
Browns from dose of colors I just love
this color scheme ends up being a very
warm look by the way if you use this
palette just all on its own it's gonna
be kind of warm today too I'm gonna go
for this middle shade with my e25 brush
and we just want to work a color into
the crease it wouldn't have to be this
pillar tone of course you could use any
shadow color you want and it doesn't
even have to be fully met like satin
finishes can still operate nicely in
this way as well but you just want
something to get yourself that softness
going in the crease because while cream
shadows can be used in the crease I
think it's a little more foolproof to
put a powder shadow there because the
blend ability is just really really
simple here so again just getting that
color right into the crease blending it
up as much as you can or as much as you
want to we all have varying amounts of
space between our eye and our eye brow
and then just take a bear brush and
really make an effort to buff out the
outer edge of the color and then I want
to do a highlight and for that I'm also
gonna use powder shadow as well I'm just
gonna use that color right there and
just buff that right over the edge and
this also helps to make a very finished
edge so to speak to the other shadow
you've applied edge is really the wrong
word to use we're trying to create a
total lack of edge actually just a blend
I guess so now we've got a nice soft
crease working there and I'm ready to
pull in a cream shadow so for this look
I'm using aqua aura from the L'Oreal
infallible paints line this has kind of
a satin finish peach and then this super
pretty matte teal so I'm gonna go to
this color first and it doesn't take a
lot of these you might find if you've
experimented with these as well I put a
little dot of it there on the lid and
you want to kind of start blending it
out right away because these are cream
shadows that have a tendency of setting
so just take advantage of the fact that
it's been freshly applied it's nice and
creamy and just blend it all across the
lid this is my Real Techniques shading
brush and I think it works great with
cream shadows and if you want to build
up the color just a little bit more at a
couple more dots but just go little by
little don't overwhelm your lid
with a ton of product because odds are
it just doesn't need that much so that
shade is now all over the lids and
because the staying power with these is
so good I'm not going to be worried
about that fading off or smudging away
this is a great strategy for locked in
staying power then what I want to do is
take that same brush that I use for the
crease color I'm not gonna add any more
product to it but I am just going to
blend over my crease a little bit and I
think this just softens that line
between the lid shadow and what's
already been applied to the crease now
if you want a really distinct cut crease
don't go back and do this I mean you
could definitely use these cream shadows
to create that very defined line between
your crease and your lid but for
everyday wear and just the look that I
go for I like it a little softer so just
go back in with that same brush and
that's enough I think to soften it up
then you also have the option of
layering a little bit of powder on top
of your cream if you want to so the next
step I would do is take a slightly
deeper shade so here's like a dark brown
a nice kind of rusty warm color here I'm
going to use a combination of both of
those and Pat this on the outer part of
my lid just to kind of demonstrate to
you that you can you know overlap
powders on top of creams like this and
when you add just a little bit extra in
this way it makes it look less like
you've just slapped you know one solid
shade on your lid and it just integrates
it into your look a little bit better
next since this is a look where I'm
going to be using a liner on my upper
lash line I'm gonna go ahead and do that
now before I move on to the lower lash
line this is my Jordana color Envy in
black Envy
now also because I got very little sleep
last night I'm going to brighten my
lower inner rim with my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlighter this really
perks up that area nicely and then the
second sort of cream shadow strategy
that I want to demo today is using it as
a pop on the lower lash line you could
also use some of these cream shadows
that have a very kind of liquidy quality
to them easily as liner across the upper
lash line too but just basic lower lash
line pop I like to take out this wand
applicator or picture yourself dabbing
into a little pot if that's the style of
cream shadow you're using but I just get
a little bit of this on an angled brush
and you will find this transfers so
easily you feel like you're working with
just the perfect consistency of product
here because it's not even as stiff as
some gel liners are but it's not as
liquid he is a straight-up liquid liner
this is such a nice consistency to work
with and you just apply it straight to
the lower lash line the intensity is
there so I don't feel like I need to add
powder for that reason but I also don't
feel the need to layer powder on top of
this for staying power either because
it's gonna be very locked in and long
wearing just as is I'm using very little
product it's literally just dabbing a
tiny bit off of that wand and boom
you've got this really pretty pronounced
lower lash line I love that so next just
to finish the look you're gonna curl
your lashes apply mascara top and bottom
add a little false lash if you want to
and that's the look finished look
something I'm very happy with I think it
looks really nice just in terms of
blending and the way everything comes
together but it's also nice to go into
your day knowing that you've got
something that has a staying power that
can take you you know into night time if
it needs to I like having a lower lash
line that I'm not going to be worried
about smudging and it was really such a
one-step thing but yet the intensity is
totally there but again the key to
making this whole look work and really
give you that great longevity throughout
the day is to use cream shadows that set
to a long wearing state they're not
going to be transferring up you know
onto your brow bone or down under your
eye you need to use products you can
count on in that way so in addition to
the L'Oreal infallible paints which I
think are
great there's such an easy consistency
to work with and blend with a brush
really interesting color options some
are more monochromatic in terms of the
two shades that they give you others
like this give you some contrasting
colors another great liquidy type
eyeshadow from the drugstore that makes
a great lid pop are the Maybelline Color
tattoo eye chrome so they also have some
deeper shades that you can easily use as
liner like I did today and then there
are tons of great eyeshadow sticks in
all price ranges that can do this type
of job Jordana made the last shadow
sticks the Milani shadow eyes are
another great creamy option I love the
Mallee ever color shadow sticks or
shadow stick extras as they might be
called now there are some gorgeous
neutral kind of shimmery tones in that
line the ball makes some great shadow
sticks called batter up also the laura
mercier caviar sticks which are now not
only in shimmery finishes but also
mattes those can be fun to work with and
there's even more than what I've just
named there but hopefully that gives you
some ideas of the kinds of things that
I'm talking about shadow sticks that
truly set cannot be smudged away and
yeah I hope this was helpful you guys
and if you've got other like little tips
and tricks maybe things that I've
mentioned briefly in videos but you'd
like me to go more in depth on exactly
how to do it you guys know I'm not
calling myself some super expert here
but you know you do enough makeup
application you do come away with some
tips and tricks here and there that I
think are worth sharing so thank you
again for your time and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
