video it's going to be sort of a
multi-purpose video I'm going to be
reviewing a product and also doing sort
of a mini haul for you here just to get
you updated although i don't do halls as
often as i should i mean if you want to
see more of them let me know but um you
know i feel like i'm getting a lot of
new products all the time and i don't
know really how often do you want to
know about it so just feel free to chime
in on that and let me know what you want
to see but the product i'm going to be
reviewing is from coastal scents and it
is the 32 lip color palette and i love
this thing because it is it's just so
much fun to play with because you've got
this great range of colors going all the
way from reds and pink from more like
corals and oranges on this sides to
pinks and reds and then into more like
neutrals and browns and nudes on the
other side so it really this palette
really does a good job of giving you the
whole spectrum of color I am actually
wearing one of the shades and this sort
of pinky shade is this one right here
kind of a frosty a sort of a bright pink
shade with a little bit of like kind of
a plum undertone to it but I love
playing with these and sort of mixing
them because they're not all exactly the
same texture for example of these on top
like this peachy one is like kind of a
more glossy texture and then um here's
like a deep coral shade that's more of a
cream most of them are creams um it's
just I love how pigmented they are I
love the texture of them on um there's
like even like an orange II one that is
honestly kind of pretty on if you layer
it I think even if I layered it on top
of this you think it's gonna be like
crazy orange but instead it kind of
takes it you know to a different sort of
red tones so it's just so much fun to
mix and match with these and if I can
what my hand here on something and and
that really lets you be creative if
if there are any like makeup artists out
there that are kind of wondering would
this be a good palate to use I think it
would be fantastic for if you were doing
someone's makeup and you just wanted a
great selection of color so i feel like
i'm going to rambling but bottom line is
i really like this palette it was well
thought out I feel like in terms of the
color selection they gave you and just
so much fun to mess around with I mean
you may discover that all kinds of
different shades look good on you if you
are the type of person that you know you
might you might typically think oh well
that's probably a palette recommended
for people who love lots of cut lots of
different colors and using a lot of
colors honestly I might recommend this
to somebody that sticks with a lot of
these neutral shades and just wants to
see if some of these other colors look
good on them because I bet you will find
some new favorites with this and then if
you like one you know you can be like
okay I'm looking for a lipstick shade
similar to this one or that one and it
can help you pick out products in the
future just by having this sort of
palette to give you ideas with so I
really really like the Coastal Scents 30
it's 32 colors with the lip palette
there is another one I believe that
might be more colors but these that you
get are a little bit bigger than that's
than those sizes so definitely check
that out I'll have information in the
sidebar and now for my little love mini
haul here i have a few products from
glam couture cosmetics which is a makeup
company online and um it looks like some
really really fun and awesome stuff here
that i have so I'm really pumped about
it I have three of the HD pigments and
check this out guys yeah I'm going to be
doing a look with these I wanted to get
some pigments like some bright colors
and shades that I that I really haven't
done a look with yet so um this HD
pigment is in sunshine and you can
totally see right through the thing you
just normally I have a hard time I have
to open it up that you can see what
color that is that sunshine this is
another HD pigment in strawberries it's
actually coming out a little brighter
than maybe it actually is but that's
sort of a I'm trying to decide these do
have a little bit of like glimmer to
them but
not like chunky glitter and then this
one is crazy in love and this is while
strawberries is more reddish this is
more of a pink so you can imagine like
how much fun i'm going to have putting
those three together for something yeah
I think that'll be fun especially when I
mix the red and the yellow I'll get sort
of an orange eat own too so that'll be
fun and then I got something that I can
use to while it's Albright's like I
wanted I want to do a look using all
these together with those bright shades
I wanted something that I could kind of
contour with or may be used as a liner I
got this really really unique eyeshadow
it's called night in Vegas and let me
open it up here this is so different
it's a black with what appears to be a
gold sparkle in it and when I saw the
picture on the website I was kind of
thinking maybe it was just gonna be
black sparkly black with me like silver
glitter but I was not expecting the gold
but honestly I'm really excited about
that and the goods gonna look great with
those bright colors to just kind of to
deepen up the crease maybe or something
like that and oh it's a really rich and
pigmented and you know that's really an
understated sort of sparkle like as you
can see it just gives that gleam to the
shade but it doesn't it doesn't make the
the shadow look like a really bright
bright sparkly thing so I'm really
excited to try those and i also have a
brush here this is oh geez I think it's
set on the package but it is let me
actually fish it how or hopefully oh duh
it's on the brush it's the chisel crease
brush so that's going to be awesome for
you know doing some contouring work and
stuff like that so very very pumped
about those products and a little wipe
off here yeah that looks like someone
wearing eyeshadow cuz it's not coming
out have several sort of palette things
that i got from TJ Maxx and if you
ever been to a TJ maxx store it's like a
store where you can get clothes like
some sort of brand-name clothes at lower
prices and they also have like some
beauty products skin care hair and
makeup at lower prices too and how cute
are these these are made to look like
little books and it's from the company
the balm and they look like little books
like if you stand out like don't those
totally look like you know the backs of
little books and they open up and this
is the bomb springs one and by the way
these were like fourteen dollars and I
got them for half that price so like
seven bucks and you open it up and it
kind of looks like a little book you got
a mirror here and it gives you some
different things this is like an
eyeshadow in uh shameless Shana and then
a liner and you get a little brush and
then something called overshadow which
is like a see exactly what they called
that I think it's just like a shimmery
light pigment sort of thing so you get
all that in there and I just thought
what a great gift idea or just something
fun to like take around and travel with
I don't know it just strikes me it's
really cute and then this is the one in
Palm Beach and you get a bomb shelter
lip gloss which I've tried this one and
I really like that it's a tinted lip
gloss like a pinky shade and then you
get three things here this is a bronzer
in Bahama Mama this is hot mama and it
is a I think as shadow / blush and then
this is a shadow in mischievious Marissa
so just really fun and cute and I just
thought you know how cute will those be
like sitting up somewhere I just I just
think they're adorable so i'm not sure
like if those are discontinued or what
the story is with those little palettes
but i just had to tell you guys that I
got them and then this palette i'm not
sure what the original price was it's by
sugar cosmetics really pretty finally i
got it for five and it comes with really
a lot of stuff in it you get all these
shadows which are sort of sort of
lighter shades but they i mean i've
swatched a few and there
a little more bold and you do have a
nice black there so like a row of
neutrals in a row of blues and berries
and then the other side opens up and
you've got some lip colors and a couple
of blushes sort of a peachy pink and
then a bronzer right down here so I
stopped for five bucks to get all that
stuff in there I just really i didn't
even know what the inside looked like i
was on such a make up high while I was
in there I thought I had to get it so
anyway guys that is my review / hull for
today I hope you enjoyed this video and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
