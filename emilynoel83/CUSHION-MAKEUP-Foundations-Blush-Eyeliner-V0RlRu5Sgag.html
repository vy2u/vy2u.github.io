video is about all things cushion I have
three cushion foundations to talk about
also a cushion blush and a cushion
eyeliner so this trend is huge right now
I thought this would be a good
opportunity to show you everything tried
on so I'll be trying on all the
foundations and the blush the eyeliner
reviewing them for use joining some
before and afters just going to try to
be as complete as I can in this video so
if this idea is completely new to you
what is a cushion anyway well a lot of
the products seem to have a format a lot
like this where you've got a sponge a
pretty soft sponge in a compact and that
sponge has been completely saturated
with whatever the product might be but I
think the important thing to keep in
mind with these foundations is that it's
liquid foundation you know it's not a
different product than what you've
probably been using for years it's just
a different delivery method they're
giving it to you in a compact which the
claims for this might be that it's
easier to use on the go or for touch-ups
for me that claim doesn't really
interest me so much because I'm never
really one who's looking to touch up my
foundation another benefit that
foundations like this will claim to have
is that you know they're buildable and
they're just an easier application maybe
then the standard liquid that you might
pour or pump out of a bottle and I can
see that I mean as far as just opening
them up you could use the little puff
that's provided they all have a very
similar style puff here and I find that
I prefer either using a brush or a
larger Beauty Blender type sponge to
apply these just because I feel like the
application is faster and more even with
that not saying you couldn't do this
with this product or if you did want to
touch it up I mean this would probably
be the way to go but I always feel like
with a smaller sponge like this I apply
a little more pressure and it just isn't
the most even application and I do think
that effects the coverage but again
talking about how buildable they are you
know if you decide okay I want a little
more coverage than I initially got from
this product you can just dip your brush
or your sponge right back into the
product and continue building it up on
your skin as opposed to you know
coming out more foundation maybe getting
it on your hand first or getting it out
of palette first and then scraping it or
scooping it off of there and getting it
on your face I can see how there's a
little added convenience factor from
that angle with these products in this
video I'll be talking about the cushion
foundations from Physicians Formula this
is called the mineral where talc free
all-in-one ABC cushion foundation with
SPF 50 I've also got the one from
Lancome which is called miracle cushion
and the one from L'Oreal which is the
True Match Lumi cushion buildable
luminous foundation something all of
these have in common they all give me
this luminous look to the skin you know
they're a little bit glowy and none of
them seem to have sparkle or shimmer so
I love that
but I'll notice just this little bit of
Sheen on my skin after I apply them and
I actually think it looks really pretty
I think it's very well done in all three
of the products while I do find all of
these to be buildable you know if I add
more product I can see more coverage but
what you're also going to see when you
build up a slightly luminous foundation
is more glow the more product you add
but as a whole I really enjoy these
products and this concept I do think
it's very easy to use i get a quick
foundation application i find all of
them to be buildable although they don't
all get me to exactly the same place
which i'll explain in just a second I
feel like these all give right around
medium coverage the Physicians Formula
definitely on the lighter end if this is
medium coverage it's just working its
way into that category and then these I
think very similar with the L'Oreal and
the Lancome in terms of giving me a
solid medium coverage so let's just talk
specifics already with each one of these
first off the Physicians Formula
adorable packaging I love that they went
blue with it it has this kind of quilted
look on the front got the mirror the
sponge all of these cushions have this
sort of sub cap that's keeping that
cushion from drying out I have this in
the shade light/medium and this does
have an SPF 50 as you see demos with
these I use the same brush for each one
I cleaned it off in between but I use my
Sigma f80 I like the way flat top
brushes can just easily boom dip into
this product pick it up
and just nice even application so I
thought I would keep that sort of a
constant with all of these as I showed
them to you but anyway when I dip into
this one I feel like even from when it
was brand-new the sponge was not quite
as saturated with product as the Lancome
in the L'Oreal and not that I struggled
to get a lot off on my brush but with
the others I just needed one dip and I
could get like an entire side of my face
done and feel like you know that was
decent coverage for me also if you were
to just swatch all of these out on your
skin and just feel the product and
really just look at how it lays down
this seems to be a thinner product it
almost strikes me as like a serum and
foundation mix or closer like a BB cream
type thing when I look at the L'Oreal in
the Lancome swatched out they look like
straight-up foundation I think this is a
light coverage building to like the low
end of the medium scale once you get it
all blended out all over your skin you
see that little bit of a glow that I
think is characteristic of all of these
cushion foundations for whatever reason
but when I see this all over my skin I'm
happy with how it overall evens out the
skin tone you know there may still be
little areas like the under-eye where I
want to correct with a little concealer
I do like this product
I just think unlike the others this one
takes a little more work if you're
wanting more coverage and you just have
to add a little bit more of this product
and I should also point out I feel like
all of these wear very similarly on me
I've really been watching the staying
power and I feel like product stays on
my skin all day I never feel like I've
had a total breakdown in any one spot on
my face but if I don't set these with
some powder on the t-zone I will have
some oil issues around the nose and I'm
a normal skin type I'm not overly oily
I've been trying to test these over the
past few weeks both with and without
powder and I think the powder is a must
for most people and outside of maybe the
driest of the dry I do think the powder
is helpful right after you apply if I
was going to go somewhere and I wanted
my foundation to look its best
I would probably blot over it again like
late
afternoon now as far as the Lancome and
the L'Oreal this is the miracle cushion
here from Lancome I have it in 220 buff
C and then I have the L'Oreal in n 4
which is called buff beige I just feel
like there are so many similarities
between these two and basically
identical finishes on the skin first off
when you get them applied they really
look the same as you can see with the
Lancome here and it's kind of a little
bit larger compact you take your sponge
out and you've again got that little
snap open lid when I was applying this I
just took my Sigma brush I give it one
dab into the product and I just feel
like it's more foundation like than the
physician's formula and I think it evens
out the skin tone quickly easily I don't
feel the need to build up a lot of extra
product I'll call the straight up medium
coverage and it still leaves the need
for concealer in some areas you know
that kind of varies by the day in terms
of how much I might need on the under
eye or if I've got a blemish or
something those kinds of issues will
still show through to an extent but as
far as the overall skin tone I love the
way this looks
now I'll jump right into the L'Oreal
Lumi because I feel like again there are
so many similarities between these two
this one the shade I have is just a
little bit deep for my skin tone but
we're making it work for the purposes of
this video this demo like I said it got
this in in for and much like the Lancome
I just dipped my brush in I swirl it
buff it all over my skin I feel like it
quickly goes to medium coverage without
you know dipping back in more and more
it could add more foundation and
potentially get even more coverage but I
don't necessarily want that much of a
glow on my skin because you get more
glow as a result of that too so I get
this blend it out all over my skin
really happy with the way it looks I
mean I just can't really complain and
I've been a fan of the lumi liquid
foundation in the traditional bottle
format and i really think this is a lot
like that just a little easier to apply
and the other day i was wearing these
like half and half on my face really
trying to see what are the differences
surely there's some big difference that
i'm missing you know between these two
that's what I've been thinking but I've
they can't come up with it foundations
themselves have that same kind of
lightweight thin consistency but gets
still foundation like overall pleasantly
surprised with all of these as I
described I think the physician's
formula is the lightest coverage
requires the most work if you want to
build it up so this is not one I
probably look to repurchase although
I'll continue using it on and off and
I'll keep it in the rotation for myself
these two really like them both and when
I use them up if it comes down to
repurchasing I would repurchase the
Loreal just because it's less expensive
and on my skin it really gives the same
look maybe on different skin types more
of a difference would stand out between
these two I'm not certain so while I've
got favourable things to say about those
foundations this blush this is from
philosophy this is called take a deep
breath and it's cushion color for cheeks
this I'm not so much a fan of first off
totally different cushion format here
you've got this little like netting
going across the opening of the product
and then just straight up liquid blush
that comes up through and I realize this
product is pretty new there's a lot of
juiciness kind of coming up through but
a lot of product comes up here to the
cap so I don't even feel the need to
touch this part because there's just so
much product there and I can just sweep
whatever I would need off of the cap and
the way they say to apply it is to just
use your fingers and swirl it on your
cheeks I did not like the look of that
at all I felt like it instantly broke
down the foundation underneath it's just
too wet your finger has to apply too
much pressure and that combination I
mean it was like there was no foundation
underneath it and I had just this kind
of splotch of blush there the shade I
have it in is shade 4.5 which is the
soft pink I think there were four shades
total every shade that i swatched there
in Ulta had glitter in it
glitter why I mean philosophy I was
surprised to see a brand like this put
out this product with little flecks of
glitter in it not just shimmer not just
a pearlescent finish but little bits of
glitter that can actually be seen like I
can see I've got kind of a stain of the
product on my hand from where I applied
I'm definitely seeing the little bits of
glitter don't understand that whatsoever
don't like it at all it's unfortunate
because the color is beautiful I mean
don't you think this is kind of a fresh
like baby's blush kind of I don't know
it would work for a lot of people type
of color the way I do make this work
application wise is I use a brush I use
my ELF small stipple brush which really
makes pretty much any liquid cream
product work for me blush and highlight
wise and I don't dip it right into the
product because I would have way too
much on the brush so I get a little bit
out on my finger I put it on my hand i
dip on to that and then swirl it out on
my cheeks and that makes the application
pretty easy and I feel like it's more
lightweight I don't think it broke down
the foundation underneath so this
definitely solved some problems for me
and from a distance I think the look is
fine but when I look up close I can see
little bits of glitter and I just don't
like that and for the price tag of this
product I feel like I should really be
enjoying it you know if you think you
might like a more liquid consistency
foundation I'm a big fan of the becca
beach tints which are just in little
squeezy tubes and there's some really
nice shades in that line there's a
raspberry color that I really love and I
think those are easy to work with they
look really fresh on the skin but they
do not have glitter now for eyeliner
this is my eyeliner here it's from
Physicians Formula it's called the eye
booster two-in-one lash boosting cushion
eyeliner plus serum now this eye booster
line is not new to Physicians Formula
they also make this liner pin that I've
talked about before that has the nice
little brush tip so the way the
packaging is I've seen this style of
packaging with other products here and
there but you've got your cushion in the
same style it was in with the foundation
so in actual sponges there it's
saturated with a basically a liquid
cream type liner maybe a thinned out
cream would be the best way to put that
and then on the cap you've got your
little brush here and I like to put the
end back in the cat so I've got a little
something more to hold on to but you can
of course use any brush you want to dip
into this product
when I first used this I thought oh my
gosh this is so simple because I was
comparing this to different cream gel
liners that I've used in the
and I feel like with those whenever
you're dipping in one doesn't simply
just dip in to a cream or gel liner with
their brush and just Boop and then right
to the eye I feel like I'm always taking
a second to make sure my brush didn't
get overloaded you know getting a little
excess off of there and then going back
to my eye and then anytime I want to
apply more or if I need to go back to
the product you repeat that same little
step with this
I loved how I could just take this brush
dip directly in here a couple times and
then go at it and I thought this was so
nicely saturated with product and it was
like no-brainer dip in and go plus it
looked really nice and black going
across the lash line just very intense
great ease of use I was a fan I'm using
the term was because that was my
experience with the first couple of
applications after that and I've had
this for about a week and a half after
that point this has gotten quite a bit
drier and I feel like for that short
span of time
I shouldn't be experiencing that already
this is one reason why I don't do first
impression videos because if I did a
first impression on this I would have
given this an absolute rave and now with
a little time and testing I can see I
don't like it so much I really feel like
I'm dipping into a different product now
this is nowhere near as saturated as it
was when I first got it and just to get
it across the lash line the amount of
times I have to dip back in to thicken
out my line it just feels dry going
across my lash line and like when you're
using a cream or gel liner that's just
about dried out now well I can swatch
this out on my hand and have pretty good
staying power with that swatch and I
find that it sets and it looks matte and
I can rub across it and it doesn't go
anywhere with wear on my eyes it's a
little bit different story anytime I
have this on and I'm not looking forward
to this later in the day but the part
that's around the inner corner always
transfers down it Tran it will transfer
to the lower like tear duct area and
look black right in the tear duct and
just below it's not a cute look it does
not look intentional it looks like okay
somebody's got smudgy eyeliner so I was
released
to see that considering how well a
swatch could wear on my hand but I guess
it's just the moisture in that area and
I hadn't been crying I hadn't been
rubbing my eyes but it just did that
much like foundation eyeliner is not the
kind of thing I like to think I have to
spend any time later in the day touching
up you know I expect it to just stay in
place I have so many eyeliners that
flawlessly stay in place this other one
from Physicians Formula loved it
has not caused me any drama any problems
but this one I was just so surprised
that it would feel so drastically dry
after just about a week and a half of
use you know the first two maybe three
times I thought wow I love this this is
so quick dip into it boom go across the
lash line and now it's already starting
to feel dry so bottom line with this
video cushions are they good I do think
they are really performing well with the
foundation products I have enjoyed these
I'm going to keep using these I think
for someone who likes a little bit of a
luminous finish on the skin you're going
to love the way these come off my
favorite of the bunch for just the
overall look and then taking the cost
and the value of product into
consideration the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi would be my recommendation because
you're going to save some money compared
to the Lancome and you're going to get
better coverage compared to Physicians
Formula but for the blush I don't feel
like the cushion format really does it
any favors I don't find it to be
absolutely necessary with the Physicians
Formula maybe it's just a matter of
tweaking that formula to where it can
stay a little more moist or something or
maybe it's just drying out because like
I'm not leaving it open overnight but
it's got to stay open for a certain
period of time as I apply it so if it
could dry down a little less in the
container that would be awesome if I
ever see this product come out and they
claim new and improved formula I might
try it again I hope this video helped
you out thank you so much for taking
time to watch I really appreciate it and
I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
