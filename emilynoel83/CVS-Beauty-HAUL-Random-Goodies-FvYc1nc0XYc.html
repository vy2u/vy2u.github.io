beauty haul I've got actually a few kind
of random non beauty related things and
a lot of really cool finds one thing
that I went in really hoping to find and
I fortunately did are the new Milani
matte lip creams it ticks me off that
these are limited edition because it's
like these would be such a great
addition to their regular line because I
absolutely love the consistency of these
first off will let you know I'm wearing
this red one this is called romance and
then I also picked up the one in embrace
I really a lot of times seem to enjoy
the deeper shades of these matte liquid
lipsticks they had a nude in this line
that I was close to getting but I
thought you know a lot of times the
lighter shades can just look pretty darn
drying and they had some medium shades
that just didn't seem all that unique
but these two I just really wanted to go
after and what makes these different
from the various kinds that I've tried
is that they are like a true liquid they
really start out SuperDuper thin but
they're really pigmented so not thin and
like watery like you got to work to
build it up on the lips but just you
know a thinned out very pigmented liquid
lipstick liquid lipstick I think that's
a great characteristic of something like
this that's going to dry matte because
when they're thicker it's not like that
thickness does anything for you moisture
wise anyway it can actually kind of make
the lips feel a bit more uncomfortable
and I'm always trying with these liquid
lipsticks to apply the thinnest layer
possible because I think that makes for
better staying power or even staying
power and just a better feel overall on
the lips so I am thrilled with the way
this looks I mean it's so mad it totally
dries so just like the color pop ones
you know it's not going anywhere and you
know I am so pumped to try out the very
kind of berry purpley shade that I
picked up also given the way this one
went on I wish I would have picked up
more he's like I'm so impressed if you
find these definitely try a couple of
them another
things that I'm wearing that I'll talk
about real quick I was just looking at
the Knicks display I'm a new thing for
my CBS is that they're carrying Knicks
now not like it's full of a range as you
would find it Ulta but they've still got
quite a few items and one thing that
appealed to me that I was like oh do I
not have this one yet it's this nine
color shadow palette in merci beaucoup
and it's a beautiful range of neutrals
plus the money shades right here for me
I love this red it's kind of interesting
because it's not like a super burgundy
red but it's actually kind of I don't
know there's more red to it and a really
nice peach bronzy golden shades a couple
of really nice dark shades so I am
wearing that on the eyes today I've got
some of this on the lid these two shades
in the crease and I kind of smudged this
bronzy shade just on the lower lash line
also some of this Brown this is a really
creamy nice um kind of warm matte Brown
so that's a great one to have in the mix
oh yeah it doesn't transfer all love I
might need you to pick up a rotisserie
chicken I know in my big like NYX
product review video I talked about all
the new things this I believe has been
in their line for quite some time just a
little bit smaller palette still great
color variety just under $10 so if you
like neutrals plus you know some reddish
colors this is a fun one also I wanted
to try one of these NYX baked blushes
actually on the packaging it says baked
blush + illuminator + bronzer I'm not
sure what that's about because it even
said that on like the really really like
rosy blush toned shades but I got this
in the shade chiffon and I am wearing it
today I'm not sure what it's doing for
me exactly I've got a little bit of
highlight on with it a little bit of
mary lou manizer this blush is like to
be honest I think it's barely showing up
on me it looks pretty in the packaging
and I was just thinking you know if that
turns out to be really pigmented it
might be one of those cool like a subtle
blushes but
it feels very dry to the touch and then
that's kind of the shade so I don't know
a this is really just my first time
playing with it so I'll have to use it
some more but one kind of indication is
that if the blush looks that here in a
you know swatch where you're going like
that and rubbing on it for a while once
you share that out on your cheeks it's
gonna be even softer now as soon as I
walked into the store I saw a display of
like yo s lip balms some generic like a
OS type lip balms and these from
covergirl were like right in there with
it
it's the lips licks smoochies from
covergirl in Midnight melon it has SPF
15 use twist-off oops
twist out the top and here's what you
have so it's basically like an EOS lip
balm just in like a squatty I don't know
cylinder type packaging smells amazing
really smells like kind of a watermelon
type scent I don't know that this has
any color really on the lips I was
wearing this yesterday and I didn't
notice much and now just watching it I
can't really see anything yeah it smells
so sweet I smell it as soon as I like
take the top off I can really smell that
and they had I think like two other
flavors also haven't really worn this
enough just yet to have a real solid
opinion on it though something I've
already had and reviewed on the Express
channel is the Sarah V skin renewing
cream serum this is something that I
have been using kind of like a night
cream basically it's serum and
moisturizer in one it's kind of the way
it behaves but I'm figuring in time I'm
probably going to want a little more
moisture than that on my skin and guess
what I found they have the Sarah B skin
renewing night cream so it's just in the
same like kind of lineup as this stuff
but an actual night cream so I guess it
comes in a little tub here have not used
this yet but this is the way it comes it
says helps soften and renew the look of
tired skin overnight I am just a big fan
of the Sarah V products I have had
really good luck with you know the
hydrating cleanser
now this cream serum also the eye cream
I think it's called the repairing eye
cream
and so this stuff has like a little a
little subcat there can you see how
thick that is
like it's not gooping out anywhere it's
just really yeah it feels very thick
very hydrating I'm excited to try this
and I also like their just the regular
moisturizing cream in the big tub that's
great for just you know kind of spot
treating various dry areas wherever they
might be on your face or body I've got
high hopes for this product gosh this is
like a true whole I haven't done a real
true haul in a while I feel like they
always turn into reviews because I've
waited a while after the haul and this
is like stuff I just bought yesterday so
you're really getting the first taste of
everything here and starting to run low
on my Vaseline spray and go lotions I
have both the cocoa butter and the green
bottle which I believe is an aloe scent
so I wanted to try this kind from st.
Ives
this is the fresh hydration lotion it
says coconut milk and orchid extract and
I started putting some of this on
yesterday but it's that lotion that you
go through and you just spray it on I do
really like the scent of this it's a
little less coconutty than I was
imagining you know I'm getting a little
bit more of a fruity maybe even floral
vibe out of that I guess that is that
working I was putting this on my legs
yesterday I thought it seemed really you
know lightweight but what I did put on
seemed to kind of pack a punch moisture
wise I guess the question will be is
this more hydrating than the Vaseline
options that are out there so we'll try
it some more and let you know but this
says fast absorbing non greasy 100%
natural moisturizers now something I've
purchased over and over and over and I
needed a new one for my diaper bag does
anybody keep mini hairspray in their
diaper bag my Tresemme trade to
hairspray this is really the best stuff
I actually as I was taking things out of
a purse and trying to get my diaper bag
all packed for the wedding we went to
this past weekend I somehow left out the
hairspray and it just kind of reminded
me hey you might want to pick up an
extra one so this is just as good it's
like the big can it's just a nice mini
can great for travel and this really is
just my holy grail type of hairspray
period I don't feel like I have to use a
lot of it I don't really use a lot of
styling
all these days but a light amount of
this will usually do what I need a
hairspray to do so love that now outside
of the Milani lip creams these are
probably my most exciting find that I
have to share with you and I was not
expecting to see these at all and when I
found them I thought this is genius why
have I not seen something like this
before they are these get the look
flexible hair bands from the sketchy or
scrunchie brand um and basically they're
wired the little tails on this head wrap
look at her you know she's got it
wrapped all the way around her head and
then your little like bunny ears that
you have here you can make them go like
any which way you want I love that
because sometimes you kind of want them
poking straight up and then other times
maybe you want them to lay down and be a
little more tame and using just a
regular bandanna can be kind of hard to
work with but this I think is gonna be
so fun I am certain you will see me
wearing this in a future video and I
will let you know like how it was to
work with and this wire seems to be very
thin very flexible it's not like you're
working with something super stiff or
something that might get uncomfortable
like on your head because it is wired
all the way through I've actually got to
just try this right now so let's see
let's undo it it's all wrapped around
anytime I wrap my hair up in a bandanna
I put my hair totally up first and then
I kind of have a little more control
where the bandana type thing is
concerned so here I'm just gonna like
twist it a little bit you know like I
don't even feel the need to tie it I'm
just gonna like crisscross that a little
bit okay there's my ends oh I think
that's so cute
I think this is just a great little
innovation here and I like how it's
being worn in the picture as well with a
bun but wait you guys I also saw this
this one here is a bun wrap so I can
have something cute like when I put my
hair up and they only had like two
styles and this one was like blue and
white and then I definitely had to go
with the black and pink polka dot but
much shorter but how cute will that be
because I'm always
throwing my hair up into a bun and now
I'm gonna feel like way more stylish
with that little thing so yeah this is
so exciting and because I apparently
can't stop with the hair accessories I
thought this was really cute this was in
it like a little side display there was
this Mia brand and they had all these
different hair accessories and this is
the little denim bow it's got one of
those big old clips in the back but I
thought you know that would really match
anything and it would be kind of cute if
you were wearing your hair half up or
cute like clipped right on to a bun I
don't know I'm kind of into it and this
is so comfy because I really didn't have
to like yank it so tight you know like I
might tie up a bandana it feels like
nothing on there but I've got this
little bow just how I wanted it another
thing I grabbed you know I'm always
talking about the equate daily facials
cleansing cloths they are the dry cloths
that actually have sort of a soapy
substance in them but it activates when
you get it wet so it all suds up and
lathers up once you you know run it
under the sink so I'll grab the Olay
kind if I'm somewhere where that's the
only thing available whenever I'm at
Walmart the equate hydrating daily face
wash cloths are sold like two in a
package and that's what I always try to
get a lot of drugstores don't seem to
make a store brand of this particular
item but now CVS has and so I wanted to
pick those up and try and they are the
CVS pharmacy hydrating daily facials
so in here will be a pouch of how many
thirty cloths so I'll try those out
hopefully they don't like irritate the
eyes that's them to have something I run
into with the generics not always with
the face wash cloths but the face wipes
equate has been great equate has been
great so we'll see how these go all
right now we're really veering off the
beauty path here but still staying
somewhat connected these sticky notes I
had to get him a little lip sticky notes
these were in like that dollar bin type
section instead of three 30 sheets in
each so yeah and then I got up to the
front and I didn't realize I had grabbed
two so when I sent him down at the cash
register I'm like I don't know that I
need six of these but I didn't really
want to like go put it back at that
point and they were just a dollar so
okay
these with friends and family I needed a
couple more of these little long skinny
trays and they actually had these
there's two in a pack they're a dollar
these fit nicely in my IKEA storage here
I've been asked like how do you store
your double ended brushes this is how I
store them so like this one from it
cosmetics or I just keep it out and let
it clutter my space but for the most
part I just you know land down in there
or you know you could store regular
brushes this way you could store like
eyeliners shadow sticks these are just a
nice size have organizer to fit down in
your drawer so you can always use more
of those and the winner for the most
random item in this haul is this Trident
layers swedish fish moving for gum I was
letting some gum because I feel like my
sweet tooth is just fired up lately and
I think like maybe if I choose some
sugar-free gum you know that'll satisfy
me maybe we'll see but this is I got a
three pack of it and the gum is like
this I have one opened up downstairs
it says berry and lemon I don't know I
to be big into swedish fish in college I
went through a major Swedish Fish Face
and these don't taste anything like it
like if somebody just gave me a piece of
this it would never occur to me that it
was swedish fish I can kind of taste
some lemon and you taste the lemon not
and when you first put the gum in but as
you chew it more I think it's got like
some of that flavour crystally type
stuff in it maybe that makes you taste
that more but it is kind of oddly breath
freshening you know it's kind of cool I
don't hate it but I wonder who decided
like hey we should make Swedish fish
flavored gum but wait now I'm getting
confused the swedish fish that I always
knew were only red like that's the only
kind of ever head and then they're
showing a swedish fish here that's
yellow are there multiple flavors in
which case maybe this does taste like
swedish fish since I haven't tried other
flavors of it I've only tried the red it
doesn't taste like red swedish fish i
can assure you of that
so that is my hull guys I hope you
enjoyed it I had fun I would say the
most exciting item
those matte lip creams from Milani and
these fun little like Wired headbands
definitely look for these if you're in
CBS that's the only place I've seen them
let me know if you've seen other styles
other places because I'm definitely down
for getting some more of these so have a
great day you guys and I will see you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
