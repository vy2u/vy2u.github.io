caramel apple themed eye tutorial and
this was inspired by my friend David he
actually challenged me to do this and I
talked about David a lot on my channel
he is a great friend and a fabulous
makeup artist and he was noting that I
seem to talk about a lot of caramel
apple favorite things here and there
we've done the caramel apple Oreo review
on the other channel I also love those
caramel apple Milky Way's and the
caramel apples suckers and he's like
have you actually eaten a real caramel
apple and I have eaten one I've actually
never made one but I am gonna make this
caramel apple eye tutorial using the
vice 3 palette it really has some
perfect shades for this with this green
here and some great bronzy browns and I
just thought maybe you know you're not
going all-out Halloween with your look
but you just want something kind of fun
and fall themed that you could wear
pretty much anywhere this would be a
look you could use for that so I hope
you like it
alright so I've already primed my lids
and to avoid dulling down this green I'm
gonna go ahead and do my crease shade
first and that's going to be this color
right here called downfall it is kind of
a caramel e matte tone just using my
Sigma e25 brush to apply that all
throughout the crease this shade seems
to kick up a lot of fallout so you want
to make sure to tap the excess off your
brush next we're taking this beautiful
shimmery green called dragon and I'm
just using a flat brush with this and
this is going to go all over the lid so
just Pat it on I like to kind of start
lightly with bright shades like this and
then build them up to the intensity I
want but this shade is really bold and
pigmented and it builds up really
quickly so really just filling the whole
lid space with this and then also we're
going to take it around the inner
tear-duct this is something I normally
wouldn't do with the green but I think
the top there is kind of fun so I'm
going into that shade with a smudge
brush this is my e21 and I'm just going
to encircle that tearduct area here and
I'm taking it just under
as well just that innermost parts and
then I also want a little lightness to
surround that green and I'm doing that
with this shade down here called Bobby
dazzle it's a shimmery white so I'm just
gonna take that right around the tear
duct next I'm going to deepen up the
outer part of this look with this shade
called rain it's a shimmery Brown and
I'm using my Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush and I don't want to cover up too
much of the green so I'm really gonna
keep this right on the outer part of the
lid and then I'm flipping the brush over
and I'm pulling that shadow kind of up
into the crease area a little bit and
here I'm just kind of building a bit of
an outer V just really placing that
shadow exactly where I want it to go and
will blend it out in a bit and while I'm
working with that shade I'm just gonna
go ahead and smudge some on the lower
lash line and then I'm just taking a
bear brush and I'm gonna blend over the
edge of that dark shade and then for
sort of the caramel effect of this look
I want to bring a lot of warmth around
this space between the eye and the brow
and so I'm using lucky for that it's a
really nice golden a bronze this is my
Sigma e30 six brush I like it because it
can give me soft application but in
really small spaces and as you can see
I'm taking this down all the way in here
to the inner corner and then I'm just
gonna keep adding shadow and pulling it
up and I'm almost taking it to the brow
I'm getting a really light with my
application like I'm barely touching the
brush to the skin but I'm definitely
overlapping some of that brown and
trying to stay off of the green and then
just up under the brow I'm using truth
and just placing this right on the
border of the brow just to give me a
little definition between the eye look
and the eyebrow this is my Jordana color
and the liquid liner in black Envy I'm
just starting right there on the
innermost corner and pulling it across
and then when you're doing a wing kind
of want to think about pointing it up to
the outer edge of your eyebrow so if you
were to connect the two you know you
would be able to create a straight
line there so I just kind of pointed out
in that direction get that little
triangle going there and then start
filling it in
sometimes I create my initial like short
wing with liquid liner and then you can
extend it up with shadow first off on
the lower lash line I'm gonna line my
inner rim with black and this is my M
Cosmetics water liner in black night I'm
taking a little bit of that down onto
the skin and connecting it up to my
black liquid liner there from the upper
lash line next using an angled brush I'm
going down here to revolver it's kind of
a shimmery black charcoal type shade and
I'm just gonna go over that area where I
did the pencil liner now I just cleaned
off this angled brush and I'm going into
lucky picking up where that green left
off and going just under any of this
blackish darkness here taking it just up
under that wing next I'm just curling
the lashes and I'm going to apply some
mascara top and bottom here this is my
Mally volumizing mascara that's going on
the upper lashes and then covergirl
clump crusher water-resistant on the
lower lashes and then I am gonna apply
some false lashes with this look I'm
using my red cherry number 43 s and I'm
just applying some glue to the lash band
this is my Revlon precision lash glue
and I will link below to my full false
lash tutorial if you want some more
detailed steps and you know some ideas
for what lashes you might want to pick
out and this and that and once the glue
gets tacky I'll just place that on the
upper lash line finish off with one more
coat of mascara and we'll be done so
there is the finished eye look I gotta
say I'm loving that green shade it comes
through so clearly and beautifully I
think even surrounded by all these nice
neutral tones as well some other keys to
the look I think it's good to use sort
of a warm bronzer I think it really
plays well with these types of tones on
the eyes I used my eight cosmetics CC
plus radians ombre bronzer and I use
that for a little contouring and around
the hairline for my blush I went with
kind of a shimmery peachy gold with the
balms hot mama and
my lips I've got a little layering
happening here I couldn't quite settle
on the exact shade I wanted but I used
my maybelline matte lipstick in daringly
nude so that's kind of my base color and
then as a liner I used NYX mahogany
which is kind of a deep brownish red
type color not a lot of red and it's
definitely more neutral and I was kind
of trying to achieve that nice caramel a
look with the gloss and so I used my lip
glass from Mac it's the Viva Glam Gaga
too and it didn't give me exactly what I
wanted so I get the layering stuff when
in doubt just keep throwing stuff on the
lips right I used lucky the shade that I
used above the eye there and I kind of
just Dad that on the lips and I thought
it made everything a little bit more
golden II I hope you guys enjoyed this
it was a lot of fun thank you David for
the idea and I hope everyone has a great
and happy safe Halloween bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
