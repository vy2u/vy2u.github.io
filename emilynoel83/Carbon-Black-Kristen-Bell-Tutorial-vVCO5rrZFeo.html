this video this is a carbon black eye
look the from the shadow to the liner to
the lashes everything is really black
and really intense in this look so this
is definitely your party look you're
going out look you know anything you
want to do to really draw attention to
yourself and draw attention to your eyes
especially this is the look for it and
it's inspired by actress Kristen Bell
she was in the sophisticates hair style
guide which you know I like to get
because I get a lot of makeup
inspiration out of it and I saw her and
it really caught my eye because of how
just deep and dark her um I look was and
I thought that'd be fun to just really
focus on black for a particular tutorial
I will take you step-by-step through
this whole look so keep on watching
alright to start this look you go ahead
and apply some Too Faced shadow
insurance all over your lid and really
make sure you get that not only on your
lid but up into your crease and all over
this entire area because we are
definitely going to be using a mix of
cream and powder shadows so we really
want that to stay as well as it can so
really just make sure you've got that
everywhere then take some sort of black
cream shadow or jumbo pencil would
actually be my best recommendation here
I'm using one from wet and wild it's the
idolized in graphite so you're looking
at a very deep dark it doesn't even have
to be completely black but like a dark
charcoal shade what like this would work
as well we just want something very dark
to really grab our black shadow and
increase the intensity even more so just
go ahead and draw this all over your eye
starting at the lash line so get very
close in there then just continue to
move upward even getting right into the
corner as well this is a look that is
really dark all over so don't hesitate
to get that right there in the inner
corner and then up into the crease and
then we're going to kind of think as we
get to this outer part here think about
extending that out like if you were
going to draw an outer v on yourself
instead of make it out of shadow
where would that be I would go up a
little bit and make like just this
little outer um extension of the I
basically think of it like that that's
the sort of shape we're going for here
we also want to come down a little bit
underneath with this now we will have
eyeliner on but just to give us an
awareness of the shape i'm taking the
pencil i'm coming down below here if you
were using a cream eyeshadow i would
definitely instead of using your finger
for this i would use a smallish brush so
you could make these different Tyga
shapes out of it here we've got that all
over and now you just I did this is a
key step so really don't forget this
don't go straight to your eyeshadow take
your finger and blot over all of this
what this is doing it may not seem like
it's doing a lot but look what I'm
picking up on my finger here here you're
getting the excess product off of that
this is kind of eight I mean you saw how
easily that pencil glided on that's
great but there's a lot of moisture in
it that you don't really need so it's
just like sometimes you know when you
want to blot your lips after you put a
bunch of gloss on or something like that
same exact thing that we're doing here
we're blotting it with our finger and as
you can see we've got a lot of extra
product is I'm just going to wipe off
here also I'm going to take a cotton
swab q-tip and just kind of go over that
edge and there we are there is our cream
base for this look but you can see it
can get a whole lot darker so now we're
going to go to our shadow I recommend
using a matte black shade here and i'm
going to use matte carbon about as black
as it gets and i'm going to take a flat
eyeshadow brush I'm using my Sonia
Kashuk medium shadow brush you can see
it is definitely a flat type brush get
some of that shadow on there and then
just kind of we want to overlap all of
what we did there with the pencil thing
or the jumbo pencil
so just get right in there top it off
and just build the intensity once we
want this to look more black than it did
before so just Pat that on now we want
to make sure we get the crease as well
so get some shadow on your brush flip it
around make it so the brush is is really
zoning in right there on the crease and
we're going from the crease way in here
all the way out here and padding but
also pulling right around just beyond
where we put our pencils so we want that
to really blend out you can see right
now how this has just really faded out
there's a couple more products in a few
minutes that you'll see that are really
going to help us get that effect that
natural fade that we've got here fading
from black to skin tone is a process so
this is just kind of step one of that
process is just you know going beyond
where we put that pencil and making it
just the shadow which will decrease in
intensity as we go out now that we've
worked with just basically taking the
cream topping it with the shadow we want
to pay attention a little bit more to
the shape you can see it's kind of muddy
right now this isn't exactly defined or
blended out so I want to take my essence
of beauty fine crease brush and the most
important place for this to be black is
our crease because that's where
naturally the color I mean that's that's
where color recedes a little bit in our
eyes so we want that to be as black as
possible and using a smaller brush it's
going to allow us to do that so go there
and then just kind of like I would
normally do an outer V probably with
this kind of brush so I'm just doing
what I would do she's kind of going out
coming over and just really defining
that looking at my other eye seeing
basically what the shape is that I'm
working with and just kind of blending
it out now I'm going to take my Sephora
rounded crease brush really really blend
blend blend on the outer part up here
right around there
so now we're looking at you know a
slightly more finished look where the
black is concerned but what I've noticed
from looking at the picture is there's a
little something extra to this look the
makeup artist didn't simply put black on
their make an outer V and call it a day
they put a little bit of a warmer shade
to allow that black to blend more to a
skin tones look and a shade that I think
kind of duplicates what I see in the
picture is a shade from milani called
golden bronze this is sort of a very
very light brown with tons of gold in it
so I'm going to take my actually smaller
than that I want to use my essence of
beauty not the fine crease brush but the
one that's one stage up from that comes
in the same kit with it get a little bit
of that shimmery shade on there and this
is kind of like the difference maker of
this look sometimes in my shadow
tutorials it's like there's that step
that just takes it up a notch you know
this is kind of it for me here so going
right to wear the black fades to nothing
going right over that border with this
pretty golden tone and you see how that
is turning to I don't know it's just
that fade is beautiful loving how that
works go back going back for a little
more again we only are really putting
this on this part of the eye right from
here to there creating a nice little
fade for us making it look a lot more
natural and just I mean hot it's just
making the look hot right here I love
this step now we want to not neglect
this whole space here I have more space
between here and here then Kristen Bell
has in the picture so I need to do
something with this so I'm going to take
golden sunrise from covergirl this shade
could look very intense like that but I
always like to share it up by using a
fluffier brush if we're around a crease
brush get a little bit on and go right
up here just covering the whole area
from what we just did to the actual
eyebrow
and then just to lighten it up a little
bit right under the arch of our brow and
using Mac's Naked Lunch we'll come back
to this shade in a moment for the one
lighter area down there but just going
right under my arch like so as dark as
this look is I still want to use a liner
on my upper lash line I'm going to be
using my la girl fine line it's just a
black pin type liner very very fine tip
gonna go from inner to outer corner just
to really um I mean no matter how black
we make this it seems like this is
always going to be blacker just because
it's a liquid form so I really want that
darkness to be very close to my actual
iso and that's why we're going to go
ahead and use liner i'm just going to go
from my extreme inner corner here
staying very close to the lash line and
it's going to almost be hard to see if
you did the last step right it's almost
going to be hard to see that black
getting it right right in there with the
lashes and then on you might wonder well
what do you do with the liner from here
you don't necessarily have to wing the
liner out at all but i am just to keep
consistent with this shape we've got
going out there so i'm going to be
taking it out just a little bit so I'm
just drawing it out to extend slightly
and it's just going to give us sort of
another little base thing to stick art
we're going to use some false eyelashes
so they'll just kind of fall on top of
that and it'll all just have that nice
darkness to it a really creamy option is
from almay it's just the Elm a pencil
eyeliner in black just works very well
to get this intense look that we have so
what you're going to look to do here is
go right in the corner blending it right
up to that corner there corner of the
upper liner and then come down
we're going to go all the way in staying
kind of right between the lashes here
sorry I hate it when I do that I go back
and look at my video and I see I've gone
out of frame for the whole liner step
and I hate it okay sometimes it's kind
of challenging to get right in between
the lashes but when you're doing water
lining you don't want to have any kind
of little light gap there you know
between if you're doing both lining on
the natural lash line and the water line
it needs to all be dark so you've got to
really keep it close okay now for the
waterline taking the same liner it's
very soft and will stay very black for
me here tugging down slightly and very
gently and just getting this whole area
nice and dark you'll see any gaps then
that you need to go over i'll go over
those later and she has liner that goes
it goes completely in to the very very
inner corner there so there is our liner
look guys not too difficult and one
final step we can't leave out on the
liner is to top off our lower liner
which is very creamy we want to increase
the staying power here as much as we can
sorta coming back to matte carbon taking
my Coastal Scents tackle on liner brush
getting a little bit of that powder on
the brush and just top it off right here
from outer corner to inner corner it's
not really making it any thicker but
it's just going over it it's also it may
be making it a little bit darker it's
taking any sheen from that cream in the
liner and kind of making it Matt when we
put this matte shadow on top so this
look while it while it is so dark it
still remains pretty defined and I kind
of like that and one last little thing
to think about here shadow wise I feel
like I keep thinking I'm done with this
but then I have one more thing to do
there is one bit of light in the basic
eye area here and that is right around
the tear duct there's just a light shade
so I'm taking max Naked Lunch just a
very light shade little bit of shimmer
to
taking my Coastal Scents mini chisel
crease brush and just coming right
around here just working it right up so
this little light backwards Sea area
right here around our eye is just a
little bit lit up okay hopefully that
makes sense there we go and next what
I'm going to do is apply some mascara on
my top and bottom lashes on the top i'm
going to use steel a major lash mascara
it gives it holds my lashes in a nice
curl and that's going to help us when i
put on my revlon fantasy lengths false
lashes the intensifying set these are
not these self adhesives i just got
these from the store intensifying they
look like that and going to pop those on
then on my lower lashes looking at the
picture she's got a lot of thickness
that shows up in the lower lashes but
not a lot of length you can see what I
did here I really went over the lashes
but I didn't drag my brush through the
length of my lashes because I didn't
learn to look too long so I'm taking my
Maybelline lash discovery with the mini
brush and really just kind of keeping it
right in there close to the lash line
itself and that's what's going to give
us sort of a thick look there but not a
long look so I'm going to do all those
steps and then I will join you with the
finished look
alright guys we're back with the
finished look as you can see just a
super super dark I look the false lashes
I feel really set it off and kind of
make it look even darker because they
stay consistent with that shape we've
got going on here on my lips I used
first I put some lip balm on and then i
used the Rimmel thousand kisses lip
pencil in natural so just kind of a nude
pencil all over and then I put on one of
the Coastal Scents Max and strut on nude
so that's just kind of a sort of
somewhat opaque well just a little bit
of shimmer to it nude gloss so in the
picture as you can see she stays very
nude on the lips but the eyes are just
really where the intensity is and so I
really wanted to mimic that with this
look I hope you really enjoy it and if
you want more tutorials like this more
celebrity inspired looks just let me
know tell me what celebrity you're
interested in seeing a makeup look on

thanks for watching guys have a great
day
