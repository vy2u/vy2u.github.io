the people 100 most beautiful people
list that's from People magazine and
this look is going to be a Carrie
Underwood inspired look and so that
means after looking at a lot of
different pictures what I've noticed her
looks usually don't have a lot of doing
us on the face it's usually pretty like
a matte flawless face with not a lot of
heavy contouring or anything like that
and neutral to nude lip and then the
focus is really on the eyes with liner
mascara and I'm going to take you
through some suggested products to help
you achieve this look and it's really
not too difficult to do but even for me
it did use a few different strategies
than what I'm used to so if you want to
see how I pull off the look keep on
watching guys I'm kind of in the middle
of working on the face look what I've
got ahead and done is applied some of my
uh it's this is just an awesome awesome
concealer guys it's the kat von d tattoo
concealer my color is light here you get
a big tube of its Sephora product and it
really rivals the coverage of my Bobby
Brown concealer only it's not so thick
so I really really like that for the eye
area so much so I've applied that there
since carries look in terms of her face
makeup more often than not she's seen
with a very matte look a very something
that appears to be maybe somewhat full
coverage and so full coverage Matt to me
that equals everyday minerals intensive
foundation my shade that I used is
medium beige neutral and so that
intensive is the highest coverage
formula you can get from everyday
minerals so I applied that all over I
set that concealer with my abbott's perk
me up on mineral concealer so just like
kind of a peachy yellowish toned powder
that really um cancels out that any
discolor discoloration around your eye
area now what we're going to do is kind
of try to get some color in the face now
and I'm going to be using a product from
bare minerals and this is the photon so
this is a um sort of just a bronzer
basically but it's a pretty deep
shade so I'm going to use a really
fluffy kabuki brush and I'm going to
just apply this you can see instantly
wear that color starts to show up I'm
gonna apply it on my forehead down my
nose I just kind of want to overall just
bronze up the look a little bit this has
a little bit of shimmer in it but it's
not like a dramatic amount if you want
just a light dusting just if you feel
like well you want to tan up your skin a
little bit more you know maybe grab
another bronzer I have my Milani um
powder bronzer in light and I'm just
going to swirl that a little bit and
just kind of swirl all over this is an
entirely matte powder as far as Carey's
cheeks go generally speaking she's got a
really pretty um sort of peachy flush to
them but it's not like a real harsh
contour or anything else has been done
there so I'm going to be using my
everyday minerals blush and snuggle
which is a pretty kind of light apricot
peach shade and just going to get some
of that on my brush and applied it here
on my cheeks and just gives us that
really pretty peachy glow that carrie
has all right guys the first thing I
applied to my eyes was my L'Oreal
decrease I primer I kind of just used
that interchangeably with my Too Faced
shadow insurance so either one seems to
be working pretty well for me most of
the time so then I'm going to grab my a
new palette that i got from physicians
formula and it is a smoky hazel eyes
custom I enhancing shadow and liner and
I realized I have brown eyes but for
some reason the colors and the smoky
hazel eyes just kind of caught my eye
more and I don't have as many of them I
like this burgundy shade down here so
anyway I'm going to take to put all over
my lid this second shade from the top
here it's kind of just a sort of golden
a light champagne shade
and so I'm going to pack that on my elf
I shadow brush and just apply that all
over my lid it seems like in I mean
things it does vary from picture to
picture but for the most part um carries
I shadow isn't too terribly intense but
it's the liner and the lashes that
really bring out her eyes so this
eyeshadow look is really going to be not
too difficult and not too involved but
um it will give us a nice frame for the
the lashes and all all the rest so just
apply that all over your lid just a nice
sparkly shade there and then I can find
my brush I'm going to take the shade
that's second from the bottom this
burgundy color and I'm going to use my
um this coastal scents brush and I don't
have the name readily available but it
is just the perfect size little of
crease brush here and it's so soft and
dense and I'm going to dip it in that
sort of burgundy shade and just run that
in my crease here and just going
basically covering the entire crease
from end to end with that just warming
it up a little bit and keeping it kind
of you know natural there maybe put a
little bit more on the outer half okay
and then we're going to go in for this
black shade all the way at the bottom
and this we're going to use kind of
sparingly we're going to keep actually a
really light touch the shade can do a
lot more than we're going to do with it
for this look but I'm going to take my
fine crease brush my really small one
from essence of beauty and get a little
bit on your brush and just deepen up the
outer half ever so slightly carry in um
a lot of just normal pictures doesn't
have a huge big outer V going on but
there is a little depth there so we're
just going to deepen that up
ever so slightly and like I said that
black shade can definitely do more than
we're doing with it right now but we
want to keep it diffused here okay so
just like so and then another
interesting thing i've noticed after
kind of doing my homework here she
doesn't do a lot with like a bold
shimmery shade up at the top so i'm just
going to use that same shade that I used
all over the lid get a really light
amount on a really fluffy brush I'm
going to use my Smashbox number 10 so it
doesn't get too concentrated anywhere
and just apply that shade along the brow
bone area there and just blending out
the borders of the other colors we apply
all right now for liner this is just a
real one characteristic thing of Kerry's
looks um liner is just ever-present in
what you see here and so I'm going to
take my Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black black seems to be her
shade on the eyes so I'm taking that
from inner corner to outer corner and
I'm not necessarily making this the
thinnest line I've ever made I'm kind of
making it just a little bit thicker we
are going to be laying some false lashes
on top so that can if you do do a little
thicker line in anticipation of false
eyelashes that can help you out because
you won't see that band as much when you
lay it down okay so going back to the
outer side and we are going to wing it
out a little bit she does have a little
bit of a a wing to look and that's
partially created by the eyelashes but
partially also by the liner so just
going to fill that in there
and there you go there is your upper
liner and just correct any little
mistakes there um like I said thick
black that's kind of the key there and
then for lower liner gonna be using a
little different technique I'm going to
be doing some water line or work and I
do like the mineral where talc free a
mineral eyeliner pencil and ultra black
from physicians formula I just feel like
this is really gentle it hasn't caused
any like watering in my eyes because you
guys know I'm not one that typically
puts liner in the water line but this
just doesn't cause any irritation or
anything like that so and it stays on
really well so I just like how soft it
is one thing with Revlon Colorstay is
that it's not the softest liner you know
it stays a super long time but it's also
you know not it doesn't have a ton of
moisture in it and that's part of the
reason why it stays so we're going all
the way to the inner corner here just
like that and then on the outer corner
um go ahead and go on your natural lash
line just for the outer part and blend
it down like that and I realize that
won't look like it's really fitting in
right at this moment but we're going to
take this handy blender tip that comes
on the end of this which is one reason
why I like it so much and just blend
that outer portion there just blend it
out it's going to kind of add to the
shape of our I there on the outer corner
so one more liner technique I've just
kind of picked up it's amazing what you
can pick up if you really start looking
over all at a person's makeup I mean you
can figure out a lot of patterns that
they they use the you know you might
might not think about otherwise we're
going to come back to the eyeshadow
palette now I'm going to be taking this
sort of silvery shade right here it's
probably the second darker
just shade in the palette and I'm going
to take my Coastal Scents tackle on
liner brush angled brush that I love so
much and I'm going to go over what I've
done there and this is staying on our
natural lash line and just apply that
here this crew will create a nice fade
out from that stark black that is on the
waterline so just apply that all over
there fade it down even more I'm going
to take this taupe shade right in the
middle of the palette here get some of
that on your liner brush and just go
under that all and we know the lashes
are a big part of Kerry's look as well
just like the liner so I'm going to curl
my top lashes hold it there for 15
seconds and i'm going to apply on my
mineral wear mascara which I got the bat
liner i've been using free with this
mascara animan applied that this is an
ultra black as well i'm gonna apply it
on the top and bottom lashes and then
i'm going to put on my revlon fantasy
lengths defining lashes so that's not
the most intense false eyelashes that i
have of those self adhesives but i can
apply those using my own glue since i am
using them kind of over and over again
and i will return to show you the
finished look okay guys just one more
thing I wanted to make note of Kerry's
lower lashes though they look thick they
don't look super long my lower lashes
for some odd reason are kind of long so
what I'm doing instead of taking my
mascara one and running it the entire
length of the lower lashes I'm kind of
just putting it on the top part of them
where they are coming off of my eyelid
and concentrating the mascara there to
get the thickness but I'm not running it
out the entire length of the lashes and
that's how we're getting that thick ok
guys here is my finished Carrie
Underwood makeup tutorial now i realize
i'm not blonde i don't have her eyebrows
and all that but
it really is just it look utilizing the
same techniques from what I can tell
from looking at a lot of her pictures
overall again it's a matte flawless face
look the emphasis is really on the eyes
in terms of eyeliner and mascara and
then the lips are kept pretty neutral
usually it's a light peachy pinky nude
gloss i'm using a shade called pearly
pink from palladio it's a brand
available at sally beauty supply and
it's just a let pretty light peachy
shade I'm it's a plump and shine herbal
plumping lip gloss but it really doesn't
plump that much but it's just it just is
right along the lines of her look there
and now carrie has really short short is
in short this way eyebrows and they're
pretty thin as well so minor kind of a
little bit thicker and kind of long
across my face so um you know you're not
getting the exact same look there but in
terms of the liner the mascara and all
that I think this is pretty true to what
she does on a regular basis with her
makeup so I hope you guys like this look
