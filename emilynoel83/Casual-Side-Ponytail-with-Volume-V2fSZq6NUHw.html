ponytail today in a very casual and
super quick and easy to do way there are
a lot of different you know intricate
things you can do to make this style a
little more complex or whatever but this
I think is the most basic way to do a
ponytail or you've got it you know all
nice and pulled over here but you've
also got some volume up here you know
how do you create that how do you keep
it so you know it will last throughout
the day so hopefully if you follow the
techniques in this video you will be
able to recreate this style as well so
if you want to see how I put it together
keep on watching your stuff I will just
run you through the things you need and
you'll want to have a rat tail comb some
sort of a fine-tooth comb and if you
like to use this into sort of boost up
any teased areas in your hair this will
help otherwise sometimes i like to use
one of these pins you can find these
sally beauty supply or probably most
drug stores but these little pins are
really useful for smoothing out here
that's been teased or kind of bumping it
up a little bit so one of those might be
a good idea you want a couple of bobby
pins if you choose to wrap your ponytail
up so the elastic band isn't showing a
small elastic band I usually just use
one of these smallish black ones and
then some hairspray would be a good idea
as well lately pretty much the only
hairspray I've been using is the
Tresemme tray two extra hold and this is
just my travel when I have in my makeup
bag since i'm not usually I'm not
sitting where I usually do my hair but
that's okay anyway what we're first
going to do you got your hair down here
we want to get a little volume going in
the crown so if you want your bangs
parted on the side you know or wherever
go ahead and kind of make that
determination now and so I want my bangs
over here on the side and then I'm going
to kind of take my comb back behind that
area and sort of section off some hair
right up here in the crown and that is
the area that I'm going to be teasing a
little bit so just kind of grab it all
up there it's
as if you were going to do a half-up
half-down style and this is the part
that would be half up okay so I'm just
lifting that up and then right on the
back side of what I've pulled up I'm
going to take my hair spray and just
spritz it a couple times then I'm going
to take my comb and just kind of pull
down teasing the hair just slightly back
there so for some people's hair it may
take more or less depending on kind of
how much texture your hair has also
something i didn't quite touch on was if
you want your hair curly for this i
would curl it ahead of time and you can
always try curling your ponytail after
but and sometimes it's a little hard to
get two layered pieces if you have
layered hair so anyway now I've got it
up there you can see it's kind of wild
and crazy probably don't want to leave
it that way so I'm going to take my
little pin and that's useful for just
kind of toning it down a little bit to
the level I want so as you can see since
you've kind of got it back there in a
chunk you want to sort of pull it down
to the sides so you've got a good shape
almost like if you wanted to wear your
hair down this way you could get away
with it okay so once you've got that
it's kind of you know it's it's somewhat
loose I mean we haven't obviously fixed
the hair back in any way but I'm still
going to go ahead and spray it because I
like the shape I've got going on now and
this will help it stay in that shape and
maintain that shape when I pull it into
a ponytail now we're at the point where
you want to find your ponytail holder
and either you know if you want to do
this in the center of the back of your
head that's fine I lately have been
liking to do the side ponytails and
that's what I've been getting questions
about so um what I've been enjoying
lately is kind of keeping my ears
actually covered up somewhat so just
kind of pulling my hair back like this
and just kind of pull all your hair to
one side and how it naturally sits there
is sort of the appearance it's going to
have I'm pulling my hair in the ponytail
sort of below my ear kind of just behind
my jaw right here so you kind of have to
you know work your arm flexibility here
but pull that hair
back get it in the ponytail and I just
actually with these smaller elastic
bands just go kind of two times around
it because you kind of start working it
in there any tighter you're going to
lose all the fullness you had in your
crown so now that I've got that ponytail
in there what I'm going to do is take my
little pin again and sort of go around
and kind of boost up the hair one more
time just boosting it up in the back I
used to have another strategy I did
where I kind of actually pulled the hair
back in the half-up half-down fixed it
with bobby pins and that's a really good
long wearing thing but I think the key
here for this look is a little more
casual if you have shorter type bangs or
any kind of layer you want to pull out
on the side you definitely can you can
leave these loose or sometimes just for
you know to lessen the annoyance factor
of having my bangs in my face sometimes
just a light spritz of hairspray will do
it to keep them just back there and out
of your way so now yeah you basically
got it you don't have any real excess
and you know pins or anything else going
on you've got the volume eyes hair and
like I said that'll take more or less on
teasing and hairspray depending on how
your hair is sometimes this is a good
hairstyle if you're like you know not
washing your hair every single day and
you're on that second day and it has a
little more texture to it but my hair
was just kind of curled a little bit
like sort of curled under barely so it's
kind of that in-between point from all
the way straight and totally curly now
to just wrap it around your ponytail I
have done a tutorial showing how to do
this before but here's all my hair in
the ponytail I'm going to find a
somewhat you know long to medium length
piece on the underside and okay I found
it it's going to be this piece and so
I'm just going to wrap that piece around
my little elastic band there it's going
to be kind of hard to show you but I've
wrapped it until there's almost no
little tail left so yeah it's all the
way around the ponytail holder then I
just take these
bobby pins and crisscross them right
underneath again i'm sorry i don't like
have a you know a ponytail cam where i
can like show you exactly how this is
working but like i said i do have
another tutorial where this is done and
more in more detail but yeah that's
basically your look guys it's so easy to
pull off it's great for a casual look
great for second day hair but it at the
same time you look finished and
interesting so thank you so much for
tuning in for this video hope you
enjoyed it and have a wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
