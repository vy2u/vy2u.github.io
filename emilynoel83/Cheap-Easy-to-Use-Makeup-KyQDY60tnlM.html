for this video this is all about cheap
and easy makeup products and I mean that
in the most positive way possible I'm
talking about makeup that you can get at
the drugstore that is not gonna cost you
a fortune and it's also very easy to use
and by that I mean like you know it
application is fairly easy it's easy to
blend it doesn't take a lot of like
painstaking process to make it work for
you you know what I mean
so I feel like sometimes you know makeup
is fun and when you have the time to
play around with it you know you can
really experiment with a lot of
different things but I know there are a
lot of people that are out there looking
for convenience and looking for
something that is very cost effective as
well so hopefully I give you some
solutions here I got about 11 different
products I'm going to talk about so I
better get started first off with face
makeup one foundation that I think is
one of my favorites from the drugstore I
think it does work for most skin types I
mean I feel like I've heard from people
with drier skin that like to use this
foundation my mom who is in her 60s
enjoys this foundation and also you know
me who has more like combination skin
this works well for me also and I feel
like it is super easy to blend whether
it's with your fingers or if you like to
use a brush this is really great and
it's the Rimmel lasting finish
foundation I've talked about this for a
while and I feel like that should kind
of say something the fact that this this
product is not new to me it's something
I've been using and kind of in my
foundation rotation for a long time it
used to be a 16-hour formula and now it
is a 25-hour formula but to tell you the
truth I haven't noticed a difference and
the ingredients on the ingredient
listing is pretty much identical so I
kind of don't like that they did that
because it's like okay I don't feel like
you changed it to the stuff at all you
just slept 225 on it maybe they just
realized it works for 25 hours not 16
but they wanted to top all those 24 hour
foundations I guess but regardless of
the claims I feel like this is a truly
long wearing foundation but for the
point of this video it's also
very easy to wear super easy to blend
and like I mean you can put it on with
your fingers very easily and not have
any issues so it's nice because while it
is a long wearing foundation it doesn't
get dry too quickly that's the one
complaint I might have about like the
Revlon Colorstay love that foundation
but it can get a little bit dry as
you're trying to put it on and if you're
the type that likes to kind of dot it
all over your face and then start at
point a and end all the way over here
you know it may be a little too dry for
you to do that so this this works really
well and I think it's good even if
you're beginning with foundation I next
up a concealer that I think is very easy
to use I'm talking about the dream
mousse concealer from Maybelline I love
this I use this daily pretty much on my
under eye area I you guys know me I work
a very very early morning shift I'm
waking up at 1:30 1:30 a.m. to get ready
for my day and I don't always get all
the sleep I need so I do need a very
good concealer for under-eye and I feel
like this works really well I feel like
this is more pigmented and a little more
creamy than like the dream mousse
foundation and I the reason why I think
is so easy to apply is a it's another
product you can just use with your
fingers you know you don't need a fancy
tool for it and also it doesn't take a
lot of building up to get the coverage
you want like I get a little bit on my
finger I tap it in I kind of use that
patting motion to get it around my eye
and then I'm good I don't feel like I
need to keep going back again and again
to build up coverage so easy quick and
definitely cheap that's from the
drugstore next up another Maybelline
product I've been getting questions more
and more about people wanting a powder
foundation something in a compact not
like necessarily a mousse mineral
foundation which can be you know really
great but at the same time tough to
travel with and a little less convenient
to toss in your purse but you know
people wanting a powder with a little
more coverage first off I would also say
in addition to what I'm going to mention
here the L'Oreal True Match press
powders have a nice amount of coverage
not quite as much as this which is the
Maybelline pure state powder foundation
this has an SPF 15 in it so that's great
because sometimes people rely on their
foundation to contain their sunscreen so
this has that um I've used mine quite a
bit actually and I'm surprised I haven't
thought to necessarily mention this a
whole lot in my videos but it works
really well he has nice matte coverage
and it just I mean it does help to
control shine and if you're looking for
something I think powder foundations
like this aren't extremely easy to use
if you just want to apply a little
concealer skip liquid foundation and
just go for this I mean you can do that
so by nature powder foundations are
simple to use but this one gives you
good coverage that you don't have to
work a lot to achieve another face
product I think is very easy and very
multi-purpose to have in your collection
and talked about these before it's the
shimmer strips by Physicians Formula
this one that I have is in Waikiki strip
which is a peachy glow bronzer but as
you can see it's definitely got
highlighter shades up here as well and
then you got more bronzer type colors at
the bottom these could all work as
eyeshadows but I just love the fact that
you could also just kind of swirl your
brush over all this and give your face
that all-over kind of tan glow um that's
still something you probably want as we
head into fall right now as well so I
just think this is super easy I think
it's easier than carrying around a lot
of different products you got
highlighter you got bronzer here you've
got just a way to perk up your face and
once again it's not it's it's probably
on the higher expense level of drugstore
makeup Physicians Formula is but this is
nice because you're getting multiple
functions in one and it's very easy to
just sweep your brush across it and give
your face some color
next up talking about I makeup and I'm
gonna talk about three different eye
palettes one is smoky one is neutral and
one has a little bit of color and I'm
specifically recommending these because
I think they are easy to use easy how to
figure out how you want to use them like
where to put each of the colors that's
fair
goof proof and also they're very
blendable very easy to blend not all
drugstore eye shadows are that easy to
blend but I feel like these are starting
out with the smokey kit I don't think
you're going to be too surprised here
let's all say it together
covergirl draw my eyes everyone I mean
if you want cheap drugstore I mean and
and buy cheap I'm not trying to say
cheap too to diminish the quality of
these products at all inexpensive
whatever you know but this is not costly
and these colors are great they blend so
easily I mean to swatch them for you
this black is intense but it can blend
and it blends very easily and I feel
like we can all kind of look at these
shades and I've done tutorials with this
before but you can kind of think about
how you might use those okay I might put
the silver on my lid or maybe a little
bit in the corner you know smudge the
black up into the crease and or you can
do the same with that Burgundy and kind
of blend it up above the darker shade
and give yourself some warmth as you get
closer to your brow I mean I don't feel
like it's that hard to figure out how to
use that palette and at the same time
the colors are very blendable so that's
my pick for smokey I think it's
wonderful and if you had that palette
you can get a smokey eye any day of the
week and you can even make it look a
little different each time you wanted to
wear it next for a neutral palette that
I really like this is one that I haven't
been trying as long but I know I
definitely like it um for what I've
tried a bit so far and it's the
Maybelline stylish smoke squad in
natural smokes and what you're getting
here is a couple of great kind of
metallic shades there at the top you've
got a white matte shade and a matte dark
dark brown I feel like I've tried all of
these quads now and I think this one is
the easiest to work with in terms of how
all these shades work together and
figuring out how to use them I think
that's a very self-explanatory but also
they're they're very blendable that
matte Brown is super dark but super easy
to work with I promise you another thing
that makes the Maybelline palettes easy
is that they do label each
section lid crease outer corner and brow
bone and that is a pretty good default
way to use this although you can't
definitely switch it up leave only use
two shades you know use three out of
four I don't care but the colors are
nicely pigmented easy to blend and very
very give you a very very nice look and
a smoky look if you want it to be you
know this could definitely be a neutral
smoky palette or leave out the dark
brown and just keep it more natural you
have lots of options here but it's very
easy to use an inexpensive next up for a
palette that I haven't talked about at
least on here yeah I might have tweeted
about it or something but it's a palette
that can give you some color that I
think is one of those you know
no-brainer palettes and it's from
covergirl and it's called ice princess
and this has some interesting shades of
like blueish lavender and I have created
some eye looks that I really enjoy with
this you've got a kind of like a deep
fish purpley blue see how it's almost a
little bit metallic there and a gorgeous
kind of like purple periwinkle shade and
then a couple of lighter colors and you
can easily understand what you might do
with this you know darker colors in the
corner and the crease this shade is
absolutely beautiful all over the lid
and kind of like if you take it down a
little bit under your lower liner or
smudge it in there it looks awesome so I
was kind of pleasantly surprised by this
palette had never tried it until maybe a
month or so ago and I've been really
happy with it so if you're looking for
something with some pretty purpley Blues
very simple to eat to use once again
similar ability to blend that the drama
eyes palette gives you as just you can
get a that light ice princess look as
the name of that palette might imply but
you can be a little more dramatic with
that - couple more eye things to talk
about if you're starting out trying to
get a good liquid liner for your upper
lashline Physicians Formula I define our
felt-tip eye marker and I don't have it
on me because I ran out but the Revlon
Colorstay
liner pin is very similar to the
so both are good but using something
like this and I'm marker where you can
you know you have that control to draw
that line I think you know you might
find it easier as you're starting to use
have how to learn liquid liner learn how
to use liquid liner that's right I've
been too much talking today already but
anyway I think explore the world of
liner pins you may find one that you
really like and a tip that was passed on
to me which I definitely agree with if
you can store these tip down like this
you will I think increase the longevity
of this product so it won't dry out as
much all that product will run towards
the tip and when you use it it won't be
dry so ease the eye product to use I've
got to throw in a mascara that I feel
like is fairly um something you don't
have to keep going over and over again
and again whether it be for more coats
or to get rid of clumps people in the
matting we all have mascaras we like and
don't like I understand if you don't
really like this mascara but for me this
has only gotten better the more I've
used it and it's the voluminous carbon
black mascara recently recommended this
to my friend Kaylee and she used it and
she said I can tell I'm gonna like this
mascara and that's kind of the way it is
it's got a nice big brush and I feel
like this is easy because you put some
of this on and it's like okay there are
my lashes now I don't feel like I have
to keep going over and over to build up
a lot more volume because you get a lot
of volume the first time you put it on
people might argue that this product you
know maybe it puts too much product on
your lashes but as I've used it it's
dried out a bit and there's gotten to be
a little less product there and I think
it's right about now it is at the
perfect it's at its peak moment this
mascara is for me so it's like I put
some on I don't have to keep going over
it it gives instant volume to my
eyelashes and I just don't have to keep
you know messing with it over and over
again like some mascara
I feel like I do like I either need to
put on tons of coats or I need to keep
trying to get clumps out so it's a crazy
story with mascara but now we're going
to move on to lip products just a couple
more things to talk about okay you want
to talk about easy to use the Jumbo lip
pencils from NYX hello
all those jumbo eye pencils they get so
much love these need the love too
because these are easy easy to use this
one is called chestnut I love this color
and I tell you it's like they are so
creamy and you put them on you can
define your lips with sort of like a lip
liner because this is more obviously
more tapered than a lipstick is so you
get a little more definition but you
also can put it on so quickly so much
more quickly than you could filling your
entire lips in with a lip liner so it's
just so easy to use you have tons of
control it's so creamy I mean I pretty
much have said it all about this product
it's great you should really check these
out
cherry culture calm if you don't have
access to an Ulta store that's selling
NYX or another drugstore that's selling
NYX look into it they're really awesome
and finally I got to talk about a tinted
lip balm I talked about these a while
ago I haven't really discussed them very
much since then but I still love them
every bit as much and usually one is in
my purse and it's the Palladio herbal
tinted lip balms these are so good guys
I mean you've got the typical totally
typical lip balm format here nothing
unusual about you know twists up from
the bottom
there's your product but this gives you
color like you're not just seeing this
in thinking oh that looks like that
would make my lips kind of a berry color
it will I mean it will give you sheer
color this shade is actually called
berry and look at that sheer you know
wash of color you get there it feels
very moisturizing very you know easy to
put on bronzy pink one of the first ones
I got kind of a neutral very pretty and
then they have some light shades as well
cotton candy kind of like that soft
light pink
you can kind of see it there I love that
each of these has you know it has
pigment it has color there are even more
shades by the way that you can pick from
but Sally beauty supply look for those
they're possibly your alte store as well
but some of them have shimmers some of
them are just creamy but no matter the
case they're very easy to put on and not
have to think too much about it so there
you go guys those are my cheap and easy
makeup products easy to use inexpensive
I hope you like this list and let me
know what your favorite products like
this are I think adding your thoughts to
the comments section will help everyone
that's out looking for this type of
product so thanks a lot for tuning in
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
