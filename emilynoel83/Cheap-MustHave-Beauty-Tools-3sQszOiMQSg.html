this video this is going to be a really
good video for people who are just
starting to build their collection who
want to know what sorts of makeup tools
do i need aside from the makeup and the
brushes but in and really other typical
makeup tools but i'm going to show you
just some other little things that are
very very inexpensive some of the
cheapest things you'll buy that or
makeup related but their beauty tools
that will just kind of help you along
and make things a little bit easier for
you as you do your makeup so i'll get to
that in a moment but first i wanted to
address a change that's been made here
on youtube and all of the channels i
guess by now have been switched over to
the beta format which is basically if
you're watching it on my channel now you
can see the change but and it's you've
got a video playing right there sort of
kind of in the middle of your screen
it's surrounded by a little squirrely
thing with some videos on it then
everything else is like down below it's
different from the from the old one
definitely and it just kind of it I
guess the point of it is to make it so
you don't have to go outside that page
really to see anything that is on that
channel you know you never go to a
separate page so I've had people tell me
you know i don't really like this you
know i want to be able to see kind of
like all the videos laid out there and i
kind of like that too always knowing
that like my nine newest videos were you
know i was going to have those in my
little lower box here but i have
discovered something that you might be
interested to know here if you are
looking to be able to like access all
the videos in kind of a big full screen
format go to the upper right-hand corner
of like a person's channel page and
you'll see a little on screen that looks
like kind of a grid and if you put your
mouse over it it will say switch to grid
view click that and then click it'll
change screens for you and then it'll
say uploads and then a number click that
and then it will take you to a screen
that you can just scroll right through
every video kind of like full screen
mode every video will be listed there
and
actually kind of neat because that that
option wasn't there with the old way but
it is there now so you can like just you
don't have to go to any separate pages
it's not like page one two three four
five they're all there you can just
scroll through so of course after you
watch this video you can try that it but
on another thing I wanted to do a little
announcement here I wanted to give a
shout out to April Woodward she is a fan
on the beauty broadcast facebook page
and she says that her mom has been in
the hospital recently with h1n1 us or
swine flu and so I want to give a little
shout out for her and I hope her and her
mom are doing well now she had said that
it's kind of you know tough to deal with
that and and everything else in her life
and she said that they like to watch the
videos and it was kind of uplifting to
them so I wanted to say thank you and I
hope you guys are doing well I hope you
start to feel better soon and hope
everybody's you know anybody that's out
there dealing with this that's out from
school or off from work because they're
dealing with the flu whether it's just
regular seasonal flu or h1n1 I certainly
hope you make a recovery soon so going
off of that I guess my first little tool
that I'm going to talk about is actually
hand sanitizer I'm just something to
have in your makeup bag I mean I keep a
full-size here at home like just right
here in my makeup area this is the
morning fresh germ x which actually
smells quite good but like a little a
little hand sanitizer would be
especially useful in a circumstance
where you couldn't wash your hands so
keep it in a makeup bag or a purse and
before you start doing touch-ups getting
your hands all over your face near your
mouth maybe you're in your eyes and have
some of that hand sanitizer there so you
can use some of that if you don't have
access to a sink wherever you might be
touching up your makeup so that's one
thing and other things i'm going to
start off with a couple nail products
that are again very cheap but very
useful one of these nail buffers has a
bunch of different steps on i think this
is like a seven-way nail buffer they
have these where they're like little
blocks and it's like I think four
different steps that they have that's
probably all
but this is the one I had and these are
really really good for just if you don't
have time to do a full-out manicure but
you do want them to be buffed and kind
of shiny this has all those little steps
and you know in just a minute you can
get through them all and make your nails
look good and natural and healthy
without having to go through the steps
of waiting for polish to dry so in with
nail buffers I mean some people may be
familiar with this but some people might
not when you use these you can actually
get a really nice shine on your nail
from using a nail buffer so these are
you know just a bit going to be
available at your local drugstore
anything I talk about here I believe
should be available at your local
drugstore so no big expense there at all
also for my nails I had some questions
about what these nails are these are um
I actually have them right over here
these are the nailing so natural chip
proof it says three times longer wear
more comfort more natural and they are
trying to see if there's actually a name
there for these these are a short length
square shape and the number is seven
1000 right there but these are really
really nice they are on just yet you
just put them on with glue and I think
they look just you know like you would
have gone somewhere and gotten them done
at a salon or something they just have
held up now I put them on on Saturday
they're still going strong now I had one
pinky nail pop off the other day but I
just put it on with some more glue and
we're doing good so I think they they're
nice because there's so many different
sizes that can fit your nail and in my
experience with nails like this the
better the fit on your nail and the
longer they'll stay on that I do like
the Revlon runway collection for some of
those that have the neat designs on them
but for just a natural just general
French manicured look these are really
neat they're from nailin so I just
wanted to say that that's not is not in
with my beauty basic must have thing
here but just wanted to mention that
because I got some questions another
thing are these little they're called
orange woods
sticks and you can find these in any
nail department but they're going to
have a pointy tip on one end and sort of
a flat tip on the other and these are
going to be great for pushing your
cuticles back getting in under your
nails and cleaning them out and they're
just super cheap very great to have in
your manicure kit there for hair these
little pins see that these are the ideal
tool for me for after I've teased my
hair and I want to like tone it down and
smooth it out you can find these at
Sally's sally beauty supply I'm sure any
Walmart store in the hair section I'm
not sure what the technical name for
these is either than hairpin but yeah
they look like this they might have some
little bumps or ridges right here on
this side but you can kind of bend them
to make them however you want but
basically after you tease your hair like
in the morning if i do it like i've got
a little bit of you know body I've
created for myself but I go over it and
you get this is how you get the smooth
look on top of anything you've teased
you know you're supposed to tease
underneath and then all the hair falls
over it it looks super smooth and great
but we all know that it doesn't always
turn out that way and you need to
sometimes smooth it out and a comb can
kind of undue too much of the work that
you've done but you can find this and
see how I'm just going to go under and
give my if I wanted more lift anywhere
here you're able to work in with that
teased area and boost it up again the
sponge tip applicator I tell you they
really can work well I did a whole
tutorial I did the sponge tip applicator
challenge where I said hey guys let's
just all do a tutorial or a video with
just the sponge tips and you'll be
surprised at how well they do work for
you when I am just looking to pat color
on and keep it very concentrated and
very confined to one area on my eyelid
these are fine they come in you know
your little containers of you know
individual shadows sometimes from the
drugstore and you can also find them
packaged separately but just don't
necessarily just throw them out just
because you think all you need is
brushes because these can be nice nice
for travel as well or just on the go
thing so keep those in mind they can
also be great for if you don't have that
little itty bitty detail brush that I
talked about using to get the color
right on the
Corner these can work great there or you
can use these for things other than I
shadow like padding in some concealer
like right in there under your eye or
like a powder to set your concealer
think about it are the cheap little
brushes that come with your blush and
are these practical for blush no I do
not use these for blush but I do keep
them because they can be good elsewhere
on your face you know how people talk
about fan brushes really lightweight fan
brushes being great for like swiping off
any fallout or any like if if mask it
you've been put on your mascara sums
flaking down you want to get it off you
know you can just real quickly take a
swipe with a fan brush well sometimes
fan brushes aren't readily available to
everyone and sometimes they're kind of
hard to store too so these little guys
are very lightweight you know it'll
flick away anything under your eye or if
you wanted to use these little brushes
as just a smaller sized brush to you
know apply some setting powder to your
concealer or getting in and around these
small areas i mean i think we
instinctively think you know there has
to be a special brush for everything but
sometimes it's these little random
brushes that can be the key to you know
just something that you need to fill
that one special need that you might
have it old on mascara wands if you've
gotten to the end of your mascara tube
and you want to maybe hold onto the
brush just clean it off clean off with
some eye makeup remover or just you know
a face wash or whatever get it nice and
clean and this can make a great little
tool to just brush through your lashes
sometimes these work a little better
than the just the regular little lash
combs that come on those dual-sided like
eyebrow brush and lash combs these can
work a little better just to give you
some separation I didn't include my
eyelash curler in this because I goes
kind of thinking more than on
traditional beauty items to have on hand
that you might not instantly think about
but these elf shiny race erasers these
are a dollar on their website you get 50
blotting sheets in here and basically
what you get here open up this little
folder type thing and you have these
little sheets that you can just use
to blot over and collect any oil that
may have developed on your face
throughout the day you know it's going
to help with shine I actually pulled out
two by accident but anyway it's just
good to instead of taking on more powder
to take away your shine just blotting
it's not going to mess up your makeup
but it is going to get rid of the oil
just your traditional sponges are good
to have in your makeup collection if
you're starting out you're thinking I
don't have any sponges well you should
probably get some like these cosmetic
wedges I don't least came from dollar
tree these are things that you don't
have to go anywhere special to get them
you're going to find it at your dollar
store your drugstore there's no need for
this stuff to be high-end or you know
feel like you have to get it from a
certain brand or whatever absolutely not
these are little wedges they come all
kind of connected together and they're
fantastic for applying your foundation
whether or not I'll apply these with
foundation on a given day I will almost
always take one of these and after I've
applied my foundation I will blend right
around my hairline my jaw line my lips
my eyebrows and that's how you make sure
you're not getting that line of
demarcation all around your face so you
know your hairline your ears almost
everything you know these are great
little blenders so I would keep one of
those on hand at all times and another
thing at big lots i found these for
fifty cents and eighty cents some cool i
different sizes like these little guys
that are just you know real skinny and
you could fit those you know right in
around your eye area for concealer or
they have these that are more like the
flat kind of spongy variety so these are
just bargain bargain items by far some I
makeup remover obviously obvious choice
there you need to have that if you built
up your makeup collection never worn
makeup before but you got all the makeup
you do need to have this because you
will deal with residue in the morning or
at night you're going to probably have a
little something left over a little
special surprise to wake up to in the
morning
um and to go along with that you need
q-tips and q tips come in fun colors
they're inexpensive it's amazing how
much you can get for a very cheap cheap
price and i like to use just the
traditional q-tip to get in under your
eye and midday get rid of any residue
that might be down there at the end of
the day if you're touching up you know
q-tips are fantastic can't say anything
bad about q-tips and another good thing
to have are the pointed q-tips these you
might have to go to a beauty store to
get they may have them at your drugstore
but they definitely have them at your
sally beauty supply or your beauty first
and these are just little applicators
that have points at the end and these
can do a lot of different things you can
go over your eyeliner with them you can
smudge out you can get more precise
lines you can kind of finish lines if
you got out of your lip line and you
just want that more precise point than a
regular q-tip gives those are great and
I've tried to keep everything in this
video very very basic but there is
something that is sort of you know kind
of a new idea here that I wanted to pass
along and it's the Revlon makeup eraser
pen which is a good thing to have on the
go when maybe you don't want to carry
all your q-tips and your eye makeup
remover bottle with you and basically
this is like a little marker that writes
in I makeup remover and it's great for
just kind of cleaning up your under-eye
area but you do want to make sure you
have a Kleenex or at least one q-tip or
something to kind of absorb some of that
once you put it on there because you
don't want to just be sitting there with
that or else eventually everything will
run but it's good to it for that initial
removal and then wipe it off with
something else last but not least the
Altoids container I post this question
on my beauty broadcast facebook page not
too long ago which is facebook.com slash
beauty broadcast if you're not a fan yet
what can you do with altoids containers
for beauty related purposes and of
course there's tons of things but these
are great little travel tins for
anything you might have I put some floss
in here I've got my um like little hair
hair hair too
I elastic band things I've got my q-tips
I've got some bobby pins in there just I
mean it's amazing what you could fit in
one of these little guys and just pop it
in your purse or your suitcase or
whatever and it's just a really nice on
the Google container there so thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
video lots of little tips trying to keep
them all just super inexpensive and the
type of thing that maybe if you've just
built up your makeup collection it might
not have occurred to you so far to keep
some of these things on hand so thanks
so much for tuning in guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
