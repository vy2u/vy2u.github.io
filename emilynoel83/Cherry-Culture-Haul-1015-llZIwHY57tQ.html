cherry culture ho just recently got it
in and wanted to put together a video
for you haven't really tried many of
these products yet so this is just kind
of telling you what i have i got this
really cute amused mirror for two
dollars it is so adorable they had all
these different designs on the front
there and then it's got like a magnified
side and a regular side so great to just
have around in your purse for two bucks
next I got this 50 cent amused long I
pencil and metallic gold I just thought
for fifty cents geez and I didn't have
anything gold in the way of liner so I
thought that might be fun to do a look
with some time it's pretty creamy at
least it seems that way so far then i
got these kissy Kissy where single
eyeshadows and cappuccino and dove just
a dollar each i had one of these before
in like a creamy white color and i liked
it let me tell you that cappuccino color
it may not show up a lot on my hand
there but that is a really nice natural
contour shade next kleancolor juicy
gloss in red and beige two dollars a
piece just wanted to try these out I
haven't actually put them on my lips yet
but they've got some nice color to them
I've been looking for a good solid red
lip gloss and looks like that one might
do the trick next I have the NYX
eyeshadow trio in Lake moss wow talk
about three great colors for fall we've
got a plum shade a deep blue shade and
that third shade is actually like a
charcoal olive it's really unique never
seen a shade like it I know they all
just look kind of dark there on my hand
but three really pretty colors for sure
then just to have kind of a portable
smokey eye kit 550 these NYX palettes
this one white pearl silver and charcoal
and just don't you love NYX shadows I
mean they show up wonderfully well and
are long-lasting and I really like them
a lot
next I got these round lip glosses in
whipped and deep red they say NYX girls
on the invoice so I'm not sure what
that's all about but they're two dollars
each and that dark shade was a lot
darker than it showed up and the
swatches I've kind of got a problem with
the cherry color swatches light shade is
a gorgeous nude but I mean these
swatches it's you kind of need to look
it up like research your color on
youtube or somewhere else because it may
not be what you think it is next NYX
round lipstick and dull what a pretty
pink shade I did hit it on the mark with
this one because i love this rosy shade
but like i said a lot of those swatches
are really hard to tell what they are
this is a new palette i think starry
boutique colors and in the club
basically there are these palettes
different ones that have some really
vivid shades now these by the way these
swatches have all been without a primer
this one is as well so I was pretty
impressed without a primer how that's
actually turning out there on my hand so
we'll see how we like that starry jelly
lip balm and peach buck-fifty just
thought it was so cute on the packaging
I had to try it and it smells good too
next the starry rosehip lipgloss a
dollar and sixty cents this is kind of
thick it's a clear gloss it's very shiny
really I think I'm going to like that a
lot it has a nice rosy scent to it too
this is a new palette to I believe
starry shadow and blush palette and
pearl three dollars as you can see it
lifts up to have the blush underneath
here's the shadows some blues pink white
knights maroon shade and you have to
choose you can't actually see what's in
all these that's what I didn't like I
had to guess pearl means the outside
color of that palette that's what
determines what you get and you can't
see them all this was the one that I
could see so I chose it to real neutral
shades of blush there I'm not sure how
the pigmentation is going to be on this
it doesn't appear to be as good as is as
like NYX but who knows it was three
bucks so let's go for it right so um
thank you guys so much for tuning in for
this haul video i hope to review some of
these items or include them in tutorials
in the future and I appreciate your time
and I hope you guys have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
