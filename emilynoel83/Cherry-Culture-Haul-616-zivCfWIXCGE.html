culture hall on june sixteenth i'm going
to show you some of the items that i
just got but haven't tried yet so the
first item is the abuse six ultra shine
diamond shimmer powder now these are all
I shadows I believe and they come in six
different little compartments here with
little applicators that keep it from
getting all messy outside the container
and these are the swatches there
turquoise black baby pink baby blue
pearl and pink in that black color
they're all shivering except for the
black which is really mad and strong and
I really like that and this was only 299
and the next product is also from use it
was a dollar it's the flower lip gloss
tube with vitamin E and the flavor i got
was chewing them i thought that'd be fun
and if you look really closely here you
can see there's actually a little flower
that floats around inside i think that's
so cute such an adorable idea and the
next thing with the amuse fruit move
lipstick and lemon and strawberry fifty
cents each and on the website it will
tell you what color these little
lipsticks will actually change too so
you look at them as is and they just
look like kind of like toy lipsticks for
a kid or something but i just couldn't
help myself I had to put the strawberry
one on and it's actually a really pretty
kind of magenta color so it actually
does change from the color you see in
the two next I got the amused pearl
eyeshadow kid number two it's 499 and
this was recommended as an insider pick
on cherry culture calm so as you can see
quite a few different colors from
neutrals to colorful ones and I just
watched a few of them here and they
really aren't truly pearly shades
they're not necessarily a shimmery or
glittery but they just have a nice pearl
finish
it's going to be a fun one to play with
next I got the emu's tinted lip plumping
and raspberry for a dollar I already had
this in a nude shade and loved it and so
I think I'm gonna really enjoy this
shade as well it's just a pretty just as
the name implies it's a raspberry red
color just not too sticky really
comfortable to wear on your lips next I
got the kissy where single eyeshadow in
natural this was just a dollar and I
believe they have a lot of shades to
choose from and I just wanted a nice
highlighter shade and this comes off as
somewhere between bat and shimmer it's
just kind of a pearly I guess shade that
could be nice all over your lid or as a
highlight just a nice basic shape to
have now this is awesome it's the clay
colored nine color eye palette in Pixie
I got this for four dollars i already
had one of these in more neutral shades
and really liked it and now that they
have this one in stock i wanted to try
this too and i tell you you seriously
just touch your finger to these colors
you can see by the swatches they are so
pigmented of so much color comes off of
them and it's just going to be a really
fun selection of colors to do some cool
looks with so I'm excited about that
next I have the LA colors trio eyeshadow
for three dollars and I thought these
greens we're going to be a little more
vivid I think they look that way on the
website and they're nice but they're
come they sort of remind me of khaki
colors I guess they're metallic moss for
screen and see green and they're still
pretty but just not super bright which
may be good at times for a more subtle
look if you're going for that all right
next a couple of NYX eyeshadow trios
this one is in frosted lilac Pacific and
kiwi got it for 599 on
sharing culture calm and these are just
really nicely pigmented colors to work
with I have one of these pallets already
and there you can see the colors come
off really well look even brighter than
that in person but you don't have to
work very hard to get the color to come
off I know these are really popular for
a lot of people so I'm probably
preaching to the choir here when I say I
like this stuff but the next one is
another trio in golden rust and walnut
prawns and I just I that rust color is
kind of unique there in the middle I
don't really have anything like that
already so I thought this would could
make some really pretty bronzy looks you
know you picture bronze skin in a pretty
bronze I like this could be a really
nice look for summertime and even fall
you kind of picture those sorts of
colors so definitely expects of
tutorials on this and feel free to
request if any of these items are really
interesting you this is the NYX jumbo
eye shadow pencil and pots and pans got
it for 299 I already had a few of these
and this is just a nice silvery shade so
it'll be good and you know as a base or
alone if I want to you can see the color
comes off really creamy on these I know
these are a very popular item among the
lot of you here on YouTube so next we
have the NYX round lipstick I got four
shades there harmonica femme Indian pink
and Ernie's or her DS they're only 99
cents each and I just kind of took a
guess from some of the colors I liked on
the website because it's kind of hard to
tell what you're actually going to get
but that first color harmonica is very
light and I think that third color / is
Indian pink is going to be probably one
of my favorites of this bunch kind of a
neutral warm coral shade and next I got
another product I never tried before
it's NYX tinted lip spa in spirit I got
this from 399 and the color on this is
going to be pretty sheer but i think
it's just going to be one of those good
for your lips lip gloss lip balm type
things and as you can see the color is
very subtle very neutral but it'll just
be and be nice to wear from time to time
take a break from the lipstick in the
heavy lip gloss and then for a dollar
sixty i got this starry kiss me lip
plumping in dude number three and this
doesn't have a lot of color to it it's
basically clear but it's a really
popular thing on cherry culture they
just got it back in stock so thank you
so much for watching this haul video I
hope you enjoyed it if you're interested
in in these items you can find it on
cherry culture calm
