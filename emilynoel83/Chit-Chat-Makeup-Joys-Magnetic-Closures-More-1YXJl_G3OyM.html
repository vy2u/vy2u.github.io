of a different type of video I've gone
back and forth on whether to do this I
thought maybe people won't get it and
then ultimately it just kept coming back
into my mind so I thought I need to do
this and these are little aspects about
my makeup routine that just really make
me happy these are truly like little
things when I start talking about them
you're gonna be like oh these things
don't really apply to like how something
looks on my face or anything like that
but it's more about the actual process
and the experience of doing makeup every
day and that's an experience that I
really appreciate and I don't see it as
a burden I never have even when I was
waking up at 1:00 in the morning to get
up and do the news
I still saw doing my makeup is something
that I got to do rather than something I
had to do and that continues even to
this day you know having a child
I still like look forward to getting to
sit down and be surrounded by the makeup
and you know have the chance to do that
and I really think of these little
things that I'm gonna talk about I would
call them gratitude triggers they are
little bitty things that I do and any
time I do them it really triggers a
thought in my mind of I'm so grateful
that I'm doing this right now you're
grateful that I'm able grateful just to
be here in this moment right now really
is those little things that put you
right back in that present moment hence
this little card that some of you have
seen in the background of my videos I
made this years ago it was something
Oprah said be present live in the
current moment be fully here with
whatever you're doing not anticipating
and worrying about the things that are
going to happen not stewing about the
things that already have happened and we
can all get caught up in that and I get
that way too I'm very much a person who
anticipates or gets a little nervous
about something that I know I'm gonna
have to do but if I can stay rooted in
what's currently happening that's where
I'm happiest and that's where my
thinking is the most clear I know this
is a it's getting really deep for a
makeup video but it's appreciating the
little things it's enjoying the
experience it's not just doing makeup
for the finished look which is great you
know it's great to have that end result
but for me just as much as that I enjoy
just putting the stuff on and going
through the process kind of reminds me
of my dad and
way he is with golf he'll talk about how
he just likes the sound of the club
hitting the baller the smell of the
grass or all these little things and
that's really what it's all about when
you love something so the first thing
that I've got to tell you about the most
pleasing thing the most happy little
make up thing is a magnetic lip stick
closure I mean oh that hell how how is
it so amazing but it is this is an Estee
Lauder pure color envy lipstick these
are some of the best so this is
impulsive this is a great light pink
shade but regardless of what color you
have that magnetic closure hmm I just
love the way it feels in my hand the
weight of the product the snapshot
there's something so satisfying about
that and I have other like palettes and
things that have a magnetic closure on
them but there's nothing quite as
satisfying as the magnetic closure
lipstick second thing that really gets
me going into really one of the first
things I do when I enter this room it's
turning on this light this vanity light
behind me there's this little like metal
knob and it has just a little bit of
resistance as you turn it and then ping
you hear this little tick and my lights
come on and I just I love that feeling
this was a mirror that I remember Tyler
got for me as a gift back when we were
in our last house shortly after we moved
I think it was it might have been like
2010 2011 or something like that
and I have loved this mirror so much and
it just makes me feel good every time I
turn that little knob I think about it
every time here's something that I think
is incredibly satisfying when a q-tip
with like one little swipe actually
removes the problem like you don't have
to work at it you don't make a bigger
smudge out of it like something fell
down there or something got smeared a
little bit and then with your q-tip boom
it like actually took the problem away
with one sweep I'm not writing on q-tips
because they have saved me in so many
circumstances but there are some times
where it's like okay good enough I'll
bring in some makeup I'll cover it up
I'll redo it but the times when the
q-tip just really saves you with the one
stroke that is just oh I love that is
anybody else with me on the joy of a
retractable brush
I just there's something about it I
think it's the physical opening of the
product but also the knowledge that that
brush is living in this little tube and
then it's going to be perfectly shaped
every time you undo that thing I mean
I'm just I love that idea I think it's a
great concept I mean just for practical
purposes it's really easy to throw
something like that in your bag and the
brush doesn't get messed up but just I
love that that movement that process mm
there are probably some people watching
this video who think I'm crazy
and you know what I don't care this
particular retractable brushes from up
and up I'm planning to do a big up and
up brush video soon so this was one new
one that I was testing out and as you
can tell I like it I am a big scent
person and one I think part of the
makeup experience that has recently just
appealed to me so much is the Rose
setting mist I have several different
kinds I've got one from Mac I got a
bunch of different brands that I talked
about in my Rose product video this one
from glossier is continues to be one of
my favorites and just that that fine
mist that feels first off really
refreshing but the rose scent that
follows I mean literally stop and smell
the roses like it's just such a nice
kind of soothing calming yet refreshing
type of thing I don't know it just puts
me in a good place and any time I think
of that phrase it makes me think of my
friend Kaylee she's always but she still
would say like oh I'm in a good place
right now and that's what this makes me
think of okay just a couple more things
here I wish I had one that I could
demonstrate this on because then we
could really just enjoy this together
but you know when you get a new palette
and there's like that film over the
mirror and you peel that film off I love
that I would like to just hire out to
remove those for everyone because I
could do that thing all day you know it
feels so good and then you got this
perfection mirror behind it I don't know
the last thing I'm going to mention that
really satisfies me really makes me
happy is when you've got a product okay
and you know the pan that the product is
sitting in has some sort of texture on
it like for example rings like that and
for a while when you're
using a product it's like you can start
to tell that hitting pan is imminent
because you can see that texture of
whatever is on the bottom pan you can
kind of see that coming through to the
powder you haven't hit pan yet but you
can tell it's coming and then you
finally do I love that I love like
feeling like okay you know I've really
used a lot of this product now and then
BOOM I can finally see through to the
pan in a sense that could be bittersweet
especially if you're using like a
discontinued product or something you
can't get your hands on anymore but for
the person who has and uses a lot of
makeup it's almost like validation like
yes I can you know nearly use something
actually even with all this stuff and
there are some products like mascaras or
different things in tubes where you
can't really see that you're totally
using it up it just gradually starts to
dry out on you that's no fun for me I
like to be able to see like okay I'm
starting to see like a little outline of
some rings here on this bronzer or
whatever it might be and then you
finally go through to it I like that I'm
not sure what I'm going to title this
video but all I can think of is those
are my happy little makeup things those
are the things that as I go through the
process of putting on makeup they make
me smile
they put positive thoughts in my head
and they are gratitude triggers they
make me think like you know look at this
life you can sit down you can have time
to do something like this how grateful I
am that I can do that and a lot of times
you know we do our makeup at the start
of the day and those are great little
feelings to get going in your mind
especially if something's a little
hectic or something's not quite going
your way or you've just had a really bad
week or whatever you know you sit down
you do your makeup it's kind of like
okay I'm gonna refocus myself in a
positive place and it's just a series of
all these little things that kind of put
me there so of course I would love to
hear in the comments section what you're
happy low makeup things are please
really what I want to hear is that I'm
not alone in loving all these crazy
little things like magnetic closures and
retractable brushes and weird things
like that yeah and it's fun to be
working toward a finished look but the
real enjoyment wise I think in the
little steps along the way for me so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
