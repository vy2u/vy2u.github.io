Christmas it's good to be back even
though I haven't really been gone from
YouTube while I was gone at home for
about the past five days or so I still
have videos posting but now I am back
and getting back into some video making
I'm working on some reviews for the
Express channel today and I thought I'd
go ahead and show the things that I got
for Christmas and my birthday I do this
video every year and I think it's just
fun to see you know outside of all the
things that I've been recommending
throughout the holiday season you know
what things I ended up getting these
families probably like this you've got
some people who want a specific idea
from you for something to get and then
there are some people who just really
want to surprise it really got both
happening with these gifts like my
parents want specific ideas for things
to get me and then my sister wants to
completely blindside me with some fun
stuff so the first thing I'll mention is
something I got from my parents for
Christmas and it's the Stila masterpiece
set or masterpiece series eye and cheek
palettes and there's a volume one two
and three I love how it's put together
like a little box of books you know do
you remember when you're a little kid
and you'd get like baby-sitters Club
books in a little box or something
so there's three and they're all like so
so cute one is the impressionist palette
or that's actually volume 2 volume 1 is
the minimalist palette and volume 3 is
the modernist palette a day I use this
one it's the impressionist palettes got
a lot of great pretty purpley shades in
there I love all the different textures
like there's one shade that's really
really sparkly and I've got a thing
right now for putting sparkle on the
lower lash line so that's what I did
there and then I used this kind of topi
lilac on the lids some of this deep
matte bluish purple shade and a little
bit of this in my crease as well so I
just love the look that that creates a
really pretty blush and there as well as
I haven't really messed with as much yet
are the minimalist palette this looks a
gorgeous - just a bunch of neutrals some
shimmery shades kind of a coppery color
in there so I'm excited too
then the modernist palette really has
some nice icy colors a really pretty pop
of blue and then a charcoal matte black
a light blue a soft white so here's what
they all look like side by side I feel
like the blushes and these two are very
very similar this one you're getting
more of a peachy blush in terms of like
shade overlap between these three even
if some of these shades are looking
similar on camera they are all like
different finishes so I think there's a
lot of nice variety there none of these
have mirrors which is a bit of a bummer
I still think this is a super travel
friendly concept just being able to pull
out one of these and take it with you or
if you even take this whole boxful you
know it's not taking up that much space
so I think that's really cool oh and it
does come with a little booklet with
some real-life eye pictures instead of
just sketches which I really think is
helpful I love when it's a real picture
of an eye to go off of I had tons of
time to really use this and give you a
review on it yet so this isn't a review
just more of a hey here's what I got you
can probably expect a review on this
stuff coming soon but I've heard a lot
of good things about the Sephora brand
lip glosses so I thought this would be a
fun way to try a lot of different shades
it's a Sephora color wand lip gloss trio
so you get three different like stacks
of four gloss I love that concept for
just getting a sampling of shades
because if you don't go through glosses
very quickly this is just a nice way to
try a lot of different ones and this is
how they work you just twist them off
and there's a doe foot applicator in
each one and it just twists down in
there today I'm wearing a combination of
these two shades and I find that there's
different a lot of different finishes
some are more opaque some are more sheer
for example this was more of a sheer
gloss so I went over it with some of
that but they also know like grapefruit
which is really cool and different you
know I feel like a lot of glosses have a
vanilla sweetness these have a really
refreshing scent and they're just very
comfortable on my lips like not sticky
at all so each wand has a different
theme there's the nude wand which has
some nude colors golden
light-pink there's the pink wand which
has all pinky tones from light to deeper
and then this is the red wand which has
a true red and then like plummy colors
some different tones of pink in there
too that's just gonna be a lot of fun to
play with and I really like the formula
also from philosophy this thing struck
me it's like a take on a OS what mom
almost this came from Sephora I'm pretty
sure and it says pink almond candy and
it's just a lip balm it's got that
rounded top kind of like an EOS it's got
a really lightly sweet scent I can sense
a little bit of that almond in there as
well but it's very moisturizing like
kind of thick on your lips so this is
gonna be great for times when I just
really need a lot of extra moisture and
also got this Kat Von D spellbinding
look kit I don't have a lot of Kat Von D
stuff but the stuff I do have I've been
really impressed with I've got the Lady
Bird eyeshadow palette and so this comes
with another eyeshadow palette that I
thought looked gorgeous it's called
Poetica the packaging is so pretty it's
like kind of a metal tin almost and
there is a liner in their eyes shadows
are just so pretty I love how it's kind
of a half-and-half thing you know a lot
of really cool purpley tones and then we
get into this gorgeous copper color
they're really beautifully pigmented
nice staying power with these kinds of
eyeshadows also comes with a full-size
mascara it's called sinful lash and
gorgeous gorgeous tube here and I
haven't tried this mascara yet but it's
a big old brush traditional bristles
there a little bit tapered at the tips
so can't wait to try that out and
there's a foiled love lipstick this is
an FTW again the packaging is so pretty
with this kind of like sketched on roses
around the outside and then this color
is like a deep plum with a little bit of
a metallic edge it's very very pretty I
just kind of tried it on one day while I
was back home and I thought it was
gorgeous and then there's another eye
liner the one in the palette was black
but this is a full-size brown one
in immortal love so it's got the little
built-in sharpener and one end a smudger
tip at the other end and then there's a
look at that and it goes on very very
creamy and smooth sets to a super long
wearing finish so no complaints about
this kit I think that was a great value
I also got one of the hourglass ambient
lighting powders I this has probably
been one of the most asked about things
that I don't have as one of these
powders this is the first one I've
gotten and this is actually like pretty
matte it kind of reminds me of my laura
geller baked french vanilla highlight
and go on like super thick and white on
my face I put it down my nose kind of on
top of my cheekbones with a little brush
I'm really gonna have to keep messing
with this a little bit to figure out how
I most like to use it if I think it's
worthwhile but I'm really glad I got
that to try now my sister pup completely
surprises me every year with Beauty
related gifts which she is found to get
harder and harder the more makeup stuff
I'm drying and reviewing so she asked
our friend David for some suggestions of
stuff to get me and it's just amazing
stuff that I did not see coming at all
like total shock when I opened up the
boxes as to what she came up with so
great makeup but she also surprised me
with an incredible watercolor here look
at this I hope I can fit it all in you
guys know my sister Kelly I call her cup
does the most amazing watercolors and
this one is just gonna be gorgeous so
we're here in my makeup we're pretty
sure you can order prints of this as
well I'll have to put a link below to
that but it's gorgeous she's got some
Estee Lauder lipsticks some eyeliner in
there nail polish I just think it's
amazing for a makeup lover day little
details and just all the shine that
comes off in here sorry the glare is not
doing it justice but it's it's so
wonderful and it just brought me to
tears when I saw it because she just
didn't mention a thing about it it
completely surprised me and I love it
check out what else she came up with
RuPaul is out with makeup there's a
glamazon limited edition cosmetics set
it will give you this kind of a look
which I am totally gonna do in a video
blush they're a couple of eyeshadow
those a lipstick or a lip gloss eyeliner
mascara I mean it's total drag queen
makeup and so I think it's gonna be a
blast to put it on and see if I can pull
off this kind of alone I had not heard
of this at all before I guess it's just
recently launched these are loose powder
like pigments here with the eyeshadow
and the same with the blush as well
that's loose so I haven't busted into a
lot of this you know I'm totally gonna
be doing a video with this I think it's
gonna be awesome there's also a makeup
brand that I've never heard of before
it's called kaor and here's like the
little card that came with the stuff and
I think one of the things they're known
for is a completely glittery lip like if
you go to the website you can see demos
of it and it's supposedly ultra long
wearing glitter lip like I guess it
comes in a ton of colors and your lips
end up completely opaque and sparkly you
know not the kind of thing you're gonna
do every day but for you know just a fun
night out it could just be crazy and
awesome got me like the little set of
things to create it and she got it for
me in red which I'm really glad she went
with the shade that I would I would go
out of the house wearing here
but the lipstick is called show off and
you have to use this particular lipstick
you put it on and then you top it with
the red glitter and there's a special
little applicator for that and it's the
glitter in yeah show off glitz stick is
what it's called
glitz stick is the whole method for this
so check out the website see how crazy
cool it looks when it's applied it just
hits the nail on the head with these
unusual things that she knows I'm gonna
like to try and review and demonstrate
for you guys so I can't wait to do a
video showing that now here's something
that I have heard about in the YouTube
community but I just hadn't gotten any
yet for myself and they are they look
femme blushes crazy crazy pigmented like
unbelievable I have three of them here
and they're called blush on Rouge and
they are just powder blushes
this one is quarrel take a look at this
like wow one that I've used so far which
gave such a pretty of I'm gonna say
natural flush because I used it very
light
but it's this one called Fram bozhe it's
this pink with a little bit of sparkle
in it there's that one I mean just know
why you guys might already have these
and know exactly what I'm talking about
this one's called magenta this is the
craziest one of them all I mean I'm just
tapping into it obviously you're not
gonna wear it that strong on your cheeks
but you get an idea of how intense these
really are speaking of David by the way
if you're not familiar he's a makeup
artist for Estee Lauder in New York and
the lipstick he had given me in years
past it was like a great Estee Lauder
lipstick with my name engraved on it
look what he did this year for my
birthday this is called the Capricorn
compact so heavy it's got like little
crystals there look at the gorgeous art
on the outside and then it's got Emily
Noel engraved on the back at the date of
my birthday 1227 inside there's a little
mirror and then I think this is like a
translucent powder he suggested using
this to set my under eye concealer it's
a very weightless powder I've been
really liking the effect from it because
it totally mattifies but it doesn't look
to that I've been loving the product
more importantly loving you know the
compact and the meaning behind it so
thank you so much David he's also given
me some things that I'm gonna totally
get into more in other videos I just
want to give them mention to a few of
the Estee Lauder foundation type
products because I'm loving the double
wear have loved it since I first tried
it and so he gave me some different
forms of that I've double wear light now
which I'm loving I have the Double Wear
maximum cover camouflage for face and
body is a really interesting texture it
seems to spread a little bit more so I
see why it's like a face body type thing
but incredible cover it and then also
the double wear stay in place powder
which can give you a completely full
coverage experience when you put this on
on top of like your Double Wear
foundation or even the double wear light
it's crazy coverage David thank you so
much I don't want to even talk about
this too much right now because I know
I'm gonna be doing more with it but I
just love this stuff my dear friend
Kristin Kristin game here on YouTube
gifted me some incredible luxury makeup
some of her favorites things I had
and dip my toe into where makeup is
concerned and she sent these to me and
I'm just like blown away by just your
generosity and your taste in makeup this
is a Tom Ford cheek color and it's in
the shade frantic pink and this is so
glowy and beautiful without being
sparkly I mean it's crazy this is a
beautiful peachy color I think you're
seeing the truest color right there as I
tip it a little bit but I'm wearing this
today and I love how it's giving me like
a really glowy cheek but you can get
super close to my face and not see one
bit of sparkle coming off of that blood
just crazy gorgeous texture I love it so
much and then Kristen's a big fan of the
Burberry eye shadows this one's in
Mulberry this is midnight Brown and just
take a moment to appreciate the
gorgeousness of the outer packaging I
think that's so pretty
and then stamped into the product is
that Burberry signature print this is
mulberry here you can see it's kind of
like a satiny finish pretty plummy color
but not too intense on the purple still
like almost a neutral type color and
then this is midnight Brown can you see
all the taupe happening in there kind of
like an antique bronze type color so
I've worn these two together and really
enjoyed that look at Kristin thank you
so much that was so nice of you
I forgot me a couple of beauty related
things this was completely his choice he
was asking for like Christmas birthday
gift ideas and I said just you know a
new fragrance of some sort and I like
that he picks it out and just chooses a
scent that he likes he's just really
good at picking out really good cents
and so this is the one he got for me it
is from Chanel and it's called chance
and I have never had a Chanel perfume
before I don't have a massive perfume
collection but this smells so fresh
clean a little bit floral a little bit
sweet let's look at this beautiful
bottle so thank you so much Tyler for
that that's really sweet and then I
always love philosophy stuff
particularly the shower gels and so he
got me this set of
five and they're all like holiday sense
I believe it came from QVC and they're
all six ounces each which is kind of big
for one of these multi you know gift set
kind of things and they're all these
great great holiday since they smell
exactly like you would expect I love the
accuracy of the philosophy body washes
and they are the three in one shampoo
bubble bath shower gels I normally use
them as a shower gel but this is English
toffee you two that I've used so far our
cinnamon hot dots and the sweet creamy
frosting oh my goodness the sweetness
this one I mean if you love cinnamon
spicy kind of stuff it's different from
cinnamon buns which I love cinnamon buns
that adds kind of a baked goodness sort
of element to it sorry these are going
to roll up my lap but this is more like
a sweet cinnamon candy kind of set I'm
gonna love spiced gingerbread cookie the
wild card of this group I'm not sure
what I'm gonna think of it because it
really does smell exactly like the name
and it's spicy gumdrop I'm not sure if
I'm gonna enjoy operating with this or
not I haven't used it yet but just
judging by the scent out of the bottle
it is scarily accurate so I hope you all
had a wonderful holiday season I've been
getting some questions about the Emily
awards already I do those in January so
I'm not sure exactly when they'll start
airing but I've got a unique concept for
how we're gonna intro them this year I
always try to top each year so we've got
some fun ideas going for that and lots
of great products to talk about as
always so thank you guys so much for
watching I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
