Christmas I'm so happy to be sharing
part of this day with you because it is
my birthday so yeah I've been sitting
around this morning playing with makeup
mostly that's why my hair isn't really
done and I'm still in my new pajamas
which they're so soft I got some new
pajamas for Christmas and I just thought
you know what I'm leaving them on
because this is my day
so I wanted to share with you a
Christmas / birthday haul of course
Christmas was a couple days ago my
birthday it's on the 27th and I just had
a lot of gifts of makeup related things
that's what I asked for in a lot of
cases in some of these instances it was
something I specifically asked for and
in other cases someone surprised me with
something really great so I haven't dug
into a lot of this stuff just yet a few
things I have and I'll mention that
along the way also I want to point out
that there are a couple of great amazing
gifts that I got one is a new giant size
makeup mirror that I'm so pumped to show
you and I want to save that for a
separate video and also my sister Kelly
I don't know if you are friends with her
on Facebook or if you follow her blog
she is an incredible artist and when it
comes to her portraits they are so
lifelike it takes your breath away
and I've got to tell you she did a
portrait of me in my makeup area
makeup all around it is incredible and I
was watching her progress and we were
keeping in touch online you know she was
showing me you know I've got this much
done or I did this part of it but when I
saw that in person and she gave it to me
on Christmas Day it brought me to tears
to see that in person and I believe that
moment was captured on camera so I'm
gonna put together a separate video all
about that painting she did one of Tyler
to kind of in his element in his office
and I'm so excited to show that to you I
want to you know definitely do another
video on that so that's to come also the
Emily awards will be coming up in the
not so distant future after the start of
the new year so there's lots to look
forward to on beauty broadcast but for
now let's get into some of the gifts
first off I did my first ever swap with
a new friend that I've made through
YouTube and through Twitter hi Abby
she is so sweet and I've got to tell you
she started up a channel and she has
some great ideas great taste very
pleasant to listen to and watch and
learn from but we chose to do this swap
and she went above and beyond I mean she
she took her price limit and she just
you know threw that out the window but
she gave me some awesome things I just
wanted to highlight a few of the gift
sets she gave me and then I'll put more
on my blog about all the other great
things that she threw in because there
was a lot but one thing she gave me I
was very excited about it is the
Smashbox
I wish palette so if you've seen this
you know what this is if you if you've
been looking around your Sephora store
lately because this gold palette is
filled with not only a wonderful mirror
but a lot of great shadows here and
what's neat about this is that they're
all numbered so when you're doing a look
or when I'm doing a look and I'm trying
to tell you what I used I don't have to
be like you know pretend like we're
paying playing battleship and go two up
and three over or whatever cupcake is
here she's gonna sit with me for this
haul but it comes with mascara the
primer this is gonna be so fun to use
I'm really really excited about that one
and she also gave me a couple of gift
sets from brands I have never tried
before she knew I liked Smashbox but
she's introducing me to some new stuff
with the Gemma Kidd signature kit
Gemma kids stuff is available at Target
and so this comes with like a primer on
eyeliner mascara lip gloss so that's
gonna be great to try and she gave me I
told you she went all out and this isn't
even everything she got me she got me
this great set from pixie another Target
brand but kind of like the higher end
stuff that target is selling now comes
with an adorable gold clutch and then
all these great products a primer and
eye primer and eyeshadow and eyeliner so
I can't wait to bust this out and really
dig in and start trying that now my
sister okay I told you she painted me an
amazing portrait of me and one of Tyler
too but she didn't stop there she always
gets me great
and she surprises me with the gift she
gives me I don't ask specifically for
something she picked something that she
thinks I'll love and she went over the
top this year and got me more makeup
stuff on top of that fantastic painting
and one thing was this palette from Too
Faced and it's the enchanted glamour
land palette and we kind of exchanged
names for gift-giving in my family and
so Tyler had my sister and he ended up
getting her this one too so it was like
we both ended up with this and neither
of us knew we were going to be getting
it so that was fun but this is such a
pretty palette to face just outdoes
themselves year after year with the
construction and the art that is part of
their palettes and you've got some ideas
here for um like looks there's little
cards in there you've got a blush you've
got a highlight oh hey it's okay cupcake
it's it is all about you there she goes
but you pull out this drawer and you've
got a ton of shadows and by ton I don't
mean a literal ton but you've got these
shadows all in here some favorites that
I've had from other palettes a full-size
shadow insurance and a big full-size lip
gloss in there so me and my sister both
are gonna have fun trying looks with
that we were joking maybe you know she
can do a look and I can do one we can
see what's different and what we did the
same and stuff but she also got me this
palette from Urban Decay which I've
heard great things about on YouTube
it's the Urban Decay NYC palette and you
want to talk about presentation I mean
these brands are just getting absolutely
insane with what they're doing but I
love it this one actually I don't know
if you can tell but it's lighting up
you've got the mirror there you've got
like the New York City sky and then of
course oh yeah there's the makeup so you
pull out this drawer and I mean what am
I gonna do with all these eyeshadows I
have no idea tons of tutorials tons of
reviews you know it's coming but look at
all those great shadows too of the 24/7
which if you've got the naked palette
you know that that's something great to
have and then another mini
eye primer so I think a lot of these
brands as you can see are catching on to
the fact that people not only want the
punch of shadow but they want the primer
so the shadow can really function as
well as it can now my sister surprised
me again by giving me something that is
going to be really fun to do a video on
I think and just tell you about but it
is from making cosmetics calm I don't
know if you've heard of this website but
that's exactly what it's gonna happen
here I'm gonna make the mineral eye
shadow here and so you're given all the
stuff in this bag to make it and you're
also giving given um basically the
recipe of how you go through and measure
the different things out so this is so
neat you've got the containers and all
that and you've got the pigments - a
bunch of pigments and then you've got
kind of like I guess what is a base for
this and that's it kind of the white
stuff that's taking up the whole other
part of this bag and you're gonna mix it
together you got some spatulas and I'm
gonna be creating my own eye shadows and
I think I'll be able to mix and
customize and make them look how I want
them to look and I think that's gonna be
awesome to do a video on and I really
want to check out this website to making
cosmetics calm because this sounds right
up my alley and I think she knew I was
gonna have a lot of fun with that so
thank you pup for all that you gave me I
am so excited to try that step out now
Tyler his big gift to me was my makeup
mirror from vanity girl Hollywood which
oh man it has changed the way I do my
makeup and I'm in love with it but not
as in love with that as I am with Tyler
you know but he also got me the set from
bare essentials it's the buxom city
slickers set and I've had these out I've
been actually using these all week long
but I repackage them for the purpose of
this video but basically you're getting
four buxom lip glosses and four of the
sort of lipstick jumbo pencil type
things that coordinate with each one and
I have been
this lipgloss I know that not everybody
likes minty tingle in their glosses I
happen to enjoy that if you also enjoy
it I think you'll love these the
pigmentation the shine the shimmer in
these glosses and the staying power good
lord
I mean I was through Christmas these
were the glosses I was wearing if you
watch my travel video you know I took
these with me and man oh man did they
last through meals and naps and
everything lots of talking to of course
love those moving on to what my parents
got me watching a lot of QVC and
especially the shows about beauty
because I just learned so much and I
love its the reporter in me I'm sure but
I love having the person from the brand
there that is explaining you know why
they did what they did why they created
you know this product to be this way or
that way oftentimes they are a makeup
artist that you know has been doing
makeup for years and they want to
explain exactly how to use the products
so I love it and then I was kind of
keeping a mental checklist as I watched
up and then when mom and dad asked what
do you want for Christmas I told them a
lot of things that I saw there one thing
in finale all day gorgeous said I don't
know if you know who Malley is but she
is a celebrity makeup artist isn't she
beautiful and this little pamphlet came
with the kit that I had which is called
the all day gorgeous kit and it tells
you step-by-step exactly how to use
everything because there is a method to
this Mally makeup is known for long
wearing like high-performance makeup and
I thought that would be perfect for
on-air great for me to test out and
review and I have for example the lips
the blush and some of the eye stuff that
I have on is from this kit and so what
you're getting here are you've got a
long wearing lip color and gloss a
phenomenal mascara oh my gosh
and then you've got a like a shadow
stick super long wearing you've got an
eyeliner that's a pretty plum and of
course is this all neatly packaged just
like that this is a special applicator
for the blush you've got sort of a
foundation brush looking thing and then
some
for the powder because it's a cream and
powder blush and then you've got kind of
this interesting double ended sponge tip
thing that works with setting the
eyeliner so a couple of the really neat
strategies I mean we thought we're all
kind of familiar with long wearing lip
color I really like this color by the
way that I've got on but the method with
her blush is really cool in this pocket
you get her blush compact and what's in
it is a cream and a powder and so you
put on the cream blush first you use
that little foundation you type brush
and I put that on then I blended it in
and then put the powder on top to set it
and it's supposed to be long wearing
blush a lot of people complain about
their blush not lasting all day like
that's it visibly wears off I mean you
can tell when your blush is there and
not there so that's the interesting
strategy with that and then with the
liner you put your liner on with that
pencil and then if I can open this up
you've got this two-sided thing the
white you take the wide end of this tip
and cover the liner with the white and
that light kind of sets it in there and
then you bump up the color again with
this dark shade that coordinates and so
I've got a smaller tip for that if you
like working with sponge tips and you
love the control that that gives you you
will really like using that and so I
have kind of that plum smoky rim you
know around my eye thanks to this kit
and I really had fun with that and just
to show you there's that shadow pencil
and yes I do have candy cane painted
nails I painted those stripes on there a
few days ago and but that shadow pencil
really really does stay on so from QVC
the Laura Geller stuff um Laura Geller
was sold and Sephora I don't know if
it's still sold in Sephora stores or not
but this was another item I watched
presented on air and I was really
impressed and I need to try it out to
let you know what I think but it's
called the real deal arsenal and this is
more of you know high coverage high
performance makeup just to open it up
for you here this is what you're getting
it's you've got these three sticks one
is a stick blush a stick like
three-in-one primer and then a Altima
coverage oil-free stick foundation
you've got this concealer which is
serious coverage concealer a gloss the
sponge that you're supposed to use along
with these sticks and then this eye
stuff is a I rims baked shadow okay this
is this is beautiful
I haven't used this stuff yet so I can't
really tell you anything about it but I
open this up look at that
Laura Geller is big on the baked
products and I've been getting back into
like the blush and brighten bronzed and
brightened balanced and brightened stuff
that she has but this is kind of a
different thing with all the stick
makeup so um it's supposed to be
basically really awesome coverage so I'm
so pumped to try that out and let you
know how this is the Urban Decay 24/7
jackpot ask for this off of sephora.com
and basically liner Palooza here bunch
of different eyeliners you get the full
sized zero which is black so that's nice
and then you've got all the fun colors
in minute whoa almost lost it there in
mini sizes so neutrals blues purples
everything no more boring liner I mean
I'm gonna really have fun about this
from Clinique the black honey glow I've
heard so many good things about this and
this is described as a cult favorite
shade that black honey from Clinique and
when you take it out when you look at
that lip gloss in the tube it's like oh
my gosh that's gonna be so dark but it
comes off the sheer gorgeous shade and
it comes also with a Super Bowl
moisturizing gloss and a gel blush so it
all coordinates I've never tried the
brand Tarte before but they've come out
with some things bitch that I think I
saw it in person and I saw it on the
Sephora website and I kind of just said
this has to happen gorgeous quilted box
here this is actually a necklace you can
wear yeah you can wear that and then it
opens up to be an absolute makeup I wish
I had another person here within
set of hands that could help me show
this off but you've got a fold out sort
of container here so there's all those
shadows okay let me fold those out to
reveal yeah more shadows right
underneath there
and then we're going to pull out a
little drawer here that is full of a
couple of face colors and a bunch of lip
colors and wait there's more this is
like you just continue to discover
things there's a little tray here
with a bunch of sorry I don't feel
comfortable holding it totally up and
down for you but bunch of liners in
there so this is going to be a great way
for me to experiment with this brand
because lots of people have told me this
is an awesome brand you need to try it
out and I just kind of thought it would
take the opportunity around Christmas
time to do that with this gift set and I
know you guys are seeing a lot of this
stuff and thinking man all this high-end
makeup you know what's going on but
that's I told you this before that's
what I asked for around Christmas time
and I'm definitely continuing to use all
my drugstore makeup as well my Fit I've
used a lot of the manly stuff today but
I also used my Colorstay foundation my
voluminous mascara you know all that
stuff so no I have not say goodbye to
drugstore makeup by any stretch of the
imagination a cup stuff I know this took
me a long time but I wanted to include
all those awesome gift pallets to let
you know what to expect reviews and
tutorials on in the future and remember
a couple of videos to come on my makeup
mirror and that gorgeous portrait my
sister made so thanks so much for
watching I hope you have a wonderful had
a wonderful Christmas a Happy New Year
and thank you for the people who have
already been sending me wonderful
birthday wishes I do appreciate it have
a great day guys and I'll talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
