video feels like it's been a little
while since I've put a video up because
I've just been traveling I've been back
home to see my friends and family and
celebrate Christmas in my birthday which
was on the twenty-seventh so I got a lot
of great gifts that i want to show you
in this haul video and i'm going to go
through and kind of quickly and yes this
is where i talk about quite a few more
high-end items because that is what I
asked for as gifts since I don't
normally buy it for myself so if you
notice this more focused on that than
the drug store items you know that's
kind of why so first thing I want to
tell you about is something that Tyler
got me it is the Smashbox a rapture
eyeshadow and blush collection and came
in this box by how's it out and keep in
mind this is just going to be a hole
because i can't really review yet
because I haven't tried a lot of the
stuff yet but it came with two really
nice brushes and number 15 um which is
like a definer brush it's a little more
you know densely packed and and smaller
like a dense crease brush and then this
shadow brush which is really nice it
comes to a little bit of a point which
is kind of interesting so those two will
entice brushes Smashbox makes a nice
quality brushes and then this whole set
of duo's and I know isn't that awesome
and it's got like some plums some you
know topes some really deep rich colors
and then some lighter colors excuse me
I've got a cold too so you'll have to
bear with me here but this is for
example this is the duo I have on right
now it's called splendid and it's kind
of like a warm taupe kind of shade and
then a really pretty shimmery champagne
color so that's just a great everyday
one they've got something you should do
an awesome smoky eye with just like
straight up basically that's kind of
sparkly black and white I've got
Purple's greens light blues there's also
um to show you this one kind of
a true cobalt blue and a pearly white I
love that shade um this is just going to
be really fun to experiment with you can
imagine all the looks you can get I find
the Smashbox shadows to be very velvety
and almost creamy feeling even though
they are powder so I've got eight
different fun duo's and some nice
brushes to play with their so that's a
great great gift thank you to Tyler for
that and yes I did tell him I did ask
specifically for it so now the next
thing I got was from Laura Geller I've
heard some good things about um the
Laura Geller baked like mineral I
believe its mineral makeup it's the
baked basics was what I got and it's a
set that contains like basically a
foundation a blush and a bronzer and
also a little mini Mookie brush I'll
show you that it came in this little
pouch it says laura geller on it and it
unsnaps and there is your little little
what kabuki brush which is what I
probably said before I don't really like
super small brushes but this is very
dense and very well made and it might be
good for areas where you want a little
more coverage maybe around your eye area
and you can't beat this little pouch you
know keep your brush nice it just sticks
right in there sorry and then I'll snaps
up so very cute and then on to the
makeup um I got a balance and brighten
and these were a little smaller than I
was expecting but that's okay since I
really didn't know if I like them yet
anyway but if she didn't see it's kind
of like a dome and this is you know
claims to be baked you know like a baked
mineral product i believe and and it's
kind of gotta add several different
tones in there there's some yellow tones
some beige tones some deeper tan tones
and and the assumption is that when you
swirl your brush in that you're getting
all those colors kind of blended
together and it will really complement
your skin tone so it came with that's
the balance and brighten and that's what
you could use this like a powder
foundation and then i got the bronze and
brighten and that has
some pinks and some deeper tan some
shimmering cream notes in there and so
that you could use as a nice little
bronzer so that's I have used that and I
really like that and then this is
gorgeous this color is so pretty it's
the blush and brighten in berry and it's
got I hope you can look at it and see it
so how the color truly is but it's got
some pretty almost plum shade some pinks
some goals I mean it's just a gorgeous
swirled blush and again it's got quite a
bit of shimmer and was what I have
noticed so you do want to not overuse
the product on your cheeks but it is
very pretty once you get it on there so
these these products I mean I've done
like maybe one application with them and
I really don't want to argue things
after only one application but I will
tell you that I did like the way they
all work together and so that was I'm
really glad I got that set of a new
brand again that Laura Geller something
I have nothing from so that was exciting
to get that that was from Tyler to um
let's see what else here um got a gift
from my parents it's the Smashbox and
along with that rapture line with the
shadows the gift of glow set and it
comes Kim a little box like this and I
of course got it out and looked at at
all and it's this cute little like
pearly pink clutch which I think I might
actually use is like a little purse some
time because I think that is just so
cute i love the pink ribbon and it's
like a golden a pink color on me pouch
and it really makes a nice little makeup
pouch to it has two sides the unzip and
what you've gotten the others in the one
side here you get a shadow liner brush
which is interesting this is an
interesting concept and because it comes
with the waterproof shadow liner in
Hollywood it's kind of a brownish golden
brown shade and what that's actually
supposed to be is
give you sort of not the smoky eye but
sort of the smoldering kind of you know
like not super defined I'm a little more
natural seeming but yet no you're not
seeing a harsh you know real line to it
and so I think this is adorable first of
all and so it comes with a kind of a
thicker brush when you think of using
for eyeliner but we'll see how that goes
that'll be fun to play with once again a
little I like this brush this little
kabuki brush that it gave me better than
the Laura Geller one it's more tapered
and less cut straight across and so so
soft so I really like that and it gave
me some flash powder which is sort of a
golden eat own dat powder you could use
to set your makeup with top your makeup
off with you won't probably be able to
see the sparkle in it but there is quite
a bit of shimmer there sorry I'm really
getting a bad call um and then the lip
gloss and gilded which is a pretty
peachy gold nude so just a bunch of fun
smashbox face products to go along with
the eye stuff so that will be fun to try
and how cute is the packaging live very
very cute um moving on toshing i have to
speed this up my sister got me just a
full-sized smashbox photo finish primer
because i really had only gotten the
travel size was in the past and now i
have a nice big Smashbox photo finish um
and then my sister got me some really
great gifts and she just she doesn't
need tips for shopping either she'll
just you know pick out awesome stuff
without me even having to you know say
anything about it she got me the mirror
mirror gloss set from Too Faced and it's
just for different like really high
shine glosses several look to be kind of
like transparent women anyone is queer
one is like a clear red gel sort of one
as a creamy nude and one it's kind of a
clear peach so those are very very shiny
and and what great over almost
anything on your lips and then she also
got me the doo-wop kit here that is the
best of you walk it's the collection of
their best-selling products so this is
awesome the this is really really cool
what you get in here is just some really
innovative products first you get dual
ops reverse lip liner which you actually
would use like outside your lip line to
keep everything in your lips you get
payoff which is this little guy with
it's actually got a little dropper there
and this is something you can add to
your powder shadows sort of like a
mixing medium so that'll be fun to try
um I have the blush booster in apple and
it's just an illuminating blush it's got
a lot of sparkle to it very peachy and
pretty there and gorgeous color on the
packaging as well and then this
eyeshadow do it in macchiato and it's
kind of similar to that smash box when I
told you I had on my eyes right now
gorgeous colors can't get enough of you
know nice neutral duo's like that and
then the last thing it comes up with two
more things that comes with the
revolution body bronzing body
moisturizer with sunscreen this has an
editor's choice award for the lure on it
so that's sure to be awesome and then
I'm sure you've heard of lip venom you
know one of the sort of pioneers I guess
you'd say of the lip plumping well you
get some adorable little minis here you
get venom flash gold venom flash with
like silver flecks and lip venom the
original in there and so they all sit
down in this cute little little tube
thing and you can have them there so
that is going to be really really fun to
experiment with so awesome i know i've
gone over yeah i got over to anything
I'm sorry guys I just have one more
thing to show you though and this is
what my sister got me for my birthday
this is all out like my packaging award
it is the two-faced world domination
tour all access backstage beauty
collection and you open it up and this
can actually double as a um ads like a
little jewelry box what I want to say
you can see this little girl she's like
spinning around like a little I don't
know Marilyn the Moroi or something
there that's so cute and you look down
in it and this is where you can pull out
not sure how long this to play for um
there we go you can pull out this little
palette and you can see what you get in
terms of eyeshadow some really fun
looking eye shadows and blush colors to
play with there and when you're done
that will lift out for good and you can
put jewelry there in the bottom a whole
lip palette and in the side and the side
is a blush and bronzer thing that what's
out so just so cute to sit on my makeup
table and then when I you know what I
run out of it to use it for jewelry will
be really really awesome so and then the
last thing that I want to show you is my
new makeup bag that I'm using for work
which my sister I believe she came up
with this at urban outfitters and it has
so many pouches inside and this cute
little it looks like paper dolls is the
print on the outside so this nice you
know finish you can wipe off we all know
makeup bags get really dirty and then
some great you know places to keep
brushes and everything on the inside and
to see the contents of that bag and when
I picked in I won't make up bag stay

on that so thank you guys so much for
