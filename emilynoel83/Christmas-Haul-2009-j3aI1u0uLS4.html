like it's been so long since I've put up
a video and I really don't like going
that long without doing videos but I
have been back home for Christmas and my
birthday which was on the 27 thank you
so much for everyone who sent me like a
tweet or a nice message on facebook or
on here wishing me a happy birthday that
really meant a lot to me that you guys
noticed that and wanted to say hello so
thank you so much I had such a busy time
during Christmas because I was visiting
my family and my husband Tyler's family
and so it was just really jam-packed I
totally thought I was going to get a
video made but then I don't know I just
kept getting busier and busier and I
thought well once I get home I will have
time to get some done and I have tons of
material to do them on so I've been just
kind of itching to do something so I
thought I'd just start out by you know
doing this little haul video I guess of
my Christmas presents and that way you
can kind of see what's coming up and
what sorts of things I'll probably focus
on for my upcoming videos so I've said
in the past I think when I did a whole
video last Christmas I explained that
you know I use a lot of drugstore
inexpensive makeup but when it comes to
me Christmas time or my birthday I
usually ask for you know a little more
expensive special stuff and I don't know
it kind of allows me to try some new
things and it's just exciting to you
know try something new that you don't
get for yourself every day so I'll just
tell you what I got um first was my gift
from Tyler um I got a set of things from
Mac and yes I did tell them exactly what
I wanted I got this set that's the Mac
up starts flawless kit and it comes in
this nice little see-through bag here
and what you get is an eye and eye kind
of my thought process what this is it I
don't have a lot of Mac stuff I have you
know a handful of eyeshadows and some
Studio Fix powder and a cream blush and
fix plus I have to like some of the
basic things but I kind of wanted to
build my collection a little bit more so
I that's why I went with a kit as
opposed to
thing else and so what this came with
was the mineralized satin-finish SPF 15
foundation and so there we go with that
I got it in the NC 40 that was what I
was color tested as when I got I know
that I don't color match des by a makeup
artist when I was there I don't remember
when but I got the powder in that the
Studio Fix powder in that so I thought
this would be an interesting foundation
to try because I've heard it kind of a
recommended foundation for someone with
normal to dry skin and my skin does get
a little more dry in the wintertime so
I've put it on the color works well for
me and yeah I just really really like
the way this goes on I had a little
difficulty blending in at first but yeah
overall I think it'll be a fun product
to continue to use and it really does
give a nice finish on the skin it also
comes with two of these little guys one
is the cleanse off oil which I have yet
to try and if you have tried any of this
stuff or have opinions or tips on how to
use it please share because chances are
most of the stuff I'm going to be
talking about either I haven't tried it
or I haven't used it very much so I'm
totally open to your tips and your
reviews as well but this is the cleanse
off oil and then it came with the
charged water skin hydrating mist as
well I guess this is kind of similar to
the fixed plus but if you know if you
have any like major differences that
stand out to you let me know because I'm
a little confused on that and it also
came with something I'm loving to use as
a highlight now it's the soft and gentle
mineralized skinfinish and so this is it
has this gorgeous Sheen to it and I like
using it really lightly on top of the
cheekbones is a little bit of a
highlight it's very light it's nice for
just highlighting other parts of the
face like you know how sometimes I talk
about highlighting like the Cupid's bow
area or whatever you know it's just very
multi-purpose and I enjoy that about
that powder so again those four pieces
all came in this little kit so it was a
nice way for me to get to try a few
different things and you know like I
said some of them I haven't tried yet so
I will keep you posted on how I like
those but put them back in my little
cake here I got that or Tyler got that
i'm mac cosmetics calm another thing i
asked for it was the strobe cream which
this did not come in the kit this was a
separate item and i'd heard some good
things about this in terms of being kind
of a a moisturizer that adds some
luminosity to your skin you put it on
and it's not just something that's going
to hydrate your skin but it's also going
to give you a little glow so i really
have like this for that purpose my skin
has handled it well i don't know if some
people are more prone to breakouts with
something like this because it is a very
creamy moisturizer it's not as thin as
some of the others that i've been using
but it really keeps and puts a nice
sheen on the face before your foundation
or any other makeup even goes on so i do
like that i noticed that i can put it on
and not be like overly shiny with my
foundation on top of it or anything like
that it was pretty subtle maybe a little
i felt like it was more subtle than it
had been described by some other people
but still really liked it it's kind of a
small size you get 1.7 ounces in those
fluid ounces so i mean it's sort of a
small little guy i kind of expected it
to be bigger but this is the full size
so that concludes my max stuff that i
got i got a couple things from my
parents from sephora one is the sephora
lash lash stash i can never say that
right the first time but it's the
mascara deluxe sampler it's got ten
different Sephora mascaras in there and
if you've been keeping up with me on
twitter and facebook i'm trying to keep
you guys updated with each one of these
i try i will ultimately do like a big
review on this once i've tried all ten
but as I've done them I've tried to snap
a picture of what my eyelashes look like
and give you just a mini sort of initial
reaction on like how how it applied or
did it stay on or you know do I like the
the way it turned out so follow me on
Twitter or my facebook page that's
twitter.com slash emily noel 83 or
facebook.com slash beauty broadcast and
i put a picture up most dates that i try
this I didn't try one of these today
because I was getting back into the
swing of things with work and some of
these honestly I haven't been all that
thrilled about and I didn't want any
smudging you
with being on the air and whatnot but
I'll continue to try them don't worry
but here are the 10 that you get I'll
link to this so you can check it out
further on Sephora's website and see
what all there is but so far I've tried
and reported to you guys on the fresh
supernova mascara the lat these smashbox
lash DNA and what was this one the cargo
lash activator so I'll keep trying him I
thought it would be such I really asked
for this you know product free with you
guys in mind because I thought it would
be a really fun reviewable item and plus
you know there are many mascaras and
mascaras no one like lasts that long
anyway so it allows me to try a lot of
things and it came with this little
thing this beauty insider thing you can
earn 50 free bonus points when you
purchase a full-sized version of one of
these samples in this kit so kind of
cool there I will keep you posted on how
this go and like I said do it ultimate
review on all of it let's up tried them
all the other thing I got from Sephora
was this NARS I want you lipgloss set it
comes with five small NARS lip glosses
and I've tried some of them not all just
yet let me pull it out here okay it
comes with the following shades you get
Turkish Delight which you may have heard
sorry
Turkish Delight is like a light pink and
I actually have that in the full-size so
if you've heard me refer to that before
yes I have tried that this really light
one is strip tease very very light nude
orgasm is this golden II kind of like
peachy pink I really like this one I
have tried this it's my goodness I can't
hardly tell what that one is called odo
J this reddish one i'm keep looking at
the wrong part of the label but that's
kind of a creamy no shimmer to it kind
of like a rosy shade and then this one
looks like it has some shimmer haven't
tried it yet but it's called greek
holiday if you have any favorites if
you've been trying NARS lip glosses
before
and you really like some of those let me
know what your favorite ones are or if
your favorite isn't included in that set
let me know because I do like how they
come off like I said I had that one in
Turkish Delight and I really liked the
finish the staying power the texture so
I thought I would really enjoy this kit
and even though there are many I mean
they're not that small I don't feel like
so I think I'm gonna get a lot of a lot
of use out of those products another
makeup related gift I got was nothing I
really asked for my mother-in-law got me
a little um it looks like a little
clutch it's kind of a hard clutch and
it's from Lancome and it came with this
and also some different makeup products
inside and you can see it has kind of a
jeweled magnetic closure there so you
open that up and it's lined in red and
then there are a bunch of different
makeup items this came with let me tell
you about amarelle quickly you get a
blush in sheer amuro's just a light pink
blush this all of course came as a set
you couldn't pick individually it just
came this way you get an eye color
design sensational effects eyeshadows
smooth hold and there are four colors
there I use this recently and really
liked it you get kind of like a black
shade a shade that's kind of a burgundy
brown a soft peach and a light shimmery
white shade and then you get a like a
lash primer and the mascara they're mini
sized you get a full-size lipstick in
vintage Rose which is an interesting
very blue undertoned
lipstick you may be able to see when the
light hits it and I can see when I put
it on my lips it has kind of that bluish
undertone which is nice because that
always makes your teeth look a little
wider and another thing that came with
this this really the star of the show in
my opinion even though I haven't tried
the mascara yet it's the color fever
gloss in heat stroke I love this shade
it is so like multi-purpose it kind of
reminds like I mean it's neutral II but
it has kind of a rosy tone kind of a
coppery color to it I have it on my lips
right now so shiny has a nice amount of
shimmer to it it kind of reminds me of
that shade the the Jordana pretty shine
lip gloss in lovely that I went on about
and I wrote a whole blog about if I
could just pick one lip gloss that would
be it
this is so nice because I think it's
even more moisturizing than that and I
like the applicator it's this kind of
applicator it has like a little hole in
it but it seems to carry some product
there and it just you don't have to get
back in a second time usually to cover
your lips and I liked it so much I've
been trying it for a couple days I went
back on my birthday and bought the full
size from the counter so anyway that's a
little set from Lancome kind of chance
to try some new things I really don't
have anything from that brand right now
so now I do and the other thing the big
gift to me that I asked for for
Christmas that my mom kind of got me all
into because she was like have you been
watching QVC and seen Ken pavis and
Jessica Simpson with the the hairdo
products it's like hair extensions that
you can just clip in your hair and you
know you're good to go and if there's
different styles and everything well I
got two of those for Christmas I'm
wearing one right now it's called the
bump up the volume and if you've heard
about this you're gonna know what I'm
talking about my shave is I believe a
shade called dark chocolate it's sold on
the I got mine off of because it can pay
this website but you can also go to QVC
comm and check these out and they may
have an even bigger selection and the
colors may be slightly different if dark
chocolate is not like available it may
be other colors like chestnut or dark
brown or whatever they're calling it so
that I noticed that that can vary maybe
just depending on what stock he's
pulling from but basically how it works
is you know you start by parting some of
your hair up here at the top you clip
this in in several places there's
several pressure sensitive clips and
and you have one in the back that you
basically just clip it up or down
depending on how much volume you want
and once you get it where you want it
you just clip and it stays there it's
awesome guys this is if you thought
puppets were too difficult or they show
through or whatever this is the thing
this stuff is awesome and anyway you can
get like a really extreme amount of
volume you know in the crown or not so
much and I'm not gonna get too in-depth
here because I definitely plan on doing
some videos on these specifically
showing you how I use them but what I
have again is the shapeable clip in
extension called bump up the volume and
I believe it is a trying to find the
inch the length on this because I think
my little thing on there is okay I will
find it somewhere what the length on
this is that it comes down to about here
it gives you like I'm wearing this
straight this one can be straightened
curled you can use heat styling tools on
it and it comes down about that long on
me pretty much straight and so I've got
the volume there you can kind of see if
I turn to the side I've got that volume
in the crown I just popped the rest of
my hair on over it gave it a little
spray on top you only have to wash these
like a few times a year I mean I guess
it kind of depends on how much styling
product you would get on them if you
would want to do more or less but it has
some nice natural layering in it matches
my hair color to a tee nobody could tell
at work today I was like I had to I
didn't want to say anything and then I
finally had to say like okay guys this
is not my real hair but I had so much
fun playing with this over the weekend
and it's gonna be fun to be able to
style this one now the other one I have
and I believe this is 18 inches the
other one I got is the 23 inch clip in
wavy extension it looks something like
that
of course the darker color again it's in
the dark chocolate shade and this one
cannot be styled um at least that was
what from the description I got when I
watched his video
you can watch his videos of this honest
you on the Ken pavis YouTube channel but
again you just pull part of your hair up
you clip it in right there it has clips
across the you know the top part here
the top part of your crown and then you
have more clips this one has more Clips
down below I don't know if it's because
it's longer or a little heavier or
whatever but it is so nice like it's so
nice to just what I did when I wore this
the other night I just lightly curled
this hair my natural hair and then I
clip that in I just blended it right in
and just kind of use my fingers to style
right through it and it is fantastic I'm
really really loving these and I will
definitely do a step-by-step
demonstration on how to use them and you
know what those are going to be quick
videos because it is super super easy so
thank you guys so much for hanging
around to watch this whole little haul
video of my stuff I'm very excited to
try it some more and another thing the
person who usually is my like main I
want to say supplier but the main gifter
of high-end makeup to me is puff my
sister and she actually wasn't able to
make it to Christmas because she had
swine flu her and her husband both so um
we're gonna end up having whole you know
get together with them later in January
so I'm sure there will be more makeup to
talk about then because she is always
she'll surprise me with what she gets me
I don't have to tell her anything to get
she always gets me something I end up
loving so anyway guys more videos to
come more reviews tutorials etc so thank
you so much for tuning in and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
