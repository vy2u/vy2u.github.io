a review of some of the Claire's
eyeshadows that I've got a couple of
them that I'm going to show you are ones
that I've actually featured in a video
that I did when I just got some new
products and I didn't really review them
I just kind of told you about him and
these are also keep in mind I really
really like this stuff so it's gonna be
a pretty positive review but you can
also expect to see some tutorials I'm
going to start doing more of those and
have a lot of requests for for me to do
you know show you exactly how I use the
products that I have and I'm telling you
about and so I'm coming up with some
different messing around some different
ways to do that but definitely
especially with these products expect to
see me try them out and show you some
good ways to use them so first off I'm
actually going to start with a couple of
the pallets that I told you about before
this one is a 1 2 3 4 5 10 color palette
here it's just it doesn't have a name or
anything there's just some really pretty
vivid colors what you're seeing now
they're even brighter than what you're
looking at there I'm just to tell you
real quick oh here is I hold them back
they're a little brighter I guess you've
got a like a kind of a rusty color red
I've really deep blue a peachy color a
medium blue a like bubblegum pink a
darker purple a medium purple down here
like a golden goldenrod golden yellow
and then two shades of green one light
and one a little bit darker I wouldn't
call it all of but it's kind of a true
green color and these are really
interesting because they're not matte
but yet they don't have all that filler
kind of sparkle stuff
like you sometimes see with cheap
eyeshadows like if you if I just put my
finger on it like you get off a nice
amount of color just by just touching it
to these colors and so I really like
that like this is kind of my go-to thing
for a bright eye look especially those
gorgeous blues and purples that you see
there on the bottom there's a pretty
good shot of what all the colors look
like they almost look like when I hold
them a certain way they almost look like
they would be creams but they're they
are creamy I'm not talking creamy like a
cream eyeshadow but they feel creamy
when you put them on your lid I mean
their powders but they just have that
kind of thick texture to them I'm just
really happy with the way they go on and
I also like you know like I said that
there's not a lot of sparkle in them but
yet there is a nice pearly Sheen they
are kind of curly I guess that might be
the best way to describe them but I
really would recommend these this was
five dollars and fifty cents and usually
their stuff their eye shadows are like
buy one get one half off they have like
a lot of different makeup palettes some
of them are clearly like little kid
things like little kid design stuff but
then the eyeshadows are like I saw it I
was like I have to have it so like I
said well they're usually buy one get
one half off so this is the other one I
have you know it's a more neutral
palette here there you go umm this is
nice because you're not only getting
some pretty golds and warm kind of rose
shades and nice Browns but you're also
getting a really really nice deep black
a nice chuckle and a silver color a
great highlight color with this sort of
butter cream color and once again I mean
you just touch your finger to this stuff
and you've got a large amount of color
there each of these I would say is a
little bit bigger than maybe dime sized
but that gives you a little perspective
of how large the
are here and my man as I hold him up
there they look like they could be crews
but once again these aren't glittery
they've just got a really nice smooth
texture there's they're really easy to
blend therefore and gosh I just love
these colors so much like the morning
with that in the morning you know start
thinking of all the different looks you
could do with this kind of a palette and
having that subtle shimmer that they
have it does make them quite easy to
blend so and they both come with these
kind of long handled applicators and a
little mirror little skinny mirror right
down there in the bottom and so like I
said both of these are 550 and usually
buy one get one half off now one of the
palettes that I recently got look how
cute this is
this comes with nine shades and it was
650 and I just think the packaging is so
cute it's like little ice cube trays is
what it reminds me of it's really cute
like there's little grooves in between
all of them like it's so neat and then
you open it up and a little bitty
applicators but these are the colors you
get in it this reminds me of some of the
Urban Decay palettes that I've seen just
this configuration of colors take that
down so I can explain this a little
better the one that I chose comes with a
really nice ivory white a light lavender
a kind of oranjee peach a white yellow
kind of a light teal blue but that was
pretty vibrant a nice pure green at
Kapolei Brown and I a black and a sort
of slightly deeper purple so these
colors are they remind me consistency
wise of the ones that I just showed you
in that palette but they are so I don't
know the colors are so rich like I'm
really surprised at how they can do this
and this packaging like this would be a
great gift I feel like like I would love
to get this as a gift or some money or
just buy it for myself but what's nice
about this one is the range of colors
that you get here I mean you could see
how you could do something like a smokey
eye you could do something really really
pretty and bright with some of those
blues and purples so I really look
forward to using this more from what I
have used in it have use just some more
basic colors and I really really like
them they're great highlight shades I
can tell you that for sure so and the
black it's really really black too like
if I touch it right now my finger is
black so you guys are gonna like that a
lot if you go out there and see it and
like I said you're not gonna even have
to pay too much for it it's only six
fifty for this cute little guy nine
colors okay now what I think is the best
or the most impressive for last tada
can we fit it in the screen there we go
this palette is this cost me ten dollars
but like I said I got it with this one
so I got that other one half off so it
was less than $15 for both of these
pretty much and you open it up and
you've got all these colors I think it's
like it's like 56 colors I believe and
it's from Claire's and I'm just gonna
kind of pan it around here there is a
lot of sparkle in most of these not in
all of them if you look at it here like
if you look down vertically kind of look
down the line here's like a section that
could clearly be smoky like teal blues
dark blues purples to pink to browns to
golds there's so many colors here and
the color payoff is so great I did it
look with these Purple's the other day
and I was in love with it like it just
looks so pretty there is so much color
that comes off of these like you really
wouldn't believe
like you're really not going to probably
start believing it until I do some
tutorials with it but they look sparkly
they really it's strange it's like the
sparkle doesn't even totally come off on
this if you know what I mean like you
put your brush in it and you're going to
get more color than you aren't Sparkle
and like I said some of them are a
little bit more there's a little more
pizazz in them than others but this many
colors having these many this many to
choose from I can tell you right now
it's a lot more vibrant than what you're
seeing on your screen it's it's much
darker than that the colors are so
pretty as I hold it back there you can
kind of see what I'm talking about but
I'm gonna have to wrap this up but I
moral of the story is check out Clare's
eyeshadows they're really really great
and I like them a lot and I think you
guys are gonna like them too Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
