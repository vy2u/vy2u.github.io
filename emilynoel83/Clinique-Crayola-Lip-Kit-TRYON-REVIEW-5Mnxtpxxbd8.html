joining me I am going to be talking
about this set of chubby sticks
I have also got about another chubby
sticks that not too long ago from
Clinique but since getting this and
mentioning that I got this on snapchat I
have had quite a few questions about how
it ended up working out for me so this
is the Clinique and Crayola
collaboration you might call it and I
got the chubby lip crayon box so this is
a set of eight colors in here and
they're not quite full-sized just to
show you first off here's what the
packaging looks like I mean isn't that
just awesome maybe it's like having a
toddler in my life and dealing with
crayons all the time this just really is
exciting for me but the size on me
they're not exactly full-sized so
compare that to a full-size chubby stick
right here you can see it's shorter but
and you can see it's still larger than
like the teeny tiny size that came in
that really long chubby stick set that I
got for Christmas and I'm pretty sure
Clinique also has another grouping of
these that's in a smaller set like maybe
a four or five piece set but I do really
tend to enjoy the chubby sticks I think
they are super wearable very comfortable
on the lips the classic chubby stick is
really like kind of a tinted lip balm
type product to me I find many of the
shapes to be kind of buildable so with
like one pass over your lips you get a
really light amount of color and sort of
a balm like filled but usually even with
the shades that appear to be very sheer
which I'm wearing one of those today
with a little bit of building up you can
get quite a bit more colored but what
was really interesting to me about this
set is that not only are you getting
five of just the regular chubby sticks
you're also getting three of the chubby
stick intense
so the first one here the brick red
fuzzy-wuzzy and red violet are all the
intense version and I think you can see
in this lineup on my hand those do have
just a little bit more color pop to them
I would describe the chubby stick
intense formula as more like a cream
lipstick and you're going to get full
color pretty much with one pass over
your lips and I think all of these
shades have the potential to give you a
little bit of shine especially
the onset like when they're freshly
applied but with just a little bit of
where that shine kind of goes down a bit
as any lip product tends to do with a
little bit of time but I find that even
as the shine sort of starts to exit the
equation I still have a lot of moisture
on my lips with the intense version with
the regular Chevy stick version that
feels more like a tended lip balm like I
said I mean they just have this really
kind of buttery comfortable feel on my
lip and I'm feeling that even when I'm
not seeing a kind of shine so I'm going
to go through all of them just on my
lips show you the lip swatch and sort of
describe them all for you and then I
want to mention a few dupes at least
that I've been able to identify with
what I currently own from the chubby
stick line I don't own every shade that
they've got so this might be kind of an
incomplete comparison but just based on
the ones I already have I have noticed a
little bit of overlap so I'll point
those out here but let's go through the
Tryon brick red is the first shade in
the box and this is one of the intense
versions and it's a really pretty red I
don't know that I'd even call it so much
a brick red it seems to me like kind of
just a true red and it is a little
different from the chubby stick and
mightiest maraschino it's not the exact
same tone as that so I like to see that
a little bit of difference there but I
think that's a beautiful shade and then
while strawberry is just your sheer take
on red it is buildable you know you can
add some more color see more red out of
this but it's definitely just a softer
take on Red Mango Tango is going to be a
pretty sheer quarrel I think going into
spring times this kind of shade is
awesome to have if you're a little bit
hesitant about wearing oranges I think
this is a really soft easy take on
orange and then I was so surprised with
how much I love melon this is kind of a
soft pink but it's like a soft warm pink
very very pretty and honestly sort of
surprised at how much that does show up
on my lips considering how white the
color is and then the shade called
mahvelous is probably the chubby stick
just the classic version in this box
that has the most color intensity to it
and to me it feels just like a soft
berry super wearable I have this kind of
shade many times over in my bag
collection I still like this one but
it's kind of probably a common shade for
those of us who do love the berries and
in the shade I've been wearing
throughout the video is the pink sherbet
and this is your kind of soft cool pink
whereas melon had a little more warmth
to the pinky shade this one I think it
is a beautiful cool pink while still
being wearable not being too like cotton
candy and light and chalky
it has just a really pretty look on the
lips I love that shade now the color
felt fuzzy-wuzzy this is going to be the
one shade in the box that has like a
little bit of frost to it and it's a
neutral shade kind of a honey type color
and I actually think it looks gorgeous
on the lips the frost is not out of
control you're not seeing actual like
bits of sparkle but it just has a slight
like metallic nature to it and I wasn't
thinking I loved it so much but I think
for the fact that the formula is still
so moisturizing it doesn't end up making
my lips look dry and then the last shade
in the box another one of the intense
versions this is called red violet and
it's a beautiful rich deep berry shade
as I said with this intense variety I
mean you're going to put them on and
have full on color intensity right away
whereas with the regular chubby sticks
you might have to build them up a little
bit more to see more color but those are
the eight shades in the box and I really
do think they're beautiful there's not
any one shade that I can't see myself
wearing I mean I've got some favorites
in there I really like the three intense
versions and I also love the pink
sherbet shade which I chose to wear
during this video really like Mango
Tango as well that sheer orange and
melon melon is beautiful too if I may I
just want to point out the several
shades that I already had that I thought
were almost identical to several shades
in this box something very similar to
melon is this shade called mighty mimosa
so I'll just draw a little swatch below
it so you can kind of see for yourself
how close those are and just to look at
the sticks to the colors just look very
similar so if you already own mighty
mimosa and you're very interested in the
melon
I was describing they are like pretty
banks and learn also the color called
whoppin watermelon from the regular line
is very very similar to the color I'm
wearing that's pink sherbet right there
the one I'm wearing the swatch of it is
the watermelon shade right below it too
just very similar sheer pink and then I
want to show you grandest grape here
right below red violet I mean those two
just seemed like dead-on dupes for one
another and grandest grape is one of the
chubby sick intense versions so those
are the three that I already owned that
I thought really matched up to certain
ones in this set if you already have
those and love them then you might
welcome you know the fact of having more
of those in this kit or if you're one
who is not a fan of overlap in any form
or fashion that might be kind of a
disappointment to you and other people
who might have tons of these might even
find more overlap potentially but those
are the three that I could see oh and
all I kind of see this as a collectors
type thing like if you're a huge fan of
the chubby sticks I think you're going
to love just the cuteness and the
novelty of the set or if you love your
Crayola Crayons I mean I'm picturing
like this set would be an awesome gift
for the elementary art teacher in your
life I wouldn't that be adorable or
really any teacher particularly as young
kids I think that would be such a fun
little gift to give either in this
larger box or the smaller kit that they
have or you can buy these individually
as well but this box itself is going to
run you forty-nine fifty I'm very
pleased with the purchase myself because
I look at every shade and I say yeah I'm
going to wear all of those just the
product packaging is really cute too you
know they've got the little Crayola like
design happening on the stick itself and
I just think it's really fun I'd love to
hear what you think if you've tried this
kit or any of the other shades in this
Clinique Crayola collection I think
again number one it is very giftable
because everything in here is just so
wearable there's not any shade in here
that's completely off the wall and most
of the shades you know like I said are
in the regular chubby stick formula
which is kind of sheer flash buildable
and I think it's for the person who just
enjoys an all-around comfortable easy
lip product
you know these feel very bomb like
whether you were an intense one or one
of the regular ones they just have a
nice smoothness a nice moisturizing
quality on the lips so I am a fan so
that might take thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
