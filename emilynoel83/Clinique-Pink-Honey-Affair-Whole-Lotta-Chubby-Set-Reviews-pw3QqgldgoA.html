do a little two-in-one product review
for you today on a couple of things from
Clinique I was just at that place where
I was ready to talk about both of them
so I thought I'd lump them into the same
video but I've got these two thingies
here this is the whole lot of chubby set
so you're getting a bunch of their
chubby sticks it's like a chubby stick
variety pack and then they have what I
believe is a new palette called a pink
honey affair and I have talked about the
black honey a fair palette they're all
about shadow a color palette so I was
kind of interested to try this one this
is what it looks like you've got a
mirror it's a very compact design and I
do love that because I know I traveled
with my black anyone a lot over like
Christmas last year and it was just so
so handy because it took up no room it's
a sturdy palette I wasn't worried about
it breaking and with the black honey
affair as you can see I was able to get
quite a variety of looks I could go a
little bit purpley and then I had just a
nice classic spectrum of neutrals as
well from warm to cool all in one really
small palette so I love this I've raved
about this and just in terms of the
quality of Clinique shadows all around I
feel like they're very strong um they're
pigmented they don't seem to generate a
lot of Fallout but they also have really
great staying power and I know this kind
of varies person to person like what
your eyeshadows staying power struggle
might be some people even if they're
using powder shadows they'll notice
creasing with them and that's kind of an
oily lid issue I don't really have super
oily lids but sometimes that's an issue
I'll have with cream shadows but tell
you about powders it'll be more so
fading that's what I'm looking for like
when I'm trying out eyeshadows and I'm
looking at staying power I'm always
using a base and bases and primers
definitely help but still there are some
shadows that really seem to be able to
adhere and they last and they look very
true to color like from the way things
started to the end of the date and then
there are some where you just feel like
the color intensity has faded some and
with my Clinique shadows I really feel
like they don't fade and I'd love to
hear your feedback if you've also tried
Clinique shadows do you feel this way
too because I
feel like that's a unique characteristic
about these now what's not so unique
would probably be the color selection in
this pink honey affair palette the pinky
shades that you do get in here are more
toward the light end and they're just
really like kind of barely there Pink's
in my opinion and for some people you
might be loving that because you don't
really want all-out pinks like I
wouldn't say they're as pinky as the
pink toned or rosy tone shades in the
Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I would call
this the softest take on pink eyeshadow
and then you've got other shades you can
kind of mix in you know soft mattes that
you can put in the crease there's a nice
deep dark matte Brown there's a dark
shimmery Brown right here some of these
shades you may have in other palettes
and I'll put up the little guide that's
on the back and it tells you you know
some of these are from other palettes
some of these are maybe singles just on
their own I really like the balance of
matte shimmer light to dark
I don't really feel like there's a super
weak shade in this kit if there is one
that shows up a little more on the sheer
side it's probably this lightest one
right here it's got a little shimmer and
sometimes when I use that I feel like I
need to build it a bit but everything
else is really nice there's a pretty
like lighter kind of pinky taupey shade
and then a deeper taupe in here so I
think the taupe lovers in general will
probably kind of gravitate toward this
color scheme and like it but I just feel
like I have to point out it's not nearly
as unique of a palette as my black honey
affair I like this one more I feel I can
do more things with it it's just it just
stands out more to me personally but I
wanted to show you these products in
action and I put a primer on my lid and
then I just went in with the lightest
shade around the inner corner and then I
went with the most pinky shade in this
palette so you can see how this goes on
and I put that just with the sponge tip
on about half of my lid and you can see
it's got some shimmer it's not like
all-out super metallic but that's
probably the most shimmery shade in the
palette then I use this kind of soft
matte Brown in my crease just to deepen
things up there I blend it above with
some more of the pinky shade and then
put the lightest shade under my brow is
my highlight I use the really
dark warm brown that has a little bit of
shimmer in it and I actually covered
about half the lid with that shade and I
also took it on my lower lash line just
smudge you with a pencil brush and then
I used a light liner on the lower inner
rim and a dark brown liner on the upper
lash line mascara top and bottom some
false lashes just an example of the
classic kind of look that you can get
with this palette but I really wanted to
show off what I saw is probably the most
pinky shade so you can see that really
all in all that you can see the little
pink tone twist but it's very subtle and
Clinique offers a bunch of different
eight pan palettes like this there's not
just the black honey affair they also
have like I think where everywhere
Gray's where everywhere Browns I think
there may even be aware everywhere pinks
that may or may not have a little more
pink tone than this one but I do think
the clinic shadows are worth trying I
don't think you'll be disappointed by
their quality or their staying power
it's going to be a personal preference
thing as far as what kinds of colors
you're drawn to now the other thing I
want to talk about is this whole lot of
chubby set and this is you know one of
their little holiday kits the only thing
I've had experience with from the chubby
stick line are a few of their chubby
stick intense like jumbo pencil type
things and I really have liked them and
they're bold color they're non shimmery
at least all the ones I've tried I kind
of see these as an alternative for
someone who might like tarte lipsurgence
but doesn't like any of the minty scent
or flavor you know that slightly tingly
feel because these are totally unscented
at least to me although I have a cold
but I'm pretty sure I'm not smelling a
darn thing but basically with these lip
colors you're getting three different
intensities one of them really surprised
me it's the chubby stick baby tint and
so this version when I look at it I feel
like that looks kind of like a
transparent type balm you know even
though it looks a little bit Orange E or
Coral it just seems to be the kind of
thing where I would imagine that going
on with like next to no color on my lips
and it doesn't swatch very much very
intensely on the hand either but once I
apply this to my lips I'm really
surprised by the amount of color it
gives off it really behaves a lot like
the genesee quoi vitality lip flush from
it cosmetics it looks like some of them
be super sheer but then it really has
color once you put it on the lips it's
not quite as orange E as the packaging
might lead you to believe I think comes
off more as a sheer pink the shade name
is pop and poppy it's pretty it's
something I'll use I find it very
comfortable it has a really like easy
bomb like feel and a little bit of shine
so I do like that and I was very
interested to try it the next one that
you get is the one I've been wearing
throughout the video and this is just a
classic chubby stick and the shade is
called curvy candy so here we're talking
classic pink it's going to be a little
fuller coverage on the lips than the
last one but still has I think an
element of Sheerness to it it's
definitely not as opaque is the intense
variety but I think this is a great pink
lip color classic you know it's got that
little bit of brightness to it it has a
really smooth texture I'm not seeing any
shimmer in this product it doesn't give
off a ton of shine but just one of those
really easy no fuss kind of one-step
simple lip colors and then you've got
this great read from the chubby stick
intense line and it really is I mean you
can tell just as you sweep it on more
coverage on the lips
brighter color this is a great holiday
shade so I'm glad they threw something
in there that's got a little more
intensity because the other two both
kind of in the pinky color family so
boom here's your reddish shade I love it
well it's an intense red and it does
have a little shine it's not too greasy
on the lips I'm always like I have a
radar for greasy Reds that I'm worried
about drifting and being hard to manage
and maintain keep an eye on this one
doesn't go too far in that direction so
I do like that but it's definitely not a
matte shade that I won't be able to show
you today in actual application I can
swatch it for you but I didn't want to
apply it alongside the palette because I
wanted you to see how that palette
worked just standing alone but they give
you one of these chubby sticks for eyes
and it's in the shade bountiful beige so
it's a pretty champagne kind of shimmer
I see a little bit of peach in this
like golden peach when I swatch it I
have used this on the eyes before it's
pretty it's brightening it can be a nice
kind of spot lighting shade if you just
wanted to put a little under the brow or
around the inner corner I have even used
this as a highlight on my cheeks and it
has you know maybe a little more sparkle
that I'm looking for in that aspect but
it could be used that way if you want to
one thing to note about this is I don't
feel like it completely sets I can leave
for example a swatch just on my hand for
you know a good 5 minutes and then go
back to rub over it and because this has
some sparkle in and I feel like I'm able
to rub over and kind of pull some of
that sparkle away I'm not sure if every
chubby stick for eyes has shimmer and
there may be some that don't and it
might be a slightly different formula
and maybe a little different story there
for the staying power but this one if I
wore this alone I would not be surprised
if I saw some fading with it
but one way that all probably use it is
more like I said spotlighting different
areas or maybe as a base to some other
shadows so then we've got this chubby
stick cheek color in the shade amped-up
apple and i really like this i love the
shade we're talking like kind of a soft
mauve color here with this one and I
like the texture a lot I think it's very
easy to work with in my application I
just you know popped it on right from
the stick and blended it out with my
fingers and I had no problem with it so
application was easy enough it's a
pretty shade and then number three I
love the fact that it doesn't stay
sticky on my cheeks like that's the last
layer of makeup I have on my face and it
still feels pretty consistent with
everything else I'm wearing this is just
a very simple no-brainer product I like
that they put a shade in here that I
think is buildable so you can add a
little more color achieve a bit more
depth if you want it and this is
probably one of my favorite parts of the
kit and then I don't know it's between
the two lip colors I really do like this
pink I don't know might like the red
just a little more so this whole lot of
chubby kit I would say if you're like me
and you're kind of a product sampling
junkie and you're just intrigued by
trying some different formats of
products this may be worth it for you I
don't think this is necessarily
must-have for everyone because while the
baby tint and the Chevy's stick and the
chubby stick and tents were pretty I
don't think they're incredibly unique
there are tons of jumbo lip pencils on
the market these days a lot of them are
very comfortable on the lips as well and
I like these I'll definitely use these
but it's not like your only opportunity
to experience something like this is
through this kit because let's face it
there's a lot out there
overall the shadow stick for eyes was
just okay for me but I really did like
on the cheek tint so just wanted to
share my experiences with you on these
couple different Clinique items I would
love to hear your feedback in the
comments section on how these things
have worked out for you and thank you so
much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
