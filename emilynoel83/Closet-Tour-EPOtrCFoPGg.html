this video I am joining you right now
from a just outside my closet I thought
it would be fun to do kind of a closet
tour because for the first time probably
in my life I have actually got a closet
that is big enough to really accommodate
everything I have and clothes wise and
accessories wise shoes and all that and
I've gotten to implement some different
organizational and storage strategies
that you might be able to get some ideas
from or maybe you can give me even more
ideas because I you know it's a
continuing need to keep everything
straight and organized and whatnot but I
thought I would just show you inside and
let you see what I'm doing okay walking
in you can see there's a decent amount
of space in here just I mean it's
definitely a walk-in closet it has just
kind of an overview here I have a rack
on the left side an upper rack a lower
rack that go long the length of the
closet and then another rack over there
with shelves and stuff on top so
immediately to your left as you walk in
I've taken this little three drawer
basically mini mini dresser I kind of
use this as a bedside table in my old
bedroom in the apartment but I brought
it in here so I could continue to store
some things and as you can see it's for
the most part kind of empty I've got
some sunglasses in there and I've also
got these are like different kinds of
socks leggings tights and stuff like
that some extra jewelry there and then
down here I've got leggings and even
more tights and stuff the sort of tackle
box type thing it's something that I've
had for a while I don't know I may
eventually change this but it's nice
because it has so many compartments so
like four different color jewelry and
stuff like that when I'm in here in the
morning trying to you know figure out
what jewelry I want to put on it's very
quick and easy to coordinate that with
my outfit so I have that there I have
this little guy that I think Tyler got
me this
one Christmas and so it's just kind of
like a mini jewelry armoire you have a
place for your smaller necklaces and
stuff these little drawers pull out for
like my larger ear rings and for
earrings bracelets and more bracelets so
this top part lifts up there's a mirror
and you know you can store more earrings
this is kind of like a almost like a
travel little jewelry box there over
here you see hair hanging I know you
guys won't get creeped out by this but
other people that aren't used to seeing
hair extensions might think it's a
little weird basically what this is is
just a skirt hanger and I have to clip
in extensions I both from the Ken pavis
Jessica Simpson hair extension line I
guess called hairdo and this one is the
straighter one the bump up the volume
and then down below I have the longer
wavy extension so that's there I have
this thing is actually to store shoes in
but my mom thought it might be a good
idea to store my purses in there as well
so I've got purses on both sides of that
one and I've got more purses in this one
as well so you can see you know they
just fit in there nice for smaller bags
I've got bigger bags somewhere else and
then for shoes I've got two of these
pretty much filled up here just storing
my shoes so if you I mean even when I
had a more cramped closet I used these
because I just think it really stores a
lot of stuff and it just you know
definitely gives you more space I've got
one here kind of empty waiting in the
wings for more stuff a couple of tubs up
here that I'm not using a whole lot
right now because they have some
sweaters in it I've got some jeans
stacked up over there some hats up top
across this main part here I'm going to
step out actually of the closet so you
can see that more I've kind of
color-coordinated that but that's a lot
of my jackets that I use for the news
for anchoring so I've got whites tans
you know bright I love bright colors
they come off really well on TV so
just a bunch of different jackets there
that I've acquired over time and then
down below my shirts are all
color-coordinated this is just a mix of
pretty much everything I have so some of
this stuff is work appropriate and some
of it is more you know fun stuff but I
think putting it there by color just
helps me find what I want what I want it
there so over here I've got like my
dress pants and these pants hangers are
a great way to keep all that organized
because you can just you know store like
four or five pairs of pants in one area
so that's great I've got some bigger
bags up high here along this shelf I'll
shut the door and then down here I've
got skirts
and this whole area is dresses so some
more formal dresses some just casual
dresses I've got quite a few sweater
dresses that was something I was big
into this past year some extra hangers
I've got these little hanging things
here for like scarves and ribbons and
whatever things I might use as belts and
then a whole belt hanger thing there
that's I think probably actually meant
to be like a tie hanger or something and
then on the back of the door is just
something again that I brought back from
the apartment this is sort of a little
makeshift necklace hanger basically what
we've done here this is this is just
kind of like an organizer thing this
black part but I've hung another one of
those things that may have been a tie
hanger at one time and then I've hung
some of my larger chunkier necklaces
here that aren't going to necessarily
get so tangled up so that is basically
the storage of my closet guides I've got
kind of a jewelry station it's sort of
set up so I could stand to here and just
kind of turn in a circle and basically
get myself ready for the day so I hope
this was somewhat interesting to you if
you have suggestions for me or if you
have questions for me just let me know
thanks so much for joining me and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
