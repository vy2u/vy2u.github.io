you this review of the Coastal Scents 78
color palette it is so awesome I have
had it for a little while now and I've
been testing out different looks so I
feel like I have used it enough to do a
review on it and I am totally gonna do
some tutorials with this because the
colors are so great let me go ahead and
show you what it looks like
look at this oh it's got so many colors
and and just I mean uh I hope alright I
can tell you right now the camera is not
doing it justice and as far as the
intensity because these colors are truly
truly pigmented more pigmented than the
Claire's palettes so much variety and
one of my favorite things about this as
far as the eyeshadows are concerned is
that some of them are shimmery some of
them are matte you know it's a nice
variety as far as that's concerned it's
like each color is truly an individual
color it's not just like let's throw a
glitter on top everything and see what
happens you know it's really a nice
palette and you do get a you do get a
decent size mirror at the top and you
have a couple little applicators at the
top as well I wanted to show you real
quickly some swatches that I did with
some of the colors and I'm not sure how
well it's coming off here because I
can't quite get my hand situated just
right but um it's I mean the colors are
really vibrant like I mean the the pink
to Purple's that turquoise blue I've
used several times now and it's really
gorgeous
and then that
color I mean they're so pretty and this
is just you know without a lot of effort
just taking a quick swipe up then
they're on my hand so you can imagine
you know the kind of color payoff you're
gonna get on your if you use these on
your eyes so and what's neat about this
palette also because there is an 88
color palette that currently I guess
they're working to get it restocked and
I really like to try that but I am like
totally satisfied with this one because
as you look up at the top here I'm going
to talk about these eyeshadows these
little circular ones first they're about
the size of a dime and what you've got
I'm having trouble here this first
section is gives you some nice yellows
if it's not showing up real well but
these are some really nice yellows and
golds and neutrals and so they're in
like their own little 10 color families
here so here's a set of ten that's kind
of neutral then we get into some Browns
and from light to some very nice
chocolate browns the next set over
you've got ten different shades of blues
from turquoise to getting into more
purpley blues and then we've got a nice
set of green from blue green to lime
green to everything in between next
you've got like hot pink and purple and
those are gonna be so so pretty I have
used oh yeah I have used a couple of
these when I've been messing around with
this and then at the end you've got some
reds and oranges and then a row of some
really pretty like Burgundy's almost
that last row is so unique yeah a lot of
these colors are very different
different than what you would find in a
typical palette and
do you guys ever get frustrated when
you've got some big pallet or somebody's
giving you like a gift palette and it's
like three of the colors in a row look
like almost exactly the same thing I
find that to be kind of frustrating it's
like why did they even bother you know
why did this have to be an eight zillion
color palette and when half of these
colors look exactly the same but these
especially if you can get this in person
and see it close-up or even see the
picture on the website each color is
honestly its own color some are shimmery
some are matte you know they're all
their own thing and I love that and then
we haven't even talked about down below
what you've got here you've got two four
six eight ten twelve you've got twelve
neutral colors and they're all a little
these are all kind of metallic and the
black down here is extremely black I
promise you that and you get a nice
white some Silver's and then here you've
got like some Browns to like a nice nice
kind of medium color coppery goals and
things like that and then below that
you've got six blushes and if you can
see these in person I wish you could uh
oh we just had a blue one fall out I
guess that's not a good sign we'll put
them back in
you need to add some glue to that one
but all these blushes are really neat
because they're tiny unique colors this
is like there's a plum here a nice kind
of a reddish color actually that'll be
kind of fun to use and then a couple
neutrals on either end so this is going
to be such a fun palette to experiment
with I've only scratched the surface but
I have enough you know looked at it
enough to be able to say that this is
really really awesome so I am so eager
to do some tutorials for you guys with
this palette that I'm hiding behind and
I think you're going to love it if
you've got it if you do have it like
share a comment tell me what you liked
about it what looks you're doing with it
because it's really the possibilities
are endless with something like that
it's the 78th color palette it costs
I believe it costs right around $20 on
Coastal Scents comm and they do have
some other kinds of palettes on the
website that you can check out but like
I said the 88 color palette is still in
production right now but there are some
others if you are interested so check it
out thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
