joining me for this video I'm kind of
excited because not only are you gonna
get a tutorial on this look that I have
here on my eyes right now but I am going
to be reviewing the 88 warm palette so
this is a new product from Coastal
Scents you may be familiar with the 88
palettes they already have that are the
88 shimmer or the 88 matte which is just
a whole array of super colorful shades
well with this palette if you you know
maybe aren't so much into the bright
colors but you love a good smokey eye or
a good brown eye hello you can do all of
that with this palette you've got all
the shades sort of over here to get that
smoky eye you might be after there's a
great matte black here that is it's
wonderful to use and then up in here it
may be getting kind of washed down on
camera but what you've got is a lot of
different silvery shades some white
shades cream shades here in the middle
um you've got some nice warm colors that
sort of have some purpley and reddish
undertones which make it for a very
interesting color some of those I'm
going to be using in this tutorial
coming up here I'm really excited about
that and we've got some kind of Browns
that are more of a instead of the cool
Browns they're kind of the warm Browns
in here some gorgeous gold shades and
then we head over to this side where
you've got a nice nice array right here
in this little sector the wonderful
matte Brown shades all tones and
something that you may notice as you
look at this palette if I can show it to
you a little bit more closely there's a
real variation in the textures and the
finish that you will get with these
shadows there are plenty of matte shades
but there's a lot of shimmer shades
there's a lot of very high shimmer
shades in this and I mean if you're the
type of person maybe you've gotten the
say the 88 one of the 88 palettes that
it has more of the colorful shades in it
and you just find yourself gravitating
toward those neutrals more maybe you
just feel like you're going to get a lot
more good out of those
for work or you know you're just more
comfortable wearing neutral tones this
may be a great choice for you now
Coastal Scents also has the I believe
it's a 28 neutral palette where the
shadows are going to be bigger than
these these are about the size of a dime
right here but if you got that one on
you would be getting some bigger shapes
but you wouldn't get quite the variety
in terms of all of these great own
shadows okay so you're really getting
the full spectrum here and when I say
you know the Browns and smoky looks yes
you can do that but the tutorial I'm
going to show you is gonna prove that
you can get a really fun twist on a warm
warm I look using some of the Burgundy's
in here some of the more unusual shades
like I mean there's there's some unique
colors I'm gonna be using one that's
like a plum it's it's it's very similar
to tracks by Mac it's got like that
plummy shade with golden undertones so
there's some very unique color
combinations within each shadow that
make them really fun to use and over the
course of the past week I have used this
one palette every day for work and I've
kind of challenged myself to do a little
different look every day and I was
really able to do that and so this is
probably right now one of my favorite
Coastal Scents palettes I really love
just the creativity they allow you to
have by so many having so many different
shades but like I said if your comfort
zone is really with these neutral shades
and you want something that you know can
take you you can use on a daily basis
for work this is a phenomenal palette to
have and like I said shimmery matte you
name it you can get a zillion different
eye looks out of this so I'm a big fan
and you can check it out on Coastal
Scents website I'll have the information
over there in the sidebar and for now I
will turn it over to my tutorial on this
look that I'm wearing right now and it's
just sort of a natural spin on it hang
around till the end of the video because
I will show some pictures of a more
dramatic twist on the very same look
keep on the first step is to apply a
primer to your eyelid I used my l'oreal
decrease primer and then i'm gonna go to
my warm palette and use this kind of
rosy shade right here I'm gonna use that
all over my lid and then I'm gonna go
over towards one of these more you know
kind of gold any butter cream kind of
colors I'm gonna use that all over my
lid and then just sort of highlight the
inner part with that creamy shade there
we're going to take we're gonna use a
couple of shades I'm just gonna show
them both to you first the first one
being this really unique color it's like
a purpley shade with some golden
undertones and then this pretty burgundy
plum right down here so that's those
will be the shades I'm using as I refer
to these kind of plummy Brown shades so
that first one that I showed you the one
that's not quite so dark and matte I'm
gonna just use a medium sized crease
brush and apply that all over the crease
just kind of giving myself that wash of
color there
it's really blendable and just kind of
gives you a really natural look at this
point next I'm going to take my fine
crease brush and I'm gonna use that more
matte burgundy plum shade and we're
gonna use this to sort of define the
crease just a little bit more it just
shows the versatility of this palette
while there are a lot of great smokey
shades a lot of great Browns you also
have the opportunity to use some really
unique colors here so um yeah just get
that kind of go over the crease and then
kind of work it out just a little bit
practically like the outer V and just
kind of getting this halo of warm color
here okay and then if you want go ahead
and take a fluffy brush and kind of work
it over the outer edges of that so it
can be a little bit more blended and
then we're gonna take there's a matte
black shade in this and just so we all
can kind of envision what that is so I'm
not gonna lift up my palette again but
it's just a the matte black color in
this palette and we're just gonna use
that at the outer half outer third maybe
of our crease and for that we are
creating more of that defined outer V
these are so easy to blend and so
pigmented really really happy with that
aspect of this palette okay
so there you go you can see we've kind
of developed that outer V there and
that's pretty much the shadow look right
there it comes together really nicely
one other thing I'm going to do remember
the the kind of matte burgundy plum
shade um I get some of that actually on
my fluffy brush and a sort of a
finishing touch just to further warm up
this area I'm just gonna go over that
again just like that I love that warmth
there and then I'm gonna use a lighter
color up in here I'm going to use the
sort of butter cream shade
that I used all over the lid primarily
on the inner half and just use that up
above here
hope you enjoy this look this is a
pretty natural take on it but I just
wanted to sort of show that even though
this palette is packed with great shades
for a smoky eye or just a neutral Brown
eye you can also use some of these
shades just to get a super warm kind of
that burgundy plum tone to the eye and
it turns out to be so natural it's
strange because you think oh I might
look more natural just gray or just the
brown but it's amazing how these plum
and burgundy tones really pick up on the
natural shades that are in our skin so
when we use that as our contour shade we
end up getting a really natural warm
look around the eye area so I enjoy the
effect of that and I will include some
pictures at the end here of a more
dramatic take on this look as well I the
night before I had done it and kind of
discovered some of these shades in the
palette and I was like oh wow I could do
a more natural look for a tutorial on
this as well so on my lips I am wearing
my wet and wild Brandywine lip liner
it's just kind of a neutrally sort of I
don't know reddish brown shade actually
and then I topped it off with this Too
Faced mirror mirror lip gloss and I'm
perfect so on anyway I hope you enjoyed
the look everything else on my face is
everyday minerals just use the intensive
foundation all over and the everyday
bronzer and the salon fun blush so thank
you guys so much for watching and I have
a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
