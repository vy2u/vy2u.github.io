in for this video and thank you so much
for being a subscriber on my channel I
was so excited yesterday when I hit
20,000 subscribers I'm now more than
20,000 subscribers and I think is just
incredible and unexpected and just
something I did not think was really
going to happen but I am so thrilled and
me and Tyler going to shoot a really fun
like sellable celebratory mood you know
at some point when he has time so it's
coming don't worry in the meantime I
wanted to share with you a product that
I sort of highlighted in one of my
previous tutorials and it is this lovely
black clutch here but actually this is
full of makeup brushes this is from
Coastal Scents and it rolls out to hold
all of these brushes you can see how
many there are there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 brushes in this
thing
okay so this is a really really cool way
to store them all and have them all in
one place so what I'm gonna do is go
ahead and walk you through each of the
brushes and why I like them and then
I'll kind of talk over who I think this
would be a really good product for okay
so anyway as I said it unwrapped sand
this is a nice light kind of snake skin
looking and exterior there so it's not
gonna go dirty it's nice and shiny you
can just wipe it right off if you got
something on it and then on the inside
you have all of these nice little slots
here for brushes to go in and the size
of them kind of varies a little bit so
if you had a smaller brush like if you
wanted to take one of these out you
didn't use one a whole lot but you had
another brush you wanted to sub in and
just keep it in here I mean this holds
15 brushes so if you don't like all 15
that it comes with then you can put in
whatever you want to sub in for those
few that you don't like so anyway to
show you a brush here let's see what
kind of what brand of brushes does this
remind you of these look exactly like
Smashbox brushes right down to the
little detailing right there on the
ferrule they feel like Smashbox brushes
and I
have a small handful of those I probably
have like five Smashbox brushes they're
nicely made there's nice weight to them
this is the biggest brush in the set and
this would be your powder brush this is
probably these first three that I'm
going to talk about are my favorites in
the whole thing and they are the three
really nice face brushes so this is
great for your all-over
powder foundation or not powder well I
guess you could use it for like a
mineral powder foundation but what more
what I was thinking was the palette
loose powder to set your makeup bronzer
highlighter things like that this is a
great great size you can see how you
know nice and big and full it is it's
got a nice tapered shape that means that
these bristles on the outside are gonna
be shorter and it's not gonna be cut
blunt right across it's super soft this
has been what I've been using as my
powder brush now ever since I've gotten
this and I've been playing around with
it so that's a great brush then you have
a blush brush which basically just think
of downsizing the powder one and then
you've got the blush brush you look at
it from the side it does have that same
tapered effect this is a lot like my
Revlon blush breast the blush brush that
you'll see me using in my tutorials it's
just about the same size it's maybe just
a hair smaller and I like it you know
for whether you want to contour with it
or just put it on the apples of your
cheeks it's a nice nice brush again
nicely nice and soft good shape nice
fullness to it I really can't say
anything bad about that one
the next brush you have in size is very
comparable to the one I just showed you
but it has that nice angle effect to it
so a lot of people like to use this kind
of brush for contouring and I do too I
think it's great for using those you
know deeper bronzers or blushes that can
kind of double as a contouring color and
basically you know you just kind of use
that shape to your advantage and it
runs really nicely right under your
cheekbone to apply that contour and
basically you're dealing with a little
less fluff on the brush you know it's a
little it's holding together a little
bit more and so you're gonna get a more
dense application of colors so think
about areas you want to contour even if
it's the side of your nose you know you
can still get a really concentrated
application of color with this while
still having that ability to blend over
it and that kind of thing next brush is
one that I haven't yet used in this set
to apply liquid foundation but this is a
pretty typical liquid foundation brush I
believe I already even have one from
Coastal Scents
that's a liquid foundation brush that is
practically like this and I can tell you
it works I mean it works wonderfully
well what you're dealing with here are
these synthetic bristles and it's just
you know it's nice and concentrated
there they're dense they're soft I mean
and this is a good size sometimes you'll
get these foundation brushes and
honestly they're too skinny to do the
work I think this is a good size I mean
this is what I would use on my face if I
were choosing to apply my liquid
foundation which is usually what you
would use this for but my favourite
purpose for a brush like this a flat
brush like that is to use a use it with
a stick foundation those are kind of a
little bit more thick and creamy and I
think they work really well with a dense
flat brush like this for blending so you
have that there now then we're getting
into some and eye brushes and this next
brush is one that I have never had it is
so unique and different and this is
called on the website the DOE foot
eyeshadow applicator so it's about that
big around and then it's it's angled
okay it's cut blunt instead of being cut
like you know with like I said with
those shorter bristles on the outside
it's cut straight but at an angle
you know what I mean it's cut all the
way across blunt but it's cut angled and
so basically I don't have a ton of use
for this brush it's nice I mean it's
it's nice for applying a all-over color
up in here it's nice for blending things
out but
same time it's like for packing on
colored you want something a little bit
flatter so I wouldn't use this too like
cat color on my eyelid a nice wash of
color perhaps but I don't have a whole
lot of use for a brush that is cut blunt
like that at an angle for the eye area
next you've got an eyeshadow brush and
if you're looking at this and you're
familiar with elf this is very very
close to the elf eyeshadow brush that I
love so much it's softer it's more um
it's more a little more densely packed
but not by much and it's a little bit
wider from here from here to here just a
little more width on that that doesn't
bother me in my eyes um it's really not
bigger by much so this is gonna look I
mean it operates for me exactly like the
elf eyeshadow brush does so I mean
you've got that in the set that's an
essential that's another one of my
favorites because it's such an essential
brush for being able to you see how it's
kind of flat you look at it that way
a little bit flatter it's an essential
brush for packing shadow on your eyelids
so gotta have that and I'm so glad
that's in there um then you've got a
brush that's an interesting size if this
was the I show this is the one I just
showed you and then you've got this one
which is rather large and I would say
this is good for you know getting that
color all over you know your your brow
bone area applying a highlight or at all
over wash of color I like it better than
that yo foot applicator that I just
showed you because I like the tapered
bristles there on side shorter on the
sides longer up in the middle but
another great idea for this brush this
is a really nice size if you were going
to put concealer around your eye and
then set that concealer with some powder
this is really really nice for that it's
it's a small enough size to where you
can get in there where you need to go
and even if you were touching something
up and you didn't want to mess up my
makeup or get light colored powder all
over your eye makeup you don't have to
feel like oh I've got it going with my
powder brush to you
powder to set my eye concealer use a
smaller brush like this that still is a
little bit fluffy so you're not gonna
get it to like caked on or anything but
it's a nice way to just Pat in there
around your eye area and set concealer
so that's one of those that's kind of
labeled as an eye brush but I think it
definitely has an alternate use next one
is just a classic brush that everyone
needs to have a it's one that has the
glass comb and the brow brush here on
side and this is pretty standard like
the same kind of brush of this type that
you're gonna find anywhere it's great
that it's included in this collection
because I feel it is so important I
mainly use this side with a little brush
I use that daily to brush my eyebrows
down into place after I put a clear gel
on them we have this flat eyeliner brush
I'm gonna go ahead and show you the
other eyeliner brush that's in this set
just for comparison purposes these are
both eyeliner brushes this one if you
can look really close at it I'm not sure
if you see how it's almost a little bit
fluffy at the end the it's not a real
sharp cut like say this one is see how
that cut is just absolutely there is not
one hair going anywhere other than just
right in that little you know dense
portion there and this is a tank one
eyeliner brush this angled brush is the
perfect size I like using this because
it makes my cream liners manageable I've
used this with like my L'Oreal hip cream
liner and it is just a great size you
can see about how big that is up next to
my eye so very nice for those cream
liners because it maintains its shape
like that now back to this one that I
talked about a second ago it's a little
bit fluffier it's got a little more give
to it it's got a little more movement in
the brush I like using this if I want a
little more diffused look if you wanted
to blend something out a little bit and
you wanted to do it right here in this
under eye area if you wanted to apply a
light shimmery color kind of right in
here or something
it's just nice to have that ultimate
kind of brush to turn to for a liner is
this the most essential brush in the kit
no but is it a nice fresh to have I
would say yes you also get a lip brush
in this set
honestly I'm probably not going to use
this for the fact that it is in a I've
got this nice kind of velvety inner you
know lining here and I don't want to
stick a goopy lip brush back in there
unless I got some kind of little nice
cover for it maybe I could put my brush
guard on it that would be an
interruption but I have a nice lip brush
that I use anyway it's nice for
everybody to have a lip brush as far as
lip brushes go this is nice it's an you
can see it compared to my lips that's
about the size you're dealing with you
could get a nice line around your lips
and then fill it in very easily with
that it just doesn't make a whole lot of
sense being in this kit you know with
other brushes with that velvety lining
and sitting it right on there I wouldn't
I just wouldn't feel good about doing
that so maybe you can kind of wrap it up
with a tissue or something until you had
a chance to clean it off but next brush
you've got is a little concealer brush
this is another one of those brushes
I'll tell you can do you can do double
duty with this whatever you need more
this can be your concealer brush to
excuse me to apply concealer right in
here around your eye or this could be an
eyeshadow brush a really nice flat
shadow brush that you can put right here
in your crease and kind of move it along
there and build that shadow from the
crease and diffuse it out towards your
eyebrows another brush you've got is a
very very small eyeshadow brush this is
let's compare it to the one that I said
you could pack color on all over your
lid I like using the comparison because
you don't have the same frame of
reference there and yeah you could fit
about two and a half of those for the
width of this one so this is going to be
nice to get color right in there on the
inner half of the lid if you like a dark
lid but then you like to go back and put
a little bit of a highlight right here
in the inner part great for that it's
also a nice size if you like too
use your liner a little bit it's great
for that because it stays it's so short
and it's kind of stiff too that you have
is this this little guy it's like a very
miniature fan brush it earns a lot of
cuteness points for me but not a lot of
practical points because it's like what
do you use that for it's kind of stiff
it's actually quite stiff um would I use
it too you know I just if somebody has a
good purpose for this let me know
because I'm not totally sure what I
would use this for and yeah okay the
last brush that you have this is great
this is gonna be great for doing your
outer V it's a small kind of fine crease
brush basically hear me talk about fine
crease brushes all the time for getting
that dark dark color right in there this
will help you build that outer V and
then you take one of the larger brushes
and kind of help blend it out just a
little bit but that is all of the
brushes that I showed you there they all
have that nice red handle that reminds
you of Smashbox brushes and if anybody
is in the know and they just kind of see
you real quickly using one of these
brushes they may think it's a Smashbox
brush but as far as the completeness of
this set if you're watching this and you
have no makeup brushes could you get
this and have everything you needed I
would say almost almost the one thing
that I would like this to have is a
brush like this that's a little bit
bigger a fluffier crease brush that
could help you once you once you put
that concentrated color on with this
that you could run over the border and
just kind of diffuse that all out
because they don't really have that
you've got this doe foot applicator but
like I said I'm not really wild about it
I don't think it's it's almost too big
to really get in there and blend but it
can blend so you could make it with just
this set but you may want to add one in
or swap one out for a you know and
Coastal Scents it's themselves have
plenty of affordable you know singular
brushes that you can buy but
or you could just pick one up at your
local drugstore yeah just a fluffier
crease brush would be nice other than
that you've got all the face brushes you
need from your concealer brush to your
powder brush you are set on face brushes
and you've really got a nice variety of
nice quality eye brushes as well and not
to mention you've got a nice way that
you can travel with them um I don't
think I have a better way to travel with
my brushes than this because this splat
comes down in a small detail here when
you start folding it up you're going to
fold it in once and then again notice
what happens here I don't know how well
you'll be able to see cuz it's black but
this flap goes just a little bit past
that fluffy powder brush so you're not
gonna worry about that brush getting
bent up as it folds over that final time
you know what I mean so it's completely
protected there so that was a little bit
of a concern for me because I'm like oh
that nice fluffy brush is right there at
the end I wonder if it's gonna get
smashed every time I close this but you
closed it up and it's got this little
clasp right there like that and you know
people would think you were just
throwing a person to your you know a
little mini clutch into your bag but
really you've got all your makeup
brushes here makes it easy for me when
I'm doing my makeup because I'm not
searching around for stuff so yes this
is around $40 on Coastal Scents website
and at first you may think $40 okay step
back and think about how much these
individual brushes would be and how much
they would be if you bought much more
expensive ones I mean there are people
that will spend 40 baht dollars on one
brush out there so this is really a nice
deal and to have the way to transport it
all and everything like that so I would
really look into this if you don't have
any brushes if you do have have brushes
and maybe you look at the majority of
your set and you're thinking gosh I'd
like to have some new ones or I really
need some good face brushes go ahead and
get this because these face brushes are
my favorite part of this set and there's
to top it off you've got nice eye
brushes too so thank you guys so much
for tuning in for this video and
listening to my long explanations of
everything but hopefully this gets you a
little more aware of what is out there
in terms of an affordable brush set
and I hope you guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
