pretty good day so far I had a really
funny encounter this morning that I
thought of my YouTube friends would love
to hear about this I was I don't know
how we got on the subject but I started
telling um the guy that was running the
camera today during the morning show we
were doing a cut-in and I was mentioning
how there are like sulfon he said false
eyelashes and he was like oh wow cool
and I was like you know I have some on
right now actually and he was like no
you don't and I was like yeah I do and I
think people have this perception it
just confirmed to me that people had
this perception that false eyelashes
have to be like wacky and unnatural
because he looked at he's like I can't
even see him and so I just thought it
was funny and then like the weather guys
like why you have false eyelashes like
like dudes I wear these probably you
know like three days out of the week on
average but they just so funny like they
had no clue like really what they were
about how you put them on how many
people out there probably wearing them
that they don't know about so it just
cracked me up there so I had to tell you
guys but I am going to be reviewing
something today it is the Coastal Scents
camouflage concealer palette it has ten
shades of creamy concealer in here
so a great wide range from the dark
shades all the way to the light shades I
wore this today on my under eye area so
and I've been testing it out for quite
some time actually using quite a few of
the different shades I've used for
example there are five shades in here
that are workable for me so if you might
find that a little unusual but I have
used this one this one this one this one
and this one right here so um yeah I
mean if you think like oh oh only one's
gonna work for me well chances are a lot
of them are gonna work and you can blend
to you know get a really different tone
if you because you don't necessarily
want like a really light white shade
under your eye you want something that
is gonna match your skin tone so those
circles will be concealed not
highlighted okay but
and this is just a really neat product
and I'm comparing it to something I love
which is the Bobby Brown
creamy concealer kit and corrector which
are products that are very high priced
very high quality though and I use them
on a daily basis and so I compared it to
to this
and while the Bobby Brown says has a
little more moisture to it when you if
you put your finger in it or a brush in
it it has a little bit richer and more
moist quality these while they are nice
and creamy they're not quite as rich if
you were to put some on your hand and
like spread it out it it blends out to a
very smooth consistency not necessarily
like that creamy it's not quite as thick
let's put it that way is the bobbi brown
concealer kit but that can be a good
thing these concealers would work well
on blemishes because they're kind of
that middle ground they're not too thick
but they're not as thin as like a liquid
concealer I like using this type of
concealer in a creamy format on my eye
area because I find it has tends to have
better coverage than those more liquidy
concealers that you might put on with a
wand this would be a great item
primarily for like um someone who's
maybe your skin tone changes from season
to season and you want something to be
able to work with you as time passes or
you've got a lot of good events at
concealing jobs to do on your face maybe
it's redness in one area I think it's
discoloration and another blemishes
under-eye circles because if you'll find
that you will use more than just one
shade here you know because you've got
different problems and not everything
takes a light white concealer I can't
stress that enough
but it's not gonna work it's not gonna
look right it's odds are that lightest
shade just because you think it's really
dark I need a really light shade to
counteract it it's odds are it's gonna
just end up highlighting it more so keep
that in mind
makeup artists I mean for someone to
have all of these shades to work on so
many different you know skin tones for
and it is great coverage I mean I have
circles here I do uh-huh
you can kind of see it more by the
shadow on that eye but I felt like these
did a great job of cover
to give you an example the color I used
today it's it's not picking it up quite
as well but this one is a little bit
more of a peachy it has a little bit of
a pinky undertone kind of like this one
does as well both of these are a little
bit on the pinky side and so that
salmony peachy shade can work well as a
concealer so I'm glad that it has
something in that ballpark there but
just a great variety of tones I would
definitely recommend this to those who
are looking to do makeup on other people
or people who just want to try a great
quality creamy concealer and not and
completely take the guesswork out of
what shade you are because you just buy
this it's a great price a great product
I will continue using this because I'm
you know I don't want to have to buy a
poppy brown all the time when I run out
so this you know will be my go-to
products so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
