quick review on a brush that I've
recently tried and really really love it
for foundation application and it is
this brush from coastal scents and it is
the synthetic black foundation brush and
this is really a different kind of brush
than anything I've ever used most of the
time when you think of a foundation
brush you may think of sort of a really
flat brush like this one from sally
beauty supply you can see if i hold
these side by side this one is actually
somewhat fluffy and i know sometimes
people either like to use maybe a brush
like this or a stippling brush to put
their makeup on or sometimes even a more
dense brush that is somewhat like that
kind of a feel to it but this is sort of
flat and it just really carries the
product well and you get a really really
nice blend on your makeup and I find
that well when I would use the stippling
approach I would almost feel like
sometimes I would get sort of a sheer
application because you were just kind
of gotting it on and with this brush
what I like to do is take my liquid
foundation and just kind of spread it
sort of on my face but not really you
know blend it into all the little areas
and then take this brush and just kind
of really finish it off and I feel like
this is perfect for that task and it's
just got it's really really soft first
off but it's also just so unique in that
it's not a big fluffy brush but it's not
one of these flat pancake brushes either
so and once again I don't I haven't
tried using it where I would just like
put foundation on and put it on my face
I like kind of having sort of a spread
on my face so this this can then
maintain its you know fluffiness I guess
you'd say it doesn't get weighed down
with too much product and then you make
it hard to put all over your face
sometimes I've never been a huge fan of
these flat foundation brushes because I
always felt like I just got a little
streaky with them but with this being
just a little bit fluffier you can
really you know just blend it right in
its it's great for like blending your
foundation up around your hairline or
under your eyes even it's just a
terrific tool for that it's really not
it comes to
sort of a very slightly tapered tip up
here and all these bristles are tapered
along the side so it's not some you know
cut blunt across a foundation brush and
you could probably use this for other
things if you wanted to take some powder
and maybe you know set your under-eye
area or you know it's kind of a
multi-use thing but I really do think
it's great for liquid foundation I was
really happy with the finish I got and
it was nice because I was blending
without feeling like okay I'm blending
so hard I'm taking it back off and
creating a streak so and the price on
this is definitely awesome it's 499 for
this brush on coastal scents calm and
just definitely happy with the way it
works wanted to pass along this quick
review to you sometimes there's brushes
I've tried a lot of good brushes and
sometimes I just don't go ahead into an
individual video on it because I feel
like well it's a nice brush but it's
still kind of similar to other things
that I have this one was just unique
enough that I felt really compelled to
go ahead and do a video on this and did
my foundation with its day yesterday a
day before you know and that's why it
looks a little bit you know if it's it
should be perfectly white there but I
haven't cleaned it just too recently
here but anyway thank you guys so much
for tuning in for my videos and thank
you so much for the support that you
give me whether it's here or Twitter or
Facebook or wherever I feel like the
people that watch these videos I get
that sense that you guys care about
these products like I do as well and
it's just really nice when I get to hear
from you and get to hear your feedback
and constructive comments you know
really do help so thank you so much for
watching this video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
