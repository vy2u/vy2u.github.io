this video this is going to be a review
of something I have been testing out for
what seems like a really long time I've
been testing out a lot of different
shades at the Coastal Scents gel liners
so if you're not familiar with Coastal
Scents the website is Coastal Scents
calm and the way I really came to know
about them was through their makeup
palettes they have some really really
great eyeshadow palettes like 88 shade
eyeshadow palettes and blush palettes
and all that kind of thing for a pretty
affordable price you can try tons of
different colors and really add to your
collection so they've also you know have
a lot of other things that they offer
through their website and one of those
things is gel liners so gel liners have
kind of started to increase in
popularity somewhat it's going beyond
now just the pencil in or the automatic
pencil or the sharpened pencil and the
liquid liners to something you can put
on with a brush and it's in some cases
easier to apply you can sometimes have
more control with it than a typical
liquid and let's pull with it than a
pencil so it's nice to have a gel liner
and what I like about these from Coastal
Scents is that they are so affordable
even more affordable at 695 it's less
than like a l'oreal hip liner would cost
at the drugstore so I just kind of
wanted to walk you through what so my
favorite ones are and they happen to be
the new shades that's what I tried quite
a few of the new colors that they have
out and I just wanted to tell you what
my favorite ones are and I've granted
there were some like there was a bright
pink that I loved and an aqua that I
really liked but I'm also trying to keep
in mind sort of like what's practical
you know for you guys so if I suggest
something like these will be good to
have in your collection because I think
you'll get a lot of use out of them if
anything that was the reason why I
didn't necessarily like certain colors
as well but some of them I well while
many of them work nice as long actual
liners some of them work great as an
eyeshadow base so something you would
put all over your lid or all the way
from your lid to your brow bone in some
cases and then you put your powder
shadows on top and it allows them to
cling more
um to this to this space and it you get
a long wearing look and you get more
vibrancy with your shadows so it's an
all around good thing so that's enough
rambling on that for now i'll go ahead
and show you the shades and i'll talk a
little bit about why i enjoy the
formulation on these so as far as the
ones that i like for a liner my two
favorite shades are exotic and stellar
and exotic to show you the shade here in
the packaging wow this is good lighting
on this and this is sort of a deep brown
with kind of a khaki feel to it it's got
a golden undertone almost a little bit
of an all of the golden look to it but
it's basically you know it's brown and
to show you it's this shade right here
and you can see how it has that slight
metallic finish to it so it's going to
have that little bit of shine but not
too much I have a real thing against I
liners that are two metallic because I
feel like you can be looking and yet
yourself in the mirror and it's like the
eyeliner almost looks done even because
it catches the light way too much so
this just has kind of a nice Sheen to it
but I don't feel like it's overly
metallic but it does have a really
pretty you know underlying shimmery
sparkle to it so that's this one right
here and that is called exotic so if you
like using a lot of neutral colors and
browns and greens and golds and shades
like that I think this would be a great
complement to it because it does have
just that really pretty undertone and if
you put it on in a more thick way you
could still use these darker shades as a
base all over the lid I did that for
halloween with the next shade i'm going
to show you and it worked fantastic so
you can do that these just are a little
more difficult because they are darker
so anyway and what i would use for that
in terms of application is a stiff
angled liner brush Coastal Scents has
plenty of those or even your drugstore
or just one of those small like a
pointed tip brush you can even find some
and like the craft section of Walmart
very very fine tip point to appoint
brushes that can be nice for really
detailed liner really fine lines
so keep that in mind the other one here
was stellar this is probably my favorite
of the two but I really like them both
this is basically a black or deep deep
charcoal gray with sparkle but basically
it's black I feel like it draws on very
dark it's this shade right here and you
can see as it catches the light it's got
some sparkle to it you know it's got a
little bit of a sheen there and this is
just all around great for your black
liner when I say there's some sparkle to
it I mean it's not like you're going to
be able to clearly identify glitter on
your eye but it just might have a little
more of a sheen than you're used to it's
not going to be quite as flat looking as
a typical black liner but here's where
I've just am thrilled with these is the
fact that they do stay I've put them on
my lower lashline go out all day and I
don't have a problem with them bleeding
and you can see I'm rubbing rubbing
rubbing across them and they're not
going anywhere there's nothing on my
finger you know just I mean I'm applying
pressure and they're not smudging so
that's great guys that's really great
news that this product can do that and
yet when you apply them they're not as
dry as say the l'oreal hip cream liner
if you've used that I find that it got
dried out on me really soon but also
like just to apply it it was like it
would be hard to smudge it because it
would dry so quickly these you do have
some some time to get them if you wanted
a real softened up look on your lash
line but yet they dry to a completely
you know non smudge able finish so i
love that time to move on to the shades
that I like to use all over the lid say
as a base and I would go ahead and use a
typical eyeshadow base underneath it
just to be safe like say you're too
faced shadow insurance or your L'Oreal
decrease or whatever formulation you
like to use your Urban Decay primer
potion I go ahead would go ahead and use
that underneath and also to get the best
outcome out of these as your base do not
put too much on doing it just because
you think like oh I want the color to
really stand out
or something you're going to get the
best effect if you just keep it a thin
coat and I feel that way about almost
any cream product you put on your eyelid
you've got to keep it thin or else you
will get creasing so there's my little
disclaimer on that also these little
frosted glass jars are not very big the
opening is just rather small there and I
have nails and to get my finger in there
it's like it's you know it would be I
would get it in my nail and I don't like
the thought of digging something out
with my nails so I go ahead and use even
if I want to put this all over my lid
like that I use a little brush this is a
smallish I think it came as a concealer
brush in a set from Coastal Scents but I
mean these are everywhere you'll find
these it's just a smallish brush to see
it compared to like the size of my eye
it's like just you know lots of control
you can just easily get it in there get
out what you need and it's very very
easy to spread that on your eyelid these
these little guys just aren't quite to
nail friendly so anyway to get through
these last few shades my favorites for a
base all over the lid and these could be
liners too if you like a light
shimmering liner but I just like these
bestest basis wicked is a silver shade
look at that this is going to be a great
all-around base for almost any color
it's right here you can see it really a
nice metallic finish really catching the
light and you could wear these alone as
well and you would still get that nice
long wearing finish you can see I'm
rubbing my finger on it I've even put a
lot of product on here and they're still
not smudging one to the next so I love
that but anyway that's your silver shade
it's going to look it's going to really
add to any light shade you put on top of
it if you want to you know your pastel
shadows to really stand out more put
them on top of wicked and I think you'll
get a really bright light shimmery
finish the next one is summer fun I love
this one this is a gorgeous um peachy
gold shade and fans of Mac yeah
is basically like a rubenesque Paint Pot
doop I have rubenesque I don't have a
ton of Mac products but I do have that
and i swatched these side by side and
they're very similar this one is a
little bit more metallic than that one
is but the tone is over all the same if
you were to top this with a shadow and
top rubenesque with the same shadow you
would over all lined up with the same
basic look so this is just gorgeous for
your everyday you know base for a shadow
it will give off that peachy gold
appearance if you like a lot of neutrals
this would be great as well this is the
swatch of it right here in the middle
just a beautiful and golden undertone
peachy golden a slight bit of bronze
just beautiful base for eyeshadow and
the last one I want to show you as a
colorful one I really really like this
one because it's so unique it is called
feline and it's like a sort of a bluish
green with a yellow yellowish gold
undertone okay so you're looking at that
there it's got a really pretty gold
under town and you'll see it more on my
skin here it's just beautiful and so
unique and i like you i use this as the
base of an olive-green look I've used it
as the base of a blue look and it really
just captures whatever color you're
putting on top of it and again great
staying power I can rub all over my hand
nothing has smudged in with one another
so you can have confidence that these
will last I think I've gone over
basically how the best way to apply
these are and like I said the only thing
really holding back other shades that
I've tried is the fact that I don't feel
like they're necessarily practical
shades I tried to pass him along shades
here that I thought if somebody took my
recommendations I think they would get a
lot of good out of them and at less than
seven dollars these are really good bye
where this stuff is concerned because
you will go into the drugstore even and
spend more on a gel liner so I hope you
guys maybe get the chance to take
advantage of this deal if you can these
are the shades that I like the best and
please let me know if you've tried other
shades let me know what your favorites
are maybe I'll get some new ideas to so
thanks so much for watching guys have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
