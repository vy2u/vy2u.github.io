this video you may notice I'm in a lot
different setting here i'm actually at
home at mom and dad's house for
thanksgiving and i wanted to go ahead
and do a quick video while i was sort of
on the road here and i wanted to review
the new high-definition foundation from
Coastal Scents this is called undercover
high-definition foundation and this is
something that as soon as it came out
and think a lot of people were curious
about it because you hear about the High
Definition foundation from brands like
makeup forever available at sephora and
stuff and it's it's pretty pricey and
when you think you know well Oh
high-definition you know like that title
really makes it seem like wow this is
going to be a really like amazing
product for being on screen is just
going to magically you know take away
your flaws if you were on
high-definition TV and that kind of
thing but really I think it's just a
catchphrase that you're going to see
being used more and more with makeup
products to really give you the sense
that you're going to get flawless skin
if you use them so basically this
operates like a little pump here my
shade that i'm using is st 05 so that's
what it looks like they're so i use that
all over my face today and you may
notice i got my little bangs cut there
too it's kind of a cut like shorter
straight across and I just kind of side
swept it a little bit but yeah I use
this all over my face and I really like
the feel of it I use my photo finish um
photo finish primer from Smashbox all
over my face and then I smooth this on
just with my fingers all over it and it
blends really well it does it excuse me
it doesn't give you like a blotchy
appearance whatsoever and part of that's
how it works nicely with that primer but
I think in general this is sort of a
liquidy formula and it just blends
really well it doesn't get too dried out
as you blend so if you like dotted it
all over your face and then blended it
in you wouldn't have a hard time with
feeling like sometimes how revlon
colorstay is the oily two combo formula
you kind of have to work quickly with it
this there's not as much of a concern
with that however I feel coverage wise
this isn't necessarily as much coverage
as I've gotten with
with say revlon colorstay or the
maybelline superstay superstay 24-hour
its or really the Rimmel lasting finish
either it's a little bit lighter but
you've got to keep in mind that for
high-definition make up the thought is
that you don't want to have as thick of
a makeup look okay you want to be like
if you had the cameras on and I'm very
conscious of this because our station is
supposed to be going high def you know
very soon and so the concept is that if
you had a camera on you it would look
more like skin and less like makeup on
the skin so that's why a lighter finish
and is very desirable for for makeup you
may use in a high-definition setting and
we all know that not we're not all in a
high-definition environment and that may
not be important to all of us but the
concept of flawless skin definitely is
and so this this is kind of like a
straight-up medium coverage foundation I
would say it is so liquidy you might
find foundations that are thicker more
of a richer cream foundation that we
give you more coverage than this would
however this does not have the
appearance of a lot of makeup on your
face so if you have minor discolorations
you want to even out if you have minor
maybe acne scarring or things like that
if it's not to an extreme level and you
also want that kind of flawless face but
without a lot of makeup kind of look
this will work well for you and the
staying power is pretty good also the
one thing I noticed is that having worn
it through most of the day a few days
ago I mean I've been wearing this pretty
consistently but I really took note of
this a few days ago I had put it all
over my face definitely my nose area as
well and I noticed some shine coming
through on my nose so be aware that this
isn't necessarily a shine busting
foundation or anything like that you may
you know need to top this off with
powders that's the way i do it i put
this on put my concealer on in any
places that the clock is going up put it
up put the concealer on in any areas
where this foundation didn't cover top
it all off with powder and i think
you'll get a pretty good
while this look I just want you to be
aware that this may not cover as well as
some other foundations that I have
recommended but if you don't have a lot
of major flaws and you do want that
really nice kind of no makeup look you
know really kind of letting the skin
shine through but also evening and in
serving that function you may really
like this products doesn't look like
caked on makeup especially around key
areas where you might look like around
your eyes you know or just different
places on your face where you know after
a day wears on you can see the makeup so
um anyway just wanted to give you heads
up on this product there's a lot of
different shades that are available and
it's called the undercover high
definition foundation from Coastal
Scents so thank you guys so much for
tuning in for this video have a great
day and I hope you all had a wonderful
thanksgiving thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
