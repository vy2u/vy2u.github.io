and I hope you had a wonderful
Thanksgiving mine was really fun I got
to go back home and see my family for a
few days and when I returned I saw a
nice little package on the doorstep from
Coastal Scents because I had placed an
order there a couple of things that are
definitely new and very excited as I was
shopping for those new things I stumbled
across some other things that may or may
not be new but I just didn't know they
had them so if you're not familiar with
Coastal Scents it is a brand that makes
a lot of those really large pallets like
maybe you've heard people talk about the
88 warm or just those different 88
colorful pallets they've got all kinds
of finishes metallic shimmer a man
really nice quality pallets I think in
my perfect palette tag I mentioned the
big 252 with three levels and really
great if you just want to experiment
with a huge spectrum of color or
neutrals or whatever it might be I
didn't get any of those jumbo pallets
this time but I did get a smaller
palette that they've come out with and
it's called revealed and I'm going to
double check the price but I believe
this was like 20 bucks it's got 20
eyeshadows in it and it looks like this
so they're all like same kind of size
and format you know of the naked
palettes and as soon as I open this up
like I starts watching I'm like oh
that's really similar to this or that
from The Naked palette so I'm going to
have to do either a video or a blog or
something side-by-side comparisons of
these shades versus some of the Urban
Decay ones because I can tell you right
now there are some that are extremely
close and like exact Duke as you can see
it's a mix of matte and shimmer on the
matte black it's one of the mats also
there's several like kind of mid-tone
Browns ranging from warm to cool up
there as majority of these shades have
at least a little shimmer there's just a
quick look at some of the swatches that
I just randomly swatched here on my hand
a few of those are matte summer shimmer
really nice quality from what I can tell
I mean very soft very pigmented shadows
an initial complaint that I have on this
palette is that there's no mirror up
here because I often with these smaller
palettes you know when I'm doing my eye
makeup I just use this as a really close
mirror typically so I can really see
what's going on with my
make up but doesn't have one so that can
be a bit of an issue especially if you
wanted to travel with this and you need
that extra mirror yeah I can't wait to
try this some more and review it but
that's called the revealed pallet way if
you do order from coastal since you do
get some fun little extras this time I
got this little I love makeup sticker or
they'll do like an I love makeup bumper
sticker which I have over there on my
bulletin board and they give a free hot
pot with your order so it comes like
this and that is a full size hot pot pan
that you can throw into your various
palettes whatever another new thing to
the line I was so excited to try these
are the forever blushes and there are so
many colors like I didn't even really
know where to begin on the website so I
just kind of randomly picked a few that
I thought might interest me but these
were what was the cost 795 each for
these and there are pretty large size
for a blush I mean I would say this is
the size of most pressed powders you
know packaging is just like Laura
Geller's if you're familiar with that
it's got the little window on the top
the partial mirror on the inside and
then there's your product ik it's
definitely the most subtle one that I
have and I am wearing that today but it
still packs a major pigmented punch I
mean look at that this is kind of like a
dusty peach type underneat thing it's on
the website it does clearly label what
the finish of each blush is because it
can be kind of hard to tell just by
looking at a website you know is this
going to be packed with glitter as it
totally mattes one really appears pretty
matte if not a bit of a satiny finish to
it as well really love the natural look
that this gives and I love that I only
had just tap my brush right into it and
then buff it on in and it was fun I've
still got three that I haven't tried and
these all seem really really bright is
called lovely and it may be coming off a
bit more pink on the camera but it
really seems like a bright coral in
person and I just touched my finger to
this is that going to go and this is the
color that comes off it's got a little
Sheen to it a very pretty pigmented
blush I mean this reminds me just to
touch these and see how much color
payoff there is it reminds me a lot of
like the sleek blushes
next one's called sleek and I feel like
it's a little more pinky mauve than this
one is this is lovely the one that I saw
is kind of like a bright coral soft oh I
can't believe how soft it's this shade
right here kind of reminds me of an
ultra ultra pigmented like NYX mocha and
then the final one I have here is called
beautiful and it seems even more mauve
like and maybe a little bit plum II
almost compared to sweet which was the
one I just showed this one seems pretty
matte I mean look at that plummy color
you're getting off and I felt frustrated
with blushes or you felt like yet pay a
lot to get a really really rich
pigmented one maybe check these out and
obviously i'm swatching these in a
really concentrated way you would never
like have that much color on your cheeks
but really I mean I could tell from even
the most subtle what I have which was um
poetic I just barely tapped my brush
into it that was enough just one time
per cheek and then just dust it in and
it was perfect can't wait to see how
some of these brighter shades pan out
for me and kind of to look at the
staying power of these as well but
definitely review material thing that
Coastal Scents has which I'm not sure if
it's new or if it just you know got past
me but it's the little concealer pans
they're doing individual pans of
concealer they come like this and then
when you take them out they are totally
wrapped and there's even a little like
plastic cap over them so if you're
wondering like won't that dry out it's
all like totally wrapped and sealed in
there but I got a bunch of these because
I wanted to do my own little concealer
palette and test these out and see how
good they got an empty four pan palette
and then I put shades one two three and
four inside and this is shade five which
I thought might be a little dark so far
and just swatching these and they remind
me a lot of the textures of the
concealers that are in like the Eclipse
palette pretty creamy and just a little
thick so they could really be good for
you know covering discoloration on your
face and so this is one two three and
four right here so I've got you know a
little range for myself to try these and
maybe see what works best I just really
thought that it was cool at least were
sold in the individual pans because for
a lot of people if you're just buying
for personal use and you're not a makeup
artist a lot of shades may go to waste
and some of those larger you know pre
put together concealer palettes so here
you can just pick whatever you want only
do have a pretty rich texture so we'll
see how that goes we're just a dollar 95
each so if those turn out to work that's
going to be awesome and then I also
wanted to get some of their individual
little pots here yeah you could just
take one of those hot pots you could
take one of those concealers like if you
said I'm just going to try one it could
pop in here I got five of these because
I just thought hey that's a good thing
to have because sometimes I do deep pot
things and for whatever reason may just
want one to take somewhere and maybe
just you know one of those concealers
really works for me I can use that in
here so yeah nothing too fancy they
remind me exactly the little compacts
that you would get like a Mac eye shadow
in exactly the same size wise and lastly
because I'm obsessed with finding a
travel brush that has everything and is
inexpensive and works well I got a
couple of the brush sets the first one
is this the color me fuchsia brush set
and that one was just 995 so it comes in
a really compact little zip around case
like this and then these are the brushes
this is a powder brush definitely like a
full-size powder brush not too small or
any and then on the other side of the
brush roll there are four little slots
there's one teeny tiny like detail brush
here check that out like that could
definitely apply like cream liner or
maybe smudge out some eyeliner there's a
flat brush here that I think could be a
you know a concealer brush or a flat
brush for packing on eyeshadow these are
all really really soft and they feel
like synthetic bristles is really
excited that this brush was included
this reminds me of the e25 brush from
Sigma that I use all the time a little
bit pinched in at the top very same
fullness I think these are great for
getting color in your crease and just
wedging it in there and then using it to
buff out they work really nicely so I'm
excited to try that and then you've got
on kind of a typical flat brush here
definitely a little more chunky than
that other flat brush that I just show
but it's good to have options right so
this would be like kind of a standard
brush for packing eyeshadow on your lid
so definitely some good variety in this
kit as far as eye brushes you're only
getting one face brush so I'm going to
have to test this out and see what kind
of looks I can come up with like just
using this brush set I don't know why
travel sets just fascinate me so much
but I feel like once I stumble across
one that really does it all I will be so
excited and I do like the Sigma mr.
bunny or mrs. bunny travel kits that was
involved in my giveaway that I do but I
know that that kit can still be kind of
pricey so I'm looking for something you
know in this like $15 kind of price
range and this one is 1495 this other
one and it's called cityscape and I kept
the box here it looks like that it's got
a really cute little quilted zipper
round case here and it opens up like
this you've got your brushes covered by
a black and then you've got an extra
mesh pocket over here for whatever you
want well this kit is five brushes in
this kit you're getting seven this one
is a really soft angled blush brush
definitely could work for blush might be
a little small for powder than one of
those great flat eyeshadow brush is
definitely not under sized on any of
these eye brushes from what I can tell
this looks like a classic flat concealer
brush to me another one of these great
like e 25 ish crease blending brushes
I'm glad Coastal Scents is realizing
that people love this style of brush
look like different bristles from the
one in the other kit but still
definitely the same size in the same cut
this is interesting it's kind of like a
little smudger brush but it's definitely
a little bigger than my Sigma e 21 you
can tell that the bristles have a bit
more movement to them so this might give
you an even more sheer smudge on some of
your like powder eyeshadows or something
up a great angled liner brush this one's
stiff but it's still definitely soft not
scratchy and then this I thought was
really cool a great little bent eyeliner
brush and this has a nice amount of
stiffness there to the bristles I think
you're going to be able to use it and
have enough control but I love how it
bends in so you can really easily get
across
laughs well I just can't wait to
experiment with these sets and review
them for you because it could be you
know a really great little gift idea to
throw in with somebody's Christmas gets
it everybody that's the new stuff I got
from Coastal Scents again that eyeshadow
palettes brand-new the blushes are brand
new and some of these other things like
the concealers the brush kits I'm really
excited to try them and let you know
what I think so thanks for watching my
haul and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
