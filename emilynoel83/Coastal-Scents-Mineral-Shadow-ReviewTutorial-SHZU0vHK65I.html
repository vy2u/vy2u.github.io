this video this is going to be one of
those videos where I actually review the
products as I use them you're going to
be getting my reaction on several
different items as I apply it to my face
which i think really forces me to pay a
lot of attention to detail in in what I
tell you about the product and you
actually get to see what i mean you know
rather than we just sitting here all
done up talking about this product right
here i'm going to show you exactly how
it applies and what what I think about
it as I apply it so today some of the
things I'm going to be touching on are
some of these loose shadows from Coastal
Scents if you've seen those on the
website and been a little skeptical I'll
tell you what I really think about those
also i'm going to be using a new liquid
liner pin and the Coastal Scents gel
liner and yeah I'll just walk you
through this I look it's very natural so
you've been warned it's shimmery light
pastel but you may still be interested
to just know how several different
shades of these loose shadows actually
go on so if you want to see how it all
comes together keep on rest i'm going to
prime my lid with my smashbox photo
finish shadow primer and this is the
type of primer that's really going to
even out the discolorations that we
naturally have on our eyelid you can see
since i put that on there i'm going to
continue to put it right up here since i
put that on it really has done away with
some of the little veins you can see
around there and a bluish or reddish
tone so actually kind of a nice
completely natural look that that
creates for you with the primer so next
I'm going to lay down a little bit of a
creamy color base just to grab these
loose shadows and help them out a little
bit i'm using my NYX jumbo pencil and
cottage cheese which I know may not be
like the greatest name for it for an eye
pencil depending on how much you like
cottage cheese but I'm just kind of
dotting that around and then blending it
making sure I don't get too much of the
product on there but this is just a
shimmery kind of white pencil that's
going to grab basically any color you
put on and make it stand out just a bit
more then I'm going to take one of these
coastal scents
shadows in doe tail and this is a light
light kind of shimmery neutral i would
say i would say a very very light pink
shade and so for that i'm going to tap a
little bit into the lid this is how i
like to use loose shadows anyway I've
got a little bit in there I'm going to
take my elf shadow brush and just kind
of pack some of that first onto the
brush and this is going to give me a
little more control now that I packed it
on the brush and I'm going to pack it
right on top of the NYX jumbo pencil I
put on so we're getting kind of a nice
light shimmery sparkle there ok so just
patting that on and then we're going to
pay attention to a couple other places
we want to use this so I'm going to use
a fluffier shadow brush again get the
shadow right in there and that's going
to be our highlight so let's just go
ahead and make one step out of this
since it can be a little more hassle to
use a loose shadow than a pressed one so
kind of go through all my steps at once
here and condense it then I'm going to
take my tiny brush my mini detail brush
a q-tip is fine for this step as well
you'll find that this brush will give
you the most concentration of this color
when we go down here for the tear duct
area you can see how it just gives us
that nice fresh dewy look there
otherwise this really is an extremely
sheer color not a lot of color is going
to come through you're more just going
to get this shimmer and shine from it so
it's all about you know if that's
something you go for then you might
enjoy this otherwise it might seem a
little too light for you next shade i'm
going to go for is called drama shadow
and this is um it's sort of a purpley
shade i'm trying to see if there's
anything especially unique in the
packaging it looks to be a true purple
maybe just a hint of a deeper plum tone
in that shadow i'm going to tap just a
little bit into the lid again this is
shimmery all these shades are shimmery
and sometimes shimmer can take away from
the overall pigmentation i'm going to
take my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
there's the color I'm not going
use all that but I'm going to am going
to just kind of angle my brush go kind
of down right in at that angle so i can
get part of the tip covered with the
shadow tap off any excess you have and
we're going to go right for our crease
here just patting it in just to give us
a base color for the crease and just
because of how this looked in the
package I thought it would be darker I
thought it would be more vibrant on my
eyelid but really after one swipe I
can't hardly see it I'm going to go in
with another really this only looks more
sparkly it doesn't really look more
colorful so yeah that's kind of I mean
this this step is almost obsolete I feel
because this shadow which looked like a
gorgeous deep purple and i am doing
using it packing it on approach with a
shader brush here and it's just kind of
not not really coming through too much
for me you can see a little warmth there
but overall not a ton so yeah not
exactly what i was thinking i get from
that shadow so very very subtle the next
shade i'm going to go for is is no doubt
darker the shade is called what is it
called night swim shadow it's kind of
hard to see these sometimes but this is
a nice deep blue again shimmery but I
like a good shimmery Navy and that looks
just really gorgeous right there in the
packaging and I believe I found this to
be a little bit more pigmented on the
other side I'm going to use to my
essence of beauty fine crease brush got
a little bit there in the lid this
appears to be a little more concentrated
just a little darker so by nature I
think it's going to show up better and
I'm just going to go for my crease here
and we can see a little bit of that
shadow starting to show up here and
define our crease I'm going for a line
application first just from inner to
outer corner just to lay down sort of a
base contour and then we'll think about
working it out into the outer V going to
get a little more product here see if we
can make this a little more dramatic
attic there we go there's some color
starting to work for us here on the
outer V I'm just kind of swirling this
still trying to keep it pretty
controlled not doing any majorly you
know big and bold strokes here because
it is a loose shadow we're dealing with
but yeah this is a very very soft look I
would say if you're going for the soft
romantic look you could probably do this
with just the light shade and this shade
and it would be really pretty and you
wouldn't necessarily need the middle
shade for it and there we go there's
kind of our outer V it's very diffused
and it's easy to diffuse these light
light shades if you're a beginner with
makeup and you're worried about making a
lot of mistakes with your eyeshadow
because you think you know I don't know
quite where I'm going with this and
these loose shadows are a little bit
foolproof in that they're not so bold
but do keep in mind they are still loose
and that does make them a little more
difficult than your typical press shadow
we're going to move on now to the liner
and I'm going to be using the LA girl
fine line long-lasting fine tip liquid
eyeliner and this is one of the most
fine tip show you the logo there this is
one of the most fine tip liners have
used is really fine and the one thing
difficulty I found using it so far the
tip goes it doesn't doesn't protrude
very much from the plastic here so when
you're going in really nice and close
it's almost like you wish it was just a
little bit longer but either way fairly
easy to work with so I'm going to go in
starting at the very inner corner and
you will get a you can get as just as
fine a line as you want I sometimes draw
these up just a little bit more and then
all like a little bit up from my actual
lash line and then kind of fill in like
draw up like that you see where I've
left a gap and then you can go back and
fill in just to kind of create a thicker
line as you go towards the outside like
that
and here we just kind of wind it out
slightly these pins are very easy to do
that with so instead of you know making
that slope or my I will go from here to
here i'm going to start drawing an
outward a little bit now true test of a
the liner like this in my eyes is if it
can draw over something that's ultra
shimmery and still keep its nice rich
black color realize that this is fairly
new to me and i haven't used it a whole
lot but it is very nice and black we'll
see how that goes after a few more
applications the revlon one that i'd
used a while ago actually is it has
managed to hold up quite well for a long
time so I was kind of surprised at the
longevity that had a lot of these pins
can dry up rather quickly but um there
we go there's kind of our cat I going on
there next we're going to do our lower
lash line for that i'm using my Coastal
Scents gel liner in stellar so this is a
shimmery black but it's mostly just
going to look black I got some questions
about this can this be used as an
eyeshadow base I think they work great
as an eyeshadow base frankly i'm using
my Smashbox number 21 brush here i'm
just going to smudge it in with the
other liner there you can see how we've
created that little notch for ourself I
know but using this all over your lid
you might have more difficulty blending
out a dark shade like this but still
it's doable and I have done it I did it
on Halloween and I liked it I thought it
gave a nice long wearing base to my
eyeshadow which was nice plus they just
have so many bright colors with these
gel liners that they really allow you to
have some unique shadow bases there so
if you're not using them as a shadow
base I think you're missing out frankly
but here I'm just using it for its liner
purposes especially this black is nice
to use that for so I just kind of went
all the way in sort of softening the
line with my little brush as I went next
I'm going to be curling my eyelashes and
they'll apply a coat of L'Oreal's
original voluminous mascara and I'll
join you with the finish line
here is my finished look this is an
extremely soft shimmery look we've
defined it with a bit of a cat I there
but it's not too over-the-top obviously
and if you're not one who really likes
the light pastel shimmery shades this
may not be for you and it is no doubt
shimmery it's not going to be very heavy
on the color and you're not going to
necessarily be going to be able to
distinguish that ok that is navy blue
there's a little purple underneath and
some sheer pink you know you're not
going to really be able to pick out
those colors for some people that's a
good thing they don't want anybody
poking out well you know what their
colors are on their face but for other
people if you're into more of an arts
artistic colorful application this may
not be what you want if i were to bottom
line give you a recommendation on what
to buy from Coastal Scents I steer you
more towards the palettes just because I
think they're more unique in their
quality I think they're great quality
you're getting a lot of fantastic colors
in there that you wouldn't find that
combination may be elsewhere in your
local drugstore say and you're going to
get a lot for your money with these
they're just so sheer there John they're
not doing a whole lot for me in terms of
color payoff will it give you a pretty
lurk look yeah I think it's pretty it's
just not necessarily unique as far as
what's on my lips today I'm using trying
out the new elf lip stain my color is in
fashionista so it's a light pink and
then it's topped off with this clear
gloss and I like it I like the shade so
far I think that could be a great kind
of every day and you you know it's not
really a neutral pink but it's not a
bright pink at all so thank you guys so
much for taking the time to listen to me
talk this look out and kind of tell you
what I think about the products as I use
them I think it's a nice perspective to
give from time to time instead of just
sitting there reviewing something for
you and just talking so thanks so much
for tuning in guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
