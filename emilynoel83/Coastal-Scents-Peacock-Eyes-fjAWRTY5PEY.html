how to do this look using two totally
different colors some purple and green
kind of like a peacock inspired look
using that great coastal sense 42 color
double stack palette it's the kind that
has all these shadows here on the top
and then blushes on the bottom so I'm
just going to show you an example of a
look you can achieve with that and I'll
take you through it step by step first
thing I'm going to do is pry my eyelid
I'm going to use the sort of shadow
primer that really makes that shadow
cling to it and for that I really like
using the be luscious shadow magnet in
light been using this a lot lately and I
just really think it takes those
colorful shadows and really makes them
pop so I'm just going to lightly apply
that a thin layer all over the lid and
also kind of up into the crease and just
lightly blend it upward from there next
I'm going to use my 42 color double
stack palette from Coastal Scents so
that is shadows like I have here stacked
on top of blushes and if you want to
learn more about that visit my blog I
have pictures and swatches and
everything on these but i'm using the
shimmer palette today and i'm going to
take this pretty emerald green shade
right there and i'm going to take my elf
shadow brush and just use that to apply
the shade all over my eyelid you can see
how these colors are sort of have like a
metallic feel to them and you know i
imagine you could foil these apply them
with a little mixing medium and you
would get an extra metallic pearly
finish to them so I'm really just
packing that on from the absolute inner
corner and just a little bit it helps
kind of look down into a mirror and
apply it up a little bit into your
crease just lightly there then I'm going
to take the shade that is directly
beside it it's a pretty pretty kind of
unique shade of purple there
kind of nice how they're sitting right
there side by side you can kind of see
where we're going with this but that
shade i'm going to use to apply in my
crease so instead of you know really
using a dark deep shade in the crease
we're using another equally colorful
shade to just kind of change the effect
here and some oh I'm using my Sonia
Kashuk on medium eyeshadow brush and
first thing I'm going to do is just kind
of get that color going right into the
crease here and you're starting to see
that purple sort of overlapping with the
green and from there we're just going to
sort of work our way out I won't quite
say outer V but we will just kind of
start pulling that color right out in
that direction that's what this kind of
brush is so good for kind of
concentrating the shadow somewhere and
then just dragging it out and a nice
diffused way like that so now that
you've got the level of color you want
there i'm going to take yet another sort
of colorful shade and use it as my
highlight i'm going to use this light
shimmery rose pink here and i'm going to
use this shadow brush from Smashbox that
i really like it's kind of fluffy and
it's nice for picking up highlight color
or color you want to put all over the
lid and i'm just going to apply this I
love doing highlight shades because
they're so easy to get on there right up
to my eyebrow and overlapping the outer
edge just a great strategy when you've
got two shades that are kind of similar
in color to really diffuse that line
between your outermost crocheted and the
highlight just kind of go over the edge
like that for our liner I'm going to
grab my L'Oreal hip color truth cream
eyeliner in black this is just a really
solid solid black eyeliner shade it's
going to come across very black on your
lid I'm going to use this little brush
here that I got from Walmart in the
paintbrush section it's just kind of a
turquoise rush I'm not sure the brand
since it has rubbed off but you can find
mold
pull multiple kinds of these I believe
lo Cornell had some very very tiny
brushes of this type as well so what i'm
doing here is just applying this just a
little little by little edging it in
closer and closer to my inner corner now
I'm also going to be using that L'Oreal
hip liner on the lower lash line as well
just kind of carefully taking it here
from the corner making a little
connection there with um the upper liner
and we will sort of go back to that and
blend that out a little better here in a
second but just continuing that line
we're just going to be tell me just a
little bit of like fall out there but it
doesn't usually do that I'm just gonna
kind of smudge it there you can see
right in my lash line just smudging it
all the way to the inner corner and just
a little trick for making a really
subtle change to your black eyeliner or
any eyeliner change really is just going
over it with a shadow we're going to use
that brightest purple shade right here
taking my liner brush getting some on
the brush and it may not come across
it's really not very bold in person but
I can see it more in person that I can
hear on video but I'm just going to go
over it ever so slightly with that
purple shade and just kind of ties ties
it into the look a little bit more now
I'm going to curl my eyelashes and do
that for about 15 seconds then I'm going
to use my physicians formula mineral
wear mascara in ultra black and I am
going to be doing a review on this
coming up very soon it's a rubber brush
mascara that has like a little comb on
one side and a more typical rubber one
rubber mascara wand on the other side of
the brush and I'm just gonna probably
apply several coats of this on my on my
upper lashes and then probably just one
quick
on the bottom and I'll be back in a
second to show you the guys there is the
finished look while the eye look is a
little more bold with the greens and
purples and stuff I left the rest of the
face a little more neutral with just
some bronzer blush some products from
everyday minerals including my new blush
that I really like in salon fun sort of
a um they just a really pretty shimmery
pink shade so kind of sets off the look
on my lips i'm wearing my steel uh what
is it lip glaze and brown sugar so just
a real neutral shade on the lips and i
hope you enjoy this look and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
