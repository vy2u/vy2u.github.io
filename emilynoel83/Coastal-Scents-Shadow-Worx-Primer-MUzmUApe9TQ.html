me for my review a thought I'm doing
another one of these I did one I don't
know maybe a month ago or so and I got
really good feedback on it so many of
you enjoyed the ability to just watch a
bunch of videos at once if you wanted to
or you know space them out watch them at
your own convenience and also have a lot
of reviews all at once so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that again and the first
product I'm going to talk about is a new
eyeshadow primer from Coastal Scents
this is a product I really really like
and I'm gonna tell you why over the
course of this review obviously
basically what you've got here is a
shadow works a shadow primer comes in a
golden tube it squeezes out and that's a
good thing because with a lot of primers
I know people prefer a squeeze tube as
opposed to the wand because you can't
necessarily get all the product out when
you have the wand and it's a very rigid
too so basically this squirts out and
you are getting not just a typical
creamy neutral skin toned eye primer but
you're getting something with a lot of
shimmer to it so if I were to blend this
out on my hand here you can see it
blends and it does not end up feeling
tacky at all like if I wasn't watching
myself do this like I can't even feel
the product there anymore so it's kind
of nice in that it does blend to a
completely you know you're not you're
not feeling like you've got a lot of
heavy product on there it's very
lightweight and once you get it all
blended on you do have a sheer sheen
there of shimmery color basically and my
first you know sceptical point in my
mind when I tried this is why would they
come out with this as their standard eye
primer and it has shimmer in it what
about Matt colors are they still going
to look good on this and the information
that I was reading about claims that you
know you can still get a matte effect
over the top of this and so I thought I
would show that to you here here is the
shadow works eye primer just as is I
just got a little you know small less
than a pearl sized amount and this is
what you get out of that so a little bit
does go a long way it spreads out and
blends very easily but that is just the
primer
this is the primer with a shimmery shade
over the top and I feel like it it
enhances it even more here it is with
the matte shade over the top and get a
really close look at it I feel like it
well okay I you know comparatively
speaking yes this does look more matte
but under a microscope by being a I
guess I can still see a hint of shimmer
equality still under that or you know
since this was a completely white shade
the shimmer kind of shows through us
sort of like I showed you this kind of
pinky um not necessarily pink but like a
champagne off-white like a neutral
shimmer so it kind of does show through
on your lightest matte shades so that's
something to think about if you really
like using shimmery products and you
loved the effect you know this kind of a
metallic practically look under your
shades this is only going to enhance
those colors and if you love that look
this would be great for you to invest in
1495 I mean that's pretty good price
compared to maybe what you would spend
at Sephora for an Urban Decay primer
potion or a Too Faced shadow insurance
although it's not that much less it's
just a few bucks less I guess but if you
enjoy that this is good however if you
do continually use matte shades and
that's kind of your thing you I mean I
don't see quite see the point in having
this if you like only matte colors
because you know you're just gonna work
a little bit harder to be like covering
it up so there I would say you know get
your Palladio eye primer or your Urban
Decay primer potion two faced shadow
insurance those things that are going to
go on and not give you anything to
contend with you're going to get that
purely matte look but if you like
shimmer and this is nice I've used this
just alone because I love the look of it
once I put it on my eye just adds is and
I'm like okay I'm happy with that you
know so I guess so far I've just been
talking about it appearance wise and in
terms of that I think it is pretty and I
like it I like it when I'm doing
shimmery looks or I like
to use it alone now in terms of staying
power it has the same degree of staying
power as the other primers I've used
I've got to say it's interesting and
that it doesn't leave behind sort of the
tacky you know finish there it feels
entirely smooth which at one point I
thought primers had to have a little bit
of tackiness so they would kind of grab
and hold on to the shadow but that's not
necessarily the case I mean this goes on
very smooth but I found my shadows still
lasted as long and in addition to that I
mean there was one day where I was
having a real sneezing attack like I
think I was having some kind of allergy
issue I sneezed a lot my eyes watered a
lot there was a little bit of moisture
coming up on the inner part of my lid
and I checked it and I could and I think
I may have also been rubbing my eyes a
little bit too and yeah the shadow had
rubbed off there so in the event of an
intense sneezing episode I think you may
have a little bit of a staying power
issue here but in the event of a normal
day you know just wearing this typical
you know day-to-day obstacles you may
have I think this will hold up just fine
I just thought was important to show you
how it does come off and how well you
know it can look matte but in a sense
when you get really close it's like I
still see a little humor there so just
something to be aware of if you're a
huge fan of shimmery shadows and that's
primarily what you use I think this
would be a good thing to pick up so
thanks a lot for watching this review
guys I hope you have a great day and
stay tuned for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
