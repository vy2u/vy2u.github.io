review on the Coastal Scents max so that
is the new lip gloss that they've come
out with so you probably know them for
their palates and eyeshadows and things
like that but yes they have come out
with lip glosses now and they are 495 of
peace and there's a really wide range of
range of shades there's like 21
different colors and they're actually
really really good quality I've but it
does vary from you know from lip gloss
to lip gloss like it's not like they're
all the same formula so I mean I
definitely have some opinions as far as
that goes in terms of what ones I like
best so in this video I'm going to
highlight the ones i like best out of
the three color families i guess you'd
say that I've broken them down into and
the first is a nude and peach shade so
like these are the sorts of shades those
are just like your neutrally colors like
that and then the next grouping I'm
calling that my deep metallic sparkle
shade so these are all just a little bit
darker and they definitely have that
shimmer to them and then the other
category i have is pinks ok so straight
up pink and so I've picked three that I
like out of each of those categories and
I think they are representative enough
of the different types of glosses that
are in the whole mix so you're going to
get a good representation of what's out
there so I'm going to start off with the
nude shades and I'm going to describe
using this first one which is cosmic
this is one of my favorites and let me
tell you this I wasn't the only one that
kind of reviewed these my sister-in-law
Sara was down for the weekend and we
both were like going through them and
trying them out and seeing which ones we
like best and cosmic anyway this was one
that we really liked on her she has
blonde hair and kind of fair skin and
that's just really um I think there's
some new glasses that don't necessarily
look aren't that complementary to fair
skin but this one really looked good and
this if you look at it it is more that
sheer transparent n shade it's not real
thick like it gives you that new
look but it's more of like a sheer
sparkle with just a little bit of a
peachy undertone yeah it does have some
sparkle to it but sarah said she
couldn't really feel it that much our
lips and I can't either when I put this
one on but it's just a really really
pretty shade and and it's I mean it's
probably the sheerest and lightest one I
will talk about right now but if that's
what you like if you like sort of that
barely there like kind of your lips but
better with a little bit of a new tent
cosmic is a really nice shade and what
the way these are it is a wand but it
has a little brush tip and I love this
brush more than a lot of the applicators
I have on my makeup and Sarah and I were
talking about how you know this is
really easy to manage because you can
practically you feel like you're lining
your lips with this too it's like it
works so well and the brush is just like
the right size I don't know it's just
perfect for applications so i really
really enjoy that about these clauses
that's probably one of their best
features to be quite honest the formula
varies but they all have a great
applicator so cosmic is what I like in
the nude family another one is this
shane called strut on nude and this one
is it's not totally opaque it's not like
a total flat cream it does have this
slight slight pearly appearance not
nearly the sparkle that this one has but
it's more of just your traditional like
nude color ok so if I put a little bit
of that on it's a little it still has
that slight bit of transparency to it
which a lot of these do which in some
scenarios you like in some scenarios
maybe you don't like it so much but here
gosh it just really matches my skin tone
I don't know if you can see that there
but it does have a little more creamy
texture and when you put it on you do
get that more new lip look this is going
to transform the look of your lips more
so than cosmic well because cosmic is
even more transparent so there is cosmic
you know see all that shimmer and then
strut on nude is just more creamy and
slightly more opaque my ultimate
favorite out of the nude category is
sheer tan it is a gorgeous you can see
that beautiful Sparkle it has this is
where I need to be holding these glasses
that really shows it well it's it's just
a gorgeous kind of bronzy gold shade and
I have worn this quite a few times now
it is gorgeous like if you wanted to top
off like I sort of a even a brownish
toned lipstick and put this over the top
it is dazzling that is this third shade
right here so there is cosmic there
strut on nude and there is sheer tan wow
it's really pretty it really shows up
nicely and that is by far my favorite
out of my little nude grouping and
that's just a grouping I made these
groupings these aren't available this
way on the website you're just going to
have to look for the name but next in
the deep metallic sparkle i forgot what
i called it but these shades are all
just a little bit darker than everything
else and i have several favorites here
um first off let me talk about sheer
crimson this shade i looked at on the
outside just through the packaging and
thought that's going to probably be one
of my favorites because i'm always
looking for a reddish and this isn't
like bright cherry red this is like a
little bit deeper a little bit more
wearable red tone and i put it on and i
really did like it however it was a
slight bit more transparent than i would
have liked but then i thought for a lot
of people are they're probably really
going to like this because i mean i'm
talking for you know news and stuff like
that where maybe i want to show up more
but for the everyday person that's going
out and seeing everyone face to face
maybe you don't want it that much you
know that solid of a shade so i'm going
to apply that in here that is the way
the color looks
and this is the way the swatch looks
which I can't turn my wrists quite
remember you can see it's a little bit
seat has that little bit of a
transparent quality that a lot of these
have but it's got a beautiful sparkle
and it would be a definitely a nice way
to top off any red lipstick and wear it
alone for just that sheer red color and
then my other one here I like plum crazy
a lot pretty plum shade and it's not
necessarily I wouldn't like glanced at
and think wow that's plumb it's just
like a pretty kind of ma vie with a
little bit of a berry undertone it's
gorgeous and so I'm going to put some of
that on my hand here and this is a
little bit different formula it's creamy
yet it has this beautiful gold undertone
okay really unique shade here I don't
know if you can see that but it's the
plum shade but gold is the sparkle not
like that traditional like silvery
glittery Sparkle and so that's what that
shade looks like I really like that okay
so that is plumb crazy and then the
other one I like here is mega moth I
born this one several times um gives you
that sort of nude mod look and by nude I
mean like it's got a lot of you know
those natural undertones to it that you
might find in your skin but it just
brings that little bit of pinkish look
to it it doesn't have as much the
sparkle in this is really fine it's
harder to detect and that may be it may
be something you like so I'm trying to
see there you see it this is probably my
favorite in this grouping i just find it
super wearable for any time you know
it's just one of those all-around nice
glosses so really like mega mauve and
these in this grouping i mean there are
some other ones that are nice too but
those are my top favorites oops now
moving on to pinks and Pink's had some
standouts let me tell you um the one
thats Sarah really like that looked good
on her and again blonde hair blue eyes I
thought Carlotta looked really good on
her and this is
pink that is borderline with a little
bit of coral in it it may be showing up
more pink than coral here but it does of
the other Pink's that I tried this one
has the most coral undertone to it so
I'm going to apply some of that here and
this has a little bit of sparkle but not
much I can't call it a straight cream
shade it does have that little again I
hold it where I can't tell if I'm
showing you it or not but it does have a
little bit of sparkle to it and it's a
little more pinky than you see it right
here it's more pinky as I look at it but
if you like pinks and you're like a hint
of coral that would be great um the
other one we just like had so much fun
with this one because it's like Barbie
doll pink it's called flippin hot and
this is a really opaque you know like
creamy pink like I'm going to put it on
my hand here and it's a little different
it has a slight slight metallic feel
just a little bit more than the others
and it doesn't seem to have glitter with
it it's just like straight up pink and
you may be saying why are you
recommending this to me and you know
what I may not necessarily be even
recommending it to you I just think if
there is anyone out there that once a
great pink lip gloss that's it baby
that's what you want okay if you have
that need I don't know you may or may
not wear pink lip gloss that bright that
often but why not now my favorite pink
in the whole bunch of the whole group of
Pink's is this shade that I have on
right now it's called Monroe a go-go and
that is a it's got a little bit of
shimmer to it I can't call it a just a
straight cream it has just a hint of
shimmer and it's so I feel like it's
really wearable like I feel like I could
wear this on the news if I wanted to
it's just you're going to see it next to
flip and hot and you're going to see
this difference that I'm talking about
it's a little bit it's a little bit more
pearly it has that slight bit of
shimmer to it it's not like a flat color
and so anyway those are the shades and
guys these are my favorites out of the
whole group so those are my favorite
nudes my favorite deep metallic shades
and then my favorite Pink's so I hope as
you look through that site you're
looking at all these different shades
maybe you won't feel quite so lost you
know you'll have gotten to see some of
these swatched and hear what I had to
say about it and maybe it will make you
feel a little more like Eddie's as
you're picking one out so anyway that's
my review of the Coastal Scents max
again awesome applicator just be careful
when you're picking out the colors
because there are some there I mean
obviously ones that I didn't mention
here but they are very very transparent
and you won't get a lot of color out of
them but then these that i mentioned i'm
really really happy with so thank you
guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
