for this collective haul video slash
mini reviews that's kind of what I'm
calling it because collective haul is in
I didn't buy all this stuff at once
generally haul videos or people show you
know stuff they got on their shopping
trip or whatever and these are things
that I've gotten over time so it's kind
of like a lot put it all together just
to kind of let you know what I have what
I'm using the things I'm kind of testing
out I just put on hand sanitizer and I
feel like I'm going to sneeze right now
it's like raspberry oh it's really
strong but anyway I'll get over it
this is just a bunch of different things
that I've gotten it's pretty much all
drugs yeah it's all drugstore just stuff
I'm testing out right now and I'll kind
of tell you what I think about it as we
go so yeah that's basically what I'm
doing I'm wearing my little flannel
shirt by the way
this is I've worn this in past videos
because it's kind of like my go-to shirt
to put on if I'm a little cold around
the house and just want something to put
on over at the top of whatever I'm
wearing I got this from like the little
boys section of Walmart and I think it's
just I just really like the print it's
so cute I wore it for a segment on the
news that we were doing last Halloween
and it was like I was a cowboy I just
chose to dress up as a cowboy so this
was like the perfect little flannel
shirt for that but anyway to the makeup
I have several different chunks of
things first was something I got from
the dollar store not too long ago Dollar
General as many of you know they are
selling certain elf products there and I
had gotten the dramatic flash kit and so
this is just a dollar and they have the
dramatic and the natural that they sell
there this is what the dramatic looks
like and you may be wondering well why
do you only have one set there well
that's because I used this set I trimmed
him up and they're currently like my
favorite little false lashes to wear
kind of on the outside for that added
fullness on the outer edge so basically
what I did was these are pretty long so
I cut it up and I kind of trimmed them
so they were sort of tapering out to be
a little bit longer
I guess tapering in to be a little
shorter towards this part of my eye on a
little longer toward the outside but
I really like them they've been holding
up really well I've cleaned him off
every time I've used him and I've used
him for probably five times now I really
like the way they look for work they're
just not overdone but yet they give you
that look of more thickness in your lash
area so if you're looking for a little
do-it-yourself trick there
totally just clip you know that up with
some scissors kind of make each side
even obviously and if you got a lot of
you have a lot to work with because you
have a really long strip here so yeah I
have this other set then for when these
get a little raggedy you know I'll try
that out but we're only a dollar I mean
you can and you get that many uses it's
awesome and by the way I did a blog if
you go to my blog and you search false
eyelashes I did something all about
caring for your lashes when you can tell
that you've worn them too much it's time
to toss them out that kind of thing get
a lot of questions about that and so I
covered it in that blog another thing I
got from the dollar store I wanted to
try out one of these cheap like 99 cents
I think LA Colors lipsticks they say
they have vitamin E and aloe vera this
one I shade I have is called satin and I
swear it smells a lot like my MAC
lipstick and I love the smell of the Mac
yeah kind of a cupcake sort of vanilla
slightly sweet scent not overboard or
anything not like horribly fruity and
stuff but just kind of a sweet cake sort
of scent so I was really surprised by
that because sometimes with really
really cheap products the thing you have
to sacrifice is maybe the scent or
something but this shade is Jagger's
kind of a middle-of-the-road sort of
neutral little bit pinky a little bit
light brown just swatch it on my hand
there just very very easy to wear has a
little bit of a metallic finish not as
creamy maybe our moisturizing feeling as
I would like but you know it'll work
it's pretty good so I was just sort of
like delightfully surprised by that
purchase there from the dollar store
then Walgreens I've got a series of
things here that I've gotten over time
on buy one get one free score buy one
get one half off I can't remember
what the exact deal was when I purchased
these but they're kind of in twos here
according to brands so from covergirl I
tried out their new lash blast length so
if you've tried lash blast and the big
orange - but this is the lengthening
kind and you can see what the brush
looks like there it's a little bit
longer brush just the the little spikes
under a little bit longer towards this
end and then they get a little shorter
here I can't quite decide yet if I like
it better than what regular lash blast
or not it is nicely lengthening but I
just can't decide yet if I think it's it
really gives me the look of more lashes
necessarily so that's still definitely
under review for me but you'll probably
see it in some tutorials or maybe you
already have I can't remember if I've
used it yet or not the other thing I got
was one of these wet slicks fruit
spritzers lip gloss and berry splash
pretty shimmery light pink hadn't tried
any of these yet and these have been out
for a while but the scent is so good oh
my gosh this is probably one of the best
smelling lip glosses that I've tried and
it's got just a really nice light pink
shimmer maybe I'll put it over the top
of what I have on you can see it's this
is over sort of a light nude pink
lipstick that I had on yeah I like it I
really like it it's kind of one of those
overlapping shades it's it's fairly
sheer but it does have that hint of pink
nice amount of shimmer I really like
that love that said the flavor is very
splash really really like that one um
other stuff I tried out a couple of the
Maybelline Color sensational lipsticks a
lot of people have been asking if you
try to man have you tried them I have
tried them and I really really liked
them um the shade of lipstick that I
actually had on underneath this gloss
which and I featured this lipstick in a
tutorial already is number 15 it's
called born with it and it's a really
pretty light pinky sort of nude ice a
light pink / nude B clip because it's
not one of those in-your-face Pink's
it's very very wearable it's very
just kind of works with any makeup look
any outfit I've gotten a lot of use out
of this already the scent sort of a
somewhat strong scent and it's not maybe
my favorite scent ever but I really am
not super sensitive to it so I don't
really see it it's a big problem because
the lipstick is so creamy
it feels moisturizing it's very
pigmented you know it's wipe of that on
your lips and it just just really good
quality lipsticks you can see the
packaging is sort of this twist up and
then the cap comes down over the top and
the cap colors are a little bit
different depending on what color family
you got these from like I have two here
I don't know if you can tell but they
are a little bit different colored so
that one was born with it the other one
I have is party pink this is more of
your fuchsia kind of brighter pink shade
I really do like this shade as well but
I haven't gotten to wear it as much it
just doesn't necessarily work with as
many things like just a neutral light
pink does but it's still really nice I
once again the texture is great I love
the how it's just you know you put it on
your lips it feels moisturizing the
color is nice and rich really really
like those lipsticks and we'll probably
look into some other shades of those as
well um other things here from L'Oreal
haven't really ever gotten into the
L'Oreal eyeshadows the where infinite
eyeshadows I think I had like a long
time ago once and just wasn't really
pleased with the color payoff but
decided to kind of go back and try them
again the quad I got is in there you go
those are that now the colors are
showing up a little better and this is
very violet so what you get here is
they're all sort of matte I guess this
shade number three here has a little
shimmer they're numbered and then it
tells you on the back like how to use
the numbering to get I guess a typical
eyeshadow look but you've got sort of
the yellowy toned highlight shade a
light lavender a deeper lavender plum
and then a really nice kind of basically
black slash deep deep navy blue so I
really like these colors grouped
together it
isn't necessarily what you would
instantly think of I like to get quads
where the grouping of colors seems a
little more random that sometimes it's
just more fun that way especially after
you've tried a lot of eye shadows so um
I've used this once I was really pleased
with the way it came off the colors
could have been a little bit more rich
or soft or kind of creamy feeling but I
still like the the payoff that I got
mainly with the colors here at the
bottom was really pleased with those so
I may do a tutorial or something like
that if you guys are interested I don't
know and then I just went back and got
another original voluminous mascara this
is one of those that I've used on and
off you know kept repurchasing not
necessarily consecutively like right
after I run out but I'll keep it in
rotation usually in my mascaras that I'm
using voluminous just has one of those
really traditional kind of thick brush
mascaras here I think I did one of those
where I just told her that before and
I'm always called out on it by someone
but anyway I've always liked voluminous
it's not been maybe you know ultra
favorite but it's just a good day-to-day
general mascara to use just gives you a
thick lash look so I do like that Oh
next thing I wanted to mention I got a
magazine I thought I'd just put this in
my haul video I hadn't really gotten
these before I've gotten too and so far
in recent weeks but it's the
sophisticate hair style guide I haven't
read too many hair style magazines other
than this one but these are really good
to give you some makeup ideas too I mean
hair is great as well but they
oftentimes will do these profiles on
different stars and they'll ask like
what their favorite makeup is or what
they use to get their look day-to-day
and like for example here's like Carrie
Underwood and you know they may mention
what kind of makeup you can use to
achieve that look or what her favorites
are through one of these magazines I
found out about the NYC super cheap
liquid liner that is Megan Fox's one of
her favorites apparently so you can get
a really close up look
someone's makeup if you want to do like
a celebrity inspired look so you get a
really really nice clear picture of that
but you've also of course got the hair
stuff too here's like Miley Cyrus and
then it has like some of her favorite
products that she says she uses so um I
was just kind of surprised at how much
makeup there was involved in these and
then to get hairstyle ideas and stuff
like that these are good to get every
now and then not like you have to get
them every time they come out but it's
kind of fun just now and then to see
what they've got featured in there okay
now is the stuff from hard candy that is
now being sold at Walmart somebody got
on my on my Facebook fan page and they
said did you know that hard candy is
being sold at Walmart now and I'm like
thinking well I don't know what kind of
Walmart you shop at but I don't think
might has that because hard candy has
always been in my mind sort of a semi
high-end I mean makeup brands really
cute stuff really cute packaging and lo
and behold I want to visit a couple of
my sister Tyler's my sisters-in-law I
guess but and we went to end up going to
a Walmart and I looked around and I was
like oh my goodness they really do have
it here so they probably have it at my
local one too I just haven't checked it
out yet so of course had to get a few
things to try just I I didn't have a
whole lot of time to look so I just got
some of the things that appealed to me
right at the start these adorable
lipsticks with this little like tail
it's like a little ribbon there and they
all had this kind of unique packaging on
the outside this shade that I have here
is called crush and it's got that cute
little like four leaf clover horseshoe
thing going on and it's just pretty kind
of shimmery pinky gold so that's pretty
I just want to get a really wearable
shade that I knew I get some good out of
so that's really really cute also they
do not test on animals for those who are
concerned about that but just adorable
packaging on everything
I got a lip balm which came in this
little box so it's got this cute little
girl on here and this one's name is
Elise I guess and this is what the lip
balm looks like it's like this little
pear shape at home and it's
just sort of tinted balm this one's
light pink the color really doesn't come
off very much so I wasn't necessarily
wild about that purchase but the
lipstick was really nice kind of
moisturizing not super long wearing but
the color was fantastic other thing I
got was the shadows here that come in
this little sort of book oops what did I
just do there was I think I lost the
applicator oh well applicators down
there somewhere but you open it up and
they had I think they had quads or
something but I got this just this three
set nice neutral something you know
every day usually when I don't have a
lot of time to look I'll think what can
I do I know will probably work for me so
I like this I really like this taupe
shade right up here it's really pretty
kind of a nice shimmery brownish taupe
and then they give you this it's kind of
I don't know if you can tell but it's
sort of strapped on there this little
liner little coal liner so that's really
neat to get to try that item as well and
then the thing that really just stole
the show for me was this concealer
palette it's called the nobody's perfect
concealer palette I got it in fair they
also had medium but the medium shades
look just a little dark and you got this
little thing here which is just a little
brush which is tiny so it might only be
good to like spot conceal maybe some
blemishes but still love that love that
idea there and then it just opens up and
you've got several shades of regular
kind of skin tone concealer and then
you've got like a greenish tone to
conceal bread a yellowish tone that can
be good around the eye area on blues and
you've got like a lightish sort of pink
tone concealer so absolutely so cute the
packaging is adorable if you don't even
buy anything just go see if your Walmart
has that yet and just check out how cute
the packaging is it's adorable but
anyway guys so I know that's kind of a
big haul but it didn't happen all at
once it happened over quite a while here
actually and I just wanted to give you a
heads up on what I'm trying when I'm
liking so far or not liking and what I
hope you check out if you get a chance
so they
so much for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
