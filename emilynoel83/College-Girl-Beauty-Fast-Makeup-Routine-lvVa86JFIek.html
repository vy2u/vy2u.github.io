number two in my college girl beauty
series which I'm loving so much because
the first video got such an excellent
response and that one was all about
storage so how to kind of organize your
products in a small space whether that's
a dorm room or an apartment or even if
you're not a college girl this stuff can
still apply to you and I also asked for
requests on what you wanted to see in
future videos and one of the things a
lot of people wanted was a super-fast
makeup routine something you could throw
together real quick for class I've heard
from a lot of moms as well that wants
something very speedy that they can just
put together very quick what I love
about this is a few things it uses
mostly inexpensive products the look is
actually relatively long wearing it does
give you coverage in other words you're
going to see a decent before and after
here with how this comes together and
also it uses no brushes so it is
seriously you know low maintenance in
terms of what it takes to put together
but I still think you get a pretty put
together natural look first thing I used
was a tinted moisturizer you don't have
to use a tinted moisturizer but I think
if you want that little boost of
coverage this can give it to you in the
same same step as your moisturizers so I
used my Aveeno positively radiant my
shade is medium and it has an SPF 30 in
it which is really nice and you know
what if you really want to speed up the
process use both hands
you know what several of these steps you
will see that I'm not just dotting
around
I'm simultaneously getting you know
double the action going here with using
two hands so blend that all out my
Revlon Photoready concealer it's a stick
concealer but it's not as dry as most
stick concealers are so one of the
reasons why I like this is it's great
for under-eye circles it's also great
for blemishes or redness or anything so
dot that around where you need it and
then just use the warmth of your fingers
to blend that out and get it looking
nice and smooth and even then for a
powder I chose a drugstore powder that
really I think gives you the most bang
for your buck and it is the Milani
multitasker powder and it actually
just comes with a nice little puff here
that you can use honestly sometimes when
you use the puff and you really kind of
like press the powder into the skin it
can have a less cakey appearance
sometimes and even when you use a brush
I chose to use a really easy to blend
easy to use blush that's kind of a cream
blush it's Maybelline Dream moose I use
the shade soft plum which actually turns
into a really nice soft pink on the
cheeks and I find that sometimes using
cream based products can look even a
little less cakey a little more fresh
then we're already on two eyes and I
used my Mally ever color shadow stick in
Twilight which is a nice kind of taupe
that's a little bit warmer maybe a
little more toward the Browns I don't
need a primer with this and you don't
need to top it with a shed I'm waiting
for drugstores to come out with a really
great long wearing cream shadow but this
is great because I don't need to reach
for any brushes I can just run it right
over my lids dab it with my finger to
kind of blend it out and then run it
right under my lower lash line for sort
of that smudgy liner look then I use
just some mascara I first curled my
lashes and then I used my L may get up
and grow mascara it's a great thick full
brush and I feel like with just a coat
it can make a big difference in the
appearance of your lash I don't think
that I do think is really important just
for pulling the whole look together is
brows I like the Maybelline define a
brow pencil just kind of go over any
areas that it might be a little bit
sparse or just need a little extra
filling in you can do it relatively
quickly and this one I think comes off
looking really natural great hybrid lip
product as I've called it are the Revlon
lip butters because they're they have a
little shine they have great color they
have the moisture in them as well so I
used berry smoothie with this look which
is a nice fresh pink I think it
brightens up the face and if you want to
take this look and make it just a little
more glam or a little more formal go for
a more red shade or maybe even a deeper
berry shade so there you have it guys a
really fast makeup routine that I was
able to do in less than five minutes and
I think you can do it too because that
takes no brushes it takes very minimal
blending
and it's just easy to pull together so I
hope you enjoyed it thank you so much
for sticking with me through my college
girl beauty series and don't forget to
tell me what you want to see in the next
video thanks a lot for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
