me for part three of my college girl
beauty series in case you haven't kept
up with this one the first video I did
was on some storage ideas for storing
makeup in a small space I also did one
on a really fast like getting ready for
class makeup routine and this one is my
going-out makeup routine something that
would work for you know a party or
social event or just going out with
friends and stuff so Carrie Underwood's
look for the Grammys and I was really a
little bit inspired by that I'm not
saying I'm going exactly after that but
with a light lip some kind of flirty
long lashes here at the ends and just
sort of a neutral eye that's kind of
where my vision was for this a little
bit wanted to consider with this video
using a lot of low cost products
minimizing the amount of products I was
using and also minimizing the amount of
tools we are going to be doing like for
example this eye look mostly with sponge
tips and if you're kind of trying to
round up your brushes and get a powder
brush a blush brush and a brush you can
use like as an eyeshadow blending brush
and that's all you need so to start off
we're using one of my all-time favorite
foundations and it's Revlon Colorstay I
use this because it's got wonderful
staying power great coverage great price
and you can really adjust the way you
apply this to get that look that you're
after I wanted a natural look but I
still wanted great coverage so I used a
spray bottle and a sponge and after I
dotted the foundation all over my face I
just squirted some water on this sponge
and something about that just really
helps the foundation look natural you
just kind of press it into the skin like
this is a really effective way to get
the foundation on there but keep it
looking like skin using my Maybelline
Dream Lumi concealer so it's in this
little pin form it's got a built-in
brush and you can just go around
wherever you feel you need this for me
it was around my eyes and my nose and
just any other spots of discoloration on
my face so you go around there with it
blend it in with your fingers and then
if you want to go back and apply a
little bit more I find that this is a
really buildable friendly conceal gonna
fly a little bit more and it's still not
going to cake up or look like to my next
I use
powder I'm really enjoying it's from NYX
and you saw me use this in the one brand
tutorial but it's stay matte but not
flat it's a powder foundation I applied
it with a brush just over the top of
everything to really set the look I love
that this kind of enhances the staying
power but at the same time it doesn't
look like a powder mask on your skin
something about it it just has the right
look and it keeps everything looking
really fresh it's kind of you know just
if you want to do it go for it if not
that's fine too but I used my Rimmel
natural bronzer in sunlight it's a
pretty light bronzer it's matte and I
just went all over my face with this
we're gonna get our blush brush out and
I'm going to my ELF studio blush and
bronzer this bronzer is a little bit
deeper so I like to use that to create a
little bit of contour with my cheeks I
also go down under my jaw and around my
forehead as well something I've been
noticing lately is anytime I watch
American Idol I feel like Jennifer Lopez
just has wonderful contouring always
around her forehead that area is never
not contoured and bronzed up just a
little bit not only can that minimize
the look of a large forehead but it can
make your makeup look really natural
fading right into your hairline so then
using the same brush I went to the blush
in this compact and it really has a
little bit of a glow to it if I'm trying
to minimize the products I'm using I'll
use a blush like this because then I
don't really feel the need to use a
highlight because it just gives the face
that glow so peachy with a little golden
shimmer went around the apples of my
cheeks with that and I feel like it
really live-ins up the face blush is so
important daytime nighttime anytime one
high-end product that it is an optional
thing but it's becoming more of a
must-have to me and it is Urban Decay
all nighter long-lasting makeup setting
spray I had a little bottle of this
before and now I'm feeling like I want
to use it kind of after every time I
apply my face makeup because I like the
appearance at gifts takes away any
powdery appearance and I feel like it
makes it last a whole lot longer so I
like to actually just spray this
directly up into the air and let it kind
of fall on my face instead of spraying
directly on my face I don't like the
feeling of too
much liquid hitting a made-up face it
just doesn't feel right to me so I let
it kind of mists down on me and I feel
like that way it's never too much
product moving on to eyes we're gonna
prime the lids with NYX HD eyeshadow
base so just dab a little bit of that
all over lot of my eye looks I feel like
I tend to fade from light to dark going
you know left to right let's say but for
this it's gonna be dark to light from
the lashline up okay so the darkest
parts are going to be close to our
lashes so I'm gonna take a sponge tip
applicator and go into this pallet with
the black and think of just putting a
thick line basically along your lash
line I mean just a real smudgy doesn't
have to be precise just lay it down
there and also using a sponge tip we're
gonna go to this Brown which is a nice
kind of cool Brown I really like using
this shade because I don't feel like it
screams Brown it's just kind of neutral
and then sort of overlap the black a
little bit and take that up almost into
your crease then you can grab your
crease brush and go into that same brown
and this is going to diffuse it a little
bit and blend and work on the blending a
little bit into our crease so just kind
of go back and forth and really get that
color blended out nicely using the same
crease brush go to this other dark shade
that's just up a little bit right here I
consider it kind of like a shimmery
taupe reminds me kind of a satin taupe
from Mac and blend that right above your
darkest shade there in the crease so now
as you can see we're getting this effect
of darkest to lightest and then for our
ultimate lightest shade our highlight
I'm just blending between these top two
colors one's a little more golden ones
kind of like a really light white color
just blend between those two and take it
right under your eye
I don't think that comes with this
palette is an angled sponge tip and I
like using this for under the eye area
so we're gonna go into the black shade
and really lay it down on the outer
corner the first place you put a sponge
tip is always where the most product
will go same goes for a brush or any
kind of applicator so we want the most
product on the outer corner and then
you're just gonna kind of pull inward
and you know whatever's left will kind
of smudge in and you're not gonna end up
with too much product but you're gonna
have a nice amount of depth there under
the oven I'm taking the black liner from
the nude eyes trio of liners
really
nice soft long wearing black pencil
liner and so I'm going to go on my inner
rim with this I'm also going to kind of
intensify the area right where my lashes
are growing out kind of getting right in
between the lower lashes they're on the
outside and deepening that up upper lash
line I'm using my covergirl line last 24
hour this is in the black and I'm just
going from inner to outer corner we're
going to lay the foundation there
basically so we can set on some false
lashes before we get to that though I'm
using one of my favorite mascaras and
this is the Almay one coat get up and
grow mascara and this was an Emily Award
winner
I think the brush is fantastic I think
the formula is great as well if you want
something that really looks to kind of
grab every lash not too wet by any means
just go over your upper and your lower
lashes with it I'm using some false
lashes these are the number 307 s and
these are half strip lashes so you're
just gonna set these on the outer part
of your eye and it's gonna give kind of
this nice flirty sort of upturned look
here on the outside also easy to for
lips I contemplated going with something
brighter but then I thought you know
sometimes when you're going out you
don't necessarily want to be a slave to
your lip color flying brighter colors or
darker colors can be kind of tedious at
times you know you really have to pay
attention to what you're doing if you're
wearing a lighter shade if it wears off
it's not as obvious number one and
reapplying is a little more foolproof so
I'm using my Wet n Wild mega shield in
birthday suit I love this color it's
kind of just a sort of a golden e toned
metallic a little bit talked about this
as one of my favorite hydrating
lipsticks as well in my last video so
definitely a recommended product there
and then you're all done you're not
using a ton of products you're not using
a lot of money and you're not using
really a lot of skill to be honest this
was an easy makeup tutorial and it's
something you can that can kind of be a
go-to look for you when you're going on
so I really wanted this to be a neutral
eye look that would go with anything so
it's kind of like when in doubt what can
I do alright these products will work
you know what I mean so for all you
college
out there for all you moms or high
school girls or whoever wants to use
this look it can work for tons of
occasions tons of people but I thought
really fit into my college girl beauty
series is my hair by the way I just put
in some hot rollers and a little bit of
hairspray and kind of shook out the
curls and then I didn't even attach
anything back here I just took the hair
and basically took it around this
shoulder so it looks like it's kind of a
side-swept look so if you're wondering
how to do that very easy not a problem
very quick so thank you again so much
for watching I hope you've been enjoying
this series and let me know what other
kinds of videos you want to see you'll
have a great day and I'll talk to you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
