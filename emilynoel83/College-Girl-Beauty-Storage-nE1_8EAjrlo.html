by request here on beauty broadcast am
calling it college girl beauty and
basically I had some questions on
Facebook and on Twitter about you know
what would you suggest for a quick
makeup routine what do you suggest as
far as storage is concerned and just
different questions like that so I
thought maybe I could make kind of a
little mini series about it or just kind
of see where it goes in college I lived
in a dorm room for four years it wasn't
the smallest dorm room ever but it was
still kind of a confined space so that's
why I wanted to kick things off with
storage just kind of the basics of how
do you store you know a decent amount of
makeup in a college dorm you know maybe
I could have been doing this at the
start of the school year but it just
occurred to me now and I didn't want to
wait another semester so maybe your New
Year's resolution when you go back to
school after Christmas break could be to
redo your storage or whatever you've got
a really big collection I would suggest
either keeping some of it at home or
maybe there's a space in a closet where
you can throw some up in a box there or
store it somewhere else so your primary
storage area that I'm going to show you
has just the things you need I've
created this sort of mock makeup setup
just to show you an example of how to
possibly put some things together give
you a few ideas and then I would love to
hear in the comments section what your
words of advice are for storing makeup
in a confined space such as a dorm room
or maybe you've just got you know an
apartment maybe you're sharing space
with someone else it's always tricky
when you've got roommates as well
because you don't want to take up too
much space but you still want to get all
the stuff you need alrighty here's a
look at what we've got going on here
this is a basic three drawer Sterilite
container and these are plastic you can
find then usually at Walmart or Target
or source like that and I will get the
dimensions on this and put them up for
you so you know you have a better idea
of what you're seeing here but here's
about the height of my desk and this is
the type of thing that could fit under a
desk as well if you're short on wall
space or someone somewhere else to put I
used to have a little mirror at college
that I would sit on top of this kind of
and I would look in it about like this
but this is just a mirror there for show
so I'll set that over here and in this I
used always a little separate container
for my lip stuff and I think but by the
time I graduated I had like one of these
little three drawer things with my lip
products in there but I'm thinking about
again just what you need this type of
little container could store you know
quite a few lipsticks I don't know
probably ten lipsticks and a bunch of
lip liners and you know lip glosses as
well always be on the lookout for little
containers that can go down in another
container like this that's just an idea
I keep this separate and you're gonna
see in just a minute um kind of why that
makes sense as we go through the rest of
this container down in this first drawer
and this contains face stuff and also
some eye products here so basically
right here in front I've put a little
tub and as you can see these drawers are
kind of deep so they can help you stand
up some products in here that some other
drawer containers might not allow you to
do but I've got like a couple of
foundation options we got Revlon
Colorstay and Neutrogena Healthy Skin a
primer Rimmel fix and perfect some
concealers is powder that's kind of good
for on the go like L'Oreal True Match
and then one that's more of a powder
foundation like Milani so we're not
sacrificing a whole lot here we've still
got a lot of selection and I've got a
few skincare ideas here as well I love
the Aveeno moisturizers positively
radiant is a great one we got an eye
makeup remover a little tub of Vaseline
clean and clear Percy gel is a great
zapper that I continue to use to this
day used it in college too I've got this
product here this is the revive eye
serum from Dollar General it's actually
a nice eye cream and then something to
help your makeup last a long time I used
the Urban Decay all nighter which is
actually a pretty good setting spray
I've come to notice that that really
does work rather well so then here I've
got just a little glass this is like a
little juice glass and I've put in you
know a variety of different mascaras
along with my tweezers and what's in the
very back here and I would probably like
pull these out while I'm used
but this is again that Sigma bunny brush
kit that I reviewed not too long ago so
as you can see those fit great right
down in here because they're a little
bit shorter brushes they're still nice
and full but they're shorter handles and
then you double that up and you've got a
couple of little containers to put
things mix slide on pencils NYX jumbo
pencil maybelline define a brow a liquid
liner and I primer things like that so
basically I'm not doing this to tell you
all the must-haves but just to kind of
point out the storage elements there so
that's face and some eyes second drawer
second of three drawers we've got some
eye products and some face products so
as you can see here I've divided up this
drawer as well and I also wanted to show
you that if you've got pallets if you
got like a great Coastal Scents palette
here it will hold those Coastal Scents
palette so if you had a bunch of those
you could take out these dividing things
and just fold some of your palettes
there but they're plenty tall enough for
those I've also got a Z palette in here
as well so that's great for deep potting
some of your items and then just putting
them in their own little palette that
you can see everything you have so
that's a great option in the back here
I've just got a little square container
and again look to Walmart or Dollar
Stores for keep little dividing
containers but I've got my ELF
contouring blush and bronzer too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer elf studio
blushes are gray then I've got a little
container here with some eye shadow
palette just you know wet and wild
palettes here I like some of those
Maybelline stylish smokes palettes you
know I got the covergirl shimmering
sands some NYX palettes are brave and I
just kind of swords some other shadows
here just kind of free all right here in
the front that could definitely store
you know quite a bit of product there
but just do whatever you need and this
drawer down here at the very bottom it's
gonna be a little more inconvenient for
you to use on a daily basis so I put a
lot of like extra little things down
here for example travel makeup bags or
you know your q-tips and your sponges
and maybe you've got like a bunch of
body products you want
put down here like lotions or sunless
Tanner's I remember its storing all that
stuff in my bottom drawer brush cleaner
oddly packaged things that are really
hard to fit in with the rest of your
makeup like this body frosting from
laura geller so um you might even want
to put hair tools or something like that
in here because this is a nice long
drawer and like I said all of them are
equal size and they're pretty feet so I
hope that was useful for you and again
stay tuned because I will be doing some
more different videos in this series I
was a few ideas that I just had were
like a quick before class makeup routine
you know something quick you could throw
together something for parties and
formals and you know whatever things you
might be participating in and I don't
know just give me your ideas what you
think applies to a college girl what
they need to know about makeup oh
another one I was thinking was like your
travel bag for when you go back home or
if you wanted to keep like a touch-up
bag in your backpack or something like
that so again keep me posted on your
ideas and thanks so much for watching
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
