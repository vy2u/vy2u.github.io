this is basically where I choose a color
and then I tell you about some of my
favorite makeup products that come in
that shade and last week on beauty
broadcast live I was asking what kind of
shapes you guys wanted to see for fall
because there's so many nice rich deep
colors and burgundy was one that came up
a lot and that's definitely one of my
favorites too because I have favourites
in eyes lips nails cheeks
you name it some palettes even so let's
get started and talk about lips first
and this is something I'm wearing today
along with one other product and it's
the tarte lipsurgence in moody I've had
this little guy for so long I'm about
out of it but it is just a really really
pretty deep red color and I know it
looks super dark there in the packaging
it's not really as dark when you see it
on the lips or in a swatch here's what
it looks like it's definitely wearable I
love the texture of these I think
they're really moisturizing on the lips
they have a little bit of a minty scent
to them but I really love that shade on
top of that I'm wearing a really really
glamorous awesome shiny color and it's
from NYC and it's the liquid lip shine
and this shade is eat what's it called
wine and dine so so pretty if you keep
up with my blog you know I mentioned
this with my top full lip glosses just a
regular doe foot applicator there I'll
swatch it right beside the lip surgence
look at how intense that color is for
something in this kind of liquidy gloss
form I'm really impressed that there's
so much rich color payoff so I really
enjoy this another shade that's just a
classic and if you've gotten in on the
Revlon lip butter craze you probably
already have this and it's the lip
butter and red velvet a very wearable
red shade I'll swatch that here for you
as well
see how it's got a nice depth to it
still a lot of shine in there so moody
from Tarte is kind of like your sheer
way to experience Burgundy and then
these are a couple of more intense
options so a lipliner and I know this is
more on the plum side but I end up using
it a lot of times when I'm doing these
deeper red lip colors and I think it
works really nicely and it's from
Jordana and it's the easy liner for lips
and plush plum so just a twist up style
there you don't have to sharpen it and
when you see it alongside these other
colors I think you can totally see how
this would work paired with some of
these other shades and I do think a lip
liner is nice to have when you're
working with deeper colors and you're
trying to you know keep the look really
precise on your lips this is a great one
and so inexpensive I haven't done my
nails yet I just totally ran out of time
last night but I did grab my favorite
burgundy nail polish to tell you about
and this is the wet and wild megalast
line which I really really love and this
shade is called haze of love so it's a
very creamy rich burgundy shade not too
purpley it's still got a lot of red in
it and I really like the brush on these
polishes if you've tried these you know
that it's kind of a thick brush kind of
wide left to right so very similar to
the Sally Hansen complete salon manicure
I do feel like these wear really nicely
you know just put a top coat on there
and I think you really extend the wear a
lot our cheeks I actually do have a
couple of blushes that I do think they
appear kind of burgundy in the packaging
sheared out I think they give just a
gorgeous rosy flush to the cheeks
perfect for fall and by the way you
don't have to wear all the burgundy
things all at once like I am today I
wanted to show you as much as possible
on my face so you could get a sense of
how it would load you're free to pick
and choose I do however like to when I'm
wearing a deep lip like this I like to
wear kind of a rosy blush and I'm
wearing today is from NARS and the shade
is Dolce Vita or Dolce Vita and it is a
really really pretty color like when you
see it kind of sheared out see how much
red is in this shade looks so pretty on
the cheeks just really lightly there's
not a lot of shimmer in this shade
I mean I really feel like it's for the
most part pretty mad so love that blush
also if you're wanting a lower-cost
alternative to that at the elf's studio
blush and blushing Rose see how similar
these shades are you know they're pretty
close blushing Rose though does have a
little bit of shimmer in there so you're
going to get some added glow along with
the color on your cheeks I love this
shade love them both so I just wanted to
give them both the shout out
let's talk eyes shadow for a great cream
base loving the Maybelline Color tattoo
and pomegranate Punk
this may have been one of the first that
I picked up when the color tattoos came
out so pretty kind of metallic
definitely rosy and that is you know the
base for my eye look today and these
lasts a long time you can wear them on
their own but this makes a very
beautiful layering color if you want to
put a taupe over the top of it or some
you know a sheer wash of some other
shade a little bit of this shines
through and it's very unique and pretty
so the other thing I've got on my eyes
today which is a great quad that
incorporates burgundy is this one from
Maybelline eye studio in taupe temptress
so this is great you've got the deep
burgundy shade but along with it you've
got a pearly white and then like you can
kind of go in two different directions
with the mid-tone shade you can go more
warm with this pretty rose gold color or
you can use this taupe kind of greyish
shade so I use the taupe color over
pomegranate Punk on my lid start
blending this up into the crease smudge
this deep burgundy also under my eye
it's a very very pretty quarter are the
swatches you can see pearly your
mid-tones and then really really deep
burgundy color a couple of singles that
you may have heard me mention in my
makeup geek favorites video but they're
both kind of two different takes on
Burgundy that I think are just stunning
one is the makeup geek shadow in
burlesque beautiful shimmery burgundy
shade see how there's a nice amount of
red in there but it's very deep you
could do a smoky eye with that shade not
be worried about it like making your
eyes look sickly or anything like that
the other shade that I love from this
line that's so unique is called bitten
and this would be like a matte
take on a burgundy red so give you a
swatch of that as well you can see a
little more red comes through in this
matte shade and I actually chose to use
bitten really softly just blended up
around the border of this look to bring
out some more of the red because in
taupe temptress the burgundy is very
very deep I like throwing in that extra
shade to just pop it up a notch so I
wanted to point out another great
burgundy is this cyber Ruby single from
Estee Lauder it's the pure color cyber
metallic and you can wear these wet or
dry this is a gorgeous shade I use this
in my Estee Lauder one brand tutorial
but it's very similar to burlesque from
makeup geek so if you're looking for a
dupe option there those colors are very
similar and one more quad that works in
burgundy and this is an oldie but a
goodie
such a great quad I'm falling back in
love with it again it's the cover girl
drama eyes if you've been with me
forever you know I used to talk about
this constantly and yeah it's got the
perfect Burgundy a silver a black and a
white so you can get an intense dark eye
with this look if you want went ahead
and swatch these right here look how
great those shades are more pigmented
than you might expect so I love those
way I thought it might be useful for me
to mention a few bigger palettes if
you're thinking about a larger palette
purchase in the near future and you do
want it to include this beautiful
burgundy color a few recommendations
from me one is bon jovi one of my
favorite shades in this palette is Alice
copper right down here beautiful kind of
plummy burgundy there's a lot of like
berry tone in that shade and you're
getting of course lots of other great
colors as well couple lip and cheek
products too also in the bones new -
there's a matte take on a burgundy shade
I know i mentioned this invest in beauty
but sexy this shade right here kind of
plummy but still when you sheer it out
you see a lot more of the red in that
shade and I think it's so gorgeous
also the lorac unzipped palette looks
like this this is great if you love your
neutrals in that kind of rosy rose gold
bronze family and there's a really great
shade up here in the corner
it's called unbridled and it's matte it
looks really really dark there but again
you can get different tones of these
shades to come out depending on how you
apply them to your eyes so if you pack
it on it can be that dark but if you
sheer it out you will see more of a
pretty burgundy kind of wine color out
of that thank you guys so much for
checking out this color lovers video the
last ones that I did were in the summer
so I got a lot of like a summery color
requests but now that it's fall if
you've got any new colors you want to
see in this series definitely let me
know and I'll be happy to create more of
these videos for you so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you next
