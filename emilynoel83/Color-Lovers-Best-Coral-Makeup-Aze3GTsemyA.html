it's called color lovers and it's all
about different colors each video I'll
be highlighting beauty products from a
certain you know color family this time
it's coral and I thought it would just
be a really fun time of year being
spring to introduce something like this
everybody's looking for different ways
to incorporate a little more color into
their beauty routines so I've got lip
products cheek products eye products and
even a nail product to talk about in
this video and I would love to get your
suggestions on which colors you'd like
to see featured as we go along um a few
things off the top of my head we're like
pink mint green turquoise things like
that so if you've got any colors you
would like me to talk about let me know
because I want to do what you want to
see obviously I need to talk about coral
first because first off I feel like I
have a lot of coral products that I like
and also I just feel like every time
spring rolls around coral gets really
really popular again and you're just
seeing a lot of outfits in those colors
and it's nice to have some beauty
products to coordinate I'm not saying
you need to wear all these things at the
same time but maybe you just want the
pop on the lips or the nails or the
cheeks you know one at a time it can
work great that way so with cheek
products the first thing I want to talk
about is benefits cha-cha tint and this
was actually the first like tint type
product I believe that I got from
benefit and I remember looking at it in
Ulta and thinking do I want to spend on
this is this something I'm going to wear
a lot and I got it and I really liked it
but I found out we started wearing it
most when I got a good method for
applying it but it's a great kind of
almost creamy where some of the tints
seem kind of transparent this one has a
very creamy look to it and I mean it's
just very kind of orange coral but I
love using my ELF small stippling brush
to apply I put it on my hand just like
that pick some of it up on the brush and
go right over the cheeks so I've got
that on today it's a nice wash of color
but it's definitely something
you will see if you're frustrated by
certain tints sometimes not really
giving off enough color you'll really
see this once you put it on your face
sometimes coral borders more on orange
sometimes more on pink this particular
shade of blush really pulls in the pink
and I think it's just beautiful and it's
the dream bouncy blush from Maybelline
and Hot Tamale
this is another kind of light cream
product that I think looks really fresh
on the cheeks and I'll just take that
stipple brush and go right into it it's
got that texture where you can kind of
press into a little bit different in
that way and I just find this to be
probably the most flattering shade I've
tried from this line and also just one
of my favorite cream blushes all around
this was an Emily award winner this is
the hot mama blush from the balm this is
really cute packaging but this is
actually marketed as a blush /i shadow
and that's important to keep in mind
with any of these blushes you know if
you want a little pop of coral or use
some to blend out you know a deeper
shade you can totally do that but this
one incorporates a lot of gold i layered
a little bit of this on top of the
cha-cha tint and it really didn't use a
separate highlight I let this kind of be
the thing that sort of caught the light
on my face and I think it's beautiful
too bright but definitely kind of makes
me think of summer and spring in that
kind of now I have some eye shadows to
talk about and there are actually quite
a few like drugstore quads that
incorporate coral is kind of the main
shade and one is the Maybelline eye
studio quad and Coral Oasis I've had
this one for a while I'm glad this is
part of the regular line you can find it
anytime and it's got this great coral
shade right here it also has brown it
also has a really interesting sort of
yellowish green which is sort of rare to
find in a palette and then a really
really soft kind of peachy champagne
color so I find that the color with
these I mean it's very velvety soft very
easy to wear easy to blend just recently
mentioned this in my video on the new
NYX products but I want to make sure you
know about it because I think it's a
great little set here this is the love
and Florence the shade is called eat
love be fab and as you can see it's got
that great kind of peachy coral there
would look great as a blush as well but
beware it does have some glitter so this
is kind of that pinky coral with quite a
bit of sparkle but very pretty used in
conjunction with the green with just
some brown coral and brown I think look
beautiful on the eyes so that's another
great option also I think coral is a
pretty pop in the midst of a more smoky
look and one of the palettes this is the
only kind I've tried from this color
riche line from l'oreal but it's called
shopping spree and in here it has and
actually a mat very pinky coral and I
think it's so pretty I've used this in a
get ready with me video if you want to
see it in action but I think that's kind
of a fresh you know innocent fun color
and then you pair it with some of the
deeper shades and maybe smoke out your
liner with some of these charcoal colors
it looks really pretty so I'm wearing a
lot of coral all over I wanted to go
kind of subtle on the eyes and I went
with just kind of a wash of a pretty
peachy color and this is the Coastal
Scents hotpot in reef coral and this
shade is so pretty it's only a dollar
ninety-nine I can't get over the fact
that these hot pots are just a buck
ninety-nine I took this right out of my
Z palette where I have it stored so it
magnetizes in there and you can get
other smaller palettes to put these in
but I just love this shade they say it's
matte on the website I would call it
more of a satin finish definitely a
pretty soft coral a little more toward
the peachy side of things so I just
think that's a great buy if you just
want that one shade to give you that pop
a lip products I love coral e PG lip
products so I've got a lot to talk about
here the first one is the Revlon lip
butter and the shade is tutti frutti
this is really bordering on like an
orange e color and I'm wearing actually
a little bit of this just a sheer amount
of this this can be very full color if
you want it to be but I just put a sheer
amount of that just on my lips to start
with and then over the top of that a
great gloss is the mac lipglass and pink
lemonade and i mean the name is pink
lemonade but I store this with my curly
colored lip products because it really
gives off kind of a
cocky pinky coral vibe and so I've got
that for the gloss over the top and I
just think it's beautiful I this is
probably one of my favorite Mac lip
glasses that I own I'm really glad I
have it if you want a lip gloss that
borders more on the orange side of
things
I would definitely recommend Coral Reef
Revlon Super Lustrous this is really
color this is not a sheer lip gloss um
really you can count on it for full
color and I love the Super Lustrous
formula I talk about it a lot so that's
a great option and also if you're
wanting just you know sheer very
wearable kind of feeling like a tinted
lip balm type thing on your lips
pinup peach from the color whisper line
from Maybelline is a really nice one you
can wear this very sheer you can also
just build up the color a little bit
more on your lips and it's going to have
more of a pinky vibe a little more
brightness to it so I think that's
really a really nice option probably one
of my favorites from that whole color
whisper line okay if you guys watched
the Emily awards for lips you know I
talked a lot about these Neutrogena
jumbo sticks these are the moisture
smooth color sticks is what's what
they're actually called and fresh papaya
would be my pick for a great coral and
jumbo pencils are so easy so waiting you
a little more precision than a lipstick
but still these feel and they smell so
good too they smell so fruity they feel
super smooth incredibly comfortable on
the lips this is going to be subtle if
you're thinking I don't know about this
coral thing I've never worn coral before
this is just going to take your lips up
a notch give them a little bit of
brightness it's going to freshen up the
entire face if you you know take one of
these lip colors and work it in and this
is just a very easy way to do that and
for the lips one quick mention about the
Maybelline Vivid's I know these are
hugely popular right now I have the one
in shock in coral I think it's a
gorgeous color but it comes off and it
probably is looking real coral here but
on my lips I feel like this comes off
very pink I don't know if anybody else
has had that experience I figured people
you know might think about this shade as
I'm doing this coral topic video
but this comes off as score of like a
bright pink on my lips so just keep that
in mind if you see it in the stores I
know there are some more orange shades
in the Vivid's line but this shocking
Coral definitely goes more toward the
pink side of last but not least a great
coral nail-polish and this is kind of
like creamy just full on Coral pretty
color and I've gotten a lot of
compliments on this when I've had it on
and it's from the balm and it's the hot
ticket nail polish and this shade is
called coral refined it's like refined
and it's just really you know smooth
creamy pretty color actually dry
surprisingly fast so just overall
quality it's a good nail polish but I
think that's just a really pretty soft
shade compared to my shirt you can see
it is just a little bit more peachy a
little bit softer that's it for my first
color lovers video it kind of makes me
think of like a meatlovers pizza for
pizza or something but I would really
love to hear your suggestions on what
colors you would like to see also if
you're interested in seeing accessories
or anything other than makeup tied into
this let me know about that I just
thought I'd start with Beauty here
because I had so much of it to talk
about for coral products but definitely
just tell me what you want to see and
thank you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
