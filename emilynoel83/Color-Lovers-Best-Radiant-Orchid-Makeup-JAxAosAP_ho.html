great day I hope you're excited for this
video because I am I have been like
plotting in my mind what I was going to
talk about in this video for quite a
while nitu my colour lovers videos this
is where I choose a color and then I
give you a bunch of great products that
are in that shape the Pantone color of
the Year being radiant orchid I have
been so enjoying stumbling across some
great finds in that shade I got things
for lips eyes nails even cheeks in this
video I just think it's one of those
colors that really lends itself to
makeup you know it's not just something
you can integrate into fashion with you
know your accessories and stuff like
that but it's just really a makeup
friendly kind of color start with the
shade that I think it's probably the
truest representation of radiant orchid
and it is the Sally Hansen complete
salon manicure and the shade is called
punch-drunk this is just a really pretty
creamy color that shade is radiant
working to a tee I actually really like
this formula of nail polish I feel like
the brush is kind of like extra wide and
it just really evenly coats the nails
it's awesome drugstore liquid liner that
I stumbled across and this is from
prestige it's the total intensity
against all odds'
liquid ink eyeliner I actually just
recently reviewed a bunch of eyeshadows
from this brand really impressed with
them love those but this is in the shade
around the clock and this color is
gorgeous smelling a little felt tip
applicator and look look how beautiful
this is I mean that will pop on your
eyes and one evening when I was just
playing around in here like I do
sometimes I already had black eyeliner
on and I just put some of this like a
line of this right on top of it I
followed my little wing and I thought
wow this is awesome
pop some lashes on there what a pretty
like accent to your look and I think I
say this every time I shoot a color
lover's video but just cuz I'm giving
like a zillion suggestions doesn't mean
you need to wear all these shades at
once you know you might just pick one
way to pop it out in your look I
actually have it two ways in my look
my lip and then what's going on under
the eyes like crazy I love Ashley went
very simple on the top part of my eyes I
used this cool neutral it's actually
just called cool neutral palette from
cargo and just gave myself you know a
really natural look there but then under
the eye I amped it up with some purple
shadow here underneath the lash line I
think this technique really pops the
most when you line your inner rim with
black something about that just creates
even more contrast with the whites of
your eye and it makes the purple pop out
even more when you put that underneath
and so the shadow I've used is this
single from Sigma called allure and I
just think it works beautifully just
kind of blended underneath there with a
smudge brush
well this shade doesn't have any glitter
in it see how it really does catch the
light it's such a pretty shade and so I
just really like using it in that way we
just featured this in a haul video but
it's l'oreal infallible in burst into
bloom these shadows are really really
nice just all around but this shade is
extra gorgeous I would say if you're
looking for something really really
shimmery and almost metallic looking a
little bit of spark okay this is burst
into bloom see how it's just even more
shiny I could have easily put that shade
here on my lower lash line I just think
that is such a pretty shade I mean going
into spring it's hard to even think that
way because there's snow on the ground
where I am right now but I mean that is
just a dynamite color I love both of
those shadows I want to mention a blush
that's really not radiant orchid but I
think it looks beautiful paired with
these kinds of colors like if you're
wearing a lip like this or a pop of
color on your eye it just really
complements the look nicely and it's the
balmes blush in cabana boy this also
doubles as an eyeshadow they advertise
all of their blushes that way but it's
just a really pretty kind of plummy
blush what I'm wearing on my cheeks
today it just has the slightest bit of
glow to it you can probably see that as
it catches the light another thing that
can be lips or cheeks and this is
something I've reviewed on the Express
channel so definitely check there for
extra info
a little demo on how to use it but it's
the benefit lollitint I really really
enjoy this I think I said in my review
that this product in terms of the
consistency the pigment how much it
shows up was kind of what I wanted
benefits Posie tend to be like but I
always felt like that color was super
faint and this one is just a little bit
more richer and creamy and it's just a
beautiful shape if you want to put that
on your lips you can wear this as a
cream blush really really easily if you
just dot it on and then immediately
blend it out with like your elf small
stipple brush perhaps it creates such a
beautiful look on the cheeks and it
really does stain so you have to work
with it quickly see that swatch is
already kind of like settled in it
moving on to lip products finally and
I've got several to mention and I feel
like they're all a slightly different
tone you know I think they come under
the radiant orchid umbrella but it's
kind of fun to see some deeper shades
maybe some more pinky shades and some
things that maybe if you don't feel like
you can wear this color you know another
color might work well so first I want to
mention the lipstick that I'm wearing I
am nuts about this lipstick it's the Too
Faced la creme lipstick and this is one
of their new shades it's called lollipop
and it looks a little scary they're
gonna hit me in the tube but I've got it
on my lips you know and I feel like a
lot of pink comes out of this shade it's
got a lot of pretty shine but unlike a
lot of the other la creme lipsticks in
the line this does have a little spark
just really been enjoying that color
these are very nice high quality creamy
lipsticks that's something new from
Milani and I can't wait to dig into some
of the new Milani stuff that I've got
because I've got quite a bit I mean new
lip products just new products in
general but they've got these lip
intense liquid colors and this is in the
shade violet addict and these are just
some of the most pigmented colors
imaginable they go on with a wand but
this is not like a lip gloss this is
just like a melted down really pigmented
lipstick is what this makes me think of
it goes on just so full color
and this is an example of an orchid type
shade with a lot of pink in it I feel
like this has more pink in it than the
packaging might lead you to believe
there's loss that I think is super
wearable this would be the lip color
that I think anybody can pick up and use
and have a little fun with the radiant
orchid trend but not go too terribly
bright with it and this is the Revlon
Super Lustrous gloss in fuchsia finery
there's no sparkle in it it's very
comfortable to wear and I do feel like
when you put it on your lips
particularly if your lips are naturally
more of a mauve tone not a really bright
reddish tone naturally this over ma wysz
colored lips like mine I think really
brings out the purple in this awesome
gloss I would really recommend that and
then finally the OCC lip tar in the
shade hoochie this is so fun these are
made to be mixed so if you've got other
shades you can put a little bit of this
in it give it a little bit more of a
purple tone but they squeeze right out
you can apply them with a lip brush
they're very liquidy and it's just pure
color it's so pretty it's got a little
shine those are my favorite beauty
products that follow this great radiant
orchid trend that's happening this year
with the Pantone color of the year if
you've got other great products in this
color let me know about it because I'm
really enjoying just trying some new and
different things honestly I think like
this kind of tone especially on my lips
was something I was a little scared to
do before this year but since I think
the color is out there so much and
you're seeing it more and more it's like
why not just go there and give it a try
and same with the eyes as well that's
really fun so let me know what color you
want to see in my color lovers series
and even if it's something neutral like
if you just want to know some great
topes or some great browns or something
like that I think that's cool too it's
all a color right just because it's not
bright again guys and I'll talk to you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
