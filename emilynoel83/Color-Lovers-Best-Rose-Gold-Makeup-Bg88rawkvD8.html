color lovers series I've been taking
your requests for colors you want to see
and basically the way I present this is
it's just my favorite makeup products
that are of a certain color family so
we've already done coral and turquoise
this one's going to be rose gold this
was hugely requested if you have a
certain color you want to see my top
makeup products in um just request it in
the comment section and I always keep an
eye on that rose gold I think is such a
flattering shade to work into your
makeup I think especially this time of
year when you're getting a little bit
glowy or maybe even you know pulling in
some bronze tones I think rose gold is
gorgeous and worked into a blush into an
eye shadow a lip color I've got a nail
polish here to talk about as well so I'm
gonna get started with eye products
actually and the first one I want to
talk about I love this quad this is from
Maybelline and it's the eye Studio
collection and that's a really really
high-quality collection of eyeshadows
from the drugstore in my opinion I think
they're very comparable to the Lancome
color design and a set that I love and
this is not limited edition they come
out with a lot of limited edition on I
studio quads but this one you can find
all the time and it's called copper chic
and if you're ever trying to spot like a
rose gold shade a lot of times it might
be named something copperish you know so
I think this shade here is totally you
know a great representation of rose gold
and makeup and I love the other shades
that go along with it I'm wearing that
quad in my look today just those shadows
and I think they work really nicely
together these two Browns are great in
the crease I've also smudged them down
below and mainly use the rose gold shade
on the lid another fun quad that I
recently found is from Sonia Kashuk and
this one's going to be a little more
expensive I think this was in the
ballpark of like 12 or 13 bucks and this
is the textured rose monochrome eye quad
so it looks like this and then open it
up dirt
and here are the shadows and just really
pretty rose colored shadows I mean
monochrome it's all like a monochromatic
look and I have worn these together and
you can't actually get enough contrast
in your crease with this pretty shade
right here it's definitely kind of a
dusty rose but it has like a golden
shimmer and then Sonia Kashuk sometimes
puts these kinds of like ultra sparkly
shades and her palettes and they almost
give sorry wrong finger to be doing this
with but it almost gives like a wet look
like if you overlapped any of these
other shades it would pretty much have
like a wet look to it so you've got all
these gorgeous really nicely pigmented
shades a way to work in a nice fun color
on your eyes without worrying about it
making you look kind of sickly or
whatever because it's just not that pink
so I've got all these shades swatch here
this is a burn
so don't pay attention to that but
here's that kind of shiny shade and you
can see they're all just really pretty
they work really well together for a
blush I love my hot mama from the balm I
kind of classify this as a rose gold
type color and this can work as a shadow
as well you can see there it's got that
nice shimmer nice amount of peach pink
and then definitely some golden shimmer
I'm wearing that today and I don't even
feel the need to wear a highlight with
this it's a nice kind of two-in-one
product because it is so glowy I still
had a couple more eye shadows to tell
you about infallible shadow and amber
rush oMG if you're just wanting one just
one great rose gold shadow this is
awesome as a swatch of it this is super
metallic so just really has a nice
reflective quality when you put it on
the lids I like packing it on my lid
with a flat brush and then you can do
like a one shadow look with this by just
blending it and in a more diffused way
with a fluffy brush up into the crease
and you can just get a really nice kind
of warm look on the eyes I love these
infallible shadows and this one in amber
rush is definitely one of my must-haves
from from the selection I've come up but
also got a couple cream shadow sticks
that I love one I think I mentioned in
my recent best in beauty video but it's
the Milani shadow eyes
champagne toasts and you know I think of
it as a champagne shade but I've started
to realize just how much of sort of a
rose gold quality it actually has it's
very subtle you know it's not too brassy
but I think that's just beautiful it
makes a great base for all kinds of
different colors not just things in the
rose gold family and another one I've
loved for a long time is the malli ever
color shadow stick in bronze and this
really is you know true true rose gold
you look at it there see how much it has
more of a peach vibe to it where I think
the Milani shadow eyes goes more to the
pink end but you can see how much they
just catch the light and plus these two
are super long wearing so you can wear
them alone and not have to worry about
staying power but they're great you know
as sort of a layering option with other
shadows just a couple lip ideas as well
the NYX round lipsticks come in tons of
different shades and they've got a
couple that are great with this rose
gold themed one is Indian pink that's
the lip color I'm wearing right now
aside from the gloss which I'll get to
in a second but there's Indian pink and
it's really peachy you know you see
we're seeing like the whole range of
these rose golden type shades but I'm
here a very opaque swatch of that it has
some gold in it but a lot of peach a lot
of pink and I think it's beautiful and
put alongside the blushes and the
shadows we've been talking about another
nice one is called Seto berry metallic
and it has a little less of that peachy
pink tone it's more more of a neutral I
would say so I love both of those shades
I just want to give them both a mention
also what I'm wearing on top of the
Indian pink lipstick is this elf Pelt
Perfector this is sold as something that
you can just like dab right in the
center your lower lip and give your look
a little more shine I think it's a
beautiful it's one of those really
reflective type colors but it definitely
makes me think rose gold when I put it
on so there it is right there
super shine which with so many different
lip products you might wear another
great gloss is from Milani it
um one of these crystal glasses I love
these they smell so good they remind me
of the scent of like a little bit of
like you know the mac lipglass mac
lipstick sort of smell and this one is
in summer babes a really shiny one you
can see it has a very like sort of wet
look shine whereas the elf was really
shimmery and this one is just a lot more
glossy beautiful texture to this
lipgloss I mean I like it all around but
this shade definitely speaks to the rose
gold theme we've got going on nail
polish shadow I had been wearing this
one recently this is the covergirl
outlast stay brilliant in perfect pin
this one I don't feel like is you know
the rose gold that looks a little bit
coppery it's definitely a little cooler
and a little more neutral but I think
it's a really pretty shade the kind of
thing that I have and what I think rose
gold or I think I want to go that
direction this is what I use I have it
on my toes right now I think it's a
beautiful shade I like the way these go
on I think I've got pretty good you know
longevity too in terms of not chipping
too quickly and stuff like that so I
hope you enjoyed my picks for this color
