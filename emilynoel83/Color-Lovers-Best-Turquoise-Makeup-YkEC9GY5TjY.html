another video in my color lovers series
I started this a couple weeks ago and my
first video was on course so I had all
kinds of like favorite coral products
from lipsticks to blush to nail polish
and different things and this week I
thought it would do turquoise I had a
lot of great color requests and this was
one that I felt prepared to do right now
so if there is a certain color you want
me to focus on for future videos
definitely request the color rose gold
was another really good one that I'm
thinking about doing soon I had a lot of
good requests for that but with
turquoise obviously I'm not gonna have
quite as many things to talk about
because I don't know about you but I
don't wear a lot of turquoise lipstick
and blush so this is gonna be some I
products nail products and a couple of
accessories that I'd recommend also as
with any shade it seems like there's
sort of a spectrum you know of different
hues of certain colors for example with
turquoise I know I always think about my
sister and her she has a great like
genuine turquoise like cuff bracelet and
it's got a big block of turquoise in it
and it actually looks about the color of
my nails which my nails I thought it was
being like a mint green I didn't do
these especially for this video or
anything but turquoise that she has is
very close to this color but then you'll
see other jewelry and different things
that are more of a blueish deeper
turquoise so there's definitely a range
some of these things you might see is a
little more like teal or whatever but
I'm trying to keep it just all pretty
colors and things that I really really
like by the way if you were wondering
about this nail color this is the Julie
G nail polish in shark's Cove so it's
like a mint green with a little bit of
shimmer I think it's a really pretty
colors turquoise products go a really
really great thing and I love this whole
line of shadow sticks
it's from Milania it's called shadow
eyes and these are SuperDuper long
wearing cream shadow jumbo sticks
so for example I feel like the staying
power on these is just as good as like
the Maybelline Color tattoos I mean you
can put them on and they will set and
not smudge at all so you have some time
to kind of blend it in with your finger
or whatever or a brush but once it sets
it's there for good and I love that it's
in a stick form because it makes it very
easy to you know get under the eye and
not need a separate applicator or brush
or something like that so the turquoise
ish color that I think is really pretty
is called aquatic style see the sort of
metallic finish that it has and I have
this actually as a base on under my
eyeshadow it'll pump up any eyeshadow
you put on top of it but even if you
just want to wear this alone it's
totally doable so really great quality
and there's some other nice colors in
that line another way that I like to
incorporate turquoise into my eye looks
is just doing it with like a pop of some
brighter lower liner I've done a couple
looks I think maybe on Instagram where I
showed how I did that and maybe a
tutorial will be coming soon on that as
well but a really great liner my
favorite liner to do that kind of a look
with is this NYX slide-on liner and the
shade is called asier and this is just a
gorgeous blue I know Urban Decay has a
you know a similar liner like this but
this is the most affordable option that
I have and it's just great it's very
vivid like you can see here it's almost
like the exact same color as the other
ones on easily and it really really
lasts so it's gonna set you're not gonna
be able to smudge it away and so today
like I did more of a blue look on top
but like I said a lot of times I like
taking that liner that turquoise liner
down underneath and I saw so many girls
that I'm ATS doing that very thing with
some liner on there and so it looked
really pretty as far as eyeshadows go
this is my kind of go-to eyeshadow
palette that incorporates turquoise and
it's the blue had me at hello palette
from wet and wild and here you've got
really one you know blatant Lake kind of
turquoise teal color but then you've got
a bunch of other shades that work really
well alongside it
and what I also love is that you can
layer like you can put down a lighter
shape first and then do this over the
top and get you know a lighter sort of
look on that you can blend in some of
the deeper blues or black and really
give it a rich kind of sultry look so I
just love this palette I love all my
color icon palettes I feel like I am
like reef alling in love with them I
reach for one almost every time I do my
makeup these days it seems like but on
this one just really you know it has
that great accent color here and then a
lot of other great quality shades to mix
in and there's just a few of those
shades swatch there so you can see them
but the really bold takes very little
effort to blend them in so that's a
great also I have to mention this one
and I know um you may not run into this
in your local drugstore but I know it's
available at drugstore comm and I've had
this one for kind of a long time and
it's really really gorgeous
it's the L'Oreal hip duo and it's in
showy and it's got a great turquoise
color here and a beautiful like a matte
cobalt blue it's so pretty it's kind of
like the similar finish of the wet and
wild turquoise that I showed you only
there's a little more blue in it the wet
and wild one has almost a like a golden
shimmer in there there you can see you
know a little more blueish this one
comes off almost a little more green
because of the gold shimmer and a great
matte blue if you run across this I
don't know if you'll see this at Big
Lots or if you really you know just want
to get this you can get it on drugstore
calm but very nice quality I'm wearing
actually both of these shades what I did
was I put this one all over the lid I
used a little bit of the matte blue in
the crease and then I also blended some
of the matte blue just down below and
that's you know depending on just
whatever you have or have access to you
can get that same kind of look with this
palette as well so just a couple options
there now if you're looking for
something that maybe gives you the
option of having like a turquoise teal
color but you also have a lot of other
shadows to choose from as well that I
recently reviewed on my blog so there's
lots more details there is the Sigma
Resort palette this is loaded with great
products here a lot of eyeshadows you
got a blush liquid highlight
double-ended liner that does give you a
really nice creamy turquoise color well
the next one had a little bit of sparkle
to it this one's more of just intense
kind of creamy color but it's not as
long wearing so that was something I
pointed out in my blog post but perhaps
the strongest most pigmented color in
this whole palette and that's why I
wanted to mention this is this turquoise
shade here it's called new very strong
kind of greenish blue turquoise teal
color really nice is a packaging it
would appear to have a little bit of
shimmer but it comes off more matte I
feel like when I use it and when I
swatch it I did notice when I vlogged
about this some people saying you know
how does this palette compared to the
Too Faced summer eye I have the Too
Faced summer eye that was put out last
year I think it's very similar to the
repackaged one that's out now and I
would say if you're wanting more like
pinks and browns and things like that go
for the Too Faced summer on a turquoise
shade I think it's called mermaid in the
summer I palette I didn't think was the
greatest I mean it's pretty but it's not
bold like this one is so if you're
running like a really rich shade and
some other good ones to play with this
might be what you want go for a great
nail polish and I wore this a lot I
remember last summer on my toes and it's
the wet and wild fast dry nail polish
and the shade is teal or no teal got a
little bit of like a golden metallic
finish that'll come off on it it's kind
of hard to show here in the packaging
but you can see it a little bit it
doesn't have like glitter in it but it
definitely does have a little bit of
metallic look to it looks so cute on the
toes especially but you could of course
wear it on your fingers as well and then
a couple of my favorite accessories of
like my whole jewelry collection
happened to be in this turquoise teal
look this necklace that I have here I
think this came from JCPenney and I've
had it for years so I'm not sure how
easy it is to have to you know find
something like that and a lot of the
things I have I feel like I've had for a
long time but I really do like this
necklace so I wanted to wear it but
earrings
I love these and I believe I got these
from Claire's and they have the look of
like I said you know that authentic kind
of light-colored turquoise that almost
reminds you of mint green and then I
love these studs these are a little more
blinging but these came from DICE a
those came from Claire's pretty sure
those are from Claire's and these are
from New York and company and these are
really pretty very bluish turquoise
looking studs and they're just so
sparkly and pretty loose of what to pair
with turquoise I think turquoise and
coral looks great I love wearing it with
pink as well just look at you know the
bright colors you have in your
collection and play around especially
with the bright colors like turquoise
though treat your makeup practically as
another accessory that's kind of the way
I feel about my eyes today that's why I
went kind of softer on the lip and
elsewhere on the face because you know
this kind of a shade on your eyes really
does show so you know I treat that like
an accessory and maybe don't go with a
totally teal shirt but pop it you know
in another way with a bracelet or a
necklace or something like that
so thank you so much for watching I'm so
glad you're enjoying this series and
don't forget to let me know what color
you want to see next
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
