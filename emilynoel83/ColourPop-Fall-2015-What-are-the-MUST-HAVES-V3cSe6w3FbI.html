total like post lost memory card hive
right now I lost my memory card I spent
like an hour searching for it retracing
my steps looking all over I find it in a
freaking drawer and I'm now going to be
keeping my memory card in something like
a zillion times its actual size so this
way I really won't lose it not in use
but the things I want to talk about in
this video are from colour-pop they not
too long ago put out there fall kind of
90s inspired collection which is a bunch
of new super shock shadows lippie stix
lip pencils and then most recently they
have released a couple of new box sets
one of the super shock shadows and one
of lippie stix so i've got all this new
stuff and i was talking about this on
snapchat recently how you know brands
can kind of flood you with new products
and it's easy to try them all and be
like wow this is great stuff everybody
needs it but when you're really looking
at this from the perspective of the
buyer it's like okay it's all of this
necessary or when you really take a good
hard critical look at it you know what
is really the stuff worth having what's
the special stuff and for me there's a
relatively small amount of what I'm
going to talk about today that I think
is like the special stuff that knowing
what I know now I would want to go out
and buy this stuff so like I said
there's this 90s inspired Fall
collection all of these things are sold
individually there are a couple of super
shock cheek colors they're both matte
one is called cruel intentions and one
is called never been kissed so gotta
love those old movies but one is more
Corley never been kissed it's like a
really nice pinky coral and then Cruel
Intentions is a nice berry shade as I
said matte no glow happening from either
of these but really nice saturated
colors let's see I'm wearing Cruel
Intentions right now very softly on my
cheeks but as I started using these they
really reminded me of the two blushes
that come in the in bloom collection
which I believe that came out in the
spring was it was Jamie Greenberg set
and the three lippie stix the two
blushes in the highlight and I mean I
feel like these are so close to those
blush shades when you're watching them
all out
side by side these two might be just a
hair deeper than those other ones but
it's such a close call
like I wouldn't say I need them all
they're pretty don't get me wrong but
they're so close to that set so if
you've already got that set i wouldn't
say these are must-haves put out 10
super shock shadows as well i just want
to start off and tell you the 2 out of
the 10 that i think are my absolute
favorite and why one of them is I
believe the lightest one available and
it's called super model and I think this
is just I mean it's the kind of shade
you'll glance at and be like don't I
have things like that or don't I already
have something from colour-pop like that
and I feel like I've got quite a few of
their little foursome collections and
other sets but looking through what I
have I actually don't have anything just
like this this is the perfect champagne
color and there is no glitter in it so
it's glowy without being glittery
there's just the right amount of gold in
this for me it looks honestly so pretty
worn alone just dab your finger into it
for the quickest look ever dab it on top
of your lids apply mascara and be done
with it and it's so pretty it looks so
fresh so light today I've got it under
my brows around the inner corner and
actually as my highlight on my cheeks so
this is a total multitasker type shape
as I was saying the fact that it's not
glittery really makes it something that
I want to use all over so I love super
model and I really love this shade and
the other shade that I'm gonna mention
in conjunction with some of the colors
in the box set the other color that I
think is totally worth having out of
these 10 is the one called Central Perk
and as I glanced at this I thought oh
okay it's brown it's a nice dark brown
heck no it's not dark brown it's like a
freaking um deep bloody rippa type shade
not bloody I don't know what am I saying
here it's a really pretty dark berry
burgundy shade is what you're getting I
don't know why I have ways to watch that
on top of the gold but they are gorgeous
together that was one point I wanted to
make these two are awesome if you want
to kind of put one on top of your lid
start overlapping with Central Perk it's
so pretty it's matte i like applying on
some of these deeper matte color pop
shades either with my son
a small shadow brush or a sponge tip
applicator they really dab on nicely
with something like this and then you
can use a separate brush to blend it out
more but sometimes you'll find like this
is enough so today I've got Central Perk
in the outer corner blended up into the
crease just a bit I find it surprisingly
easy to work with and I just think these
two supermodels Central Perk are the
absolute best out of these ten new
ninety shades there is another shade in
the bunch that I think is beautiful I
think it's swatches like hey look at me
I'm outstanding like look how beautiful
I am and it's called stereo and you can
see you can see why I like this you know
it's kind of purpley at a glance in the
product it looks almost like a rusty
kind of shade but then it catches the
light and you get those kind of pinky
purple glimmers out of it again it's the
kind of shade that's gonna look
completely fabulous in a swatch but when
you get into shades that are that dark
like on the eyes
they don't always translate quite as
well and that's not because it's not
pigmented but it's just because it's
dark once you start working with the
various contours of your eye area things
don't always turn out to look the way
they do in your swatch this shade does
look pretty kind of halfway layering
that light supermodel color I was
talking about it's a great color I just
it's kind a little on the verge with
this one I don't know that it's total
must-have territory but it is really
pretty just walk you through briefly
some of the shades that I tried I liked
them well enough but I don't love them
one of them is called I Spy this is a
matte this is one that I would tend to
wear as like a transition color or kind
of blend it just up above my crease and
it looks very very yellowy I think for
me I want something that's maybe even a
little more toward orange or a little
more brownish in that area and it's a
nice shade for what it is but I just
don't think it's something I'm gonna use
a lot another color that they have and
this says super shock pressed pigment
and this is in the shade girl power so
it's a really crazy bold orange shade
it's more like an orange II shade that I
would really associate with summertime I
don't want to be that person who's like
you can only wear certain shades in
certain seasons but there is a color
one of the sets that is like pumpkin
spice and eyeshadow and I just kind of
like that a little bit better this time
of year this is very very bold it might
be that exact shade that someone out
there is looking for but for me I'm just
not seeing that as essential there are a
few kind of mid-tone shades in this
range where I think they're pretty
colors but their shades I feel like I've
got over and over again within my powder
eyeshadow collection you know and when I
talk about powder shadows along with
color pop you can really mix them in
completely you know you don't need to
feel like oh if I'm using colourpop's
shadows that's the only thing I can
create my look with I think they are
great mixed in with like any other
eyeshadows you own the color pop shade
might be a pop on the lid it might be
one of these matte colors that could
almost double as a smoky liner I think
once you settle on the application
method that works best for your color
pop shadows you're gonna find that it
mixes right in with the other things
that you own but that being said if I've
already got a lot of a certain kind of
shadow I'm not gonna feel like oh I need
to buy that now in color pop form you
know so one that's like that is the
shade called boy band it's kind of a
rusty bronze II kind of like an old
penny type shade it's really beautiful
it has a really nice glow to it I've
worn this on the eyes before I like the
look but it's something I feel like I've
got dozens of times over in my
collection another shade that's that
kind of deal for me is the one called
mixtape this is a super shock shadow in
the pearlized finish and again pretty
it's a very cool gray color has the
slightest bit of Sheen it's gonna be
pretty if you like those cool tone looks
but it's just not one of those super
unique colors you've also got this shake
called party time which is a matte like
a very deep dusty plum not a crazy
exciting shade I don't see quite enough
plum coming out of this on my eyes to
make it really really special to me but
it is you know part of this collection
and then you've got the several really
deep and dark shades in this collection
Central Perk as I mentioned the must
haves but then you've got a color called
plaid and I thought oh I might love this
it's a really really dark green
them is I think it's too dark to get
credit for being green you know what I
mean especially when you put it on your
eyes it's like I just can't get enough
green popping out of this shade there's
also a shade called straight trippin and
this is what I would classify as like a
black plum it's matte it when you swatch
it out you can kind of see a trace of
purple in this shade but again on the
eyes it's so so dark it may as well just
be a soft black because I can't get
enough plum out of it so just the heads
up on those single shadows and what I'm
thinking of them again I think Central
Perk is amazing especially if you love
Burgundy's and super model just for an
all purpose like it's a great eye
highlighting shade it's also a great
highlight elsewhere on the face now
still in the 90s collection here they
put out six new lippie stix
and also six coordinating lip pencils
what I want to say first is that I think
if you're going for the lippie stix
first and foremost and you're thinking
if I get these do I need to go ahead and
get the coordinating lip liners in my
opinion I don't think the lip liners are
super essential if that's the way you're
looking at it because I think the Libby
sticks themselves are a fairly precise
format for a lip product I think it's
really easy to get a precise edge and
even if you find like with where maybe
the shape of your lipstick is wearing
down somewhat and it's harder to get a
precise edge with you can take a lip
brush pick up some of that product and
still get a really defined edge so
unless you're just strictly looking for
lip pencils in certain shades or maybe
you're thinking you're gonna mix and
match like a different color to a
certain lippie stix you know it's up to
you but I'm just saying if you know
you're going for these and your one
thought is do I need more precision do I
need to get a lip pencil for that I
don't think you really must but all of
these new lippie stix are in a matte
finish they wear a really long time I
don't think they're hard to put on like
they don't really skip across my lips
but they also at the same time don't
have the same glide as like the cream
formula or they're hyper glossy formula
but I
never feel like these are drying my lips
out you're gonna find like if you
compare the net lippie stix to their
ultra matte liquid lipsticks those go
down to a very much transfer-resistant
finish on the lips they're gonna feel
pretty dry let's face it these give you
the matte finish without feeling as dry
granted they can transfer off onto a
coffee cup you're still gonna have a lot
of color remaining on your lips so
you've got oh snap it's kind of a cool
light pinky beige and definitely the
most nude I guess of this collection I
can see some people really liking this
shape for a natural look I like it I
just don't find it to be very unique
contempo is one that i think is
absolutely beautiful it's as soft berry
it's one of those things where I really
like it for what it is you know from
colour-pop but if I really glance over
my collection I've got a lot of this
kind of color so again I don't think for
me that's really a total must now if
you're getting into the brown lip color
trend you might be interested in grunge
kind of a deep brown it's got a hint of
brick-red going on in there but overall
it's pretty darn Brown and as this color
starts to fade from you know the fresh
application on your lips you're gonna
see more and more just straight-up Brown
coming out of that color so if you like
Brown that's for you now getting into
the two shades that are my must-haves
here the two colors from any new lip
color even including the set that I'm
going to talk about and these are the
two lippie stix that I think are the
most beautiful what is dazed and that's
the shade I'm wearing today think of
this as a very red I think it's a
gorgeous full red you know it's not
purpley berry which I do like my fair
share of those kinds of colors as well
but it's very close to traditional red
just with a little more pink tossed into
it so I love that and then I also love
poison with this we're talking a little
bit deeper more of a brick read there's
a little more warmth to this shade I
think it's also just absolutely
beautiful I love them both they're the
kind of shades that I picture okay I'm
gonna wear a chunky sweater I'm gonna do
just a little maybe winged liner and
mask
I'm gonna toss my hair up into a bun and
these are the kinds of colors I'm gonna
want on my lips matte finishes are
really I think the best way to wear your
Reds because you're not gonna have to be
so worried about touching them up all
the time or you know is that really
glossy red getting all over my teeth
then outside my lip line these we're a
really long time and I find them to be
pretty comfortable as well for a matte
now if you really want to go there with
the darkness then you're gonna want to
look into the shade called never mind I
kinda dig this shade on my lips it's a
very deep gray pea purple color I like
it how often will I pull out this kind
of shade to wear I'm not sure so it
doesn't quite get into the category of
those Reds that I mentioned where I
think I'm gonna wear those shades over
and over and over but you know you know
if never mind is the kind of shade for
you so I just wanted to show that to you
on my lips and give you a sense of for
how that comes off so again never trying
to make your decisions for you I'm just
trying to give you the information but
in my opinion to me the four things out
of the 90s collection that are absolute
must-haves it would be the supermodel
shade the one called Central Perk and
then the poison and dazed Libby Stix now
I was kind of evaluating that whole
collection taking into consideration
these two new sets as well one is called
forever freshman and this is going to be
your set of the six different shadows
and then your set of six lippie stix in
the back to cool kit when I first blan
stat both of these kits I thought I'm
sure I'm gonna love the lippie stix set
and this kit I'm not so sure it's really
catching my eye that much but actually
it ended up being the complete reverse
this is the one that I think is really
really great to have and the lippie stix
while I'm a huge lippie stix fan and
these are pretty shades
there was nothing in this kit that I
loved as well as those two Reds so I'm
gonna go a little bit more in-depth for
you here I can't really remember how the
colors were initially put in here
they're all individuals they just pop
out like that but I kind of realigned
them in a way that makes sense to me for
if you were going to do a cool look or a
warm look for example for a cool look
you've got this topi shade a cool deep
brown
deep navy and then for a warmer look
you've got this golden e color shade
that I feel like is pumpkin spice in an
eyeshadow and then a shimmery olive then
I love those two favorites that I pulled
out of the 90s collection this makes a
great highlight because this lightest
shade in here this gold does have a
decent amount of sparkle not saying I
don't like that because I do think it's
a fun accent on the lid I've gotten on
my lid right now but this is the most
like I think classic highlight friendly
shade to me so I love popping this in
with the set with any combination of
shadows and then I love Central Perk in
here as well because I love having that
burgundy
you know plummy deep berry color to mix
in with everything that's happening this
shade looks great if you start pairing
it with the cooler tones like alongside
this taupey color it also probably my
favorite way to wear it is pulled in
with the warmer set that I've put over
here so the gold my pumpkin spice color
that's how I'm wearing it today I have
this shade this is called crimper I've
got that all over the lid
I've got pumpkin spice which is actually
called Melrose I've nicknamed my shadows
faux because I've got that kind of up
into the crease and then I pulled in
Central Perk to give me that kind of
plumbing us in the outer corner and also
smudge down below but just a closer look
one by one crimper like I said that's a
super shock shadow metallic finish so
it's very golden E but it also has some
sparkle this is a kind of shade like
applied on the lid I like to Pat that on
with my finger I feel like that's the
maximum impact and it just looks really
pretty that way and you can really
control it I don't feel like I see any
fallout coming off of these because the
consistency of these color pop shadows I
know I've talked about it in past videos
they're almost a little bit mousse like
a little bit like a cream powder hybrid
they're very interesting they're the
kind of thing where your finger would
squish down into them a little bit but
not goopy and creamy like maybe other
cream shadows our next one Melrose this
is the pumpkin spice color it sheers out
so beautifully I absolutely think this
is an essential fall shade like I said
in
90's collection you've got a real vivid
orange and then you've got this shade
which is much more like I said pumpkin
spice I love that for in the crease I
use my Sigma e25 with that and I have no
issues blending it out you know just
into the crease and up above works
really great and then nine oh two one oh
is kind of this dark khaki green type
color that they've really jazzed up with
a shimmer that goes a little bit Orange
II a little bit golden II it's a really
pretty interesting shade it doesn't show
up incredibly green on my eyes there
really is a lot of brown in this shade
but I do think the sparkle gives it a
lot of brilliance now if you look at
these six in a lineup of swatches this
is the one that absolutely screams too
low at you and this is the one called
cush or Koosh i always call them cush
balsam but maybe some people call them
Koosh balls
this is the ultra metallic finish so it
is really super shiny but there is no
sparkle in it and it just oh it's like
the shiniest taupe ever they give you a
really classic cool Brown called as if
so I would say you've got these two
matte kind of counterparts they're
really warm reddish pumpkiny shade
called Melrose and then you've got as if
so it's really nice to be able to have
that option of taking your look I think
in two different directions for the
crease and then you've got baby tea and
this is a matte super shock shadow and I
do think there's like a hint of Sheen to
this I might call this more of a satiny
finish just for the way it performs on
the eyes the way you see it in the
swatch but it's a really pretty deep
blue if I were making this grouping of
shadows myself I might have replaced
that shade with Central Perk that's more
of my initial reaction but I have to
admit as I was playing with this shade
the other day it really pulled me in it
real bent and I'm like okay I can really
enjoy that blue I just think this is a
great kit for fall it's a really nice
lineup and I think throwing in these two
other shades again a more versatile
highlight and that plummy burgundy that
really makes a great selection of shades
for me and if you've never tried color
pop you know it's something to
experiment with
it's gonna be a different format of
shadow than most anything else you have
they're one of the few kinds of shadows
that I can wear without any kind of
primer underneath and my look will be
completely maintained all day long can
grab over them and they really hang in
there if you're wearing one that's
really glittery and you start doing that
you will notice the glitter kind of
lifts away but as far as straight up
colors they really do last I had a super
long time on me the other kit that's
available it's a back to cool lippie
stix set not a bad set like really
pretty colors they give you three that
are kind of really neutral I think
they're beautiful and then three shades
that are really rather bright and they
don't necessarily strike me as super
fall-like shades I don't know what they
remind me of you know I guess just
random bright colors and like I said
after trying all those on well I think
there are some pretty shades there's
nothing in there that I liked as much as
Dazed &amp;amp; poison which were available
individually but let's take you through
all of them and let you see there are
some different finishes within this kit
as well for example choker the lightest
shade that is a cream formula the creams
are my favorite I think formula that
they put out in the lippie stix they
actually I think smell the best they
remind me of like a shortbread cookie
just really sweet really yummy this is a
pretty nude it comes across with just a
hint of shine it's a like just not a
love for me moshpit super pretty the
definition I think of like dusty rose
but with some added warmth to it it's a
pretty shade it's probably one of my
favorites out of this kit I also really
like Baywatch which is BAE Watch don't
tell Tyler he hates the use of the word
baby did I say this was matte because it
is matte it's a pretty berry it's a
little bit deeper more rich compared to
contempo which I mentioned is the
individual color that was available from
the 90s collection then you've got out
of sync and this is a matte color and
it's just an extremely bright pink you
know it doesn't really strike me as a
fall pink it makes me think of more like
a bright summery shade it is gorgeous I
got to admit it's a bright berry to sexy
is a satin finish and this is kind of
taking me back to radiant orchid when
radiant orchid was the color of the year
because you can really see an
interesting little Sheen out of this
shade much more purpley compared to
out-of-sync a little bit deeper as well
and then you've got TGIF which is one of
those nice brick red type shades it's
not quite as deep as poison and that was
kind of why I like poison so much was
because it was that brick red but dark
so what could I say it's a pretty set of
colors yes I like them four out of the
six are match you may be like yes I want
each and every one of those shades
that's for me but just you know me
looking at this and taking into
consideration other collections I have
think on the whole I really liked the
variety in the I think it was called the
Sundays in Silver Lake set of lippie
stix that came out earlier I really felt
strongly about that I've got a blog post
showing all of those thank you guys so
much for watching this video I hope it
was useful again all this stuff was sent
to me by pillar pub I feel so grateful
to have had the opportunity to try
everything out but knowing what I know
now if I could do my own haul I would
get the forever freshman kit those two
super shock shadows and the two lippie
stix that would be my whole but thanks
again guys and I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
