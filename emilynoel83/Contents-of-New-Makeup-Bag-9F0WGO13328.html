to be a video of the contents of my new
makeup bag I mentioned it in my
Christmas and birthday haul video it's
this one that my sister got me and it
came she got it from Urban Outfitters
and it had this print on it that it's
kind of like paper dolls
and if you can get a look at the overall
shape and size that's all these nice two
old handles here nice all covered in
plastic that you can easily wipe off a
little front pocket here fold open so
when you fold it open it'll just you
know lay flat like this on your table or
counter and my situation with makeup I
need to kind of I guess explain with my
work what I'm anchoring I usually do my
makeup first at home but I will take
certain products that I might use to
touch up with before or during the
newscast
I'll take those with me and it sometimes
changes what you two aren't showing you
in here today is the stuff I took today
some of those items stay the same quite
often but other items mainly the either
the blush the eyeshadow and the lip
stuff can vary just depending on the day
and what I use differently that day so I
always you know I'm kind of changing it
around and keeping it different so
anyway what you've got here it unfolds
and here's a big pocket here and this is
a really really gonna be kind of hard
for me to show you this actually it's a
really big pocket you can actually fit a
lot of things in here I really don't
have it packed as full as one could pack
it but the things I have in here like I
said I'm not bringing this so I can do a
full face with makeup I'm bringing what
I need to touch up with so in this pouch
up kind of kept some general faith
powders that aren't blushes or bronzers
or anything like that I've got my
mineral power finishing
which is just nice - I kind of run that
underneath my eyes if I want to refresh
my eyeliner something I read a little
bit more of that because it's very
lightweight and it keeps the oils in
that liner from running I also have my
L'Oreal True Match powder in Sun beige
which is just kind of a nice all-over
touch-up powder as far as you know where
do you think Sean and things like that
and then I've got my wet n Wild mega
glow kind of bronzer all over face
powder and starlight bronze I also
talked a concealer in there my Mable a
mineral power concealer which I
generally don't need to touch up my
concealer but I just have it there in
case of emergency and of course my ELF
eyelash curler so that does it for that
big pouch but like I said that could
hold that held so much more for me when
I took it home and you know was actually
traveling with it and had a lot more
things that I needed to put in it next
I'm going to tell you about this middle
pouch here it pulled either way one side
is going to show you a little mini pouch
and you can see through to the center
zippered part there's a zipper that runs
all the way across there and you can
keep some things there so I'm going to
talk about that first and then my
brushes set on the other side there's
Tyler I think you can probably see it in
the back but anyway this little zippered
pouch here is just to make sure nobody
was falling out it's kind of small so I
just keep a few things in there I've got
my cold dip it's very I have a cold
right now
some eyelash glue hairpins q-tips and
things like that and then you unzip this
part and I've got all these things in
here that are para like my tall skinny
items like my mascara I got a couple
different mascaras my Max Factor 2000
calorie sometimes they'll top that off
if I'm refreshing my mascara a little
bit with the devil extend because it's
so lengthening it really builds on top
of anything that's volume
and I take my Revlon Colorstay liquid
liner just in case of emergency in case
you know it was pouring down right in
between here and work and I had to get
outside it in or something and then this
liner in black brown which I made with
fresh my lower liner with a little bit
I've got my clear brow gel because I use
almost always go over my eyebrows again
and today I did a pretty neutral look on
the lips so I've got a lighter lipstick
this what happens to be NYC and caramel
and I've got kind of a light loss that
I've put in the middle center of my lips
buff diamond from I think this came from
Sally Beauty Supply and comics so that
stuff gets very very nicely in that
center pouch and you just zip it up and
you're good and now as for the back here
this is a little strap section there
where you can see where my brushes are
sitting and it holds them in there
nicely and they don't get roughed up and
just being in the midst of all the rest
of the makeup so what I take with me to
work as far as brushes I do take a
concealer brush that I reserved for dry
products this is what I would use with
that enabling mineral power finishing
veil if I wanted to just lighten up the
area around my eye even writing or close
to my nose great last minute you know I
brighten her there I take this powder
brush which is from Walmart
it just says powder brush on it it was
very cheap and it's just served me well
it's kind of like sort of a unique shape
I guess I believed something similar to
that still exists at Walmart I couldn't
tell you what little brand name they
stuck on it that's from Revlon just a
nice blush brush and then as for my eye
brushes I always take my little brow
groomer thing and then I take two sizes
of contour brushes and I mary kay one
that it's a little bit bigger and my
smaller one essence of beauty from CVS
makes fine crease brush
and then I've taken liner brush this
one's from Mary Kay an eyeshadow brush
this one is also from Mary Kay you can
do your highlighter with so pretty much
all the brushes one would mean I take my
take those with me and then this other
side you've got to you've got two little
zippered pouches here they're both
separate and they both actually come out
so they're velcroed in there but I just
leave them and unzip them and I've got
in one side I've got my blushes and
bronzers so bronzer I take with me is my
Milani sunset duos in Sunset Beach just
a nice matte bronzer to go over your
face with if I feel like I want a little
more shimmer my wedding well bloggers
intuition tin and again these are
subject to change this is where I will
kind of switch it up today I've got my
Milani mineral powder wash in my tie
I've got my contouring blush that I use
it's covergirl cheekers in golden pink
so a peachy shade and kind of a deeper
peach and then I got my new dual op
blush booster and apple in there kind of
an illuminating wash shade so I like to
give myself options but not take too
much that's sort of my motto put my work
makeup and then as far as eyeshadows
where I happen to take today of course
my covergirl trio with that center shade
golden golden sunrise that I use quite
often and also my Jain duo here that I
use that lighter shade and dude for a
highlight or whatever and then I've got
my hip concentrated shadow duo and I
used that darker shade quite a bit very
look very similar to the one I have on
today using these same colors you can
check out my blog its beauty broadcast
blog spot.com and i did like a face of
the day not too long ago using those
showing you in writing I guess how I use
those differ
shadows and then one I tend to always
keep with me is my Smashbox smokey eyes
trio with a plum a brown and a golden II
shade just just in case I guess they
don't that's always kind of that product
that you know something doesn't look
quite right that one kind of seems to do
the trick when I finish you know finish
off the look so anyway once they zip
these up I mean that pretty much sums up
I'm keeping an eye on my time here that
sums up my new makeup bag and kind of
how I've got it organized I'll give you
a look at it one more time so you can
see you got this side with these two
removable pouches and then the brushes
that flips down and you've got a place
for maybe some of your taller or tube
type things like mascaras and lipgloss
and a little a little pouch there for
small thing and then this could hold
just absolutely anything else that you
might wanna take so a really really cute
little bag and I'm really enjoying it so
far so hope you guys enjoyed this video
maybe got a little more insight into how
my makeup goes when I go to work and
thanks for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
