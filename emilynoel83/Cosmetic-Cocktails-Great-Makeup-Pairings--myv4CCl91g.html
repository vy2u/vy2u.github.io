quick video on some great beauty product
combinations aka makeup cocktails
products that I think work really well
when you combine them you can get all
sorts of different effects with face
makeup eye makeup lip products just by
doing different combinations or layering
them so I wanted to just share some of
the ways that I like to do this there
are some products that I've been doing
this with for a long time other things
that are a little bit new to me as I've
been thinking about this concept the
first thing I want to mention is mixing
a facial oil with a more full coverage
or matte foundation this is a great way
to get I think an even more natural look
out of those full coverage foundations
without completely diluting them just a
couple drops of a facial oil like I have
the one from sure Lake here also the
josie maran argan oil what else there's
the tarte maracuja oil just a couple of
drops mixed in with for example the
Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
coverage this is the fullest coverage
foundation I own but I find that it
blends in really easily and just thins
out looks even more natural on the skin
when I add just a little bit of a facial
oil to it this can also be a great trick
if you've got dry skin and going into
the winter months you feel like
foundations that did work for you in the
summer are just a little too cakey now
this really is a great way to take away
the cakey appearance another drugstore
foundation that comes to mind that works
well with this method is the Rimmel stay
matte and really a product that brought
the whole idea of this video to life is
this it cosmetics CC plus bronzer this
is really great mixed in with any
foundation that you want to kind of just
bronze up a little bit more deepen up
maybe a foundation has become a little
bit light for you now that you've gotten
some Sun or doing some self-tanning so
this is a great product it comes in just
the one shade and I do have a lot more
info on this in the video I did where I
talked about different CC and BB
bronzers this one's very different from
other things that I've tried because it
actually continues to have some coverage
so if you do go mixing this in with
other foundations you won't really water
them down you want dilute the coverage
you'll add some bronze but you'll I
think continue to have coverage that you
really enjoy a blush cocktail that I
think is absolutely gorgeous and it
actually leaves such a pretty kind of
glowy look to the cheeks but I swear
there is
no real sparkle when you get up close to
your cheeks you can't like see particles
of shimmer and actually I think makes
the skin look even more flawless and
airbrushed just by using this blush
combo so the first part of it is a cream
blush and it is the peach satin shade of
the Maybelline Dream bouncy blush it's a
really gorgeous color beautiful coral
shade for this time of year but I really
love it and I find I get really great
staying power out of it as well when I
pop a blush on top of it so this elf
studio blush and candid coral sometimes
on its own I feel like this particular
blush is a little lacking I don't know
like I feel like I could use a little
more color out of it sometimes maybe
it's just depending on how deep my skin
tone might be at the time I'm using it
but paired with this it's so beautiful
just love the way they combined they
leave the most beautiful finish on the
cheeks so if you're getting in kind of a
blush wreck or getting kind of bored
with the products you have just consider
combining different cream and powder
blushes and you may discover some looks
that you really like particularly if
your powder blush is a little bit on the
sheer side some of those kinds of blood
whose might really surprise you when
used in this method now this is one of
those tricks I feel like I've been doing
for a long time and it's pairing a like
a pink cream shadow with your various
pink and mauve rosy tone palettes and
powder shadows I know this seems like a
pretty logical thing to do but I just
wanted to throw it out there because it
totally fits with the topic of this
video but my inked in pink maybelline
color tattoo it's a really pretty kind
of metallic pinky cream shadow put that
all over the lids whenever you're using
other pink and mauve tones like from the
NYC individualised compact this makes a
great base for these shadows it just
intensifies whatever you put on top also
your Urban Decay Naked 3 palette this
makes a great partner for these shades
because there are so many like kind of
fun sparkly metallic colors in here and
that shine comes out of these shades
even more when you put it on top of
something like this also as I mentioned
in my may best in beauty video loving
taking different color pop eyeshadows
which have a very unique kind of mousse
like creamy consistency but super long
wearing love using these taking
something like this using it as the pop
on your lid or your lower lash line and
then
using matte shadows to really pull the
whole look together so in one of their
latest collections it was a six shadow
set there's a color called snake by it's
a gorgeous golden ìshe another couple
of shades that I really am liking from
that same collection are Mirage which is
a great pistachio greenish color and
then this mauve with golden Sparkle
called prickly pear is a lot of fun as
well a little bit deeper than those
other two but grab for one of your
favorite matte pallets I'm loving Too
Faced natural matte but I did for this
look today as I put strapless in the
crease just buff that in there and then
I put snake buy all over the lid just
patting it on there with my finger I
think works really well maintains a lot
of the color payoff from these and then
go in with another matte shade like I
used chocolate cookie Pat that on the
outer part of the lid I also put some
snake bite down on the lower lash line
but I incurred it in there again with
darker shades from the natural matte
palette so this is just one example of
the kind of look I've been doing a whole
lot with my color pop eyeshadows just
pairing them with different mattes and
seeing what kinds of looks I can get
awesome mascara cocktail that I just
kind of stumbled across is the Estee
Lauder little black primer which is just
a great first off natural like lash tint
type product when you put this on your
lashes you know you don't feel like
anything really dramatic is happening
but once you layer another mascara on
top it's like whoa this is a whole new
world for mascara plus I find it holds
my curl so well wearing this underneath
just about anything but when I put the
benefit roller lash on top of that I've
gotten great results in terms of length
but also a really fabulous curl and
another mascara that I think is really
awesome on its own the covergirl super
sizer this on top of the little black
primer as well even better I'm kind of
long wearing curl to my lashes and my
lashes really don't like to stand up
straight they weren't downward at all
times and I'm gonna wrap this up with
several lip cocktails that I really
enjoy that involve my Milani color
statement lip liners these are just some
of my favorite lip pencils and they're
really pretty if you want to use them on
their own put a lip balm on fill in your
whole lips with one of these you're
gonna be so impressed with how creamy
they are how colorful they are I haven't
had issues with these bleeding outside
the lip line and I have some
three intense shades so I would know if
they were drifting but I also like
layering these on top it's kind of like
a finishing touch little accent two
different lip shades for example my
Sonia Kashuk shine Lux sheer and sheer
pink lust this is an awesome just peachy
nude it's got a lot of shine to it but
once I pull in one of my all-time
favorite color statement lip liners in
the shade spice I add this in and just
kind of use it on the outer parts and it
brings some very subtle definition to
the lips that depth on the outside I
just think accents the looks so well
makes the lips look fuller just a great
pairing with this soft peachy nude
another great way to use your red lip
liners is alongside a more orange e
coral type lipstick for example here
I've got the Kate Moss lasting finished
matte lipstick number 109 it's very
orange II sometimes the orange e things
don't look as ordered you with my
lighting in camera but this shade really
does have some orange to it and some
people feel a little uncomfortable going
to Orange on the lips but a way to make
it more wearable is to pull in a red lip
liner so this is milania's color
statement in true red again just throw
on the lipstick and then add this right
in your outer corners kind of define
your Cupid's bow a little bit more and I
think you'll find that it makes the
orange e or coral lip colors a little
less scary when you add in some red and
lastly if you're liking the lip look I'm
wearing in this video it's the NYX high
voltage lipstick and flutter kiss which
is a really cool kind of Mavi very dusty
rose type shade and I love pulling in a
little bit more berry to this color so I
take my Milani lip liner in Bordeaux
which is a great deep rich berry again
same method just adding this on the
outer corners I feel like it builds up a
look of fullness it adds just a little
more punch to flutter kiss even though
that's gorgeous on its own I just like
this little addition and then for even
more fullness add a little bit of the
NYX butter gloss and meringue just on
the center of the lower lip it really
just meshes with these shades so nicely
so those are some of my beauty product
cocktails little mixtures of products or
layers of products that I think work
really well together I would love to
hear in the comments section what
products you're always using like side
by side with one another or mixed in
with each other these are the kinds of
ideas that I think are great when you're
shopping your stash you're trying to
make certain products go a little
further for you
do different things consider combining
them and you might come up with an even
better product than you started with so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
