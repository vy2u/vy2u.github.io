review video on a product I've been
asked about a lot it's the covergirl
nature luxe foundation and this is
fairly new and drugstores new to the
covergirl line and I actually did this
whole foundation follow-up video talking
about not only drugstore but I think
there was a high-end foundation also
that I mentioned there and kind of it's
like a master review on a few different
products and this inadvertently got left
out I didn't mean to miss it but it just
I forgot to include it in that video so
I'll link to that one below it was just
talking about several recent foundations
I've tried but still I thought was
important that I go ahead and get a
review out there on this um basically
this product is covergirl nature luxe
liquid silk foundation so when you hear
that in the title doesn't that give you
high hopes for how this is going to
smooth on for me I pictured it being
just kind of like a a velvety smooth
texture on the skin when you put it on
and you know what it really did have
that for me I really thought this went
on so flawlessly so smoothly it felt
light on the skin here's a close look at
the packaging in case you're not
familiar with what you're looking for
out there in stores my shade is 340 um
what's that called
maple okay and yeah the whole system
there has changed in terms of naming the
colors but basically I feel like this
has almost like a slightly ever so
slightly like whipped quality to it
because it goes on in that really smooth
fashion even if you're a beginner with
makeup this is going to be easy enough
to apply I was just able to apply it
really easily right there on my hand and
my hand looks very nice right now but it
gives you definitely medium coverage I
didn't feel like I mean I've tried other
foundations that are full coverage this
was not full coverage this was a
definite medium coverage foundation it's
gonna even out your skin tone but you
know there's some flaws that it might
not cover and you might need to go in
with concealer definitely to take care
of some of those
when you put a foundation on you can
just stare it yourself and see the do
enos that's kind of coming off of your
face from that and this really you know
gives you that even silky smooth but not
dewy look it does have a light scent I
know it is infused with I believe it's
cucumber cucumber water yes like the
feel like the way it goes on think it's
very easy to put on but where I really
start to get picky with foundations is
how they wear how they're staying power
is because with different parts of my
collection I feel like I might get an
eyeshadow that I don't think is great or
a lipgloss that I don't think is so hot
but you know maybe if I put a nice base
underneath that eyeshadow I turn out to
like that better or if I use with that
lip stick that I don't like so much
maybe it looks great with a certain lip
gloss over it there's compensation you
know that you can use to get more out of
certain products but with a foundation I
feel like you know that is the base
product on your skin it should cover
well and it should last and while this
covered in a medium way which this is
not meant to be thick heavy you know
full coverage foundation I don't think
some people I've read about comparing
this to a tinted moisturizer I think
it's definitely more than a tinted
moisturizer but I think it's not a full
coverage foundation but anyway where I
feel this is lacking a little bit is
with the staying power Revlon Colorstay
Rimmel lasting finish I brought these up
so much and this goes back to my early
early videos when I was first trying
those foundations and they stuck out to
me and they created a high standard and
even if something comes out and cute
kind of green fun packaging it's not
going to change my mind if it's not
better you know what I mean so I've got
that standard there I expect staying
power with my foundation for me I do not
have oily skin I have combination skin
which means I can get a little oily here
here and maybe here and I felt like it
didn't take much for this foundation to
break down you know maybe after I don't
know eight hours or so maybe six to
eight hours and then I
I started to notice the oils in my skin
kind of getting to this foundation and
its self it's nothing that can't be
corrected I guess with maybe blotting a
little powder over it and that kind of
thing but you shouldn't have to and
there are other foundations available
for the same price or less that can hold
up there things that kind of tick me off
about this I felt that the price of this
foundation was more than it should be it
was more than eleven dollars right
around 1199 I think was the average
price that I looked up online so that I
thought was a bit much compared to its
other drugstore counterpart foundations
and also I thought I feel like the way
they changed the naming of the colors
was really inconvenient
like I knew generally speaking what I
might be in regular covergirl
terminology but then I look here and
it's like am i maple and I wa you know
let it be good for maybe someone with
truly normal skin or maybe you even got
dry skin I think I could see this being
okay it definitely doesn't look cakey it
has a really nice appearance as soon as
you put it on staying power is not great
cost is a little too high for what it
gives you but yeah it's worth trying I
think maybe if you're looking for a new
foundation and if you really don't like
the feel of some foundations if you
think they're too heavy if you think
they feel too cakey or like there's a
real layer of something there on your
face and you're looking for something
lighter and you don't have a lot of oil
issues this might be really good for you
FLE this answers your questions on the
covergirl nature luxe foundation by the
way it is one fluid ounce in this in
case you're wondering thanks so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
