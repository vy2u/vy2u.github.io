great day
today I am going to be doing kind of a
three-in-one type review and demo video
on the new collection from covergirl
it's called Ready Set gorgeous suiting a
foundation a concealer and a powder and
I know I had mentioned in my whole
recently that I saw some new covergirl
things at CBS they were like a couple of
shadow quads and some lip products but
it wasn't till I went to Walgreens that
I found the entire biggle spread so I
found this stuff later on and as well as
even more lip products and while these
face products have the Ready Set
gorgeous label on them I've been reading
I think it was on allure they said that
you know Katy Perry is kind of the
spokesperson going along with this new
line and I think they're calling it
instaglam or something Instagram inspire
get the feeling that the whole idea
behind this Ready Set gorgeous line is
oil-control some of the claims for this
foundation or that it keeps shine at bay
I can just tell by the texture of this
powder it's very very mattifying
foundation has a matte finish also and
then you've also got this kind of
traditional liquidy concealer with a doe
foot applicator so as we go along you'll
see these products being applied I'm
gonna start off with the foundation and
I got this in shade 210 and that is
called medium beige this line kind of
seems to be set up with a number system
I noticed that there was like a range of
numbers for the powders to help you
better choose your powder color but I
did find that those seem to run a little
bit dark so while I'm 210 in the
foundation and that's probably a pretty
good match for me I'm only 115 light in
the powder that goes along with it so
just something to double-check for and
the way these are packaged you can pop
them open and actually see what kind of
color you're dealing with and next
foundation is a very liquidy consistency
and just squeezes right out of the tube
which I do like that format and I just
kind of like to patch it all over my
skin where I know I'm going to put it
and then I pulled in my Sigma f80 to
further blend it out and I feel like the
has medium coverage and definitely a
matte finish not going to conceal every
last little problem that you have on
your face but something about the the
matte finish of it I think makes the
coverage seem even better says oil-free
won't clog pores suitable for sensitive
skin and lasts all day however I don't
believe there's any sunscreen in this
product or initially putting this on I
feel like the finish of my skin looks
pretty good you know skin tone overall
definitely evened out you know you might
have some redness or some circles here
and there that you want to add some
concealer to but for the purposes of
being a foundation I thought this was
pretty good I could see if you're
dealing with dry patches and dryness I
mean this is the kind of foundation
that's going to kind of exaggerate that
a little bit because it's not adding a
lot of moisture and it's very matte so
definitely something more for I think
the normal combo or really oily skin
types there then I went in with my
concealer and this I have in the shade
light and this is just a very
traditional concealer type format I feel
like covergirl used to have something
called invisible concealer or maybe they
still do I think that was one of the
first concealers I ever used and this
kind of reminds me of that so I applied
this around my under eye area and
because this is a little lighter shade
than my foundation I use this for some
highlighting as well it's a very liquidy
consistency so it blends into the skin
and you feel like you can kind of layer
it on top of your foundation without it
looking too head so I just blended that
out with my Sigma p84 brush I think I
just see this is a little bit more of a
brightener than a really heavy coverage
concealer thing I've really noticed over
time is that if you've got dark spots or
dark circles it really helps to use a
peachy tone concealer on top of those
areas because it not only like covers
them up but it like it really
camouflages then and sometimes when
you're just using a skin tone concealer
on problems like that it might lighten
them or make them a little less obvious
but it doesn't do quite as well for
helping them disappear so just something
to think about there I don't see this
concealer as a total like must-have
amazing incredibly different concealer
from a lot of things that are on the
market
you don't want a really good coverage
like amazing coverage liquidy
consistency concealer from the drugstore
I would check out the hard candy
glamoflauge in the squeezy tube that's
really good powder is also called Ready
Set gorgeous fresh complexion I have in
115 light and you are getting a mirror
in here there's your powder and also a
sponge I have applied this with the
sponge but I find it gives me a lot
heavier application of the powder that I
want for a touch-up you know you could
try to be really careful with it and
kind of blot it around but I feel like I
just get too much on and for this powder
being as matte as it is when you get too
much on it's pretty noticeable the
texture of this isn't maybe as smooth
and rich feeling as some other drugstore
powders that I've really come to enjoy
like the L'Oreal True Match pressed
powder that's just a really great one
and I feel like when I put that on my
skin I don't look too dry when I put
this on it does add some coverage on top
of that foundation so foundation
concealer and this I think you kind of
end up with a pretty full coverage look
really and a very matte look as well I
like applying this best with a brush but
again you just kind of got to be careful
with it because it can look a little
more visible on your skin but using this
powder I do think really helps the
staying powder of the staying powder
staying power of the foundation I've
worn the foundation just as is to try to
determine how well the staying power is
just with this and it's pretty good but
it's even better with this on top so
setting it I mean no real surprise there
that's the way a lot of foundations
perform best especially if you're kind
of oily is with that powder on top
speaking of staying power and how well
this worked throughout the course of the
day I really tested this under some semi
extreme circumstances I was doing some
gardening outside
planting a flower bed it was hot I was
sweating definitely and I was really
surprised to look at myself in the
mirror and see that this hadn't broken
down all that much and then on an
average
when I'm not you know out in the Sun
sweating my head off
this really lasted well there have been
times and I won't say I've noticed this
to a major extent like every time I've
worn this but I'll look at my face late
in the day I'll feel like I can see more
pores maybe around my cheeks and just
like I'm seeing the makeup more than I
want to does that make sense
and I feel like my skin is it a really
normal skin type kind of place right now
it's not incredibly oily it's not very
dry right now you know this little trio
of products seems to wear a long time I
don't necessarily love the look that I'm
getting as the day goes on a foundation
that I love from covergirl that would
really be well-suited to oily combo skin
types is the outlast stay fabulous I
mean this is a great foundation and it
kind of reminds me of this one coverage
wise only I find this to be a little
more buildable in other words if you
first applied it and then your thought
oh there are a few more areas where I
want to build up the coverage I feel
like this can be built up more and not
look like too much whereas this one
doesn't necessarily build on itself as
well it looks a little more obvious
staying power with this is just awesome
I've always been impressed by that I
just feel like I like the look of it the
finish of it on the skin a little bit
better than this one also contains SPF
20 so I think if you're kind of in a
toss-up of you know a good oil control
foundation to try from the drugstore
this one's just really great has good
coverage good staying power good
appearance on the skin even as the day
wears on so in my book this one beats
this one concealer kind of a
take-it-or-leave-it type thing if you
just got some minor issues and you
wanted to try this so you just wanted to
do some brightening this could do the
job but for major major imperfections I
think you may want to look into
something a little more heavy duty
coverage or something more corrective if
you've got like I said those dark
circles and dark spots a peach concealer
works really great on those areas you're
looking for a great mattifying powder
this is pretty good but like I said it's
easy to go too heavy with this
especially if you're using that sponge
included and a lot of the reason why
someone wants a nice little handy
compact is to take it on the go and just
be able to grab whatever sitting in
there and dab it on your face and
another one that comes with a sponge is
the L'Oreal True Match like I mentioned
but the texture of that powder is more
fine it just doesn't go on my skin
looking as cakey I guess as this one can
tend to look I don't think this is a bad
trio of products and I think for oily
skin you will notice pretty good staying
power with them and all of these things
combined you know pretty good coverage
with it as well I would call it full
coverage and but there are still I think
individual products throughout the
drugstore that can do even better I am
pleasantly surprised by how well this
lasted on my skin putting it through
some pretty you know tricky
circumstances when you're buying
products they're geared toward that
anti-shine kind of thing you are going
to have a tendency of looking a little
more dry especially if light that's not
really your skin type and you are a
little more dry anyway and this this is
not dry skin stuff so just be aware of
that Thanks to everyone who gave me a
heads up about where they were finding
this stuff I really appreciate that and
have a great day I'll see you guys next
time
