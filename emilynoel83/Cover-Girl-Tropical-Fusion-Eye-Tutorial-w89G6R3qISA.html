me for this much-anticipated tutorial
using the covergirl tropical fusion
palette ever since I listed this is one
of the best drugstore palettes I've had
so many requests that saying well use it
in a tutorial then so I went ahead and
did that it's it's a super wearable look
I think even though it's colorful I
think you could go out with this and
still look great we've got blue jade
green orange and yellow and these shades
are pretty much matte or like kind of a
satiny and tone to them you know
there's not a lot of filler and sparkle
in there so I think it really comes off
pretty on the eye but I threw in a like
a shadow stick with this that gives it
more of a shimmery appearance and sort
of a jewel look around the eye so that
was fun but as far as shadows I only use
these so if you've got this palette I
think you'll definitely be able to pull
off this look so thank you guys so much
for watching and I hope you like the
first thing we're gonna do to really
grab the color and create a little bit
of shimmer for what is basically a quad
of matte shades which could still be
really pretty but I think these shades
really glisten you know when you put
something a little bit shimmery
underneath so I think the perfect thing
for that is the NYX jumbo eye shadow
pencil in cottage cheese and so this is
you know just kind of a white light
shaded like jumbo shadow stick so just
applying that all over my lid and then
just kind of using my finger to smooth
it out a little bit and you don't want
to put too much on here a little bit
will serve the purpose we need but if
you put too much you will get some
creasing so just kind of Pat it out like
that next we're gonna take our covergirl
quad and tropical fusion some really fun
bright colors here and I'm gonna go to
this kind of jade green shade first and
I'm going to just use the applicator
that they give you here because I just
think it's ideally you know ideal for
what I want to do here which is just
pack on the color so I'm using the
pointed shade pointed side of the
applicator
thing we want to do here is just pack
this all over our lid we want to get all
the way into the inner corner and just
all over that entire lid and it just
gives off a really pretty finish I mean
it's bold but it's also shimmery with
that pencil underneath so if you have
like a white shimmery cream shadow that
would be you know fine to use underneath
this but I think those pencils are just
very convenient in terms of the crease
you know just take it up there a little
bit we're not being going to make a huge
thing out of the crease but we will be
doing a little bit of an outer V
blending in another shade so it's nice
to kind of put down that initial layer
of color here just like that and this is
so easy these are like what we kind of
initially learned with a lot of us
anyway so yeah go with that another
thing with this pencil I forgot to do
this at first but go all the way around
your eye here corner and right around
there I'm just I did that all at the
first on this other side but I just kind
of slipped my mind here but you want
that because we're gonna be doing
basically shadow all the way around the
eye which is really fun and for the
creativity police out there I think it
does pretty creative too so go ahead and
go over that I'm using this is a the C
148 mini contour brush from Coastal
Scents just a tiny brush q-tips would
work for this or any just small brush or
or applicator that you have and I am
just patting that shadow right on top of
the white pencil
and you can just go ahead and do that
all the way around the I here
the next step is with this really um
true royal blue here on the outside I'm
gonna take that detail brush again get
some of that blue on there and start
blending that a little bit on the outer
half here and blend that about halfway
in on top of the you can see how we've
got some of that blue coming through
there blend it halfway in on top of that
jade green and then bring it up and I'm
basically like drawing on I mean this is
such an easy way to do the outer V guys
I'm taking it up and I'm just filling
this area in with color right there just
kind of make a little a little line and
I'm just gonna be filling in that area
with this blue and it's just a really
pretty kind of finish to this it takes
it from being a real 1 dimensional you
know colored look to bringing in another
another shade but it's not like we're
putting it all over our look we're just
kind of incorporating it there on that
outer outer corner
so you may need to you know go back and
layer to build the color up but these
are really pigmented colors so you don't
have to work too hard on that I'm gonna
also use just a little fine crease brush
as well just for blending purposes and
kind of just stick that right there we
want the with some color concentration
since we're not using any blacks you
know we do need to get the most out of
this darkest shade of blue I didn't want
to dull this look at all with the blacks
I know it's nice to use black and I
often do use it as a contour but I
wanted to do something a little
different here so I'm sticking with
exactly what is in this palette and it
makes it a little easier for you because
you know exactly what I'm using so next
I'm going to go to a crease brush just
and it's just a medium brush I'm not
really using it for the fact that it's a
crease brush but just because it's kind
of a medium size and I'm taking this
orange shade and these um the the orange
and the yellow I chose to use in a more
subtle way for this look I'm actually
just taking that and sort of creating a
border with the green and this is gonna
kind of blend with your skin tone
somewhat I mean it's just gonna warm up
this this space we have here between our
eye and the eye brow but I wanted to you
know incorporate it and keep that that
kind of tropical feel that this palette
gives and then the yellow then real
lemony yellow I'm going to take my
Sephora rounded crease brush a fluffier
brush and take that right up under the
brow and basically blend that between
the brow and the orange for our eyeliner
here it's gonna be kept really simple
because I'm gonna be putting on some
false lashes and that's really the only
reason why I'm putting eyeliner on here
because I just want to have that line so
when I put set the band down it's not
obvious where it begins and ends so yeah
I'm just going to be sticking to from
inner corner to outer corner I'm going
to use my Revlon Colorstay liquid eye
pen it has it gives you a very very fine
line because we want to let as much of
this show as possible and so just really
concentrate on keeping it close to the
lash line as close as you can sometimes
I've heard from some people saying you
know I put my liner on and then it's
like it covered up my entire look with
the shadow and one tip for that is
practically to pretend like you're
drawing on your lash line a little bit
just keep it really really close in
there do you need to curl my eyelashes
and I'm gonna put on one coat of the
colossal mascara just a really nice
mascara to blend real and false lashes
and then I'm going to be putting on a
set of these Ardell false lashes they
are I believe they're called one second
let me check they are called beauties
and they're a pretty natural set here
you can see they're pretty fine lashes I
mean they're they're very easy to work
with and I have worn it before they're
just natural but it really does open
your eyes up so I'll join you back here
when I get those
hey everyone I'm back with the finished
look I am so excited about this look I
think it was really fun and just fun to
use color not only on your lid but
really all the way around your eye you
can still get a lot of impact even
though it's not like a black color
really I liked using the false lashes to
really set off the entire look but if
you're looking for some really vibrant
colors to add to your collection these
truly are pigmented easy to blend very
easy to use and getting this kind of
range can give you a big choice of
options you know you could totally leave
out this blue and do kind of like a
Miami Dolphins thing with the orange and
the Jade green or go more with the
yellow and the orange you know it's it
there's a lot of possibilities that I
can see how you might see this in the
store and think oh it looks pretty but
not quite know what to do with it so I
hope this gave you some ideas it's just
you could you can even go settle with
this using one color and then a black
and just you know using this as you're
one of these as your lid shade and then
just black as your contour make it
really simple but I hope you guys
enjoyed this look a little different
from what I would normally do but it was
really fun I used the lip lights from
Bonnie Belle and caramel latte on my
lips just to give kind of a golden a
neutral bronzy glow to the lids to the
lips because my lids are so bright so
thanks again for watching everyone and
have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
