going to do kind of a review demo
comparison type video on a new line of
products from covergirl you may have
seen these in drugstores I just found
them at Walgreens but they're called
true magic and it's a line of products
that claims to be like a skin Perfector
I think that's actually what it says on
the package a unique texture and that
they are somewhat creamy to the touch
but I would describe them more as almost
a solid gel type format and you have
heard me talk about something called
Mally poreless face defender over the
years so I will definitely be comparing
these to this and explaining what these
all do the display I saw at my Walgreens
there actually is a tester out on one of
these so you can feel it and you can see
what I'm talking about he'll notice that
it's pretty smooth if you get some on
your finger and then rub it between your
other fingers you notice that very silky
quality that some primers feel like they
have after you've just put them on your
skin is our product that contains
dimethicone which is something that's
known to be kind of poor and wrinkle
filling very smoothing has that silky
feel but anyway this one that appears to
be white is actually just a clear
product and this is called the skin
Perfector then there's one with actual
color to it and this is the bronzer and
it also has that creamy silky type
texture and the third one in the line is
called the Luminizer and this you can
see is kind of a shimmery golden product
same kind of texture as the others as
far as some of the claims on this
product on the clear skin Perfector one
it says oil-free non-greasy won't clog
pore alone under or over makeup for a
soft smooth finish apply throughout the
day for quick touch-ups just like
pressed powder there is no mirror in
them so that does kind of hinder the
whole on-the-go touch-ups type idea when
you don't have a mirror to look and now
he has a couple versions of her face
defender I really like the one that's in
the travel type packaging because it
does have a mirror and a place for your
sponge one of them which I thought was
kind of odd it has a mirror but it
doesn't have a place to put your sponge
so that can be kind of a travel issue
well this product has a lot of the same
claims as Molly's face defender the
texture of it is definitely different if
you have both and you felt them both you
know what I'm talking about and this is
a little bit more creamy you could
practically if I wanted to kind of mess
up the product I could press my finger
down into this and almost even scoop a
little bit out there's a little bit more
of a thickness to it and like if I rub
my finger in it I can actually see like
a small little glob of that on my finger
from just rubbing it around there
malleus is a little bit more solid well
actually a lot more subtle could rub
your finger in this forever and when you
lift your finger up you still see
nothing
no residue on I think that factor really
comes into play especially when you're
using this as a touch-up product because
you really want just the right amount of
something on your skin when you're
touching up you don't want too little or
else it doesn't get the job done of
mattifying if that's what you want and
you don't want too much because then
what you've already applied can start to
look cakey the very first time I use
this I felt like I could see my makeup
more where I put this on light it in the
very same manner that I did with Mally's
you know I gave my sponge just a little
twist on the product and then dabbed it
right on my skin and the feeling I came
away with was a this is definitely a
different texture than the face defender
and be I think I may have picked up too
much product because that is making my
skin look flawless in just areas around
my face where I dabbed it on I felt like
it was making my face look a little too
dry just a little bit heavier with
product and I know this is a product
that's supposed to have an effect on
your pores but don't necessarily assume
that that's gonna have a similar effect
on your fine lines because when just
like with Mally's - if you apply it up
under your eye it doesn't really do you
any favors their product to use in
places where you want to touch up plus
some hydration is that elf studio daily
moisture stick this is something
primarily that's going to mattify the
skin
same with Mally's product it's just that
with Mally's it's a little more solid so
you just get the minimal amount of
product to top off your makeup if you're
using this as a touch-up tool that's the
kind of thing I'm after so bottom line I
like this better for touch-ups this if
you're looking to try a more affordable
alternative
the face defender this is really similar
I just think you've got to watch
yourself a little bit more on the
application be really careful not to get
too much on your sponge if you have dry
patches on your skin by all means do not
get this on there because it will make
them stand out even more thing about
this kind of product I pretty much
exclusively use Mally's as a touch-up
thing I keep it in my purse almost all
the time because that's what I'm using
it is why I'm out and about some people
talk about using this as a primer I've
never really liked using that on my skin
that way
this one though I think functions a
little bit better from a primer
standpoint if that's what you want
because I do think that's where getting
a little more product on your skin comes
in handy wearing this under my
foundation today I felt like my
foundation applied so smoothly on top of
it especially like the effect on my
t-zone I mean this is kind of thing you
just get a little on your finger and
kind of dab it over certain areas where
you really want to fill in the pores
before foundation and I think you'll
like that if you're really dry I don't
know that this would be a great primer
option for you just because it can cling
to those areas and things can get a
little bit cakey looking now the bronzer
or it's technically called the Sun
kisser this is my favorite product of
this trio of things that I've used
recently I think this is awesome for
contouring and real quickly do you
remember from the em cosmetics video
Michelle fawns line where I talked about
that double-ended contouring and
highlighting stick and I talked about
how that contour was a really nice
texture it almost felt like cream to
powder on the skin so if you're going
over foundations and powders that you've
already applied it blended in really
nice it has that same kind of
lightweight quality and blend ability on
the skin so if you were liking what I
was saying about that product this would
be a great thing to check out what I
said about the texture of this clear one
definitely holds true for the bronzer as
well you put your finger in it you put
your sponge in it you're gonna pick up
more product than you do with the more
solidified Mally face defender type
stuff and I think that works too this
products advantage when you want more
color where you want a contour and
bronze the skin right so I'm really
enjoying this and the way I like to use
it is I take the little sponge that's
been provided
I get it in the product and then I place
that exactly where I want my contour on
my fin and I take a synthetic brush you
could use the elf small stipple brush
mine has been getting used for blush a
lot lately so it's kind of dirty right
so I used a synthetic angled contour
brush from Sigma and then you just use
that to buff it in this is not going to
set immediately you don't have to be in
a rush with blending this product out
you can take all the time you need and
it blends in so silky smooth it does not
interfere with your products underneath
I mean it's such a lightweight nice
texture for then I'll do the same thing
around my hairline just get some on the
sponge place it where I want it
buff it out with the brush if you want
an even more subtle look just take your
brush directly into this product and
then start blending it on and it'll be
even softer but using the sponge first
as a way to get even more color payoff
milky smooth natural-looking on the skin
it's matte any of us love our powders
but if you want to try something
different I would totally recommend this
now the thing from this line that I
definitely did not like was the
Luminizer and the reason why is because
this just gives you a wash of gold
glitter that's basically what this is
the glitter is much more apparent than I
want it to be for a highlight I want my
skin to just appear glowy without
somebody being able to point to a
particular thing on my skin that made it
that way you know that's why I like
those more pearly highlights that just
make you look like you're in beautiful
soft light you see the little glittery
flecks but it's like there's nothing
really binding it together ultimately
when you share this out on the skin it's
just not having the kind of impact
I want a highlight to have it's not
especially brightening it just gives you
a little bit of a golden glittery effect
texture wise it's the same as the other
products and I want to show you it shows
up a lot with this but see how it's it's
creamy to the point where you can kind
of leave an imprint in there Natalie's
face defender is not this creamy just so
you're aware so please realize that this
is just one girls experience with these
products you may have a different take
on them if you've tried them but in my
eyes there's a definite must-have with
the Sun kisser love that for contour and
true magic I see this is kind of okay I
think if you use it really carefully you
see some effects on your pores but I
think it tends to be a little bit
heavier than Mally's on the skin thing
that I would totally skip is the
Luminizer there are so many much better
cream and powder highlights on the
market do a much more effective job as a
highlight on your skin so hopefully that
answered some of your questions on these
new products thank you so much for
taking time to watch and I'll see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
