minute to tune in and check out this
video this is going to be a review on
the covergirl smoky shadow blast this is
the packaging which you're not that
interested in and this is the product
basically what this is is a double-ended
cream shadow stick one end is a lighter
color that's designed to be worn all
over your eyelid and then there's a
tapered tip that looks almost like a
little lipstick that is to be used sort
of as a smokey liner around your eye or
in your I have is called silver sky and
so here's a look at the lighter shade
it's just looks like a rounded-off
lipstick and to swatch that for you it's
just yeah your basic silver color it
goes on pretty light I noticed on my
lids it wasn't an extremely bold super
noticeable color I've used some cream
shadow sticks and silver that have been
a little more pigmented than that and
then the other shade that you get here
is sort of like I won't say it's like a
darker silver it almost seems to have a
little bit of a plum tone to it and this
is like a mini lipstick my first
question to myself when I got this was
when this kind of gets rounded off I
mean what can you do to keep that shape
because this is supposed to be a little
more precise to go in under your eye
either way here's a swatch of that it's
just kind of a slightly metallic once
again it's kind of a deep grayish plum
shade so I picked this up got a lot of
questions on it about my about this on
my Facebook page and so I just wanted to
see how it actually works so I kind of
went through the entire day evaluating
how well this would stay that was sort
of my biggest issue you know it looks
pretty on as soon as you apply it but
how well does it last throughout the day
so I took a picture when I first put it
on and here's a look at that
you
now I didn't want to apply any sort of a
powder product over the top which is
what I would normally do I typically
don't wear a cream shadow just as a
cream shadow but I thought you know
there's no instructions here saying you
are going to have to wear some powder
over this to make it work they actually
advise you to put this directly into
your crease with the darker shade so I
thought you know what I'm just gonna see
exactly what happens if I put nothing on
top of it so I once I went over all over
my lid with the light shade put the
darker shade in the crease I went a
little bit under my eye as well and I
took pictures throughout the day so that
was the first picture was when I put my
makeup on at around 10 o'clock and then
this next picture is at 12:45
at that point in time I really felt a
lot of like moisture on my eyelid like I
so desperately wanted to just take my
fingers and like wipe my eyelids off and
what's interesting is I used my Too
Faced shadow insurance under this which
is my all-time favorite primer and it
works beautifully you know with any sort
of powder product or if I take a cream
product and put powder over it I really
don't have staying power issues like
this but I could just see that there was
a major major creasing going on and it
just felt uncomfortable on my eyelids I
almost felt like a little bit of
sticking like if I would you know I'm
looking ahead and I'm looking down
thinking oh this is just not comfortable
you know I for is okay kind of averages
it started out it really did not improve
at all so I want to go ahead and show
you the picture I took around three
o'clock
that was right before I started this
video and you can see this line here
it's like the the big difference I could
notice just looking in the mirror
because I know I this shots that I took
of myself we're sort of in different
lights I was in my car for one and you
know in my living room for the other but
I just felt like the difference between
my second and my last picture was that
the color just seemed to really just
anything that I put on seemed to all
gravitate to the crease and I feel like
I mean my eyelid there's still that
little bit of sparkle there you can see
as I turned my head but look at this
especially like all that color that was
in my crease just kind of went there
there I just rubbed a little bit of it
off when I did put it under my eye
you'll notice that there is still some
color under my eye and I did top that
with a shadow just to kind of get a
sense of okay if I just do that what's
it gonna do it stayed okay underneath
there as using that as sort of a liner
right in there I also lined my waterline
with something different but as far as
right on the skin under my eye when I
topped that with shadow that wasn't too
bad but up here with no no powder shadow
over the top man like I wouldn't I was
like out shopping and stuff and I almost
like didn't what people would see me
look down because I'm like oh this is
weird you know so I mean even if you
have dry lids like I don't consider
myself to be a person that has naturally
oily lids but I my eyes could not handle
this stuff and if even if you have dry
lids that's what makes me think that
this still may not be a good thing for
you even if you use a primer under it
now from now on if I use this if I want
a silvery base for my eye shadow that's
all this is going to be for me is
something that will go underneath a
powder shadow and I also want to mention
that when I applied this I didn't just
like go back forth back forth you know
really coated on and try to get this
sort of effect I put it on I blotted it
off with my finger and tried to make
sure I had the lightest layer the
lightest application possible so I
really made every effort to make this
work
on its own but smoky shadow blast just
did not do it for me and it will
definitely be a function as a base or a
shadow in the future and then I'll
probably report back to you on my blog
to see if that even worked to see if
this really is that different from other
shadow sticks like the NYX jumbo eye
shadow pencils I wear those a lot
underneath my shadow and I haven't had
staying power issues with that these
don't feel drastically different texture
wise only there's really not as much
color in these as the NYX jumbo shadow
pencils just to give you a sort of a
comparison there but thank you guys for
kind of taking this journey through my
day with me as I checked on my eyes with
the smoky shadow blasts I will probably
finish up this video and get this all
wiped off the so little like greasy mess
on my eyes so thanks again for tuning in
everyone have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
