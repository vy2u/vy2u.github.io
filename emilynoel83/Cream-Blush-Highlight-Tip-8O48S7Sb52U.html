here and do a quick little video I'm
telling you about a method for applying
cream blush that has really changed my
makeup world I love doing it this way I
really feel like I didn't have a great
method for it before but in the past
couple weeks I've kind of been working
with a new tool that has made it so much
easier I think the issue a lot of us
have with cream blushes or cream
highlights or any product like that is
that you're putting it on usually over
maybe a powder or some foundation or
some concealer when you're applying it
with your fingers it kind of makes you
wonder okay am i applying too much
pressure and is that messing up the rest
of my makeup and sometimes I feel that
way especially with certain textures but
this tool that I'm going to tell you
about really seems to work for every
texture of cream product that I have and
it is the elf small stipple brush see
how it's so short that the bristles
don't you know get all wobbly can truly
step along the product if that's what
you want or it can blend it out which
whichever way you like to do it the
point is it's not applying too much
pressure and it's giving you a really
flawless blended appearance to that
blush without messing up the rest of
your makeup now I do have this brush
from Sigma it is similar if you have
this this can were no ever I don't like
it as well because the bristles are
longer so when it does come in contact I
feel like they just aren't quite as
stiff you don't have quite as much
control whereas this one it just works
perfectly really works with any texture
product I have whether it might be some
sort of stick you can go directly off of
the stick and apply it or you can you
know apply a little bit to your hand and
just go off of there that works well for
cream products like this cream highlight
from boots number seven this is actually
a dupe for benefits high-beam these
little guys these shimmering facial lips
from ELF they're actually really nice
like I'm finding so many products that I
actually kind of enjoy because they work
with this method my Mac cream blush a
very pigmented rich cream blush the
dream bouncy blush is I love the way
these apply I'll just show you real
quick this is the blush and Hot Tamale I
just kind of tap this in there a little
bit I kind of lightly
were lit on the outer part of the apple
of my cheek and you get a great little
application cream blushes can look so
fresh and really pretty but I think the
problem we run into is that you know we
blend away are the rest of our makeup or
we just mess up the appearance of what's
underneath show you real quick like what
I would do with a liquid like with this
highlight I would put a little bit there
on my hand then kind of blend it out so
you don't get a big gob you know right
on the brush so kind of like that and
then I tap my brush in that and then
liquids work really nicely stippled and
this is kind of a subtle highlight but
you can see what I'm getting here I'm
getting that little glow there right on
the top of my cheekbones and it's just
very diffused very easy to work small
enough that you have control to
highlight different parts of your face
if you want to
I find this brush cleans really well and
it hasn't been shedding $3 at eyes lips
face comm I'm not sure if this is being
sold yet in Target stores but it's
definitely next time you're placing an
elf order this should be part of it
because it's just it really has
broadened the use of my cream products
and made me enjoy a lot more of them so
thank you so much for watching I hope
this was helpful and I'll talk to you in
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
