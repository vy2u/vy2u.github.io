Christmas today I want to talk about
some different cream products including
a brand new cream compact from Revlon
it's got a foundation and concealer in
it so I kind of want to show you how
this works and give you my little review
on that also a couple of different cream
contour type palettes that I've been
messing with lately this one is from ELF
as you can see it's got three cream
contour products and also a creamy
highlight and the other is from mascara
if you notice the spelling here Cara is
a beauty blogger and she's got this
palette that's kind of a creating
yourself type palette and I've been
testing out this as well so I just
wanted to talk about the different
techniques brushes that I use with these
products and just how well they've
worked for me so we're going to start
off with this compact from Revlon it
does say Revlon Colorstay so the color
stay line and for me it has a really
great reputation for awesome staying
power so I was really intrigued to see
whether this would have the same staying
power as the foundations the typical
liquid foundations that I know and love
but as I said this is a two in one
compact and the shade I have it in is
150 buff and with this at least with
this particular color I can't comment on
all the different shades because I don't
have them but I do notice a little bit
of a shade difference between the
foundation and the concealer the
concealer is just a little bit lighter
and I think slightly more cool toned
than the foundation you can see that
concealer pan is in its own little level
then you've got a full pan of the
foundation and then that lifts up and
you've got this sort of a soft triangle
shaped sponge so let's talk a little bit
about the difference in the consistency
here I feel like the foundation is very
very creamy as I look at it I can see a
lot of like shine coming off of this
product but it actually is a little bit
thin sometimes with cream compacts the
claim will be that they go from cream to
powder and with this I don't really
notice it changing consistencies you
know as it blends out on your skin but
it doesn't seem to maintain a lot of
excess moisture on the skin if that
makes sense so once I blend this in on
my face
it doesn't feel sticky tacky or anything
like
that and then I find the concealer to be
just a little bit thicker and you can
tell it definitely is going to have more
coverage it's not going to be quite as
quick and easy to blend across the skin
so as you're applying these I just use
this little sponge that's provided keep
in mind this is kind of a thin
consistency and cream foundation so I
don't feel like the coverage is actually
as good as the different liquid Revlon
Colorstay products or the whipped
version just a little more thin on the
skin yes I can build it up there have
been some days where I've woken up with
just like more redness in the center of
my face and I found that this I had to
really add a lot of this to cover that
up so then you're thinking okay well if
coverage is my concern then I'll just
add a little bit of this concealer and
so I did use that on my under eye area I
just used my finger to get it applied I
also used it elsewhere on the face where
I wanted a little added brightness
because like I said it is a bit lighter
than the foundation shade the concealer
is a bit thicker and I think adding just
a few dabs of foundation on top of that
makes it a little bit easier to blend
and I feel like I can easily blend large
patches of the skin with this sponge
just by sort of wrapping it around my
finger and then I can bring in a
separate brush if I want to just to get
around those more hard-to-reach areas
it's something I always notice about
these skin tone concealers when I'm
attempting to use them and only them on
my under eye area I think they tend to
somewhat lighten my discoloration that I
have right around here but it really
doesn't camouflage it like a peachy tone
corrector would so that's why I love my
benefit array space so much I didn't
pull that in for this video because I
just wanted you to see how this product
and this alone worked so overall I love
the concept of doing a little double pan
compact here with foundation and
concealer however I feel like this is
not quite dead on for my personal needs
like I said if anything as far as a
concealer goes I like something that's
going to be a little bit more corrective
for the under eye area and with this and
this could be an ideal concealer for
maybe spot concealing blemishes
definitely has some stepped-up coverage
compared to the foundation and it can
kind of
as a brightener I was also thinking
about the foundation and comparing it
coverage wise to the liquids that are
from the Colorstay line the one for oily
to combo skin the one for normal to dry
I have used both of those and I really
feel like those as well as the whipped
that comes in the jar all of those seem
to have a little bit stepped up coverage
compared to this this is a thin cream
that you can build up to an extent but
it still just doesn't pack quite as much
of a punch as those others in my opinion
also the staying power I mean the
Colorstay name is on this I tend to take
that pretty seriously because I've had
such good luck with so many products in
the color stain line but staying power
for me was not very good with this
product I've got to say my skin is
really not that oily especially this
time of year but I noticed it really
wearing down especially in my t-zone
I think the areas where I used more
concealer so maybe the under eye area
stayed a little bit better but around my
nose eye I even had a little concealer
there but I would say looking at my skin
about two-thirds of the way through the
day
I really saw a breakdown in this product
I noticed a lot of breakdown as well
like on my cheeks which isn't normally a
big problem area it's not a big like oil
production zone on my face but I could
see in comparison to my under-eye there
was a definite difference in the makeup
that was hanging around there so for me
anyway I think it's a great concept from
Revlon and awesome packaging idea
combining these two products but until
there's maybe a formula change with that
foundation to give it a little bit
better coverage and staying power it's
not really something I'm super
interested in repurchasing now let's
move on to the cream contouring stuff
that I have I've got this palette from
ELF and this is a pretty new product to
their line as you can see the big mirror
a lot of their sort of quad compacts
like this they have the same design
where you can pop out the individual
pans and they're coming out with so many
different products like this you really
could customize your own palette you
know you could take from there a little
highlight palette you could take from
there blush palette and customize
several shades and one that you really
liked but this contact
all cream none of these creams have
shimmer they are very uh no kind of like
lightweight creams they're not too dry
and thick to where they're difficult to
pick up with a brush they're very easy
you know if you just want to tap your
brush directly into the product you
won't have any trouble and they all do
seem to have that same consistency this
lightest shade up here literally like
the color of butter this to me seems to
be like the coolest shade out of the
bunch and probably the lightest while
these two down here have a little more
depth and warmth going on and I chose to
apply these with one of the brushes I
actually mentioned in my last video this
is the powder blurring brush actually
and I think it works great for cream
contour and a lot of different things
but as you can see it's just ever so
slightly fanned out side-to-side and
pinched in a bit at the ferrule that's
what's causing that to happen it's
really dense and soft and I kind of use
it in a two-sided way so I'll dip more
so one side into this cream contour and
use that to apply it right there in the
hollows of my cheeks and then I kind of
focus in on the other side to blend it
out and that just works well for me and
then I'll use the whole brush with that
lightest contour shade going kind of
under the chin I'll also use this brush
to go down the nose it does that
surprisingly well and then around the
hairline I blended the lightest shade
and the one shade deeper and just use
these right around that area these are
so so easy to blend they have a similar
effect on my skin to that Revlon
Colorstay foundation and that they don't
go on looking dewy my whole face feels
very even and nice and not sticky now
for this highlight shade if you want to
really brighten some areas of your face
I brought in my pointed foundation brush
from Real Techniques I just really like
the way that lays down product and so I
use this product in big patches kind of
on the tops of the cheeks right down the
nose chin around the mouth I also used a
little bit of the lightest shade just
under my cheek contour you can get even
more contrast that way with the light
and dark and then with that synthetic
buffing brush use that to just blend
over the slightest shade I like that
it's a fuller brush so it doesn't really
interfere with other concealing I might
have done it can just gently blend out
the
product and the product is very easy to
blend so that's the elf compact I think
a couple advantages to cream contouring
and you know it's not going to come off
really powdery on the skin it can look
more natural and wherever you put it is
where it's going to stay you actually
have a little more feeling of control
when you're working with creams as
opposed to powders I could realize just
stick your finger in any of these if you
wanted to apply it to your skin that way
exactly where you wanted it and then
blend it out with a brush and you're
finished now with this mascara compact
and this is called 3d foundation so it's
kind of like foundation by way of
contouring and highlighting it's like
skipping the whole just flat foundation
step and just using these different
colors to pull off your overall face
look and if this sounds familiar I had
mentioned this in my shop my stash
drawer video update a few videos ago and
this was sent to me I didn't already
know how to use the product so I looked
up on her website I watched Kara's video
about it and became a little more
informed on how this works and so you
can actually select different shades to
go in this palette they all magnetized
in and out so I've got this shading
color there are several different levels
of that that you can use there's a more
brightening shade this can be like cream
blush or lip product as well and then
this cream highlight with like a pearly
Sheen the consistency of the products in
here it's like they're really rich and
creamy and when you put your finger or a
brush in them you're going to pick up
more product than with the elf or even
like that Revlon Colorstay foundation
and the cream compact those are ever so
slightly thinner than these so it's kind
of something to keep in mind as you just
go you know dabbing brushes into product
and you're going to get a little bit
different texture out of these and I
shot my demo with this on a different
day but basically you start out using
the contour shade anywhere you want to
contour it's kind of neat how it is so
deep and if you were to kind of streak
this across your face it would look very
dark but it blends away super easily it
doesn't set too quickly on the skin you
don't feel like you have to work really
fast to like okay I just applied it I
got to blend it in right now and the elf
was the same way in that respect so you
go about your contouring steps then you
can take the lighter shade in my case
it's very yellowy in this compact
and I found it to be almost a little too
yellowy because when I got done with the
brightening steps I felt like I was just
seeing too much yellow still on my skin
even after it was all blended out and
part of that I think is coming from the
fact that these creams are so pigmented
I found when I used it in just small
areas almost to try to correct some
under-eye darkness it doesn't do quite
as good as the salmon tone concealers
for me in that way but it did a little
bit better it looked a little better
when applied to just very small areas
and then there are different like blush
options you can have in this palette I
believe this is the Ruby one and I love
having one that's really deep and
colorful because you have such a range
in terms of the way you can wear it I
just used my ELF small stipple brush and
got a very soft I don't know it just
makes me feel like you just came in from
being out in the cold tight flush to the
cheeks I love that and you can dab it on
your lips as well and get kind of a
stained effect and have that nice
harmony between the cheek and lips so I
like that feature to this palette and
then this highlight is so pretty and
just pearly you could lay this on thick
and look just absolutely dewy
or just wear it really softly for a
light glow but when it's all said and
done after you've done all these steps
and the concept with the 3d foundation
is that like okay there's your face you
know you're done I was really impressed
and kind of surprised by the fact that
these creams were so rich and creamy but
they kind of I don't want to say they
really set or dry down in a negative way
on the skin they just don't stay you
know looking shiny and glossy like they
do in the compact so you're not gonna
get an overly dewy look if you look at
these and think I'm an oily skin person
that's gonna be like a thick goopy mess
on my face really once you blend these
creams in with both this compact and the
elf and they feel kind of weightless on
the skin if you're just looking for some
simple like cream contouring shades to
start out with I do really like the
texture of what's happening here in the
elf palette I think it would work for a
lot of people you've got darker shades
you can pull in and you've got this
shade which I reach for a lot for the
contour and you got that lighter shade
as well I mean they're really easy to
blend in and sometimes I think we
automatically think powder is easiest to
use when you're thinking about
contouring but really with creams you do
tend to have more control you can put it
exactly where you want it you can blend
these out completely I think it's all a
matter of what is the consistency of the
cream product you're trying to use some
could make it more difficult if they're
way too dry that they're nice and creamy
like this I think you'll have ease in
application now with the mascara compact
and it's kind of taking it all a step
further because you can totally
customize what's in here for me I like
everything that's in here except this
yellow shade if I could go for something
that's a little bit more like my skin
tone but lighter I think this would be
absolutely perfect for me because I love
the highlight I love this kind of blush
slash lip color and this is a really
great contour also as far as this really
feeling like foundation for me though I
think until I get the right shade here
it's not going to do that because it
still feels like you know cream contour
blush highlight and this shade I think
is the critical thing in terms of
coverage because that's the thing you
know you're gonna put like up under the
eye area you're going to hope that it
does some camouflaging there and I am
going to go ahead and order I think the
proper pan of product to go in there
because I'm very intrigued by this and I
really do like that concept think it's
more for the person who wants to go that
extra step beyond the basic contour
shades and get something for blush
something that's a very glowy highlight
this kind of palette can take you there
and by the way it's a really nice
quality palettes I do like that it
magnetizes shut that's always a nice
touch for me so bottom line I think I
found a couple of really nice quality
cream contouring things I found a
concept I really liked in this too and
one revlon compact but it just didn't
execute quite well enough for me to like
it over the various other formats of
Revlon foundations so thanks for
watching I hope this video helped you
out and I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
