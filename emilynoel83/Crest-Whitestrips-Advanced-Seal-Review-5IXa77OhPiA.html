about teeth whitening and I've had some
questions about it in the past this
particular video is going to focus on
what are the best teeth whitening
products I've tried and it is called
crest whitestrips advanced seal so if
you want to learn more about that keep
on watching but first I just wanted to
go through a few things just to let you
know what different items I've tried in
terms of teeth whitening and kind of
tell you how this compares so I
generally on a daily basis to use a
whitening toothpaste one of my favorites
is crest vivid white it is in my opinion
one of the most effective whitening
toothpastes there is you would use it
morning and night and I feel like that
alone over time will give you a really
good results in terms of more white
excuse me in terms of whiter teeth I've
also tried the brush on white nurse it's
like a little tube it looks is about the
size of a nail polish tube and or a
bottle and you just brush it on
sometimes before you go to bed and then
you would sleep and that stuff tastes
awful and not only that but it did not
work for me at all I don't know some of
you probably tried it maybe it's just
worth wonders for you but what I tried
you like brush it on your teeth and go
to bed and sleep on it and I never
really saw great results from that I saw
better results honestly just from using
a whitening toothpaste consistently I've
also tried crest white strips and that
was the most dramatic and I'm talking
the original version and that was the
most dramatic whitening effect I had
seen because the white strips just I
mean over the course of just a few days
you do notice a difference the thing I
didn't like about white strips original
was because I I could really taste the
whitening formula that was on those
strips so it was kind of an unpleasant
experience especially because you're
supposed to wear those for like a half
hour at a time and as you get more
towards the end of the half hour it's
like you they start getting goopy
they're like falling off coming off your
teeth before they're really supposed to
so you're probably not getting the full
benefit there and that brings me to the
crest advanced seal because these are
truly the best whitening product I've
used and you may be wondering well who
really is this for who would be a good
candidate to use a product like this and
I think it's somebody that wants a
fairly drastic whitening process in a
short amount of time and these costs
around like a walgreens they ran around
forty dollars so or just a little less
so you may be able to find a deal or
some kind of coupon or something like
that for these if maybe you searched
online to take down the price a bit but
when you think about it this is
something you get 14 pouches and after
only three you're going to see results
and I thought that myself that like
after I'd used about three times was
like wow I really notice a result and
that is what it says on the box start
seeing results after three days so um
part of the reason why I think these are
so good is because they stay on so much
better and that's what these are known
to do what you get is one no I have to
keep clearing my throat today but you
get one of these and in this is both
your upper and your lower strip I don't
know if you can see but the upper strip
looks kind of like this and this is the
lower strip here and they bond to your
teeth so much better than anything else
you don't feel any goo penis you could
definitely wear these doing lots of
different things like it says on the
back it says crest whitestrips advanced
seal molds and adheres to your teeth so
easily that it fits your smile and your
life you can even drink water while
wearing crest whitestrips advanced seal
which i tried and you can they won't go
anywhere honestly you might get a little
bit of a taste in your mouth but it's
very minor compared to the regular white
strips and also they just they don't
start to come off until you're ready to
take them off like after the 30 minutes
you actually have to peel them from your
teeth and because they're not starting
to fall off whatsoever you don't get any
goop
this in your mouth as far as teeth
sensitivity that was my concern before
ever using light strokes because I knew
I had sensitive teeth that were kind of
like sensitive to temperature so I was a
little worried that maybe they would be
sensitive to the white strips too and I
had like one tooth that was a little bit
that way like it had just a little bit
of sensitivity um probably the first two
times i used the strips and since then i
haven't noticed any problems i've also
had a dentist appointment since then and
haven't you know had any issues there
that i had some dental work done and
there wasn't any problem with that so
the health of my teeth I don't feel like
has been compromised through using these
white strips at all it's just very easy
application they stay on well you use
them just once a day and I just think
it's a really really effective way to
get whiter teeth like I said maybe you
got some sort of photo shoot or a
wedding or a big event coming up in your
life and you just want your teeth to
look white and that's what these can
truly do in a short amount of time three
days you're going to definitely see
results past that is just going to
continue and you may think well forty
dollars then what happens you know after
you run out of your box of white strips
where do you go from there and i would
suggest just like what I plan to do is I
may purchase these again down the road
but i'm going to use like a whitening
toothpaste like crest vivid white is my
favorite and i'll use that day and night
and it really will I think keep this up
fairly well so um anyway that's that's
your options guys I'm not saying you
after you have to run out and get these
if you want a whiter smile but if you
want one quickly and very effectively
it's definitely the easiest way to go so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video um I hope you guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
