my bathroom right now just sticking some
rollers in and you know what I have a
tip to pass along to you in terms of
keeping your hair curly in the
summertime when it's lots of like high
humidity and heat and everything you
might have that curl resistant hair the
key is in your curling iron I have just
recently figured this out and it just
totally is a trick that works typically
I would use to curl my hair one like
this this is the Revlon like one inch
barrel curling iron and it works great
however I am one of those people that
has the fine hair that doesn't like to
really stay curled and especially when
it's summertime and it's high heat and
humidity so I mean naturally you go for
a smaller curling iron that gives you a
tighter curl it really does make a
difference because you think you might
think like oh I don't want this is a
three-quarter inch and it's available
for like $10 at at Walmart and it's so
it's not that much of an investment but
you'd get a tighter curl and obviously
all curls are going to fade somewhat but
when that tighter curl fades it doesn't
fade this quickly and you continue to
have like a decent amount of curl to
your hair so I really like that
now one other key here you'll notice
like I am using rollers that are like
this size in my hair and I am using a
curling iron that is this size see the
difference this is a lot bigger and some
of these rollers I use are even bigger
than that and you might think well
what's we know what's gonna happen when
you use that small curling iron well
you're going to even if you use a larger
roller to get more lift from your roots
even though the fact that you're using
that smaller curling iron is still going
to put a little more punch into that
curl so I'm you know basically what's
gonna happen is when I take this out and
have my finished style I am going to
have curls that want to curl a little
bit more they've got a little more power
behind them I guess you'd say because
they've been wrapped around this tighter
curling iron so despite the fact that
this is a bigger roller you're still
gonna wind up with a curl that is a
little more curly I'm just and the
reason why you might think well why
don't you just use a small little thing
to set that curl in well using a bigger
one gives you more lift from the roots
okay see how much lift I'm getting here
now that it's gonna remain that high you
know once I take this roller out but
it's gonna give me more lift so yeah I
just really wanted to pass that tip
along to you guys and I will show you
how the look turns alright guys I just
took the rollers out and as you can see
I've got like I just literally took them
out brushed right through my hair and
I've got these nice kind of bouncy curls
going on and even if those curls you
know died down somewhat did the humidity
outside I'm still going to wind up with
a decent amount of curl because of that
tighter curling iron and like I said
just putting it around bigger rollers
allows you to get some lift from the
roots like you're seeing there but you
can go on in style as however you want
to with some more hairspray I'll
probably give it a few spritzes of spray
before I leave the house and that kind
of thing but if you want to know more
about how I put in the rollers and kind
of what the configuration is and the
sizes and stuff like that I will put a
link in the sidebar to my how to use
velcro rollers video so that might sort
some things out there but just yeah keep
in mind that downgrading to a smaller
curling iron than what you're used to
for me it was going from a one-inch to a
three-quarter for you it might be you
know something even larger than this but
you are definitely going to see a
difference in how long those curls last
because they're just I mean they're
being wound tighter so even if you put
them over bigger rollers it makes it
really really wearable I think so thanks
guys so much for tuning in for this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
