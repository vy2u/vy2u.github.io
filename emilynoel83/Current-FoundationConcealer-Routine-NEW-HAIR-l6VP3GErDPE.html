hair I got a haircut over the weekend
and I'm really really happy with it
it's so short it's so much shorter than
what I've been used to for years and
years now like I have had a haircut even
a little bit shorter than this but it
was back in high school so yeah I'm
feeling some differences right now but I
love it so light my hair is naturally
just very fine and straight and I feel
like when I do something with this
length of hair it actually like responds
it actually goes with it you know what I
mean my mom is a former hairstylist and
she's always cut my hair and so she was
down this past weekend and I mean I knew
I needed a haircut like just generally
speaking I needed to trim because my
ends were so bad and then we really
started talking the night before and I
was like you know what I really want is
the look that Carrie Underwood had I
think during the CMAs when she was
singing with Sam hunt and you know that
look that's kind of the look I really
deep down what and I've wanted this look
on and off for a long time but haven't
taken the plunge and for whatever reason
now was just like I had this feeling
let's go for it I feel like I'm still
totally getting used to styling it and
knowing what to do with it like you know
I give it a gentle turn under I used a
really really big curling iron and just
gave it like a gentle sort of you know
I'm not really sure what my daily
routine will become you know with this
hairdo but it really doesn't require a
lot that's for sure like I feel like I
spent two minutes with this but it's
gonna be so fun to like maybe try some
waves in it from time to time pin a
little bit of it back do different
things but it was so funny I went to
gymnastics with Belle last night and you
know I had this hair obviously and I was
like instinctively taking my hand around
the back of my neck and pulling hair
around my shoulder like to get it out of
the way there's no hair there it's all
just right up here but I get like you
know swooping around like there was
something to pull around we went for it
like a blunt cut for the overall like
longest part of this is blunt and then
it's layered up just a little bit from
there I would say like this much maybe
up to the bottom of my ear my mom will
correct me if I was wrong on that and
doing that I mean you can kind of see
the ends when I pull them out but my
hair is so so dark maybe you can't see
them otherwise but that just kind of
shaped the look it gives it the look of
a lot of chunky thickness you know but
don't judge me too hard on the styling I
really don't know what I'm doing that
much with this short hair but I
mentioned I was wanting this kind of a
look for quite some time the thing that
kept me from doing it I think was my
knowledge of how easy it is to take my
long hair and clip it up in a bun or a
ponytail and I do that a lot and it's
very easy it's very no brainer I like
the way my hair looks in buns and
ponytails and I knew that if I went
short that would be the thing that I
gave up but then I have to ask myself if
I'm liking it really only in buns and
ponytails and not really getting that
excited about my hair when it's just
down and actually styled how it would
normally be if that's the way I'm
feeling inside maybe it is time to just
go ahead and chop it off but yay hair
cut okay moving on I wanted to talk
about a few little things in my
concealer routine really was the key
thing that I wanted to talk about in
this video but I ended up showing you my
foundation application as well but just
some products I've been playing with a
lot lately and really liking the effects
I've been getting I feel like I have a
couple of obstacles with my skin right
now not major things but number one
would be a little bit of dry skin so I
feel like these products are really good
for that and also I've had really
irritated kind of itchy eyes lately I
think it might be an allergy related
problem but I'm always like touching
this area or touching my eyes I feel
like my concealer technique really takes
care of me for both needs involving
dryness and staying power and brightness
in my caverns my innermost corners right
there so I will just go ahead and talk
you through the whole routine all right
so I've already moisturized and put on
eye cream I put on a primer as well I'm
trying out this Mally perfect prep
neutralizing primer actually really good
stuff I've used it a few times and it's
got like kind of a skin tone color to it
it's not attempting to be a foundation
at all has a really nice smoothness and
I feel like it actually might be evening
a few things out when I use that for
foundation I
have been you know using my dream matte
mousse a lot I think I talked about that
in my favorites video I really like the
finish of that and especially like the
application when I'm using a Beauty
Blender but I've also just recently come
back to my Rimmel lasting finish like
one of the longest standing favorite
foundations ever that I've ever used and
I wear this in the shade soft beige it
says skin perfecting full coverage
foundation really love this stuff this
doesn't make me think full coverage like
my Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
cover or the Urban Decay all nighter but
I mean it is really good coverage and
it's incredibly natural-looking on the
skin especially when you use the Beauty
Blender so I've kind of been bouncing
back and forth a little bit with this a
little bit with the dream matte mousse
the one thing I really resent about this
foundation is that they took it from
being in a squeezy tube a few years back
and now they put it in this glass jar
why but it's seriously one of the most
affordable foundations you could come up
with like I think it's right around five
dollars six dollars maybe so many
drugstore foundations are getting to be
like 12 13 15 bucks maybe
but sometimes what drives me to you know
pick up a different foundation is just
like oh I haven't used that one in a
while or it's the shade happens to be
dead on this shade really is it for me
right now it's really working and then
I'm just taking my Beauty Blender you
could use any blender type sponge I
truly rotate these a lot so I've got my
Real Techniques sponge I've got just you
know a couple random ones that you've
probably seen me use here or there and
just dab that product right in
and not to bury the lead on this
foundation but the staying power is
amazing with it I have never had
complaints about the way this lasts
throughout the day
so anyway using the Beauty Blender I
think just gives it the most natural
look on the skin and then lately I've
been pulling for my honest hacia
concealer this is such a creamy
concealer fantastic coverage it's in the
shade 2.5 for me right now mentioned in
my favorites video how I'll probably be
going to a lighter shade very soon in
this product but it is so so creamy and
it reminds me of the texture of Benefit
erase paste which that's a great product
but that's going to give you that peachy
tone corrector type vibe and that's a
much loved product for me but sometimes
I like to experiment you know with other
things and this concealer just could go
all over the skin for any need and I
personally like to take it right in this
zone because this can be kind of a
problem area for me like right on top of
the cheeks is where I've got a little
like remaining discoloration you'll
notice I'm not hitting my cavern right
now with this product that's going to
come that'll happen
but I love really the way this looks
once it's all blended in it just looks
so undetectable like doesn't look makeup
E or dry and I've got borderline dry
feeling skin right now and I'm just
going to put a lower bar on my nose and
then right after I put that on I've got
this Kat Von D locket concealer and I
have it in the shade l11 neutral and
it's honestly like pretty light when
I've worn this full on like all over
this area it just seems too light and I
thought that's a shame I still want to
keep using it and now I've kind of
realized my purpose I've got this
concealer that's like a total skin tone
match that I've used over a large
portion of my skin and then I'll put
this in my deepest darkest area and
there are a couple of reasons why I like
to do this number one its brightening
because it is so full coverage and light
but number two it lasts really well
along with my lovely little dry skin
that I'm dealing
with from time to time I also have had
like some I think allergy driven eye
irritation and it causes me to you know
mess with my eyes more put my finger on
it right I'm in here and want to rub a
little bit and I've seen other concealer
products I've used kind of rub away as a
result of all the touching dirt and so
maybe I shouldn't do that but if I can
find a product that can still withstand
it I'll go with that
I still love using my heart-shaped tape
the shade I have and that is a little
deeper than this it's light medium and I
can really use that in an all-over you
know anywhere I would possibly need it
on the skin type of sense but this is
just for whatever reasons kind of the
routine I've fallen into lately so
anyways take this and as you can see I'm
not concerned at all about that ah
Nastasia concealer like setting on me
because it just it won't but it's so
creamy it's just going to sit there and
then I've got my little like Real
Techniques mini sponge you could pull in
the Beauty Blender just the regular one
again if you wanted to but I find this
just hits my innermost corner a little
bit better and so that's exactly what
I'm doing right on the side of my nose I
bet a lot of this depends on like how
deep set or your eyes you know how
what's the contrast created there with
your nose as to how deep and dark you
get right in that corner but as I've
gotten older I think I've gotten a
little darker there
so there I go I feel like my eyes are
brightened up so much the whole finish
of my skin looks really nice and natural
sometimes I might bake my under eye
concealer with a loose powder I bounce
around with a lot of different ones I
think the airspun loose powder is nice
when you want to add coverage to it or
lately super handy product that I've got
here is my little Janice a quoi it
cosmetics palette and there's this
really nice what's it called the bye bye
pores pressed it's like a translucent
powder and I just pick some of that up
with my ELF small tapered brush and just
do a little dabbing right over this area
and then I feel like the anastacio this
is primarily for the anastacio because I
don't really think I'd even need to set
the Kat Von D because it dries down so
fully but I had put a very emollient
product there and I can set it and it
won't start looking dry on me at all and
then I can just dab that powder you know
wherever I think I might possibly need
it like on the t-zone but like I said
oil hasn't been my biggest concern
lately so I'm not gonna do too much
powdering and then do you want to stay
with me here you want to see a little
bit more going on why not let's keep
going keep using this palette I've got
this sunshine and a compact down here
this is it cosmetics
I guess key bronzer from their line and
I'm just going to dab that around my
hairline a bit it is amazing how on a
haircut short hair changes your
perspective on makeup like it instantly
um after getting my haircut I thought I
feel like I've seen my eyes more I feel
like I'm seeing my lips more like what
is it about that it like it shifts your
focus on your face I don't know it's
maybe your face isn't competing with
your hair so much for attention I don't
know I have no idea honestly maybe when
the hair is shorter it's just bringing
the eye up here as opposed to up here
and down and up you know what I mean no
you probably don't know what I mean
because I'm not even sure what I mean by
that I haven't even had a drink of my
coffee yet I picked up
a small size of some of that coffee mate
it's what's it called hot cocoa and
marshmallows creamer whoo good stuff
that's a creamer we're like I put that
in and I really notice it I can tell the
flavor it's it's bring it on and it's
good it's ours cheekbones I'm going to
put a teeny bit of this down there I'm
not going to do like full on mega
contour that'll be sufficient and then
I'm going to do the blush that's in here
which is the bye bye pours blush in
genesee quoi oh are you catching a
glimpse of anything there in the mirror
yeah those are my awesome Halloween PJs
anyway the blush I think all of these
products are things that you could buy
on their own form it cosmetics which is
cool the only thing I already had from
this little palette was the bronzer oh
do I feel fresh as a daisy or what with
this blush on mm-hmm mm-hmm
that's an interesting color because I
don't know that a lot of people might
even choose that shade for themselves
you know like seeing the brightness of
the pink but that can be one of the
freshest colors on absolutely anybody
because it's just so like it just gives
life it gives youthfulness and then you
know it we're going four for four and
here we're using the highlight this
highlight as you can see it's it's side
by side with like a purely white powder
up there but this is not a dark
highlight by any means it's kind of just
a soft champagne maybe a hint of peach
in this highlight but it's called the
perfect lighting Luminizer in genesee
quoi
I'm picking up some of that with the
trusty up-and-up highlight brush whoa
well I got just a bit of highlight there
didn't I seems like something mrs. Potts
would say on Beauty and the Beast
yeah we've been watching some beauty in
the Beast lately it's now available on
Apple TV well enjoys that she will
repeat certain lines that she hears in
it but the one I'm really working with
her on is where mrs. Potts sets off to
the coven now with you chip I really
want to hear her say in that accent and
k going to do a little bit here mm-hmm
after that I'm using like the remaining
little bit of my hard candy Shiren be
hydrating primer mist three sprays will
do it perfectly and that is my face
makeup so here is the finished face I'll
let you know what I put on my eyes and
lips I use my Jordana powder eyeshadow
in the shade plumberry the bull yo plum
believable I have several of these
palettes and I think I want to do a
review on them because there are certain
things I really like about them and then
a couple key things that I don't so I
kind of want to sort that all out in its
own video but I used like the darkest
shades the black and the plum or
burgandy it's kind of like a dark
burgundy on the outer corner I really
tried with this shade on my lid and I
got so much fallout like I look like if
you look at me really close-up it's as
if I've applied a glittery highlight to
my cheekbones from all the fallout I got
from that shade so boo on my lips I just
wanted to go bright so I reached for one
of my two-faced LeMat lipsticks I think
that's what they're called LeMat and
this is in the shade called pitch
perfect so it's kind of like a I don't
know a bright pink but with a little bit
of purple orchid mixed in so that is all
for now thank you guys so much for
watching thank you for all the sweet
feedback on the hair that you've given
me already on Instagram and stuff that
was really really nice I really
appreciate all the time you take out of
your day with me it means so much and I
will see you guys again in my next video
