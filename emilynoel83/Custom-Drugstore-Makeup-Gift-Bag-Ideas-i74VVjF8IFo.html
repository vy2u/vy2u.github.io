drugstore makeup gift bag video and if
you've watched this last year around
this time you know I just kind of found
a cute little gift bag and I filled it
with a bunch of different drugstore
products that I would definitely
recommend so if you were to just throw
something together for a friend or your
mom or somebody you would kind of have
some ideas of what some good things were
this year I wanted to take things up a
notch and do things a little bit
differently so I've actually got not one
but three different drugstore makeup
gift bags to tell you about and each one
kind of has a little different purpose
behind it and each one has its own price
range so I've got my smokey eye kit for
right around $15 my gorgeous glow kit
for like glowing skin and this one is
going to be right around 20 to 25
dollars and then I've got my classic
glamour kit and this one is going to be
around 30 to 35 dollars and those are
all kind of estimates on the price
because I'd go with what I can find and
what I recall paying for these things
but it varies from drugstore to
drugstore and what kind of deal you can
sometimes get so just keep that in mind
and the price of the little bags are not
included because you could really do
whatever you wanted to do with that you
could find some very inexpensive little
gift bags or you could go with something
a little more expensive and really put
your money into that bag so that's
totally up to you another idea I had for
these was to make your own little likes
a note card or you could print something
off with a computer that has like little
instructions for exactly how to use the
things you put in here so that way they
have some direction plus it makes it an
even more personal gift
smokey-eye kids I actually have this in
a little Nally bag that I got some
products in so a really cute little bag
and it fits the products in here very
well this is actually just three
products three drugstore products to get
a great smokey eye and the first one is
one of my favorite favorite trios from
wet and wild and it's called the silent
treatment
oops it is just a wonderful trio where
you can get like that great natural look
that you've also got a wonderfully
pigmented deep smoky shade kind of a
peach and a metallic taupe so I love
those and that's just like three dollars
in there then I also highly recommend
these slide-on pencils from NYX because
they're so creamy and you have a little
period of time where you can smudge them
out which makes for a great smoky eye
right around the lashline and mascara
that I'm just loving so much right now
is from Almay and it is called get up
and grow and I got to show you the brush
on this one's not not too wet not too
dry but it's a great size brush there
too so throw that all in your bag and
then you toss in like a few q-tips or
some little sponge tip applicator it's
just in case they don't have any brushes
to work with because you can definitely
get a great smudgy sexy smoky eye just
by you know smudging some q-tips and
making it really simple
these are handmade little bags and I
love the cupcake design I got like the
two different shapes this is the larger
one and then this smaller second kit is
my gorgeous glow kit so this is around
20 to 25 dollars for everything in here
we're getting into products to be used
on the skin I still think these are
shades that would work for a whole lot
of people and the first thing is just a
classic bronzer that I totally love and
everything that I'm recommending in here
are things that I really really like but
this one is NYC smooth skin bronzer as
you can see I've hit pan I repurchase
this many a time but this is a great
matte bronzer so it can be used for your
contouring or it can be used just to
perk up your skin tone shade is just
like a total current favorite of mine
it's the Milani baked blush in berry and
more and this shade is like the most
beautiful pink kind of moggy pink
swirled with gold it's just beautiful on
the cheeks as you can see you know it's
got that golden tone to it makes it very
very wearable and it just gives you that
nice glow that's why I thought it was
perfect for this kit and to put on both
of those products really a great little
travel kabuki brush from Ecotools this
is the recycled aluminum kabuki brush
and it is just SuperDuper soft and plus
it's totally protect I wrote a whole
blog about that if you want to learn
more but I think that's a great another
fun little finishing touch face product
that I've discovered recently is from
ELF and it's the radiance enhancer and
this shade is called spot light this is
actually kind of a light pinky tone and
I wouldn't even venture to call it
shimmery it's almost just like a pearl
effect and it clicks right up through
the little brush tip there and I'll show
you kind of what it looks like so in a
real concentrated way it looks like that
but I would put some on my hand maybe
taps him on my finger and then you can
make this like a nice little highlight
right here on your cheek bone or you
could highlight the Cupid's bow really
nicely with that finally just a really
nice natural looking glowing lip it's
the Baby Lips in peach kits and this is
what I'm wearing right now so it's just
just such a natural light tinted lip
balm type Lurie ease
to apply and I picturing this with those
warm tones in the blush and the bronzer
a little bit of highlight and it's just
going to be a great glowing big kiss so
this would be kind of like the deluxe
gift for a great friend or a family
member and I'm calling this a classic
glamour kit because it's really a bag of
essentials but it's the things that you
would need to get a really glamorous
beautiful initial notice in these I
haven't included concealers and
foundations and things like that because
I just think it's kind of complicated to
try to buy those things for yourself let
alone buy them for someone else so these
are like the color cosmetics you would
wear on top and the first thing I want
to mention is the elf contouring blush
and bronzer I love this product I think
this is a great way to have your blush
but also to have that product that can
contour your cheeks and contour your
chin or wherever it's just very easy to
use you get a lot of product you get a
great mirror here and that's a $3 thing
you can find at Target I also wanted to
throw in a blush that had a little bit
more of a rosy tone so again you could
get that kind of glamorous look and I
think this is such a great like
wintertime blush because it gives just
in a very light application a really
pretty rosy glow and it's the elf blush
in blushing Rose that little golden
shimmer but it's just a really nice rosy
color you would never wear it that
concentrated sheer doubt on your cheeks
it's just so pretty I wanted to throw in
a couple of kind of go-to eyes shadow
trios that I think are great quality and
that can work in a lot of different
circumstances they can give you the
glamorous look they can give you the
natural look and one is this trio from
wet-and-wild called walking on eggshells
you guys have heard me probably talk
about this or use this before but this
is a classic natural look right here
they're all really rich pigmented colors
I've compared these as all three of
these as dupes two different matte
colors that I had I think you want a
basic look that could give you something
more dramatic more smoky and that is the
trio and don't steal my thunder
both of these are part of the regular
wet and wild blind
shouldn't have any trouble finding these
where wet-and-wild products are sold but
again that's gonna be your white your
silver in your charcoal I can throw in a
great eyeliner for this kit and I like
this one just like I like the NYX one I
mentioned before this is an automatic
one though and it's Maybelline master
drama so just a great classic black long
wearing eyeliner
these are this one and the next one you
know you put them on you let them set
and then they don't smudge you know you
can run your hand right across them they
don't go anywhere a great one-dollar
eyelash curler this remains my favorite
eyelash curler this one from ELF so you
can find that at Target for a dollar as
well or you've heard me mention a lot of
elf stuff it's all at eyes lips face
com2 a mascara that I think gives you a
great glamorous look it is the L'Oreal
double extend carbon black so one end is
your primer one end is your rich dark
black top coat and I feel like I've
compared this in terms of the way it
looks and the great length it gives to
benefits they're real mascara so I know
that's a real popular one but this can
give you that very similar look from a
drugstore mascara one thing I love to do
before I really get a great lip on is to
put on some sort of lip balm first and
AOS is kind of like a great little lip
primer these aren't overly greasy lip
balms but they're very moisturizing and
they really kind of primed the lips for
what's to come
so this one is I believe the strawberry
sorbet but they have tons that smell
great there's a great mint one a lemon
one I've talked about these a lot but
how fun would that be to just for
someone to be like oh I've never seen
this before you know they may not be the
makeup junkie that you are the recipient
of this gift so they might really see
that and think that's awesome a lip
liner that I think would be great in a
kit like this is the wet and wild
Brandywine that's again the 666 I
mentioned that in my rediscovered video
just here lately but it's a great lip
liner that works for your red looks your
mid-tone kind of lip looks and even to
make a new little
more rare that's only a dollar and so is
this lipstick from NYC had to put in a
great red lipstick because what better
way to kind of say to someone hey it's
okay to experiment with that great red
lip because I think NYC's lipstick and
sheer red is one of the best Reds out
there I absolutely love this one it's so
inexpensive
so many people have tried this and said
I didn't think I could wear red lipstick
and then I tried sheer red and it was
just great so it's very creamy it's very
easy to wear and I think it looks good
on a lot of different skin tones well
that wraps up my drugstore makeup gift
bag video this was kind of a triple
edition of things here because I wanted
to make sure you guys had options in
terms of price ranges in terms of
products and definitely make these your
own if you just kind of get a hint from
what I'm telling you here go and run
with your own ideas and your own
products that you love but this might
just be a good way to get started so
thanks so much for watching I'm glad
you've enjoyed all of the gift related
videos I've done I do have a 2011
holiday gift guide video with some
larger gifts in that and I have a
stocking stuffer video too so thanks
again guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
