tuning in for this video this is going
to be a little hole I actually ordered
this stuff back on Cyber Monday when elf
the website Islip space.com was having a
half off sale I believe everything I got
was half off so I got some really good
deals and it was a good opportunity to
try some different things I literally
got the order in yesterday so there's
been a couple of these things that I've
tried this morning when I was getting
ready but not everything so this is just
gonna be a haul not really a bunch of
reviews but also I feel like I honestly
feel so weird doing this video because I
have been it almost feels like I've been
out in the wild in a sense I was
shooting a story today for the news and
this woman she is amazing she works at a
wildlife rehabilitation facility she's
actually the owner she runs the show and
I saw Cougars and bobcats and you know
Bald Eagles and vultures and owls and
squirrels and just everything like she
rehabs these animals so they can get
back into the wild so it was just so
cool to get to see a lot of animals you
don't normally see right up close so
I'll have to post a link to that story
on Facebook once it airs tomorrow gonna
try to get through this as quickly as
possible because I have a lot of things
that I got um I got the body shimmer
which was kind of a new studio product
and a lot of these things are studio
products that I saw on was just kind of
intrigued by this shade is called mystic
moonlight it looks like a mini deodorant
only here's the shimmer so it's just
kind of a light pearly shimmery color
but I just thought you know if that if
this works if this isn't too glittery it
could be a nice highlight on some
different points in the face and you get
a whole lot of product got a cream
eyeshadow this shade is Dawn and once
again much like their lip glosses or
their lip balms and their blushes
there's a ton of packaging around I
actually use this as a base for the look
that I have on today but it's just kind
of a definitely gray grayish
nope neutrals the flawless finish
foundation it says SPF 15 oil-free the
shade I got was buff I mean it looked
perfect on the website but I just you
know pumped out a little bit on my hand
the other day I'm like oh I think it's
gonna be too dark it may even be too
dark for me like in the summer months
but it might be something I mix or do
you know make it work somehow but I have
to say this has got to be some of the
most high-end type packaging I've seen
on an elf product first off you got the
cap there little detail this is actual
glass here it's like kind of a frosted
matte glass and then it has a pump so
I'm very pleased with the way the
packaging is and it also doesn't look
like from here you can tell there's not
a lot of excess packaging but it's just
really well done packaged better than a
lot of typical drugstore foundation one
of the $1.00 eyeprimer 's because the
only primer I've tried from ELF is the
mineral eye primer which I thought was
pretty good but I wanted to see if the
one dollar one could be as good or
better so it just looks like this it
looks like a typical eye primer type
product you know it just kind of goes
blends into nothingness I also love the
elf Studio blushes I mean I have been
super impressed with the pigmentation of
them I have a matte bright pink one I
think it's called pink passion that I
loves takes a little tap of the brush to
get some color but this one that I
picked up is actually the highlight it's
called got a glue it's kind of like one
of those candle light type highlights if
that makes sense that's sometimes how
these are some described these slightly
golden tone highlights and I just
thought you know that might be kind of
pretty I used a little bit today again I
feel like I've been outdoors all morning
long so I'm not sure how all this is
holding up but this all was very
intrigued by the wrinkle refiner this
product I I didn't use it today because
I really I didn't want to use it on a
day that I was on air for fear of hell I
didn't know how my skin was gonna react
to it or how it was going to actually do
but just using it on my hand it's kind
of like a creamy product and you blend
it in and it's the most unusual texture
totally like mattifies the area and
smoothes it it's really interesting so I
am totally intrigued to see how that
works under foundation and things like
that just fruit you know little fine
lines here and there that come up I got
the exact lash mascara this is a studio
product and guys get a load of the size
of this brush I'm like really it's so
tiny look at that I didn't use this
today because I wasn't sure if it would
smudge and again I didn't want to test
it on an on-air day but this is gonna
make my Maybelline lash discovery look
like a giant half the size of my lash
discovery one and a couple of pallets to
share I have been getting questions
about the 24 karat line of elf stuff
kind of supposed to be I guess a more
luxurious line of elf cosmetics and so I
got this little palette here and it's
got this kind of puffy feel here for
lack of a better word on top of the
palette but it came and it had little
smudges on it actually and it has kind
of a line right down this so it sort of
looks kind of cheap and then on the
inside it's got this instead of being
plastic it's like this puffy pallet base
here that just I don't really like it
because it tends to grab any product and
get smudges around on it it's kind of a
rainbow type color palette here I mean
you are getting some neutrals but you're
also getting like blue yellow green
purple red that sort of thing so again I
haven't used this yet so beyond just
some preliminary swatching I can't tell
you much about it other than the fact
that they don't seem initially too
different from some other elf palettes
I've tried like the little I think it's
32 color palette or something like that
another thing I thought was really cool
are these little individual palettes
here like they're little strips of ten
eye shadows two lip colors and a blush
you can get one of these or you can
actually get like three of these which
is what I did and you can put it in this
container here so as you can see I've
got another set of colors
they kind of pop in they snap in
actually and then there's a little space
back there where you can push it through
so it holds them and then the third
section of this is actually a compact
that you can take out and then this can
be your portable one so this is what I
use today I actually use these eye
colors I got a kind of a combination of
these two lips and I actually lightly
use that blush today too so anyway it's
I'm kind of happy with the quality of
this actually but this pops out of this
little container and then you can put
any one in here to be sort of your
travel set it has a nice little mirror
there as well and then it fits in and
you got it all kind of to go like this
so this is an interesting concept
if you're wondering quality wise what
these shadows are like they kind of
remind me of you know like these pallets
these little 32 counts are like the elf
100 pallet kind of hit-and-miss you know
not every shadow is going to be amazing
some are gonna be really great and not
every one of them is gonna be awesomely
pigmented some are gonna have a little
fallout here and they do like the
configuration of the kotas most natural
neutral looking one is called day on the
beach that's that one
this one's called Tuscany retreat so
this has sort of a few little jewel
tones here and there and kind of a
darker lip and then the one in this
little palette that I showed you is
night on the town I believe so that's
kind of classic smokey eye type colors I
hope you enjoyed seeing you know what I
ended up with and I'll definitely be
trying some of these things out giving
you some reviews on them in the near
future you may see them in videos you
may see them on my blog which is beauty
broadcast net so and also thank you so
much for the great response to the
college girl beauty video you guys have
given me so many great ideas for this
series so I'm super excited about that
so thanks again for watching everyone I
hope you have a great day and I'll see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
