today's video we're going to talk about
getting the most flawless corrected
under-eye area with just a few drugstore
products including a couple of things
that I've been trying now Walmart sneaky
when you see new products there they
don't always have them in like some
special display it'll usually be just
like stuck in with the existing brands
products so I was really surprised when
I came across these True Match
correctors so I have the ones in peach
and bisque and they had a whole range of
other shades too or darker skin tones in
terms of under eyes and spots they've
got even an orange a true orange shade
and there are some other good corrective
products out there I mean in a recent
video I just used that Milani little
quad that has a corrector in some other
shades but even for the drugstore that's
can be a little on the pricey side and
to get the corrector shade not everybody
wants to necessarily have the palette of
everything else
so when I was realizing how well this
worked for me I was like this is a great
easy throw it on just corrector under
$10 I think I might have bought it for
seven or eight dollars it's thin yet it
has coverage yet it's also not drying so
very pleased with the affected in this
video what I'm gonna show you it's a
little cocktail of products that I use
to get a really flawless drugstore
under-eye that actually stays looking
fresh and flawless throughout the day so
I would say the three steps are correct
brighten and bake out that you have to
do all three of those things but that's
just the process I'm gonna take you
through and you can pick and choose you
know what you want to take from it but
you guys know how I feel about my erase
paste or my boying brightening concealer
I think that does a fabulous job I still
think that does a great job I am always
on the hunt for something from the
drugstore that can do that same kind of
task so enough talk about it let's just
show you how it works
all right guys bear with me I'm still
getting my voice a little warmed up this
morning I've just really had a bad cough
here lately fortunately that usually
signals the end of a cold for me so yay
for that but the shade you're gonna see
me really demoing here is the True Match
super blendable correcting concealer in
Peach and this is the one here toward
fair to light skin tones
although the bisque for light to medium
I can make that work as well and even
more pinpointed areas so I've got my
foundation on already this is the NARS
radiant long wear foundation that I have
and that
have a decent bit of coverage but as I
turn my head right here you can really
see the area that I'm planning to tackle
in terms of the dark circle so I'm just
gonna take the peach and really work
that in here on the innermost corner of
the eye and then traveling down just on
top of where I have the circle I'm not
looking to go like far beyond that or
make a big huge path of this product
just because I have another thing that
really takes over for the brightening
and I think looks really good on the
skin it's also very lightweight so I've
got that on there and then I'm just
gonna take this p80 brush from Sigma
anything that just makes you feel like
you've got a lot of control and are able
to blend something out without
completely blending it away on your skin
you know sometimes I feel like when I
blend with my finger I can overdo the
blending a bit
then after I get done with that I just
gently kind of tap over it with my
finger just to ensure there's not too
much product on there I kind of tap that
little line that little crease that's
under our eye and I can pick up any
excess but what I like about this
product is that it's lightweight yet
it's not drying on this area a lot of
corrector products some people would
complain that like it's too thick or
it's just too big of a layer or whatever
and these I feel are really great for
being a lightweight yet non-drying stick
and as I turn my head here I mean I can
notice a huge difference in the dark
circle that was there before
so now you've color corrected and you
could be done here but if you want an
extra brightening step here's what I
like to add in I've been using this
Maybelline age rewind in the brightener
shades so it's a little bit pinky it's
just there sort of I wouldn't call it
like illuminating but it's just the tone
of this is very brightening on my skin
tone and this is what I'm gonna dab on
all over from the top of the cheek way
up into here like the true matchstick
this is very thin it does not feel heavy
on the skin I mean this products been
around for a while and has a massive
following this and also these skin tone
shades that are in this line managed to
wear really well on me and I like using
this brightener even elsewhere on my
skin to just sort of perk up you know
the areas that I want to bring forward
then I'll just sort of dab over this
with a larger brush you could also use a
Beauty Blender here just whatever you
like
this is my Real Techniques expert face
brush which by the way this mini size is
on mega clearance we're talking like $1
and change on targets website so that's
awesome
okay so now here we are incredibly
brighten the skin feels so alive right
now and the last step that I'm going to
throw in here has actually been giving
me amazing wear with this look I feel
like it makes the under eye look so so
flawless and I think given that my
concealers haven't been too thick or too
heavy this just really works well so I'm
using the Maybelline fit me in fair I'm
just going to tap some product into the
lid here and this is my sponge from NYX
I'm just gonna pick some up there on the
flat side I also like using my Real
Techniques brush for this kind of a step
and I'm gonna dab that powder right over
especially where that circle was and
just carry it up too so basically
everywhere that the brightener went if
you're anti baking I mean there's so
many options you could not use powder at
all you could do a light just dusting of
powder if you just want to really take
away any kind of creamy texture but
you're definitely not like overly tacky
after those last couple steps that I did
so I always like to take advantage of my
time while my concealers baking so I'm
going to go ahead and do my brows and
then come back we'll dust away some of
this powder and see what we're left with
got my brows on this is my ELF small
tapered brush and I'm just going to do
some kind of sweeping motions here over
the under eye and eye I don't know if
it's showing on camera but I can see the
powder kind of like a dusting away
and nope there's no more circles there
anymore there's no more darkness not
even a trace really and we've totally
achieved the look by using a very
affordable just stick concealer that
happens to be in a really good tone now
for the deepest skin tones they do make
a real orange corrector stick and in the
middle they've got this bisque shade now
the bisque for me I even find that I can
layer it on top of the peach and still
get a really corrected look that way
although there's not really any point in
using the two products but where I think
I would actually use the bisque I think
this would have been a perfect shade to
correct melasma spots so that very dark
kind of sunspot looking discoloration
that I had for a time kind of right here
on top of my cheeks in a slight depth of
color and this tone I think would be
perfect for something like that so a
couple of really workable shades again
depending on the amount of coverage and
brightness that you like you can stop at
any point in the process but I do really
like that age rewind brightener just to
really like shook bring everything to
life and then setting it with the fit me
everything is so smooth and soft and it
wears really really nicely so what I
will go ahead and do with my look is
finish up by bronzing blush I am lip of
course I'll do a little setting spray so
the finished look here just showing you
how it all comes together you know
really brightened flawless under-eye
area created with just drugstore stuff
for me to be so satisfied with the
coverage but also the wear I just feel
like it's really saying something so
this was just a little technique and
some recommendations that I wanted to
pass along a real test of this look is
the fact that I can give you this like
3/4 turn here and really not see the
circle so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
