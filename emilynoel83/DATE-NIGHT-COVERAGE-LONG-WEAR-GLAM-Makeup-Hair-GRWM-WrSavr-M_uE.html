for this little date night Valentine's
Day get ready with me video it's one of
my favorite times to get ready is for a
date night I just love any opportunity
when you have that extra time and you
may notice that I have my hair up in
rollers these are my favorite rollers I
had mentioned an Instagram post a while
back that I was trying out some new
rollers so I didn't want to be like oh
I've only used him a few times and
they're wonderful like I really wanted
to give him a shot so really any special
occasion any time I've gone out I have
put these in and I'm now gonna keep them
upstairs so maybe I'll be more likely to
just pop them in before a video or
something like that but they're from t 3
and I will put the exact name down below
I've had it for quite a while I got them
from QVC and I love everything about my
love little stand that they're on it's
so like small and compact the clips that
go on then the fact that they don't get
so hot they're burning your fingers so
rollers are flocked a little bit so like
they really do cling and stay in my hair
which is very fine and very straight but
I guess the biggie with these is that
even though they don't feel like to the
touch that they're getting insanely hot
they are giving me a great curl a really
locked-in curl that's where I get let
down by so many hot rollers sets is that
it all seems fine and dandy at the onset
and then like two hours later my hair
which wants to be very very straight
just kind of starts to fall and this
like the curl really stays sometimes I
can wake up the next day and feel like
oh they've got some of that curl in
there so I love them super easy to use
when I got them there were like two size
options and I went for the smaller in
the little like presentation that I
watched online they said if you have
really fine hair curl resistant hair you
might try the smaller of the two because
it just puts a little more a little more
spring in your curl I guess so I have
been absolutely loving these especially
as my hair has you know started to grow
out a little bit more but this is the
way I've prepped my skin so far I used
my Rodin Enfield's active hydration
serum I've been using this like every
day at the start of my day I know it's
another thing you can use at night time
too but I've just been keeping it up
here as well as the bright eye complex
from that brand so those have been a
couple of like consistent starting
points for me for about I don't know
last couple of months and then I
put on this anti-aging armor SPF 50 from
it cosmetics and this is kind of just
like a sheer like there is a little bit
of a tint in it but it's very very sheer
it gives me that SPF it also that's kind
of a nice primer like smoothness to it
so after using those three things that's
where I'm at now and I'm getting ready
for foundation so I have dampened my NYX
sponge which I absolutely love the
sponge so much you're gonna notice in
this video for the most part I'm gonna
use some things that are like
tried-and-true awesome no fail and this
sponge is one of those I love the little
flat side that it has I love the curve
that it comes to here at the top and
then you've got that little rounded
bottom of it here so it kind of reminds
me of the best of both worlds that
combines the flat edge of a Real
Techniques sponge and the roundedness of
a Beauty Blender it's awesome for
foundation today I'm gonna apply
something that really does well whether
you're using a sponge or a brush as my
NARS natural radiant long wear
foundation in Vienna we have a town in
southern Illinois that has spelled the
exact same way but it's pronounced
Vienna so I have to mentally check
myself every time before I say that
shade name those are like little tidbits
I remember when I first started at the
TV station you know you've got to learn
the special pronunciations of every
community because people get really bent
out of shape when you mispronounce their
town so you've got to know so I'm going
to take the rounded end and just sort of
Bounce this foundation in and I
mentioned this in my monthly favorites
best in beauty video like the coverage
on this is fantastic but it is a long
wearing actually somewhat natural finish
foundation is just combining a lot of
really good qualities for me and the
color is really good too and here's
where the sponge comes in huge you put
your finger on the flat end or of course
you could use a flat end to blend but I
like to put my finger on that and then
get in there right around the I like it
perfectly addresses that area
yeah this is some real coverage everyone
I'm loving it but guys here's why I love
hot rollers so much like I could invest
as much time as you can possibly give me
in doing my makeup and really enjoy it
and have fun with it like I like taking
the time when I have it but with hair I
don't feel that way I'm like how fast
can it possibly get done how little work
can I put into it that's that's great
for hair if you are of that mindset
where doing your hair is concerned hot
rollers are for you for sure next up I'm
going to do my little under eye
brightening trick that I've been loving
lately and I did include this in a video
like all about these these sticks from
L'Oreal they're The True Match super
blendable concealer and this color peach
is a really great corrective step for
any dark circles you might have and
where I focus it is right on the dark
circle itself you don't need to really
feel the need to stretch this all over
this area unless you have discoloration
just like put it wherever the
discoloration is because we're going to
handle brightening in like a separate
step I got my Beauty Blender micro mini
here yep I'm feeling my blender sponges
again not that I ever really stopped
enjoying them but you know
I just go through phases I can't explain
it and next we're gonna do the
brightening and I'm using my instant age
rewind eraser in the color called
brightener from Maybelline click it up a
little bit this is the product we're
gonna use in a whole big zone here on
sort of the top of the cheek overlapping
where we just did the peach just hitting
this whole area here this is SuperDuper
brightening this does add coverage also
and it just works great hand in hand
with the corrector got a little bit of a
pink tone so it's gonna be ultra
brightening and with this since we're
working with a larger surface area I
kind of like to use my larger sponge
just to tap over that I'm again putting
my finger where it's flat so that
rounded side can really reach all of
these areas
and with concealers like I feel like
I've got quite a few that I'm enjoying
right now I actually really like that
covergirl one that I used in my
covergirl brand makeover video shape
tape is another one of those no-fail
types of things but for those of you who
are looking for a good drugstore sort of
correct and brighten technique I think
this is great it ends up giving me a
look that I feel super confident with
and I love the way it wears as well
sometimes when I'm going back and
editing my videos I'm like wow I see a
lot of redness on my eyelids or whatever
and I never really try to make an effort
to completely blank that out at this
face of the game because I'm always
gonna be like popping color on there
unless I was doing a super nude like
hardly any color on the eyes you know
eyeshadow wise I might make the effort
to get concealer on there or Foundation
and really even that out but otherwise
it just feels like extra layers of stuff
to me and I've never had a major like
creasing issue with my eyeshadows or a
real like oiliness issue on my lids and
I think it's because I don't layer up
too much product there just kind of
leave that to the eye primer in the
eyeshadow and then what I'm really
feeling fancy I will bake so I'm gonna
use the Maybelline fit me this was sort
of the part three of that trifecta of
concealing products from the drugstore
and I use the shade fair give it a
little shake first and then this is
where the flat side of this sponge comes
in really handy for me it lays down
powder very quickly and easily so does
the Real Techniques sponge so when
you're baking you're putting a hill for
the amount of powder down here on the
under eye I've said it before I'll say
it again baking might not be for
everyone it might be one of those things
that you just try out on yourself
sometime and see like do I like the way
this looks when I'm done do I like the
way this wears does this work with my
skin type skin texture generally
speaking if I've when I can settle in on
the right powder for this step which i
think is just crucial it can work well
for me the Maybelline fit me is good of
course the Loree Laura Mercier is
top-notch amazing like to put a little
bit up into here because I just think
this is an area that kind of needs to be
brightened there between the brows a
little bit
the chin and you know I'm even gonna try
a little bit of brightening baking right
down here on the jaw so we're not
getting it into the area where we might
use a cheek contour you know like right
in here but we're gonna let this bake
and then we'll dust it away and then
sort of go in and chisel things out next
I'm gonna do my brows and I've just
really been trying to use up what I have
in my collection brow product wise and
for some reason I think I thought I had
completely used this product up but I
hadn't and so recently I've been getting
into my anastacio brow Wiz again this is
in medium brown and yeah I've still got
like plenty of product left here I don't
know what my thought was there with not
finishing it out but I'm using it now
and this is one of the finest brow
pencils you will find just in terms of
like fine tip NYX makes something really
similar called micro brow L'Oreal has
the gosh what's the name of that brow
stylist definer or something like that
they have a really nice targeted brow
pencil also so if you don't want to
shell out for the Anastacio I personally
don't really feel like it's necessary
unless she's just making like a perfect
shade for you and you have trouble
finding the right shade because I think
with the L'Oreal it only came in a few
colors so I don't always talk through
like exactly what I'm doing with the
brows but overall I'm just kind of
trying to get them even and fill in any
places that just seem a little bit
sparse once I go through with the pencil
I used a little spoolie and that can
sort of even out any product that might
have settled in more heavily in certain
areas but I think when you're baking
it's the perfect time to just go ahead
and get those brows done or you could do
eyeshadow at this time but I kind of I
feel like when brows are complete they
do set the tone for the rest of your eye
look and you ever wonder like if your
brows weren't done first would you be
doing extra stuff on the eyes just to
compensate for it you know an undone
brow I don't know you might be wondering
like are you actually even having a date
night I actually am today shooting this
on the weekend here before Valentine's
but Tyler and I are gonna be going out a
little later this afternoon so this is a
look that I intend to be long wear and
lasts me throughout my whole day of
taking care of kids and whatnot
and I don't really plan to touch it up I
don't think I'll even need to except
maybe my lip product and this is just a
little clear brow gel this is from julep
I don't think you have to have anything
special for this step unless you really
struggle with hold
I think the NYX control freak is awesome
I don't think you have to use anything
expensive in your brows as far as the
gel goes now I'm going to dust away the
bake this is my ELF small tapered brush
it's a complete must-have brush I think
in anyone's makeup collection and just
dust away that powder you know obviously
some kind of stays in there with your
skin but with this heavy of an
application as baking requires you do
end up dusting some away
you know what else I'm gonna do just
because I really really want some loft
in staying power and obviously so far
only the places where we've baked have
been really set
I'm gonna use my LA Colors mineral
pressed powder here with my ELF
complexion brush dip into that tap off
the excess I only want a really light
amount of this and I'm going to take it
across my forehead and just any other
area that didn't maybe get directly
baked with the Maybelline powder this is
my so radiant diamond powder bronzer and
medium tan from julep I love this
bronzer such a natural shade it can
really double as a contour like a soft
contour I really do think date night
Beauty is about like approachable beauty
you know approachable glam you want to
look beautiful you want to have that
confidence and feel like you've done
something a little bit special but yeah
I think you want to keep it somewhat
soft you know what I mean by that like
I'm not really looking to be like an
Instagram person I want to look like
myself just make it soft and
approachable and touchable like that's
that's what date night glamour is about
for me so I take a little bit of this
bronzer around the hairline softly there
and as you can see I've taken it kind of
along the cheekbone here for I don't
know if you'd even classify that it's a
contour it's just super light and it's
not as low as I may have once gone I may
have originally stuck the powder right
here now I'm bringing it up just a
little bit and I think it lifts the
whole face you know what else this
particular face routine that I'm doing
now would be great for like if I were
back on the news
the flawlessness of this look the
overall matte quality of this look the
staying power of it it would play really
well for news I think if you don't know
that's what I used to do for the look
morning news I am so grateful for the
community of broadcasting people who
maybe started following me when I was on
the news here on my beauty videos and
they still do someone had asked like can
you remake a video for you know the
broadcasting people out there like what
would you change since the last time you
did that makeup for TV video so this
this kind of that look as well although
I really should do a specific video like
that for blush I'm gonna use my soft
sable from covergirl
I love the splush definitely fell in
love with this all over again in the
covergirl video doesn't matter what your
shirt color is doesn't matter what your
lipstick is I mean I don't even really
know what direction I'm going with the
ice yet today it's the kind of blush
like you don't even want to stop putting
it on you just keep going and going and
then highlighter it's another one of
those parts of makeup where I'm thinking
let's keep it approach it but let's keep
it looking like skin so here's something
I love this makeup revolution champagne
liquid highlighter very very comparable
to what's going on from Becca and you
know different brands that have made
great liquid highlights this is great
too so I just dab a little bit there on
my hand and it comes in multiple shades
by the way but this high cheekbone
highlighter brush from Sigma is kind of
nice for something like this because
it's a dense brush and when you're
dealing with a real liquidy product like
this I think a dense brush tends to give
a really good application of it and then
as you'll see I'm just kind of buffing
it on there on top of the cheekbone my
small stipple brush is great for cream
textures but I think sometimes with
certain liquidy consistencies it can be
a bit streaky
I tell you that when you find the right
liquidy highlight it will always give
just an even more natural appearance
than a powder one well there are select
few powders where I feel like yeah that
just looks like nothing you know but
liquid very frequently gives me that and
then one of the best setting sprays that
you can really really count on Urban
Decay all nighter so so good if you need
the all-day wear or late night wear this
works great now on the eyes I have been
trying out a bunch of the shop hush
palettes and in my first round my first
order I had like four or five and none
of them were from the brand bad habit
because at the time I ordered all that
stuff was sold out and then I've been
getting a lot of specific questions
about the bad habit ones so I'm like
okay when those come back in stock I'm
gonna do another order
I'll try those and then we'll just lump
everything into a video so I'm not
necessarily using what I'm doing on the
eyes today because I know and love it
I'm just in the natural process of
trying it out but I got this little set
of pallets that are sort of dupes for
the Hutu Beauty smaller pallets this
one's called after hours and the one who
do one that I have is the mauve
obsessions and you know they haven't
done an absolutely identical layout like
they put that lightest matte shade in a
different spot but I mean overall
they're trying to really emulate this
palette so this is what I think I'm
gonna use for my look today for a nice
little mob smokey Valentine look I'm
gonna use this Marc Jacobs the coconut
undercover eye primer I got said this
before this is a good eye primer but so
is Milani and Milani is cheaper so for
me I wouldn't repurchase this oh there's
a little film over the mirror oh I love
taking a film office I will never forget
the meetup that I did in Chicago I'm
going to use the center shade called
lustful here did a meet-up gosh it was
like the June or July was when I was
first pregnant with Eve but I hadn't
really told anybody yet but it was in an
Ulta in the Chicago area and someone
brought me like a Naked palette err and
honest hacia pal I don't remember what
it was but they're like here you can
peel the film off because they knew I
liked doing that and I was like you are
the most thoughtful
than ever thank you like we had a moment
over that so what I'm noticing thus far
is that like this this shadow is most
definitely doing its job here you know
it's getting you this nice little sort
of topi crease color it is very very
powdery I can deal with that some people
flip out about that so you've been
warned
then I think I'm gonna take a little bit
of this flushed color it's sort of a
pinky matte and let's see what happens
when we get some of this feeling this is
a very Valentine's II kind of palette
though isn't it I mean don't these
colors just make you think of that the
Reds the Pink's it's like I'll take any
excuse to wear these kinds of colors
because I personally love them on my
eyes yeah that color is giving me a nice
bit of depth here actually
and then just blending out the edge with
a bear brush I think I'll go ahead and
also take this opportunity to use powder
room as my highlight nice little matte
highlight always like having that in a
palette then I think I'm gonna take this
color called Hickey did they really name
a color Hickey like really I'm gonna dab
this on I think most of the lid here
there's like a lot of powder fall out
but I am not mad at the way these are
applying on the eyes
let's see what this color called clutch
will do this had some shimmer how well
will this build up it's looking kind of
nice so far
I think the last step I'm going to take
is to use this wine stain shade right
down here so this seems like a really
deep perhaps even a little plum e Brown
I kind of want to make a bit of a cat
eyed effect here but lashes that I'm
going to be using are really beautifully
kind of flared they're a lot like a red
cherry number 43 although I think
they're an even cheaper alternative to
those but I think really getting an
outer V going here is going to look
gorgeous alongside those lashes and
we'll take some of that same color right
down here to the lower lash line here's
where my eyes go from Brown to just a
little bit green
don't want to look too red like all the
way around so I'm just gonna use lustful
the center sort of neutral brown taupe
shade and just continue smudging that
all over the lower lashline area I'm
really all over the place with my lower
lashline these days sometimes I like to
barely do anything to it sometimes I
really just want to smoky shadow all the
way around guess that's just the kind of
mood I'm in today even for this being
like a really affordable palette kind of
a dupe type palette I don't feel like
I'm having to build up these shadows in
any major way if anything I'm tapping
off the excess and trying to like just
not get too much on this blending over
the outer edge here that's a really
important thing to note when you're
doing your blending to keep from getting
a muddy look all over your eye you see
I'm not taking this all over the entire
look to blend I'm just keeping it on the
outer edge where I want to soften and
then I think I might do even more of
this clutch shade right in here
just for that little pop of brightness
sometimes a finger just does it best and
I know I've been trying not to do too
much of standard classic black liquid
liner all the time but I really do want
to do it for this look so I'm using my
Jordana color Envy I know it will get me
through the whole day and night this is
in black Envy and it's a perfect matte
black
again with approachable beauty I'm
trying not to wing this to the gods I'm
just giving it a small winning
and I'm actually going to do a brown in
my lower inner rim this is from julep
it's the one pencil met gel enriched
brown and this wears really nicely in
the lower inner rim and then you can
kind of smudge it down here between the
lashes
then to really just fully complete the
eyeshadow look back to the darkest shade
and I kind of use this just under the
wing it softens that up a little bit I'm
smudging out any Brown liner that we
brought to the lower lash line
I know it's looking pretty intense but
the beautiful feminine softening effect
- and I look that's this smoky is
definitely the lash so we're doing a big
lash not a huge lash not as big of a
lash as I have done at times I think
it's definitely an appropriate lash I'm
excited to try these other little
palettes that I have all the different
color themes there's like a topi one
there's a really like orange II warm one
there's a super colorful one - next up
I'm gonna curl my lashes and today I'm
gonna use my Marc Jacobs velvet noir I
just really want to use this up it's a
nice mascara and I want to get my get
out of it you know I know it's time is
limited and I just always like to get a
little mascara on before the lashes come
on I don't always reference why I do
this you know or my reasonings but I
have lashes that really don't want to
naturally curl that much so they need to
sort of be prepped think of it like you
would put your hair on a curling iron
and then put hairspray on it that's what
this step sort of does and if you have
curl challenge lashes you need to be
doing this before you put your falsies
on I don't know if a you guys are
watching the Olympics but there's that
commercial for Lindsey Vonn it comes on
every now and then bring him back that
song this and now Belle is always
wanting to sing that that song was going
through my head right now
so last night there was some
snowboarding on I'm not like the biggest
follower of all the Winter Olympic
sports and stuff but man was that fun to
watch like unbelievable they were doing
not just chin or whole snowboarding but
they were following some sort of course
with all kinds of little not like an
obstacle course but you know what I mean
different ramps and stuff and I was just
amazed - like how do you even get used
to it like being in a different place
like where do you get to practice
at first crush your water-resistant no
doubt gets me through whole days and
nights won't smudge won't flake
and then guys
I said with the lashes they're very
similar to a red cherry number 43
there's a lot of length but their
longest at the outside and I've got
these little glues here they I think
they're by kiss their little individual
glues and how perfect would one of these
be to like maybe keep in your purse as a
backup lash glue but the reason why I'm
using it is because I took my lash glue
from up here the last time I went out at
nighttime I took that and put it in my
purse so I'd have it as a backup so now
I don't have any glue up here so I'm
doing the exact opposite of my
suggestion but if you see these again I
think they're by kiss these little
individual lash glue you can get a
couple of helping it's a glue off of one
of these a couple of different
applications I mean but the quality of
the glue is good I mean it does really
work so I'm gonna go ahead and go
through this process I'm not making my
memory card fill up anymore and get
these on and then I'll join you for the
lift hey so the lashes are on I am
loving the way that looks I'm loving the
way the shape of the eyeshadow and the
liner and the lashes is just all kind of
following this a little bit flared out
cat eyed look so the After Hours palette
by bad habit I think is doing awesome
things now for the lips I'm gonna do
sort of I think a borderline nude lip
with this look that with a little bit of
shine you know I'm loving glosses again
and I didn't really mention this in my
gloss video because I kind of see this
more in like a totally different
category where lip toppers are concerned
and that sparkly like center of the
lower lip look it's the infallible
paints metallic in moon lust everything
in my gloss fit was more about something
that without fail you can wear all over
your lips all together but for this look
just to achieve this certain color I'm
after I think this is what I'm gonna go
with it's the l'oreal colour riche match
this is the shade called mattes it's
gonna end up being like a very very
dusty rose
these matte lip liners by the way from
L'Oreal they are heaven if you have not
tried them they go on incredibly well
and then we're going to take moon lust
and work side of that in right here
concentrating it most they're in the
center of the lower lip and then kind of
using my finger to spread it out
elsewhere and blend it god is say I am
absolutely loving the combo of this I've
Hallett this blush the soft sable and
this lip color killing it and these are
all some very affordable options plus
that highlight that makeup revolution
liquid highlights so gorgeous so now the
very satisfying step of taking your hot
rollers out look at this curl y'all oh
and I don't have my little stand in here
for these so I'll just sit him in my lap
and take them into the bathroom later
but so you can see all of these rollers
are the same size by the way
all the rollers are out just freshly out
of the roller you got a lot of curl
happening here so what I do next is I
loosen everything up a little bit by
tipping my head over yes you've seen me
do this in several hot roller videos and
what I'm doing there is I'm really
working my fingers in like into my scalp
you're loosening up the curl you're just
kind of getting everything going there
and sometimes what I will do is I'll
take some kind of a thickening type
cream this is from organics it's the
bamboo or OGX the bamboo fiber full
thickening cream and my hair is pretty
fine and I have lost a lot you know over
the course of being postpartum and
everything but this just working this
kind of thing into the roots to makes a
huge difference and plus like if you're
doing this on super clean hair which I
just washed mine last night so it was
very very slick and clean going into the
rollers even putting a little bit of the
thickening cream on before you wrap them
around can help too now I don't have my
hairspray or my comb in here right now
so you're just looking at kind of fresh
hair but I love the way this just kind
of you know swoops away from the face I
would maybe tease this just a little bit
not to really make it any fuller but
just to ensure that it all sort of hangs
together and then spray that a little
bit there but the volume with this look
is just crazy good I love love love
these rollers but thank you guys so much
for watching I hope this was a fun get
ready with me video just really using a
lot of no fail products things you can
count on for really great long wear
whatever your special occasion might be
I think this would be a great go-to
looks so thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you next time
