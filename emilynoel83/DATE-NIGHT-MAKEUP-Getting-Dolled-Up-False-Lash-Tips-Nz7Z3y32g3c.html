I posted a picture on Instagram and bub
and I were going out on a date yes a
rare date we had a great time checked
out a new restaurant in town the little
shopping afterwards it was nice and so
many of you on that picture we're asking
about my makeup the lips eyes mainly
what was on my face like foundation wise
and it was a really freaking full
coverage look for as natural as that
looked you know in the broad daylight
which really is kind of saying something
because sometimes in daylight things can
look even thicker than they do under
these lights a lot of you are asking
about it and said I should do a video on
the look or hoped I shot a video on the
look well I didn't but I'm doing it now
because I remember everything I had a
lot of it you know I carelessly left out
here on my table so I can see what I use
but part of what I like about a date
night is the whole getting ready you
know taking time like part of the time
when I got ready and the kids were
napping so it's just fun to be able to
relax and kind of get ready with
something in mind other than I'm on
child duty today just fun to get glammed
up you know so that's what I did so the
first thing I use was a really rich
moisturizer I'm trying this L'Oreal age
perfect cell renewal rosy tone cream and
this Bobby's book and it is rosy tone
too so I put this on and just really
worked it into the skin and my skin felt
so I kind of plumped up and moisturized
after this step which is really good if
you're using a foundation that you're
concerned might look a little thick you
want to make sure that like that
foundation has plenty of moisture that
it's going into instead of the dry
patchy areas that are going to look
obvious I'm really dry right in on the
inner part of my brows kind of the inner
part of my eye area too like in
summertime you feel like you get hotter
and sweaty ER and whaler but then if you
spend a lot of time in a pool sometimes
that has a reverse effect on your skin
like days later you'll feel drier
actually I feel like I'm tending to skin
dryness in the summertime these days I
used a primer a primer that I've been
meaning to use you know I did my primer
declutter and now I'm left with the
things that I really want to try out
or the things that I know I love and
this is from Marc Jacobs it's the
invisible undercover perfecting coconut
based primer very very thin kind of gel
like this primer just makes me feel kind
of like I'm adding a light layer of
moisturizer
additionally like on top of the other
moisturizer my skin does feel really
smooth with this on but it's not the
effect that you get with like a Smashbox
photo-finish
silicone II primer foundation I used was
this this infallible total cover I have
it in 304 natural buff and I never
really talked about this I don't know if
I talked about this one ever I got it
and it's a big 24 hour super full
coverage weightless feel foundation and
when I first got it I thought it feels
pretty heavy and I would also feel like
it looked kind of heavy on the skin but
for whatever reason I decided to pull it
out again and kind of give it another
shot and I used a dampened Beauty
Blender with it and I really just took
the time to work it into the skin a lot
and it seemed to help quite a bit
so I used about like that much I don't
know we're talking maybe a pea-sized
amount of this foundation all over the
skin and I definitely patch it on the
skin first because then you know the
foundation is getting to these areas
bounce that in all over and you can see
the coverage is really good but you just
don't want that full coverage foundation
to look like the foundation right well I
will say when you've got a full coverage
foundation if you've got a dampened
Beauty Blender setting sprays and
highlighters anything's possible it's
certainly the combo of getting this
worked into the skin really well and
then putting a little glow on top and
completely transforming the texture of
your skin with a setting spray like
that's what it's all about
now I've applied this foundation with a
brush before it had even higher coverage
with a brush but for the sake of it
looking at least a little more skin like
I'm using Beauty blenders then I used a
combination of concealers I use my
boring brightening concealer number two
which if you watch my video you know
this is this new array space now if you
wore medium
erase paste and you want to get this new
kind you're going to want number two and
I get this on mainly like I'm giving the
most concentration of product right here
around the inner corner of the eye and
then just kind of feathering out with a
little bit more product here and dab
that in I've had several questions
lately of people either trying to combat
one of two problems dark age spots
melasma or dark under eyes and like I've
had several people comment later like
I'm trying to cover them up with
concealer and they're lightening but
they're not looking completely covered
and I would say you need to use a deeper
PG corrector and perhaps also a deeper
skin tone concealer on top I think the
tell-tale sign that you're concealing
product is too light is when it's taking
your problem and not erasing it but
rather lightening it so I don't know
instead of using the number two you
might use the number three of this
product cuz that's a little bit richer
PG shade and like with concealers this
Anastacio concealer that I'm going to
pull in here this stuff I hadn't used it
for I don't know maybe just a couple of
months here I wouldn't say it's this
long gone forgotten product but this is
a fantastic concealer very creamy and I
use 2.5 and this is certainly like none
too light for my skin you know but
you'll find if I put it over dark areas
it really conceals
so I'm hitting it with the one-two punch
here on dark circles and any kind of
discoloration on top of my cheeks I'm
using both the corrector and then I'm
using a little bit of concealer and I'm
using this concealer over any other
little imperfections they see also and
then I'm just taking that sponge and
just tapping over it I would say ideally
I would use maybe a little smaller
Beauty Blender like the micro mini just
to go around this area but because this
was just what I had wet and I didn't
want to go back to the bathroom sink is
what I'm using but see how fully you can
get stuff covered up if you're just
using the right tones darker
discoloration calls for a darker
concealer and or corrector to cover it
up just keep that in mind I have totally
been there where the tendency is to
overcorrect and thing I'm going to pull
the lightest concealer this brand makes
and really cover it up but then you
merely lighten it or give it a greyish
cast sometimes and the thing I love
about both of these concealers is the
texture because they're so creamy like
do you see how my skin almost has a dewy
look from that stuff but it's not overly
sticky it's just a really creamy
you know concealer combo there this
video it's such a combination of I don't
know new old like brand new I have this
Born This Way powder from two phases as
their ethereal setting powder and so I
thought I would use this for a little
bit of baking on the under eye area I do
like that the packaging has this little
lift up cap just going to use my Beauty
Blender once again to pick up some of
that product and I just dabbed it on the
under eye I think I've referred to this
technique as microwaving before touches
baking because I don't think I'm
applying a whole ton of product but no
no we're going to get some on there this
is just what I did last night and the
look worked out if you watch a lot of my
videos you're probably thinking so as it
as good as the laura mercier or is it
better worse I'm not really sure like I
kind of at this stage of the game it's
performing a lot like it but the biggest
thing that sets the laura mercier apart
for me is I feel like it's a powder I
can get away with using less of it like
if I go there's a little baking thing I
don't necessarily feel the need to pie
a buttload of that product on to get a
really smooth flawless under eyelid also
just the wear of it is so good this I
haven't even really put it through a
long long span of where time yet so
while that's doing a little light bake
there I'm using the Too Faced chocolate
brownie cocoa powder brow pencil and
soft brown so this has the spoolie on
one end and then it does have kind of a
unique shape on this other side because
we're a lot of products are going with
the triangular shape there on the brow
pencil this is really skinny it's just
like there's not one super wide tip to
it and it can kind of craft some some
straight edges or sort of straightness
in your brows pretty easily and the tone
is really nice it does smell chocolaty
to the definitely the percentage or good
scented brow product that I've used
I just gotten into using that Tarte arch
architect that has the attached brow gel
and that's one of those that has like
the little bit triangular shape and I do
like it but you see how this one is
pairing like somewhat of a sickish brow
pencil like in comparison to a brow is a
thicker pencil yet with more precision
in the way they've cut it and I just
take the spoolie through
thank you so much to mom and dad for
watching the little ones last night Eve
had started eating solid food I guess
that's been the latest development over
the past for the past month or so around
five months I guess when she started and
she's really taking to it well she's
doing a great job and Anna's are her
favorite so far she also likes apples
like you know in a pureed State that's
how we're going with it right now
but she'll take some green beans or some
sweet potatoes no problem so I'm just
kind of dusting away any excess powder
that was on here and that's just pretty
much the powder the only face powder I'm
doing on my face is what I put here
around like the under eye area center of
the face I did bronzer I just kind of
used bronzer as contour I use my ELF
palette here that I was comparing to the
Marc Jacobs this lightest shade actually
works as a really nice little contour
type color here
laughter that and
and then if I want to deepen that tone
up you just go to the one that's kind of
at the diagonal there from it and you
can get this nice kind of bronzy depth
around your hairline
so I like to get those targeted places
first and then I'll go back to the same
couple of colors with a fluffier brush
and this will just be my all-over
bronzing
for blush I grabbed for my Besame blush
this is so pretty look at this old
school packaging it twists twists off
here and it says 1915 rose it's like a
really cool pink and I just get a little
bit on there cuz it picks up your brush
will pick up a ton tap off the excess
and then I just go for the outer part of
the apple of the cheek and when you do
that it really just I don't know
accentuates if you've got some fullness
to the cheek like I do here you just
kind of I don't know pops that area oh
so prettiest blush is like just blending
itself there's so easy to use just don't
get too much
look is looking very full coverage but
very flat and Matt right now so stand by
we're going to do something during the
Amazon Prime days and I got a few things
one of them was a brand I haven't tried
before it's called Aesthetica as anybody
else used this stuff this is their
strobe series palette and I ended up
with the tan to dark one I didn't know I
was getting tan to dark but you know it
works well it comes with a liquid strobe
like pen also but you know what the
shapes are not at all unusable on me
like they're actually all kind of
brightening I'm very curious though to
see what the lighter one isn't just how
much more glowy perhaps those shades are
but these tones are really really pretty
and I found what was they use in last
night I think this one I got a lot of
questions about what my highlight was
and this is so pretty I take it like
down to the top of the cheek because
that's really where head-on that's where
you see it so I kind of took it up and
around here it's so pretty and I even
like took one of these I think it was
this one and I put it like on my
shoulders because I was wearing one of
those tops where the shoulder kind of
pokes out but like this brand had some
really good quality stuff and I'm still
waiting on a brow palette things that I
got to come in but I'm using some of
this color as well and you don't have to
be scared of it look at that oh yes add
me to the montage of youtubers gawking
at their own highlights
seriously I mean that shade doesn't look
like it would be that light does it it
really pops I put a little bit down nose
put a little bit up here like on the
forehead sort of above the brow area
I tried this Too Faced prime set refresh
hangover RX three and one replenishing
primer and setting spray with coconut
water probiotic based ingredient in skin
Reviver I was just trying to make that
the name as long as possible for you
guys here and that is what takes your
full cover who makes it look like
glowing skin I mean you've got it you
got it in the foundation really well
with something like this you've got to
use some kind of glowy highlight that
starts to bring some dimension and some
Sheen back and top it off with something
that absolutely transforms the texture
it wouldn't have to be this particular
Spray because honestly I can make that
texture change happen with the elf prep
set and glow it can do it with the Mario
Badescu and kind of trying to figure out
if this is going to be doing anything
like next level different from my skin
but obviously here you see it definitely
looks super smooth and super even at
this point ever need a little pick-me-up
you know just look at your Precious
Moments mug that you've had for like 20
years and see what they say about you on
your name emily is e enthusiastic and
mary i imaginative l lively and whi
youthful thank you Precious Moments mug
a winning spirit filled with happiness
Milani eyeshadow primer still got some
product in this puppy I just applied a
tiniest bit of this between two eyes and
get it all the way up through that
crease there's also a good time to take
any like powder or foundation that's
collected in the crease of your eyes
somehow and kind of make sure that
that's not there anymore because the
thing I used on the eyes I thought I'm
not get out the good stuff it's date
night y'all so I got out my busy art
warm neutral matte palette or it's
called the warm matte palette I've said
this before but if you're really like on
the fence about this like this is a
really pretty palette cuz I do love the
reds and yellows but the regular veggie
aren't matte neutral does have some warm
shades in it and I still feel like that
palette is the biggest bang for your
buck it's not that I don't like the
quality of this palette because I do but
I just think I don't know I can get the
warm neutral look with the other one do
I absolutely have to have this one
probably not but I'm going to use it my
look was not super complicated it was
just kind of a a little bit of a smoky
look actually it didn't look as dark in
that particular picture that I had on
Instagram is maybe it did in person take
a little bit of this color and just buff
it's in the crease I started doing my
eyes last night and that was when all
hell started to break loose downstairs
and kids were waking up and needing
snacks and running up the stairs to
check on me and doing all kinds of stuff
so I sort of breathe through the eyes
honestly I took all that time on the
skin but hey we can all enjoy a little
warm neutral matte easy I write I did do
it up with the liner though and I did
put
we're still peeping there's a
high-maintenance look alright a little
bit of this orange e color this is a
nice little soft orange and I like using
that as a transition any kind of color I
love visi art shadows so well made so
consistent beautiful colors great
thought put into the color palettes
they're giving you don't get me started
again on that interview video that
stephanie nicole did with them but that
gave me a ton of insight into this brand
what they're about and I liked it using
that light buttery kind of cream shade
butter cream if you open what did I do
Belle and Nana my mom made cookies
yesterday it was so cute she had her
stirring that stuff dump and stuff in
decorating the cookies
they were so good it was like a cake mix
a yellow cake mix and chocolate chips so
it was a little bit different spin on a
chocolate chip cookie but very very
moist very good so anyways this dark red
I did use this and I padded this on my
lid the nice thing about this palette is
that the shades just blend so seamlessly
when you're dealing with this kind of
gradient of color and like the subtle
differences between these colors you
just put them on and they were all just
made to work together you know that's
what I'm getting at here it's not like
you bounce around to any one point and
pair it with something else and it's
going to look off they just all are in
that same kind of zone then I went with
this kind of warm medium brown and I
took that like on the center of the lid
and a little bit inward
this is what I do when I'm in a hurry
and I'm changing shades this is how I
clean off my brush I just do that and
until no shadows coming up there then I
just move on a little bit of the light
shade look how the light shade can still
totally dominate and overlap the deeper
ones with no problem
very Kat Von D shadow light quality to
those some light colors I always like a
little brightness around that part of my
eye I just do okay and then I just kind
of took this Brown and built up that
crease a bit more it's a very warm brown
it's like even warmer than it looks if
you haven't tried busy art shadows the
things I think you'll enjoy and notice
about them is how good they can look
sheer they look just as good sheer as
they do full-on like when you just kind
of blend them out and get them in this
really bust out state they look so good
but they also look great just packed on
and I was trying to find just a plain
black liner but the first thing I
grabbed for actually has I think a
little bit of a glimmer to it it doesn't
really matter it's dark enough to
actually look black but this is the
Makeup Forever aqua XL in number d12
these eye pencils have really nice
staying power really nice ability to
cling in here to the lower inner rim so
I would kind of recommend them as a
whole in terms of good waterline liners
I like to dot them a little bit on the
actual lash line and then I'll go in and
blend that with a smudge brush but that
dark mess kind of diffuse a little bit
and then you pop some powder on top of
that and you've got this great smoky
lash line but before I do that I'm going
to do my upper liner as well and I did a
good old-fashioned black liner wing
need the copy before this one make sure
I'm on my game here this is my Jordana
color envy in black nd I just thinking
what am I going to call this video at
what point do videos where makeup
application is being done when are they
tutorials and whether they get ready
with me
I'm getting ready either way right so it
does the tutorial have to be more
formally instructional generally
speaking my get ready with me videos are
longer and if I was doing a tutorial I
would try to keep it a little bit more
concise get ready with me videos or
where I give myself a little more
license to ramble so I guess this would
be get ready with me then for awhile
there I had the makeup playtime which
was like doing a makeup look where you
start out you have absolutely no
direction in mind you just grab her
stuff and have fun I need to do another
one of those two that was kind of like
what happened last night I didn't know I
was going to do this particular eye
looking I didn't really go in with a
plan I just wanted to look good you know
I just wanted my skin to look even I
wanted my eye to be kind of smoky and
sultry
this is the exact same thing that
happened last night this wings started
to do more than the swing and so I had
to go back and just add a little bit
more Chihuahua that's where it ends I'm
not doing any more you know you say that
phrase a lot when your two-year-old
randomly flirts out and I Chi wah wah
after something happen next step all you
have to finish is the lower lashline and
that's where I'm going to bring in this
deepest Brown when you look at this
palette like there's not really a black
brown or a black here but this Brown
when you put it on in its fullest extent
you know really pack it on here it looks
it looks pretty dark like this is the
fullest extent of this color the way I'm
putting it on right here
okay myself pre stick wing edge nothing
like hitting up your local barbecue
place with a fully glam eye look the
shadow beneath the wings I'll spare you
I won't sing shadow beneath my wings or
maybe a little you ah
the shadow than these my wings and then
I'm going to go into this shade this is
that same kind of warm brown that I was
working into my crease and put it on
kind of thick like if you're going to do
a big lash go a little bit thicker than
you even think
on the lower lash line because I always
inevitably go back and add more after
I've got a big set of lashes on then on
my lashes the first thing I do is curl
and apply the mascara if you're kind of
new to my videos and you're thinking
well is that even a necessary step like
do you have to put mascara on if you
know you're going to put on false lashes
and some people with a really great
natural curl to their lashes might not
need to do that because your lashes you
might find that they've just got that
nice bend to them and they naturally
mesh with the perfect curl of a false
lash really well my paradise did I say
that already but mine definitely need
this little like kind of curl and think
of the mascara as the hairspray it's
going to hold my lashes in that pearl
and make them blend with the false
lashes because if I didn't do this step
I would totally look like I had false
lashes taken off to the moon and my
lashes are pointing down
the ground so this is a necessary step
for a straight lashed person and I tell
you I do like this lash paradise so much
it's one of the few mascaras that I
would put on and feel like yeah I could
still be satisfied just stopping here
but we felt like being very extra last
night and by we I mean me I had such a
good burger so that it's like here stay
away from eating burgers at like nicer
restaurants because they end up being so
freakin thick well this place did their
burgers a little bit thinner like not as
thin as a Steak and Shake burger Lee but
a little bit thicker than that and they
put two on and really really good melted
cheese's and they had their own special
barbecue sauces and I put some of that
on there and it was so good I got my
last paradise on and while that that
mascara is pretty good about not getting
super smudgy on me I have seen it do a
little bit when I put it on my lower
lashes when in doubt go back to the Old
Faithful covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant I guess selling people
asking about wedding makeup and like
what's a mascara I can use that I can
cry and it's not going to go anywhere
this would be it this mascara has
actually proven itself in a number of
wedding situations and funeral
situations and childbirth situations
like the resume on this mascara is long
and once again kind of like the lower
liner does you know the smudgy smokiness
that I did there when I know I'm going
for a bigger I look and I'm going to
have a really full lash I'll give myself
license to do a bigger lower lash to
kind of balance it out I'm kind of doing
like a couple of coats almost down here
on these not to the point where they get
super spidery and stuff but just let
them stand out a little more let them
have their moment in the spotlight and
these are the lashes these are the
lashes that are just like a red cherry
number 43 they are full and thick the
whole way and they are slightly longer
on the outside I think these are an even
more generic commitee brand
than those but I've had these for quite
a while I've been reusing them quite a
bit and I no longer have the outer
packaging to tell you exactly what line
they are but red cherry is the one that
I had picked up for a long time I had
this very same style and I know these
are just like those they will give your
lashline a lot of fullness added length
okay so I just Center that up with the
center of my eye and then very important
here just because it feels like it's
getting in contact with the whole lash
line doesn't mean it necessarily is you
got to take your finger over it and just
tap tap tap make sure every part of that
lash band is hitting skin and then I
like to tip it up just a little bit so
you make sure it's not saggy nothing
worse than saggy lashes except maybe a
few other saggy things I can think of
right offhand more glue I think I got
this from Walmart it's the strip lash
adhesive it's clear with a low I think
this is by kiss because I can no longer
find my beloved Revlon precision lash
glue maybe some of y'all can knit your
Walmarts but I couldn't see it there
anymore so I got this it's okay I will
say this it stick end up just a little
bit it was thinner when I first got it
and now with some uses and you know
opening it up and getting it open to
some air it's thickened up just a little
bit and seems a little bit more Revlon
lash glue like than it used to be but I
will always go for a wand applicator on
my glue over just the tube I can't
remember the last time I just used it to
glue to apply lashes because this is so
quick it really just keeps the product
you're putting on at such a minimum so
this is where I look at the eye look and
I think yes I will do even more shadow
than because the lashes are coming up
here I will like add a little bit of
transitioning type color to kind of come
up there with the lashes no shame in
adjusting the look you know just because
you had your sights set on doing
something one certain way or some
tutorial you watched somebody did it
this certain way and they didn't go back
for an
that you can go back to how this lash is
wanting to curve a lot just kind of
straighten it out a little bit like that
Center it up pull it down a little blue
there and silcoon when you wear a
certain pair of lashes a lot the
application goes really fast like this
it just becomes very accustomed to the
shape of your eye they learn lashes are
smart again we make sure they're tipping
up sometimes you'll have one life that
really wants to tip up for whatever
reason on one eye just the way you set
it on there and then the other one won't
look the same so it now's the time as
that glue is really drying to make sure
that the lashes are kind of setting on
your eyes in the same manner and here's
what else I'll do because I'm impatient
sometimes I don't fully wait for that
glue to get dry and sometimes glues do
become truly invisible as they should
use clear glue this should dry to a
state where you don't see them anymore
sometimes they don't sometimes you got
more of a glob in one area than another
and you still see it and sometimes
you're just impatient and you want to
see the look be finished and so I go in
with a liner pen like any black liner
pen this happens to be the Too Faced
sketch marker matte black please if
you're going for this kind of look you
know matte black will be good if that's
what your original liner was I just kind
of go over any where I think I might
still be seeing a little something I
promise this look is almost done I do a
little dab of mascara I noticed I'm just
tapping it here at the at the base part
of the false lash just to ensure that
the real and fake lashes are together
you don't there's no need to sweep this
through the full length of the lashes
unless you've got a false lash that is
not performing as much as you want it to
and you feel like you need to bulk it up
but like what I said I was going to do
here and what I believe I did last night
as well is I brought in some more that's
orange at this point it just gave it
even more pizazz here at top pizzazz
needs to be used a lot more that's a
word that just needs to get out there
I'll make it my mission see look how
pretty this is oh I love how that's kind
of the pretty shade that's up here
she'll in and then it gets like this
murky kind of burgundy Brown has been
down there this turned out even better
than those last night it's been the lips
I went very light I use this makeup
revolution in the shade called awaken
the other color that I have from this
line that I really like is called life
long that's more rosy but these are
really really creamy lipstick
the peachy nude thing going on here my
picture it just looked like fresh
perfect baby lips you know ooh
this color wasn't screaming at you but
these looks so smooth and nice and I did
just a little bit of these you a skinny
dip lip topper in the center here to
have it on kind of blended it with my
finger and that was it for the lips
actually that's it for the whole look
that's my date night look where I really
just went and did it big I put rollers
in my hair but I've showered since then
so we're not seeing the effects of that
anymore but yeah thank you guys so much
for all the nice feedback on this look
and all the requests for this look that
made me feel like I want to get up the
next day and do this all over again for
a tutorial because it really is skin
that's got quite a bit on it I mean you
guys saw it's got quite a bit on it but
it doesn't necessarily look that way and
it certainly didn't look that way in
pictures either a nice warm smoky eye
and a little nude lips all there is to
it thank you guys for watching and I
hope this was helpful and I will see you
very soon hi
I promise I did comb my hair before the
date night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
