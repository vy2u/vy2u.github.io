today's video I seek to answer the
question did elf dupit I feel like elf
releases tons of new products all the
time and with a lot of their new
releases I will instantly think like wow
that seems like that product is
practically fashioned after an existing
high-end item that I might already have
or know about not saying they're trying
to be copycats with all their products
but I do think in some cases it would
appear they're really trying to create
an affordable alternative to some things
that are already on the market and the 5
things like that I mentioned in this
video these are things that just came to
me casually as I was like in the shower
that's that's where all my ideas really
come from let's face it I really think I
have even more items in my collection if
I really started digging through I think
I would find some more comparisons as
well the first product I want to mention
the high-end one is the Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating under eye primer
this sells for $29 and elf has a
hydrating under eye primer that is $3
and both of these - look at them they
actually have a very similar appearance
just the product itself kind of a light
pink tone but they do have different
textures the Smashbox one seems a little
bit thicker and a little more like a
true primer I feel like when I add it to
my under eye area I'm applying something
different than just an eye cream it has
actually some smoothness to it it really
does seem to smooth out that area
somewhat the elf one really seems
thinner in consistency almost like a
lightweight moisturizer that you're just
putting on your under eye area it
actually seems thinner than a lot of eye
creams I might use the whole concept of
these I think is a little bit gimmicky I
mean I wouldn't say oh my gosh everybody
needs a product like this because if
you're prepping your skin with a
moisturizer and you're going in with
some sort of eye cream you're really
taking care of that added hydration that
the eye area needs and I didn't feel
like either of these actually did a good
job in keeping anything from creasing or
really enhancing the staying power of
concealers and things like that so I
guess my answer is no I don't think elf
duped this product and because I really
don't think they're the same consistency
at all I honest opinion on these is that
I don't think they're absolute
necessary I actually really am loving
the CeraVe eye cream comes in a nice
little tube use it AM PM it has kind of
a thick almost bomb light consistency
it's not greasy but I think it really
hydrates the under eye area nicely next
product is something that I have praised
long before this video actually back
around Christmas time I was talking
about how much I love this Smashbox
contour kit this actually comes with a
brush and it sells for $45 the products
have a very creamy texture it's really
nice quality and it's just simplified
you know these are the contouring shades
I think you really get use out of but
then I practically had to eat my words
on that palette when elf came out with
their contouring kit this is only six
dollars compared to the 45 from the
Smashbox and you're actually getting one
extra shape that has a little shimmer as
you see these swash about Smashbox on
top elf on the bottom I mean they really
have mimicked the tones that are in the
Smashbox palette I think the bronze
e-type shade is just a little softer
from elf just a little less intense so
honestly I can achieve the very same
look from both of these products you'll
probably see these showing up like
head-to-head in a half and half face
video that I do and the neat thing about
this is if you've got multiple elf
palettes in this style like maybe you've
got a blush palette and there's some
part of this that you find you're not
using you could pop in a blush and also
have that element you know if you want
to you can kind of customize these
depending on what you've purchased but I
just love the depth that this cool tone
shade gives me I can get a little light
bronzy look as well and then this shade
here is so buttery and creamy a little
goes a long way when you put this on
your brush but it really does brighten
and I think a lot of highlight shades in
palettes like this actually turn out to
be really sheer and don't do enough so I
would say yes elf did dupe it on that
one the next product is the becca one
perfecting brush mine needs to be
cleaned but i did talk about this in a
video I did on Becca products and this
sells for $49 so not a cheap thing but
the claim with this is that this could
replace a lot of other brushes that you
use they say it can be used for your
creams your liquids or powders and found
Asians bronzers contours whatever
basically you use on your face even
blush I actually really like this for
cream blush I've liked it for contour as
well this is the kind of brush that's
just really not for everyone because
it's not going to give you the amount of
precision the smaller foundation brush
is going to have but at the same time
there are some people out there who are
going to love the idea that they can
replace a bunch of brushes with one but
ELF has come out with the ultimate
kabuki brush and it is I would say
comparable in size it's not the exact
same thing but as far as function goes
and how well the elf one performs those
various tasks on your skin I really
think it does a nice job it's actually
different kinds of bristles on both
these are I believe the goat hair
bristle and these are synthetic but I
find the elf one to be slightly fuller
you know a little more width to it as
you look at it in that way and it's very
very soft and so I use this to blend
over my foundation today I thought it
actually did a really good job of that
again you're going to struggle a little
bit to get around the smaller areas but
just all over the face it works well I
used it to kind of tap out my concealer
it also did well patting on some powder
all over the skin and even a little bit
of contour I think you'll find if you
get this brush you're rarely going to be
using the whole brush at one time you're
going to be like using an end or using
the edge of it it's only ten dollars I
think if you were wanting to experiment
with a larger multitasking type brush I
would say go with the elf did elf dupit
I actually think elf improved upon the
idea with this one next up I want to
talk about a lip product again this was
a much-loved product in my collection I
haven't actually busted it out in a
while but it's a really cool product
it's from it cosmetics it's called the
vitality lip flush and this particular
shade is called genocide quoi and it
looks like almost a transparent pink but
this goes on your lips it's very very
nourishing it's got a lot of great
hydrating ingredients but it shows up on
your lips with kind of this berry
pinkish stain and actually some people
might find that it varies somewhat
depending on your skin tone your natural
lip color and now elf has come out with
the got a glow lip tint I actually
really like the packaging that they've
done here it seems a little more high
and a little more substantial than some
of their other lip products as you check
them out here in the tube they look
exactly the same and they actually look
just the same on my lips I put the it
cosmetics on my top lip the elf on the
bottom lip they take on the very same
slightly deeper pink hue compared to the
way they look in the tubes feel like
these both stain in a very similar way
also is the shine wears off I feel like
I've still got the same look from each a
texture of the it cosmetics feels just a
teeny bit thicker like a little more
bone line and elf's is a little bit
thinner but did elf dupit I really think
they did if you're curious about this
kind of a product you can really save
some money by trying the elf one I'm
gonna talk about my Malley poreless face
defender it's really a touch-up type of
product basically you've got a clear
balm like thing in here and when you
swirl your finger in it I've said this
before but you can you run your finger
in this for an hour and then look at it
and see no visible product your finger
would look matte but you wouldn't
actually see a buildup of product on
your skin and that's really what makes
this special I have tested this against
several different products covergirl has
come out with something that tried to be
kind of similar to it benefit has dr.
feelgood which again is a little bit
different texture everything that I've
tried that kind of comes close to this
actually ends up being more of a creamy
product and yes it can function to
mattify but my issue with all of these
is that they still show up on my skin
and elf's is that same way it's even a
little worse than the covergirl in my
opinion for having that kind of whitish
residue on my skin you know we're
talking about similar claims from a
product but they're totally different
consistencies the elf actually like you
can see Peaks almost when I pull my
finger up off of this it's very creamy
and when I dab this / oily skin you know
it should mattify this is marketed as a
touch-up mattifying type product but i
feel like i end up seeing caked makeup
when i dab this on my nose for example
it's like oil has broken down your
makeup and you're seeing shine and I
would almost choose the shiny look then
the look I get when I dab this over the
shine and then I start to see like
little borders and edges of the
remaining makeup that's still on my face
and it just doesn't work out I will
continue to try every product that I
think might be coming close to duping
this face defender but so far nothing
has so I hope this video was informative
for you as far as some of the elf
products that seem to be really close to
certain high-end alternatives I would
say 3 out of 5 picks isn't too bad I
really enjoyed the contour kit this
brush for people who are interested in
this kind of a brush again I don't think
maybe it's everyone's cup of tea but if
you wanted to test it $10 you might feel
a little more safer going with that than
the near $50 brush from Becca and this
lip product pretty cool stuff and I
really appreciate it if you give this a
thumbs up if it was helpful and please
tell your friends if their elf fans
thanks guys I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
