me for one of my favorite videos this is
where I talk about some stocking stuffer
ideas um little DIY beauty bundles is
actually what I'm calling it in this
video and I've put together like five
different ones and they each have a
different theme tune and you could
totally fill these with whatever you
want this is just kind of a starting
point you know some ideas to get you
going if you're not sure what to do but
make it your own as they would say on
Idol and do whatever you want for these
little bags that I've put together I did
fill them with only drugstore products
so you could have kind of an affordable
like baseline idea of what to do and
also these are all things that I truly
truly love so products I would really
recommend the five different ones that I
put together are quick fix so that's a
little bag full of touch-up ideas pretty
in the PM that's like a nighttime
transformation type kit so going day to
night I have gorgeous glow which is all
about kind of a luminous glowy finish to
the skin got a bag called lip lovers
that's filled with my favorite lip
products and then one that I'm calling
nailed it and that's like a little
manicure bag and also have you met my
friend my little reindeer here I named
it Steve and we match my touch-up bag
I've got five products in here that I
really like one of them is great for
when you're getting those under-eye
smudges throughout the day and it's the
elf makeup remover pin I think this is
so handy it's basically like a marker
but it's filled with makeup remover
instead of you know marker juice or
color ink ink that's what I was looking
for and then you can just go underneath
like your lash line if you've got any
smudges there it's also just really
helpful as you're doing your makeup if
you get a little wild with the mascara
wands so just q-tips they sell in the
Travel section of stores little travel
packs of q-tips or you can get these
from Almay that actually do have some
makeup remover in them they are extra
handy if you want to try those so when
you're talking touch-ups and needing
some changes to your makeup throughout
the day you know some places get oily
some places get dries
people have more of one or the other but
a couple of things that I think help for
oil-control are blotting sheets that's a
great inexpensive thing you can do these
are from Palladio F makes these clean
and clear whatever you can round up
those are really handy and you don't
have to worry about a specific shade for
someone a compact of some sort you know
in your purse is essential for touch
it's a really nice standard one that
works for a lot of skin tones that you
can find easily at Target is the elf
translucent mattifying powder that's a
nice big mirror and then just a
translucent powder in there obviously
you don't ever want to overdo
translucent powder but if you do need a
little touch-up um maybe a little bit
under the Ives or a little bit on the
t-zone it's really handy for that and
then as I said if you need more moisture
in certain areas such as maybe your
under eye looks a little cakey as you go
on throughout the day your concealers
not looking so fresh you're seeing lines
more where you got dry patches on your
skin or anywhere on your body
the elf daily moisture stick I think is
a great great touch-up tool mention this
in my favorites have a whole video about
it I'll link to all that stuff below but
basically if you were to advise someone
on how to use this you just take the
stick swirl your finger on there one
time dab it on your under eye area it
feels cooling it won't screw up your
makeup and it will really have an effect
on the look of lines or the look of
dryness that you might get in your under
eye area throughout the day I've popped
all of these in these different little
mesh baggies but you could definitely
put them in an actual makeup bag too and
step up the gift a little bit pretty and
the PM is my nighttime transformation
kit so some things that a person could
use to really step up their look for day
to night so the things I have in here
yeah false eyelashes nothing changes
they look like false eyelashes and if
you've got a friend that you really want
to get going on that or you know they've
got a special event coming up go ahead
and give them this get them some lash
glue
I love the Revlon precision lash glue
this happens to be the dark tint they
have a clear one as well but that's just
a great easy easy option for glue I love
the red cherry number 43's if you know
someone who's not quite as adventurous
with the bigger lashes
more natural styles would be like the
salon perfect one tens or fifty three
want to give them some kind of a smoky
eye type quad one that I've been really
enjoying us from L'Oreal and it's the
smoky eyes quad and love to hate me this
is pretty because not only does it have
some standard smoky shades like a
charcoal and a brown but there's a
really gorgeous blue in there as well
kind of a jewel toned pretty blue I've
talked about this before I've used this
in and get ready with me video if you
want to see how it all comes together
but that's just one idea maybe it's just
the lips that they want to accentuate
you know I think a bold lip color it's a
lot of fun one that I think is very
wearable actually across the board is
the maybelline color whisper and very
ready this is a beautiful berry red
shade I think it's just stunning it's
really full color I mean it's not a
whisper it's like a pout or something
but it's really gorgeous and then my
final two things in this kit it
technically takes it to six products but
these are both really affordable and if
somebody doesn't have a lot of eye
brushes these are a couple of really
good ones to have it's the elf eyeshadow
brush and then the elf eye crease brush
so I think each of these are actually
really good quality brushes they're only
a dollar apiece and this one will help
you pack the shadow on your lid and this
is a really great size on this crease
brush for like an outer V or smudgy
smokey eye liner it's a nice
in-betweener kind of brush next bundle
I'm calling it gorgeous glow these are
some different products you can use to
give the complexion a little more
radiance so five things in here stop an
affordable highlight from Walmart that I
think is just great it's the hard candy
highlight intiki this is one of those
great highlights for giving you a glow
but not being too over-the-top shimmery
you don't necessarily think that the
matte highlights are for everyone and I
don't think the super sparkly ones are
for everyone either but this is one that
I think just about anybody could lay
into and get a pretty good look with so
again that's actually labeled as a
bronzer but I feel like that's totally a
highlight color and tea cream blushes
are a great way to add radiance to the
skin with great color payoff but yet not
too much of a powdery
and one that I love is from napola knits
the dream bouncy blush and Hot Tamale
I've talked about this J before I think
it's gorgeous the color on this is a
pretty kind of rosy coral type shade and
then another product that I think should
be thrown in with this is the elf small
stipple brush total game changer for
your cream blushes bronzers highlights
it works with these products so well you
can tap into and stipple it right on
your cheeks it's so easy applies the
perfect amount of pressure it's just
wonderfully sized and it's only three
dollars also I've been talking about it
a lot but it's the next dewy finish
setting the spray such a nice little
trick if you're real into makeup you
probably know about setting sprays but
maybe not all your buddies do is sit on
top of your finished makeup look it
takes away the powdery appearance it
helps the staying power and you don't
need to use much just one or two
spritzes I think makes it great
different it'll be scared by the word
dewy I just think it gives the face a
more natural appearance when you're done
with your makeup and a lip product that
I think adds a little glow to any lip
look and this is the Maybelline Color
sensational gloss and almond crush this
is a gorgeous poorly kind of like
champagne type color a little bit of
peach in there there's a swatch of that
I think it's beautiful topping off any
product it adds a look of fullness to
the lips if you just do it maybe on the
center of the lower Lari comfortable on
the lips too I don't think anybody's
gonna complain that their lips feel
sticky with this lip lovers I put
together some products in here that are
some of my top favorite lip products so
let's dig in first off an EOS lip balm
I love these sweet mint is one of my
favorites
I think the scent is so good the
textures really nice as well notice that
since the ingredients aren't exactly the
same in every EOS lip-balm
the textures can be a little bit
different one to the next but this is
one of my favorites for a light lip if
you really want to give somebody a treat
get them one of the Sonia Kashuk from
Target shine luck sheers the shade is
sheer pink lust and this is an absolute
mix between a lipstick and a lip gloss
the color is so beautifully shiny
radiant gorgeous look at that look at
that shine it's not
just multiples from this line and I have
a blog all about the other shades if
there's others that might interest you a
great line of glosses all around is the
NYX mega shine lip gloss this is the
color beige - classic pink tone you know
it's not wild it's not too bright but I
think it would work for so many people
one of the most comfortable lip products
on the market is the Neutrogena moisture
smooth color stick I thought I'd throw
in a red shade because I think everybody
needs a little bit of that during the
holidays this is the shade enriched
razors a look at rich race and see how
it's not too intense you know it's a
soft berry Ridge it comes off on the
lips a little bit softer less colorful
than the maybelline color whisper and
very ready that I showed in one of the
other kits and then on the Jordana twist
and shine balms this is cranberry crush
a great berry Shea and there's kind of
an extra element to these and that they
do last a really long time on the lips
like once the shine wears off you've got
a lot of color still hanging around so
here's what that shade looks like isn't
this a nice little range of colors and
finishes to give someone then they've
got the lip balm which makes a great
primer underneath any of these products
- finally a little kit on : nailed it
and this would be the product someone
could use to do a little manicure so I
put in five things again you could do
more less different products with any of
this stuff I'm talking about but one of
the things I really like is this true
blue paraffin super softening hand
lotion it comes from Bath and Body Works
so if you're doing this for multiple
friends there's usually like a deal on
little stuff like this like buy two get
one or I don't even know but it's a
really thick luxurious hand cream you
gotta have a file this is one I think I
got it from a dollar store in a pack of
like five or six four polishes we've all
got our favorites you might have your
favorite you want to pass along to
someone one of mine that I love is the
Sally Hansen diamond strength and nude
shimmer I love this shade because I
think it works with any outfit any look
that's going on any jewelry this looks
pretty with gold or silver jewelry it's
got almost a hint of a rosy look but
definitely shimmery it's like a rosy
champagne type color I think it's
beautiful and then
my favorite top coat is the Sally Hansen
mega shine adds a lot of shine dries
quickly helps extend the wear of your
manicure and kind of a newish discovery
to me that I love so much is from Essie
and it's the apricot cuticle oil this
stuff is the bomb you just put it a
little dab on each cuticle maybe you've
just finished your nails maybe it's
midweek and your hands are just really
really dry and your cuticles need extra
attention just put a little bit there on
the cuticle rub it in it feels so nice
and everything ends up looking so so
healthy I think any one you give this to
will fall in love with that product so
those are my little drugstore
do-it-yourself Beauty bundles again make
them your own sub in whatever you want
these are just some ideas and if you do
want ideas on more high end gifts or pre
put together gift sets I have a whole
review on pallets and gift sets on my
channel I'll link to that below as well
thanks for watching everybody I hope
you're having a great holiday season so
far and we'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
