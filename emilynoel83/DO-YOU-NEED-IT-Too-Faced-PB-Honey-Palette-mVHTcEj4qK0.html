today I'm talking about this brand new
palette from Too Faced it is the Too
Faced peanut butter and honey palette
and I snagged mine as one of those like
platinum perk early offer type deals on
ulties website got the notification that
this was in and you can get it a little
bit early so I've been playing around
with it and they say this is a limited
edition palette $36 and I kind of think
of it as the sequel to the peanut butter
and jelly palette which I was a big fan
of peanut butter and jelly frankly I
really enjoyed all the warm kind of
orange e browns in here paired with the
plums I thought it made for some kind of
unique looks over here with the honey
palette as you can see you're still
getting a lot of warm brownish tones but
it stays in more of a neutral place
you're not pulling the plums or the Sun
kind of purply shades you are getting an
interesting yellow color and what kind
of tides these palettes together is the
color called peanut but it's this matte
shade right here very matte warm brown
and that shade got started in the Too
Faced chocolate bar semi-sweet palette I
believe there are some things that I
like about this peanut butter and honey
palette some things I don't like so much
about it as well first off the packaging
is adorable it's got this kind of
honeycomb design around the outside
really looks cute beside you know the
peanut butter and jelly palette yet the
little bee the cute little face on there
it's definitely adorable to face majors
in cuteness and they do a good job with
it as far as shape selection a lot of
the palette is taken up with light
colors over here they always do this
this is kind of their general format
with their smaller nine color palettes
is that they have you know these larger
chunks over here and they're usually the
lightest shades but there tends to be I
think a little more separation of color
a little bit more difference in the
colors for example here in the peanut
butter and jelly palette was clearly
peachy one is like a gold and then one
is a matte cream color over here
everything while the shades are slightly
different the one up here has a little
bit of sparkle this one is a very soft
pink and this is your light creamy color
they do come off very similarly and I
wish there was more difference between
those shades because it does take up as
I said a lot of the palette this shade
up
here has a little bit of kind of faint
sparkle to it it's not a really like
chunky metallic type shade by any means
but you can look really closely at it
and see some sparkle these knees over
here this color has some shimmer to it
kind of a golden Sparkle and then going
nuts is kind of like a deep little bit
metallic Brown and then everything else
in here is matte going right down the
middle here I like how you've got three
distinct kind of I don't know statement
mid-tone matte shades you've got peanut
butter honey brittle and honey buns
honey brittle and honey buns I kind of
find myself wishing those shapes stood
out just a little more on the eyes and
in the swatches you can tell they're
just a little more faint than I was
expecting and two faiths typically I
feel like they're matte formula is just
amazing you know like it's really
buttery and smooth very creamy and nice
to work with on the eyes and I feel like
whenever I get a new Too Faced palette
whether it's something you know special
like this throughout the year or their
holiday palettes I go back to my natural
matte palette and I feel this texture
because this really is I think some of
the best that Too Faced has to offer and
oftentimes in their other palettes I'll
feel like yet you know in the chocolate
bar palette certain matte shades I'll
feel them and I'll think that's the kind
of feel that I remember from natural
matte it's really smooth there's a
richness kind of a thickness to the
product it goes on so well on the eyes
and it blends well on the eyes and I
feel like some of the matte shades in
the Too Faced
peanut butter and honey palette just
weren't quite so rich you know as these
there's a little more Sheerness in the
application with some of those colors
however I do think this beez kneez shade
over here this really pops and this can
make a big difference in your looks you
know when you're just going with maybe
some softer Browns and then you pop that
kind of rusty terracotta shade on there
it really does have an impact so I like
that color I think it's really nice and
bold because color called going nuts
it's kind of it kind of makes me go nuts
on some of the looks that I've done
because I've yet to be really satisfied
with that shade and you might think well
what's the big deal with it it's just
kind of a dark shimmery brown but it is
the darkest shade in this palette and
you're going to find yourself relying
that shape if you're confining yourself
to using only this palette you're going
to rely on that shade to create your
contrast and a little bit of shimmer
that it has I struggle to get it looking
really even and I felt that way even
about this look I used it you know on
the outside part of my lid and I use it
the other day as well and I thought it's
just not looking super even it's not
really anchoring the look in a really
solid like a clean-looking way like just
a matte shade would I kind of wish that
their darkest shade in this palette
would have been mad I mentioned liking
bee's knees and other shades that I
really do like in here is the color cult
feel and nutty it's a really nice brown
you can see it's kind of different from
peanut butter it's really like the exact
color of my coffee and I found that to
be a really pretty shade to use in
blending things out was pretty on the
lower lash line and I feel like that
shade and peanut butter those are a
couple of maps in here that have a
really nice smooth texture and then
honey brittle and Honeybuns I mean maybe
they're just like a little bit brighter
in color so I was expecting more from
them but they just seemed a little more
sheer than I was anticipating before I
get into like kind of my overall bottom
line on this palette and some
comparisons as well I do want to jump to
the tutorial and show you how I applied
this stuff so I used a primer all over
my lids first which I would always
advise with any eyeshadow and then I
went straight to the crease with the
color called honey brittle really tried
to diffuse that color quite a bit so as
I went along with the look I could blend
some other things in with it and then I
use beez kneez and that color like I
said it pops and that adds a lot of
reddish toned intensity to the look and
then I brought in honey buns the yellow
color just very lightly kind of around
the edge of the look to do a little
something different and then I used
queen bee right up under the brow and so
now we've established this whole like
soft kind of matte crease situation then
with a flat brush I took the shade
called going nuts and I padded that on
the outer part of my lid and just
gradually worked that inward and I'm not
saying this shade is like impossible to
blend or anything but it just seems to
have a little bit more of a patchy
appearance than I'd like and then I went
to cream honey and I used
that on like the inner third of my
eyelid and on the lower lashline i use
going nuts the deepest shade on the
outer part and I brought in Ceylon nutty
to kind of blend everything and soften
that up all the way in
as for the remainder of the look I used
a nude liner on my lower inner rim I did
black liquid liner across the upper lash
line winged it out applied mascara top
and bottom some false lashes as well and
I do think it's a pretty finished look
like I look at this in the mirror I
think yeah and like the little addition
of the yellow the warm Browns are really
pretty but then I end on this thought of
uniqueness and I know not everybody has
all the same palettes in their stash
that I might have but me personally I
feel like the makeup world is running
rampant with warm pallets these days
there's a lot of these kinds of tones
floating around in so many other
palettes and if you've already got the
peanut butter and jelly palette I
thought they did like I said earlier a
better job with these lighter shades and
giving you some different things not
feeling like you just had all one light
tone color over there and you're getting
all the warmth but you're doing some fun
purples as well as something about that
purple and warm Brown combo I thought
looked awesome from this palette here
you're getting some warm Browns and not
maybe quite as much fun different stuff
to mix it up that's just my opinion and
then I also think of the natural matte
palette and I look here and think if
you're really just into mac and maybe
even the reddish shade that I worked
into this look you think I might not
reach for that a whole lot you've got
this bottom row here that actually gives
you this honey butter shade not
comparing it directly to the yellow
because obviously that one's yellow this
one's kind of like a yellowish tan but
there's this warmish Brown down here as
well and if master you're saying this
palette is impeccable quality and it
gives you a little bit of that warm
Brown feel with this bottom row and then
got to mention the palette that I just
purchased I know it's more than double
the cost of this Too Faced palette my
eyes aren't warm mattes
I mean they're totally going there with
the orange with the yellow but the
intensity with this is so much more if
you are liking what you see here in your
thing
gosh I wish that was just stepped up
quality-wise and I love my Matt this
thing really takes you there with all
the warmth several tones of brown the
really deep kind of cranberry reddish
color a brighter reddish orange and then
the yellow and this my friends is a real
true like opaque yellow so if that's
what you like maybe it would be worth it
to you spend the extra on if I start
palette because there's more consistency
there there's more boldness pigmentation
with the color than there is throughout
this to face palette not that I dislike
this palette and I think to a lot of
people this might be something a
two-faced collector would like to have
the cuteness factor like I said is
totally there and it is wearable and I
can get some good looks out of it how
many different looks I don't feel like
there's a ton of variety in here and
like I said there are a few shades that
are lacking a little bit from what I
expected and there's so much lightness
happening here over on the left so to me
in this palette and it definitely goes
more into the 'want category than the
need category and by wanting it I mean
I'm wanting to have it because I pretty
much collect Too Faced ballads and I
think it's adorable and I do think I can
get a few good looks out of it I
certainly don't think it's going to
become one of my most reach for items I
don't think it's very unique there are
other palettes even beyond what I've
mentioned in this videos it can give you
these kinds of looks I can't believe I
haven't mentioned this yet but it does
have a scent to it
Too Faced loves to scent their product
they claim that it smells like peanut
butter and honey my nose is still a
little stopped up but I definitely am
getting that kind of a scent you know it
I don't know if I'd be able to put my
finger on it if somebody didn't tell me
it was being a veteran honey you know
that there is kind of this warm
sweetness happening there and I do like
that so let me know what you guys think
if you've tried this yet what do you
think of it is it something you're
planning to pick up I'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comment section and
I hope this review was helpful so I'll
see you guys soon bye okay I'm getting a
bad habit of signing off for the video
and then realizing right after that I
have more things I want to share I
wanted to share what was on my cheeks
and lips for this I'm wearing this blush
from the balm called bomb Springs it's a
pretty matte blush
kind of like a deep deep salmony color
my highlight on top of that is this new
one from Milani in zero one sunlight I
just kind of dust it across all these
shades and put that sort of right on top
of my blush and concentrated a little
bit of the lightest part of it right on
top of the cheekbones and then the honey
palette brought up this chocolate honey
thing in my mind from Too Faced the
melted chocolate so that is the shade
that I've got on my lips that's all for
real now guys thank you again and I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
