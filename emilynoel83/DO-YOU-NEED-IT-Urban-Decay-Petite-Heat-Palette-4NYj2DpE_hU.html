in today I'm gonna be talking about the
mini sequel to the Urban Decay Naked
heat palette it is called petite heat so
as you can see it's much smaller than
the original palette it does have the
same color scheme same kind of packaging
look on the outside if you look really
closely at it you can see roses on fire
and myself being petite five feet tall I
can relate to this palette I am fun size
I know my last few videos have been
pretty long so this will be a little
something for those of you who like
maybe a little bit shorter video from me
and I will still be doing the shop hush
palate reviews once I ordered a whole
bunch of the bad habit once I really
have a lot to go through so I know it's
gonna be like another few days for sure
before I can get that done so in the
midst of that I thought hey I'll bust
out my review on this petit heat palette
this is basically gonna be a comparison
with the original naked heat palette
just seeking to answer the question do
you need this little guy because I know
there are a lot of warm color scheme
palettes out there and before I really
read the description of what this
palette is I thought did they just like
plug in a few shades that already came
from naked heat because I did see a lot
of similarities the actual description
here of this little palette says
inspired by naked heat this petite
palette holds an all new lineup of
scorched neutrals use these six shades
alone or is the starting point for any
look with five matte shades for the lid
crease and liner plus one demi matte
highlighting shade this one on the end
is the one that has like a little bit of
Sheen to it and then everything else is
100% matte in that line up next to your
shimmer you do have this soft kind of
wheat oatmeal color this kind of the
color of my shirt that I'm wearing today
hot spell I think is a natural starting
point for a lot of people in the crease
and you will see me doing a look with
this palette today in this video by the
way a little demo Wild Thing feels like
a true orange to me it really mimics
just the color of the outer packaging
heist I would call a deep terracotta and
then we have strike which is kind of a
plummy Brown there's a little bit of
warmth to this a little bit of red in
that shade actually just looking at the
swatches here the only complaint that I
would have would be with the color
inhale that's that light shade with a
little shimmer I thought that was a
little bit lacking and when I've worked
that into my look and kind of tried to
use that as an act
cent type color I've wanted a little
more out of that shade I feel like I
have to build it up to get the impact
that I want but as far as the mats
they're pretty much everything that I
would expect from Urban Decay you know
they're pigmented they applied smoothly
and evenly on my eyes a color selection
if we're talking a warm all matte
palette I think it makes a lot of sense
I like that the darkest shade has some
element to kind of a reddish plumbing us
there because I think that pairs really
nicely with more orange shades the
warmest most like on fire color in this
palette is definitely Wild Thing your
true orange but if you cover that up and
completely leave that out of your look
you can still put together some things
that have that little element of warmth
but aren't quite so screaming at you
with orange so in itself I do like it as
a palette I tend to like this color
scheme just my own personal taste so
yeah I'm gonna be into this kind of look
that it can create but the big big but
here is what about the big naked heat
what if you already own this what are
the differences what are the
similarities to the smaller one like
what do you need to know as far as is
this worth buying if you already have
this well overall one big difference
that I can see when I'm looking up
closely at these palettes is the fact
that naked heat the full-size one here
is more reddish and it's completely
lacking that orange color that this has
and that's a really prominent shade like
when you work that into your look it can
really take it an extremely warm just
oranjee direction you know and so
without that color that's a big
difference between these two palettes
but the similarities are definitely
there with like every other shade I want
to show you what I did with the swatches
so I first swatched just the colors in
the petit heat and then I found any
shade out of this palette that I thought
was close to the existing shades here so
above inhale we have ounce that's the
soft shimmery shade in original Naked
heat chaser would be comparable to
vibrate sauced is a lot like hot spell
again wild thing the orange shade
there's nothing in naked heat that's
really like that Cayenne from the Naked
heat is a lot like heist and then ashes
is sort of similar to strike although
ashes is more of a straight-up plum and
strike has a little more red in it so
what gets me here is five out of the six
shades I can find really
pretty similar alternatives in the
original naked heat but the one that I
can't find an alternative to is like a
pretty big factor in the type of look
that you create right that warrant shade
but with so many other more Impala's out
there you might say no problem I've got
all those shades already somewhere else
like this is not extremely uncommon
let's face it it's one of those
decisions you've kind of got a look at
what you already have make the call for
yourself but the way I would look at it
is original naked heat is bigger so
there's more color variety in it if that
matters to you there's more red there's
many more possibilities to turn out a
really like reddish look in this palette
you've got a wider variety of finishes
here you've got matte and shimmer some
really metallic shades in this palette
here it may be a pro or a con it's all
matte except for that one shade so if
you don't find yourself using a lot of
shimmers maybe you want this if you
prefer a more orangie look maybe this is
your jam if you're already an owner of
naked heat you might say well I've got
this palette already and I've got an
orange that I like to use you know in
another palette or elsewhere in my
collection if that's your situation I
mean that's a pretty good call I think
for totally bypassing this palette
because if you've got this already and
you've got an orange somewhere you can
get pretty much any look that you can do
with this guy hopefully have laid out
enough situations here for you to make
that decision for yourself as to whether
or not you think you need this palette I
mean need is kind of a strong word you
know we're talking eyeshadows do we
really need more eye shadow I think
drawing these comparisons can be helpful
and I do want to show you a look I want
to show you this going on my eyes so
here we go for that first I primed the
lids and then I took hot spell and I
just used that to work up some contrast
in my crease I think that's a great
starting point kind of easy shade to
work in there and then I added some wild
thing in the outer corner mostly so
really warmed up the look with that
orange kinda blended out the edges of my
look with that vibrate color that is a
nice shade to have here just offers the
tiniest bit of color so it's really nice
for like fading out of your warmer look
into just your skin and then I used
inhale up under the brow as my highlight
filling up some intensity on the lid
I took heist and iPad
that pretty much all over the lid
leaving a little bit of a gap on my
inner corner I truly love that I
think that builds up a lot of warmth but
kind of there's a depth to it and then
strike I used that just in my outermost
corner both on the lid and into the
crease a little bit and then I found
myself pulling in a smaller brush and
really using that shade to kind of
change the shape of my eyeshadow and
pull it more in the direction of the
outer tip of my brow strike is dark but
it's not too dark it's not too far of a
cry from heist so those two shades do
kind of blend easily one into the next
and then I just used a little bit of
strike down on my lower lash line as
well this is not a real blower lashline
heavy look today so I just used a little
bit and then I finished my look with a
light liner in my lower inner rim that's
the wet-and-wild ultimate brow highlight
I've got my Jordana color Envy liquid
liner in black Envy across the upper
lash line and winged out I popped on
some mascara top and bottom some false
lashes these are very similar to a red
cherry number 43 and I just thought they
fit the shape of my look elsewhere on my
face my lip color I'm wearing today is
the L'Oreal infallible paints and this
is the spicy blush shade so one of my
favorite nude glosses ever the blush
that I'm wearing is from my Shanny blush
palette and it's this shape here this
sort of dusty rose bronze highlight
today do you guys remember me talking
about this Aesthetica palette I got from
Amazon it's the strobe series in radiate
tan to dark and I love this color right
here this has been used a lot it just
makes a really beautiful on cheekbone
highlight so petite heat again I love
the name petite heat that's really great
I love the size of the compact the
packaging is really cute if you were
coming to this video just to find out is
it good quality if I get it am I gonna
love it or am I gonna be totally
disappointed was this some unlikely flop
or something I do not think it's a flop
although I find this inhale shade to be
pretty subtle although I think that's
what they were going for considering the
rest of the palette was completely mad I
think they wanted to keep this color
with just a hint of Sheen so it may not
be as exaggerated of a shimmer as some
people might be going for but there's a
ton of overlap with the naked heat which
I found to be a little disappointing but
at the same time I do like all of those
shades biggest difference there
an orange in here there's not an orange
in The Naked heat and if you've already
got naked heat and you might have an
orange elsewhere in your collection you
might be just 100% set and could skip
this but if mats are your jam you like
the warmth you like the compact nature
of this not having to too many choices I
could see this being a good decision for
some people as well so just lay it all
out there for you guys thank you so much
for your time today I have so many fun
videos on my to-do list I'm so excited
look you guys are having a great day and
I will see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
