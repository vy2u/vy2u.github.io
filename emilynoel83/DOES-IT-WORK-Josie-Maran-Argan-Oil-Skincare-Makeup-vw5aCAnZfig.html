I am happy to have you here as always
and today I'm talking about kind of a
fusion of makeup and skincare with this
video I know I alluded to the fact that
I was going to be doing this on my
snapchat and Instagram stories weeks ago
if you follow those you may have seen me
show this little card here this Josie
Maran best skin of your life Argan
Beauty collection this was a QVC today's
special value a while back and I was
definitely sucked in during the
presentation I was kind of in a place
where I was open to trying some new
skincare things and then the makeup
elements that were also included in this
kit kind of took me over the top and I
decided yes I need this in my life raise
your hand if you've ever been sucked in
during a QVC presentation doesn't hurt
that Josie Maran is absolutely beautiful
has perfect looking skin and you just
like want to be using what she's using
I've been so tempted to get on here a
few different times and shoot this video
but I really wanted to make sure I was
getting very consistent results skin
care wise with the things that I'm gonna
be talking about because you don't want
to like you use a skincare product for a
couple days and then get on and give
your full review you know like I think
it really needs some time and I'm glad I
gave at that time because I've sort of
switched up the way I used it a little
bit to where now I feel like I'm in an
ideal place of using the skincare items
in this kit and it's been about like
between three and four weeks that I've
been using this now now I don't think
that this entire kit as a whole is still
available on QVC I'm not 100% certain on
that because I searched for it on the
app and it was kind of doing weird
things to me so I will check on that
I'll put any links that I can find in
the description box because either way I
know that these products are available
individually but what I got as part of
the kit is the Josie Maran pure argon
milk intensive hydrating treatment so
that's something that I know has been
around for a while but I never tried it
something that I have used on and off
like years back is this josie maran 100%
pure argan oil the product that her line
was really built around it's the organic
moisturizing oil okay so that's the
skincare stuff then I think this was
brand new
when this TSV launched it's the Josie
Maran whip
argan oil beauty butter ultra hydrating
velvet foundations so I was very excited
to try that I noticed when they were
displaying this on QVC that were showing
before-and-afters on people who had like
discoloration on their skin like I had
like melasma type mask of pregnancy and
they showed one layer and then they
showed another picture of like two
layers so basically just showing how
this is a buildable foundation and I was
really like ooh I want to see what that
does on my skin and then the fourth part
of the kit that I got is the black oil
mascara here so I'm gonna just talk
about how each thing has worked for me
and I'm going to start with the skincare
stuff and this is skincare that I use at
nighttime you're gonna see me in this
video like putting it on as though I'm
putting it on right at the start of my
day here under my foundation and I'm
just doing that for the sake of showing
you like how much of the product I use
and how it blends in and goes on but
this is my night time skincare these two
products and these two products only
reason being I feel like they are kind
of heavy sort of I don't know
luxuriously rich hydrating skincare
products and for daytime you know I
guess I'll use some pretty moisturizing
stuff but also make sure I've got the
SPF and all that this is not SPF just
very very intensive hydrating stuff
right here so the argon milk what even
is this stuff I really wasn't that
familiar with it I'd never tried it
until this order that I made and it's
got the little drop or design here just
like the regular argan oil has but it
literally does look like milk it's
creamy and it's kind of thin seaming but
yet when you start blending it on your
skin you can tell it's very moisturizing
they describe it as a 100% natural
hydrating serum micro droplets of argan
oil suspended in purified water absorbed
quickly for nourish plumper looking skin
and it says it's free of chemical
emulsifiers suited for all skin types
especially sensitive and they say to
shake it well and massage three to five
drops into face day and night after
cleansing I guess maybe I should give
you a little skincare backstory here
like where was I at to where I felt like
I wanted to overhaul my night time
skincare I have bounced around with a
lot of different things actually at
night time
and I think maybe the most recent thing
that I talked about on my channel was
even using some of that Sunday Riley
stuff I used the good genes kind of like
a serum type thing and then I used the
Juneau oil on top of that and I did feel
like I was getting nice moisturization
but I felt like moisturization was about
all I was getting out of that looking
back my skin wasn't doing then what it's
been doing now that I've been using the
argan oil stuff like I don't think I
really noticed an improvement in the
lines it was kind of like yeah my skin
feels hydrated when this stuff is on
here it is having a real lasting like
almost internalized effect on my skin I
didn't really feel like it so I was open
to trying this stuff so what I do with
the milk at nighttime on clean skin is I
use a pretty generous amount of this
stuff and I fill up the dropper and I
get quite a bit on my forehead I do like
a big drop there drops on my cheeks nose
and chin and I just get that all blended
in all over and it's kind of odd because
yes it looks like milk but it's not as
thin as a milky consistency you know I
feel like it's definitely intensely
hydrating yet it sort of has that serum
feel to it as well and on the bottle
here on the milk it says finished with
100% pure argan oil so that's where this
comes in and the argan oil is you know a
thin facial oil I feel like it's a
little thinner than some other ones I've
used it's definitely thinner than the
sundae Riley won the Juno Oil it's
thinner than I think tarts miroku Jo
oils definitely thinner than that far
Sally like rose gold elixir whatever
it's called oil but don't let that fool
you this is a very rich oil like it's
very very hydrating and with this it
says nature's richest source of
essential fatty acids antioxidants and
vitamin E nourishes dry sensitive and
normal skin and it says in just four
weeks 100% pure argan oil is clinically
proven to visibly improve the appearance
of fine lines and coarse wrinkles and
significantly improve skin smoothness
and hydration so that whole claim about
in four weeks visibly improves the
appearance of fine lines I am seeing
that you guys like I am noticing an
improvement right here on the like sides
kind of like under part of my eye you
guys know
I'm talking about the place that like
kind of squinches up when you smile and
make facial expressions and stuff I have
actually noticed an improvement in that
area I feel like it's a lot smoother and
I've been using this for like I said
between 3 and 4 weeks where I had to
make a little adjustment at first when I
got this stuff I slathered on this and
then I put what I felt like was a whole
lot of this on which is very
uncharacteristic of me normally I'd use
like not enough skincare at one time and
actually within the first several days
of using it at night that way I was
noticing a few little breakouts in
various places on my skin not like a
super deep
you know cystic type breakouts but just
things that led me to believe maybe I
went a little bit overboard with the oil
and was having some clogged pore issues
so I decided to scale back on this part
so I'm using the milk as you saw me put
it on all over my face pretty generously
and then with this oil I decided I would
just kind of confine this to my problem
areas like put it on my forehead and
then put a couple of small drops under
my eyes and just sort of blend it in
there in those parts and I also get a
little extra on my hands by the way and
I'll take it down my neck and chest area
too but since I've been doing it that
way I have had no breakouts I feel like
my skin has been smoother and more even
which I don't know if that even comes
back on these products or if that's
something else and I feel like my
natural skin tone without makeup has
been really good I wake up in the
morning I feel like my skin looks better
for having these products on and like I
said primarily the milk and then I use
this just really working it into the
areas under my eyes and kind of like
above my brows you know places where I'm
seeing other little wrinkles coming in
and it's just been working so well and
here's another thing I love about this I
am a breastfeeding mother right now I
really don't feel comfortable using skin
care products that are just chock full
of harsh anti-aging type things like I
just feel like I can't even go there so
knowing that this stuff is very gentle
and very natural I feel super good about
using these they say you can even like
put argan oil on your baby you know and
to moisturize their body in their face
so it is truly very very gentle stuff
but it is so moisturizing so I do think
you need to kind of strike a balance
that works for you between these two
things but I like using them together
and I feel like I've actually seen
results using them the way that I've
been the other big thing from this line
is the whipped argan oil beauty butter
and I have it in the shade medium this
is probably the most hydrating
foundation that I own and you'll notice
like they say here hydrates dry
combination and normal skin they're not
really putting this out there that this
would be a great thing for oily skin
people and I think there's a reason for
that this is a very rich hydrating
foundation but let me tell you it does
not look thick on the skin it is a
straight up medium coverage and that's
the way they kind of sell it but it is
buildable it's buildable and it will not
look thick as you add more on because
again it's got that hydration thing down
so if this were dry and then you started
building a building it would look makeup
be instantly because it's so hydrating
it can definitely build on itself I feel
like I see coverage that's very
consistent with what I watched in the
QVC presentation when they were showing
like a person's face with one kind of
base layer of this on and then built up
a little more just how nicely it seems
to blur away like bits of discoloration
on your skin
I've tried applying this a lot of
different ways I've used a Beauty
Blender that works okay but I think it
takes away from some of the coverage
I've also used a big like a rather full
buffing brush like a sigma f80
and for whatever reason I feel like
maybe it's the amount of moisture in
this foundation it kind of like Gunks up
the bristles a little bit I'm not sure
what's up with that so I've found that I
like using a smaller but still dense
brush like this pro mini flawless
airbrush from Sephora this is kind of my
chosen one that I really like using with
this or you could blend it in with your
fingers too but I just I don't know I
like using a brush with this so I just
dabbed this around on my skin start
buffing it in and then when I'm done I
kind of give myself a look and I say
okay where do I want just a little bit
extra it usually it's that area on the
top of my cheeks so I dab on a little
more one that in and I end up very
pleased with the finished look honestly
for it being medium coverage it does a
great job I have used this without even
moisturizing under it by the way and it
was still enough I think like I wasn't
feeling dry as the day went on but what
I will usually do under this
I'll put on my Kiehl's SPF 30 underneath
it so I have that sun protection and
then just put this on top because again
I'm not using this stuff in the morning
or as hydrating as this is the way I've
been describing it you guys are probably
thinking like oh my gosh your skin
probably feels sticky and tacky after
getting it all on not really that's the
odd thing like it does feel kind of
velvety soft definitely hydrated like
you know your skin has had a huge drink
of moisture here but it's not sticky
that being said I do feel more
comfortable giving it a light bit of
setting powder all over so like the way
I finished my look after putting this on
I used Tarte shake tape today under my
eyes and then I set it all just lightly
all over my face with the peach perfect
matte powder from Too Faced the loose
powder little blush little bronzer a
little highlight and that is the skin
today I'm very very pleased with it I
think my dry skin people or normal skin
people even who don't maybe need the
fullest coverage but a strong medium
buildable coverage would be a good thing
for you you may want to check this out
now compared to tarts empowered hybrid
gel foundation that kind of reminds me
of this that feels a little bit thinner
going on okay this feels even more
hydrating than that whereas the tarte
even though it's hydrating I think it
could work for most any skin type this
one I wouldn't necessarily recommend to
the oiliest people out there because
again lot hydration now the final part
of this kit is the black oil mascara and
again I think this is something that's
available on its own when you hear about
an oil mascara you're probably thinking
like oh is it runny is it inky or
something honestly the formula of this
just to look at it and like see it come
out of the tube it seems like any other
just sort of creamy mascara formula it's
it's very average it's not too thick
it's not too thin the brush has like
this little bumpy bumpy bumpy bones
thank know I got ears rather large it's
natural seeming bristles not plasticky
bristles this mascara is just okay for
me I mean it might be doing great things
from a conditioning standpoint for my
lashes because it does say it has 100%
pure argan oil in it
it's 91% natural has 24-hour wear they
say it lengthens
okay with two coats like I'll show you
going on here just for one coat first
and it's nothing nothing special you
know it doesn't really build up great on
the lashes like it just is very natural
okay that's what it is and then I go
back and I add one more coat and I can
start to see more of a lengthened effect
out of it I don't feel like it's the
greatest holding the curl it's not like
they immediately droop but by midday I'm
looking at myself in the mirror thinking
those lashes weren't up where they were
when I curl them and I find the brush a
bit bungle some it's a little bit larger
than I like to use to really be able to
have the control to get into the inner
most lashes and stuff
also it smudges like a bear on the lower
lashes like I mean the day I wore this
on my lower lashline I looked like a
raccoon like it transferred so badly
underneath I don't have any transfer
issues from my lashes here to my brow
bone I guess that's because they've lost
some curls so they're not coming in
contact but yeah I will probably
continue to just for the sake of using
this up continue to use it on and off
but I will not put it ever again on the
lower lashes because that was not pretty
and here's the thing I remember during
the presentation Josie Maran was like
yeah I just put this on and sleep in it
like I am so curious as to what she
looks like when she wakes up in the
morning not that it's that important but
like is she smudged all over with this
because just normal wear throughout a
day not even napping I'm like black
underneath here from the lower lashes so
guys that is my take on the best skin of
your life argon beauty collection some
really great things going on here again
I'm happy that I've found some natural
skin care products that I can actually
see results from that don't have like
super harsh anti-aging ingredients in
them that I'm scared of putting on my
body due to the fact that I'm still
breastfeeding you know I want to be
really careful about that so these two
things for my nighttime skincare I think
are great my foundation you guys know I
wrote eight foundations a lot so it's
not like I'm using this every single day
or consider this to be like an essential
makeup hybrid skincare item that needs
to be used along with these I think you
could take this or leave this depending
on what your foundation
preferences are but I use it
occasionally I like it I think it's the
most hydrating foundation that I own and
I like that it truly is buildable but
doesn't look more obvious on the skin
even when you build it up so thank you
guys so much for your time and thanks
for your patience and letting me you
know fully try this stuff out before I
got the review out to you I appreciate
your kind words so much by the way my
comments sections are like the happiest
places ever it's truly just amazing and
I thank you so much for that so I will
talk to you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
