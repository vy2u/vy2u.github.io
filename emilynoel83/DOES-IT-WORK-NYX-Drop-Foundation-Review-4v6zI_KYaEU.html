about the Knicks total control drop
foundation so looks like this comes in a
little bottle I found mine at my local
Ulta store I wear it in the shade
natural and this comes in a pretty
impressive shade range 24 shades and it
sells for $14 I've gotten a lot of
questions about this foundation
primarily how it compares to the cover
FX custom cover drops and if it's as
much coverage if it's a dupe in this
video I'll definitely be giving you my
comparison to this product also a
comparison to a product that I think is
kind of on the other end of the spectrum
foundation wise and it's the Make Up For
Ever water blend foundation so I'll sort
of tell you where this NYX product Falls
but just as far as the format of this
product it's a little frosted glass
bottle you're getting point four three
fluid ounces in here got this little
dropper and you can see that it is a
totally liquid consistency product
there's really no thickness to it
whatsoever
I'd say it's maybe just slightly thicker
than the consistency of water the claims
on this it says from sheer to full your
ideal coverage is just drops away
fine-tune this velvety matte foundation
says what more coverage add more drops
and there is a brush that they're
selling alongside this and I saw it in
the display I'm in my Ulta store it's
called the total control drop foundation
brush and from what I could see it was
sort of a dense slightly angled brush
and so I thought I've got a lot of dense
foundation brushes at home that I will
use with this and I didn't feel the need
to buy a new brush a concern for me
about this foundation is the fact that I
don't think it ever truly achieves full
coverage with the cover FX custom cover
drops one drop two drops three drops
like that truly makes a difference the
thought of using a very small amount of
this product or adding just a tiny bit
more like it really has an effect and
you can get just completely full
coverage with this this product is not a
foundation mixer so much like the cover
FX custom cover drops are this is more
of a standalone Foundation which NYX
claims for it to be but I just don't
think the whole drop by drop concept is
quite so
I feel like it's going to take about you
know four or five drops to use all over
my face and then before I see any
contrast or build ability from that it's
going to be you know maybe another
several drops I don't feel like one drop
two drop three dots it's not that kind
of a drastic effect that you see from
this because it is so so thin it's much
thinner than the cover FX custom cover
drops it can build to a medium coverage
for me but it's just not something
that's taking me full coverage I mean I
think about foundations that are full
coverage and it's just not doing it I
think about Estee Lauder Double Wear
even regular Double Wear not the maximum
cover it doesn't get as full coverage as
that it's not going to get as full
coverage as the Urban Decay all nighter
and again not a dupe for the function of
the cover FX custom cover drops either
I'm not saying if you wanted to mix a
couple drops of something like this in
with a moisturizer and just give
yourself a very sheer tint of color you
couldn't do that because I think that's
completely an option The Dropper style
really lends itself to mixing and
blending in with other things but it's
just not going to take you to the
fullest coverage place that cover FX
cover drops will so I want to show you a
little bit more about the application
right now and they'll go into more of a
comparison to another foundation product
that I think is kind of similar the way
I choose to apply this which I'm not
saying it's like the right way or the
only way but I just drop out a few drops
on my finger and I just start spreading
that around on my skin just kind of
roughly where I think I'm going to need
it and then once I get that all patched
around I grab my Sigma f80 which I think
maximizes the coverage of a foundation
like this most I feel like the
consistency of this product is so thin
when I use a sponge with it there's a
tendency for some of this product to
almost get more absorbed into the sponge
and not so much spread out all over my
skin so I get it all blended in and what
I see is a matte finish it's not matte
to an unnatural extent you know it does
look nice as far as the overall finish I
can get really close to my skin and I
feel like yeah you know it doesn't look
too heavy but it definitely does
mattify and it's a true medium coverage
even after going back to apply about
four more drops to my skin in certain
areas where I had the most discoloration
I still felt I was seeing some freckles
and spots through it you know it wasn't
just fully covering my skin it's not
full coverage for a medium coverage
foundation I gotta say it feels great on
the skin it does feel super lightweight
because it is so crazy thin and after
just you know kind of sitting on my skin
for a couple of minutes I felt like okay
I'm not feeling any kind of tackiness on
my skin it felt nice and smooth without
feeling absolutely dry as a bone was
there that's me
oh hi hey hello everyone you say Happy
New Year back to Boyd I'm love you
staying power wise I have been looking
at the way this is worn on my skin on
and off over the course of a couple of
weeks so I mean I do think the one day
you know staying power test can be
valuable from a visual perspective like
in a video for the viewer to see how a
product wears on one given day but I
really appreciate it when people are
looking and kind of analyzing and trying
to make sense of a foundation over a
period of days too because sometimes
you're not always putting that
foundation through the same rigors you
know and you just find out more things
about it the more you wear it that's
just the way makeup is I've been trying
to really look at this with minimal
setting powder on top like all apply
maybe a little bit of bronzer and blush
where I want it but I've been trying to
keep the powder on my skin very light
any time I've tried this because I just
want to see what will this foundation in
this foundation alone do on my skin as a
day wears on and very consistently I see
it wearing down on my nose and I'm not
incredibly oily I am a normal skin type
right now like I'm not that dry I don't
really have many dry patches to contend
with right now and I'm not overly oily
either but definitely by I would say
evening time so if I start putting this
foundation on about 5:00 a.m. by about
5:00 or 6:00 in the evening I look at my
skin and I can see you know my nose
looks almost bare
from product at times I have seen a
little wear down perhaps around the
forehead but it's not super obvious and
I do credit the thinness of this
foundation for that you know it's so
light and thin on the skin that even as
it does wear down it doesn't do so in a
really obvious or patchy way but think
of areas like your nose perhaps that
might produce a little more oil and it's
not going to take a whole lot of oil to
actually break it down in those zones so
moving forward whenever I wear this I
would be pretty mindful of setting like
the t-zone and I think I would have
better staying power there now I want to
talk about another foundation that is
very similar to this in my eyes
consistency wise it's perhaps just a
little bit thinner it's the makeup
forever water blend they feel so similar
going on the skin and blending out and
the other day I actually did a
half-and-half test with these I just
wanted to see how similarly they would
wear and just as far as the look on the
skin initially this is even more sheer
this does provide more coverage than the
water blend I took down a few notes here
I saw a bit of a glow on the makeup for
ever side like very natural it wasn't
quite as matte of a finish as NYX even
lighter coverage I could see the
freckles more on the make up forever
side even though I really could see
freckles on both sides overall and the
dry down on both seem to be about the
same about 75% I would say because I
could still feel a hint of moisture on
both sides and then as they wore
throughout the day you know the NYX held
up a little bit better because I felt
like my skin looked a bit more modified
from the start and then I could notice
that kind of carrying through throughout
the day but still the entire nose area
like neither Foundation could really
hang on to the end of the day for that
so if we've got a little line up you've
got your cover FX on the one end that
can go very extreme coverage definitely
the type of product where it's so
concentrated it only takes that tiny bit
added to you know maybe another product
like a sheer foundation a tinted
moisturizer a regular moisturizer
it only takes a tiny amount to get an
effect from that this product the NYX is
in the middle because it's not as
concentrated it's going to be a
standalone foundation that you're just
going to wear as is not that you
couldn't mix it you could mix any
foundation but I think it's designed to
be a foundation worn in itself you can
vary the amount of drops that you apply
and achieve more coverage but it does
not take you to a full coverage place in
my opinion and then you know at the
sheerest end of the spectrum you've got
this water blend that feels so so
similar to the NYX but not as matte of a
look on the skin but I do kind of see
some similarities and staying power
although I think the NYX overall is a
little bit better at least on my skin
that way so my bottom lines on this
foundation would be and the things I
like about it first off the thin texture
I think is really nice it feels good
going on the skin if you apply it with
fingers you do feel kind of an easy to
blend velvety softness with this and I
like that it's buildable because I can
you know start in one place I can add
some more but I feel like whereas with
custom cover drops adding one drop makes
a difference with this adding one drop
doesn't so much make a difference you
got to add like maybe four to five drops
to really see a pronounced difference on
your skin coverage wise and even with
that I mean I feel like at times I've
used a lot of this product and just have
not achieved full coverage so that would
be one of the cons is that I don't think
it takes you completely full coverage I
also don't think it's a foundation
that's really built for staying power
either I look at kind of one of the gold
standards in both of those categories
would be like an Estee Lauder Double
Wear also I've really enjoyed that Urban
Decay all nighter foundation their full
coverage and they really do hang on all
day on your skin for this one yes it's
going to feel thinner more lightweight
but it's also going to break down a bit
more quickly and just not achieve Super
Bowl coverage on your skin and given
what I've noticed staying power wise on
my skin if you're very oily you are
going to want to set this I'm normal and
I can see a portion of my skin where I
really should be setting this and it's
primarily the t-zone area
you've gotten this and tried this and
your different skin tone skin type from
me please share your experiences in the
comments section because I think that's
super useful for people who are trying
to sort of make up their minds I don't
expect everyone to have had the exact
same experiences I have had but
hopefully what I've put this foundation
through and the comparisons that I've
made give you a little perspective or a
little more understanding about what
this foundation is like so thank you
guys so much for taking time out of your
day to watch I really appreciate it and
I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
