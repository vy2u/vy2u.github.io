with a little bit of dollar-store glam
the stuff on my eyes cheeks and lips and
even a little concealer is from Dollar
General
I was randomly in there about a couple
weeks ago just picking up some various
really random things like I needed paper
towels and some diapers and whatnot and
I noticed they had a new makeup display
for Broadway makeup and so that line I
had only ever seen that brand offering
like some false lashes
sometimes at Dollar General but now they
had this whole display and it had eye
shadow palettes and some brow stuff face
pallets lip colors I mean pretty much
everything so I picked up some things
that I thought might be workable things
I was really interested in then trying
to mount now on and off for a couple of
weeks so I thought I would bring you my
results and honestly it's mostly really
good stuff in this video was like just a
couple of duds so I'll cover it all and
I'll try it on or swatch it for you as
well a few of these palettes I can't
remember the exact price but I want to
say nothing was over five dollars I
think those might have been around four
dollars got some three dollar items and
some 50-cent eyeshadows and a $0.50 lip
balm I can't believe it I just get a
thrill out of drying this stuff and
seeing if it actually work first thing I
want to mention is this la colors
concealer palette and it has this little
shade at the end that it identified that
the corrector and so that's the most
like peachy pink shade in the bunch and
then you've got three kind of varying
skintone shades one is really light one
a little bit more yellowish and was kind
of like a different just a more
yellowish peach and this little palette
was labeled medium and I didn't see any
other things in stock this is not the
Broadway line this is the LA Colors line
they have a lot of LA colors pretty much
all the time at Dollar General but I've
tried this out you've been wearing this
for a few days and I've realized it
actually does a pretty good job what I
would say this is lacking is a little
bit of moisture for meeting is this is
something that I'm putting on my under
eye area primarily and I would love to
have just a little bit richer texture to
put there because sometimes these can
look just a little bit dry not super dry
I mean I
tried some really subpar things from LA
Colors concealer wise and I know how dry
they can be these aren't bad and using a
little bit better like eye cream making
a point to maybe use a little bit more
of it that can help these products quite
a bit but I applied this correct or
color like in my darkest area and then I
just layered the lighter shades on top
of that I've done different sort of
mixtures of these products but I'll also
use that lightest color just on the high
points of my face to sort of highlight
and create a little more contrast with
my overall skin tone and I had my best
ma stick foundation on before this by
the way and so I just blend it all in
with my little Sigma p84 brush and the
end result is actually pretty decent
coverage and this is just a little three
dollar concealer palette you know who is
this for I think this might be for the
person who has never tried a corrector
before like a peachy tone corrector and
you just want to see like what it would
do for you you may or may not like this
formula depending on how dry your skin
is in your under eye area but it really
is giving you a pretty decent range of
the peach tones with this really like
deeper peachy pink and then a peach
that's more yellowish a straight-up
light yellow banana colored concealer
and then this really light one so maybe
you know before you splurge on something
expensive if you've never explored the
corrector concept this might be a good
place to just check it out and try now
in the little demo you're seeing
throughout this video I will have
skipped ahead a few steps I put on a
little bit of powder I used some bronzer
and I did my brows and then you'll see
me coming in with this cheek palette now
this is from Broadway it's called the
powder cheek palette kit and it is made
up of one kind of subtle highlight and
three matte blushes and these are so
good such a great Buy I have this in the
shade spring and I think they had a more
intense version I can't remember what
the name of it was but there was
something deeper and richer yet compared
to this one and I just love all of these
shades honestly I mean that highlight
it's the kind of thing that I build up a
little bit you know just a light amount
of this
necessarily go super far but it reminds
me of a mixture of like Laura Geller's
baked french vanilla blended with
something that's got a little more Sheen
you know so it's kind of a step up from
that type of highlight but then these
blushes are so so pigmented they kind of
remind me of the city color be matte
blushes that are so good but you're
getting them here in a palette form
which is a lot more handy and I love
this peach it was kind of deep warm like
dark dusty rose and then a pretty mob
here so the one I put on today primarily
like here on the apples of my cheeks was
the slightest peach I think that's
absolutely gorgeous and then I like to
take the deeper peach deeper kind of
dusty Rhodes peach and put that a little
bit lower on the cheeks and I love the
end result that's so pretty I've
definitely used this Mavi shade and that
looks great as well but then for today's
look I layered on a little bit of that
highlight and I think the glow is
actually quite pretty I love topping
that off though with a setting spray
it's just not one of those ultra dewy
shiny looking highlights you know what I
mean it's got a little bit of powder
eNOS to it so I think you can definitely
combat that by putting some setting mist
on but I really do like the finished
look and you would be so surprised that
these blushes came from a dollar store
for just you know a few bucks now I want
to move on and talk about the eyeshadows
I found which I was really pleasantly
surprised by these are these twelve
color eyeshadow kits this one is called
Aphrodite and here we're looking at some
kind of cool plummy shades topes
grays this reminds me so much at a
glance of the Too Faced boudoir eyes
palette because not only is it those
shades that I mentioned but also a
couple of kind of peachy rose shades and
that's totally like that palette I don't
know if they still make boudoir eyes but
this is really the kinds of shades that
that palette was made up of and then
this was the one that really caught my
eye the Medus Maeda's palette here and
let me say while in this one you've got
like three matte shades this one is
pretty much well you've got the one
matte up here in this corner but
everything else is either a kind of
pearly shimmery finish
a totally metallic finish but I really
like to see these warm colors down here
this gold and the rust and you got kind
of a burgundy here a plum and
interesting kind of I don't know pinky
purple mix with that shape this
Aphrodite one I just thought it was so
beautiful it's washed out so well it
applied really well on my eyes I did
just a super classic look with this
palette the other day and I thought dang
you know I wouldn't have thought like oh
that's something you just rounded up at
the dollar store and made it work like
it was legitimately easy to use a nice
shades to work with and I did use my
Milani eyeshadow primer I've been using
that the whole time I've been like
playing with these palettes but truly
nice textures in here I wasn't having to
work really hard to build them up I
would say they're to the point of being
like so super intense as let's say wet
and wild comfort zone palette you know
how those can be just really we barely
touch into them and you've got plenty of
product these shadows aren't quite that
way but at the same time I'm not working
hard with them like I'm not having to
scrub into the products really with a
couple of exceptions that I'll talk
about in this next palette there
generally speaking a pretty good formula
and I was pretty surprised to round this
up at VG but this next palette this
Metis one this is a really pretty
assortment of shades I mean you look at
that you see the bronzes the plumy tones
but also those really warm pops with the
gold and arrest these two shades here I
got to say when I first swatch them I
thought and those aren't quite so good
but then I realized they are a slightly
different formula like once I applied a
little more pressure and just really
tried to pick some product up out of
there
it came you know it was like I don't
know if I had to work through some sort
of little upper layer of the product and
when I apply this with a brush
specifically these two shades I do kind
of I don't know work my brush into it
just a little bit more and then I get
beautiful applications so you can't
always judge things by the very first
swatch you take you know because
sometimes they just apply differently
but there are some truly beautiful color
combinations you can get out of this
palette the first time I used it I did
more of Aegeus warm reddish look I
worked in not only
that golden shade but also the rust the
burgundy color some of the bronzes and
you can just get that super super warm I
look then for today's look I'm pairing
that gold pop on the lid with a little
bit more plum so I'll walk you through
how I did that first off after applying
the Milani eyeshadow primer I use this
kind of bronzy color in my crease just
kind of get things going there and then
I blend it a little bit of that mauve
shade just up above it to give me a
little different look on the transition
then I blend it over that with a bear
brush and I use that light matte color
as my highlight up under the brow then I
padded that gold shade over the
innermost part of my lid this color can
take a little building up just depending
on how intense you want it and then I
use some of that purple that's right
beside it on the outer part of my lid
and then to really intensify my crease
and outer V area I use the darkest plum
in this palette and I thought it just
worked really well at the very pigmented
shades then after I did my black liquid
liner I used again some of that plum
just underneath the wing and then I
blended in one of the bronze II shades
throughout the rest of my lower lash
line and I popped on some really intense
lashes today I just found these like in
this little lash holder I don't even
remember what the style is I think they
were maybe some of those Coco lashes but
I'm not positive but whatever the case
they're rather intense but yeah I'm
really happy with the look and it's just
fun to find these surprisingly good
things from Dollar General now a couple
of other eyeshadows that I came across
are these 50 cent ones so they have the
baby pop eyeshadows like a shimmery
collection I guess and then the LA
Colors matte so these are all by la
colors so I got one from each collection
I would have gotten more mats but like
one shade broke and the little bin and
everything was getting all like messy so
I just got this one shade which was
definitely the one I was most interested
in it's called forbidden it's this
beautiful matte like rusty burgundy and
it's so gorgeous
like seriously $0.50 it's really
pigmented very smooth not at all patchy
like just a really high-quality shadow
there
this other one called white shimmer not
nearly as impressed with this this was
flaky it really didn't build up very
easily on my eyes I feel like there are
just zillions more great like shimmery
eyeshadows you know but I was really
surprised that the matte was the better
of the two because I think that matte
texture can be harder for brands to
really nail but 50 cents people also in
that 50 cent range I got one of these
lip balms the mint one and it's nice you
know there's nothing wrong with this it
kind of reminds you a little bit of soft
lips not only for the size but also kind
of the texture and feel on the lips but
yeah it's just a little mint lip balm
fifty cents and then I got these $3 true
matte lipsticks and these they also have
liquid lipsticks I was kind of like an
I'm over it I don't really want to just
dive into a bunch of those but the
shades I chose for these were nude rose
which is the shade I've been wearing
throughout the video and lemon pie which
is kind of a berry magenta this is a
kind of shade I don't know I've got a
lot of in my collection this kind of
shade I'm getting more of in my stash
but this is a really fantastic formula
you see how it it really does appear
matte but guys this is actually like
creamy on the lips this shade is so good
if you've been wanting kind of that mob
dusty Rhodes
this would be a great one to try I think
it's absolutely beautiful and so
surprisingly
uncomfortable on the lips and I don't
know if I said but these are from the
Broadway line again and there's no real
like scent to them they don't seem like
a super cheap lipstick at all I was just
really happy with these they kind of
remind me of the feel and the comfort
level of like the Maybelline matte
lipsticks only those probably run you
more like around six seven dollars and
these are going to be like three this
Broadway line by the way it says
manufactured for kiss products and I
know kits for making like all kinds of
false eyelashes that you see in
Walgreens and stuff so apparently they
got this little brand called Broadway
under their umbrella
now one dud that I tried and I kept a
little outer packaging here this
Broadway waterproof defining mascara I
thought I might just try a new
waterproof mascara because I'm going to
be going to the beach soon
and I thought this brush actually might
be a lot like my clump crusher water
resistant and it's actually quite a bit
bigger than that and the formula is
pretty wet like it goes on your lashes
and it's kind of hard to build on top of
itself I was wearing this the other day
not even putting it under any especially
wet circumstances you know I was just
wearing it throughout the day and I had
smudges on the lower lash line so that's
a total deal-breaker for me I mean if
it's going to be waterproof and plus it
was a pain to remove that's what I don't
get it was able to smudge totally easily
on my lower lash line but then when it
came to actually getting it all the way
off it took me so much time so not a fan
of this would not recommend it it's a
no-go and I guess the other dud of
everything that I tried was probably
this white single eyeshadow but the rest
of it I mean that cheek palettes awesome
those eyeshadow palettes are nice the
matte lipsticks are really good next
time you're running into your local VG
for paper towels and diapers you might
just breeze through the makeup area and
see if any of the stuff catches your eye
because some of it definitely is good
quality I think I might branch out and
try a few more things the next time I'm
there so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this was fun and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
