little different kind of video actually
a lot different kind of video because
instead of talking about what's new and
wonderful or even new not-so-good things
in the stores I'm talking about older
stuff it seems like months ago I did a
video called what's old at the drugstore
that you've overlooked and it was some
product recommendations just things that
I feel like have really gone under the
radar since there are so many new
releases in the drugstore all the time
and so today I kind of wanted to play
off of that idea but I wanted to use
products that were some of the first
products I ever used when I started
makeup and let me tell you it was 100%
drugstore when I started I don't think I
touched a high-end makeup product till
sometime maybe mid college years and
that was when my sister started gifting
me like those Sephora gift sets yeah she
started this Beast so this is why I've
got this Walmart and drugstore like in
my soul I grew up in a tiny tiny rural
area I still kind of live in a rural
area drugstore makeup is what tends to
be convenient in those spots and this
was kind of before the days of just hop
it online and ordering up whatever you
thought you needed so in this bag I
filled it with a full face of products
some of them I had to go out and buy
some I you know happen to have because
I've continued using them over the years
but a full face of some of the things
that were the first products I ever
bought makeup wise or that my mom and
dad may have bought for me and part of
the fun of this video is that I'm not
going to love everything I know this
because I kind of did a trial run of
this look the other day and I thought
hmmm you know there's not all stuff I
love in here but I actually did create a
pretty decent look and I think what I'm
bringing to this now is hopefully a
little more knowledge in application
after all these years because I think
application is you know one of the most
important aspects so I can apply some
new knowledge these older products a lot
of these things you know you just don't
hear talked about on YouTube anymore so
it's going to be fun but what's so
interesting I'm sorry for this long
rambling intro but so many brands
really changed their entire lineup
top-to-bottom since the beginning you
know and you try to think of an
eyeshadow that you started using in the
late 90s that's probably when I started
with late junior high I'm thing in
seventh eighth grade I remember getting
ready for cheering at basketball games
at that time I had my little makeup bag
now you think back to an eyeshadow that
you used in the late nineties if you're
around my age what is still on the
market anymore I mean almost every line
has completely changed except a few
things from covergirl and covergirl is
one of the brands that has really kept a
lot of the same things you know I'm sure
there's been reformulations repackaging
but covergirl I've noticed has had some
products in their line certain shades in
their line that they have had in their
forever this is just some of the first
stuff I got into for whatever reason my
mom wasn't really directing me on what
to buy it was like I think I was looking
around at what friends were using and
trying to use some of that stuff and a
lot of the stuff is covergirl I don't
know why maybe some of that stuff was a
little cheaper maybe the brand just
seemed a little more approachable to me
it's funny to like put your mind back
where it was when you were like you know
just starting out with makeup but anyway
I know I'm going to be talking a lot
throughout so let's just get going and I
already have my skin moisturized I
already have an eye cream on and the
first foundation I remember using is
something from covergirl called ultimate
finish and it says liquid powder makeup
and I remember I first had it in the
shade creamy natural that's what I have
again the packaging is a little bit
different but oh my goodness is that
ever the same basic product that I had
when it was like 7th 8th grade and you
might be wondering like Emily how do you
remember you know all the stuff that you
started out with and it's crazy because
I remember everything it's kind of like
asking my dad to give play-by-play of a
college baseball game he pitched at like
he could tell you everything and I'm
that way with makeup so yesterday I went
to apply this and I just used the sponge
that was in here and I wasn't that
stoked about coverage so I think I'm
going to try a Sigma f80 I'm going to
try like going directly into the product
here and just see what I can muster
no that wasn't the word I was looking
for but that's okay
it picks some up yeah that's a little
better coverage I must say so this is a
true cream to powder product if you rub
this between your fingers you can feel
the creaminess at first and then it kind
of goes dry so it definitely does set I
don't know why I started with this
particular product but it must have
seemed less intimidating to me I'm
guessing than just buying a bottle of
liquid foundation that's my I'm guessing
that was my mindset I need a little bit
more targeted stuff right in here in the
under eye area so I'm just gonna I'm
picking some up with my finger I'm
certainly guessing I didn't have these
under-eye circles to contend with when I
was in seventh grade but who knows that
was not a particularly good time in my
life uh junior high years hey it was the
start of a new era of makeup use right
and then of course I use makeup
throughout high school I would say high
school was the time when I was really
starting to like experimenting and
branching out a little bit more creamy
natural hmmm might be just a hair light
for me on this day but that's alright I
probably should have actually looked at
the shade selection instead of being
like ooh creamy natural that was the
color I had I feel like it's just
straight up medium coverage kind of
buildable but not the kind of thing you
want to build too much if you've got dry
areas it kind of like looks very matte
on top of those you know definitely
feels like kind of a soft powder ish
finish on the skin next I need a
concealer I know this was the first ever
concealer that I used and it's the
covergirl clean invisible concealer and
I got it in the shade light and it's a
really like I think average liquidy
concealer like this stuff can't touch
tart shaped tape but for just minor
little problems here and there yeah
it'll work so I'm going to put some
around my nose so I got a little redness
showing through I don't like I feel like
a little redness on the top of my nose
that I could deal with this is kind of
light coverage it's probably going to
look like I'm laying it on thick but I'm
going to really go around my under-eye
extensively and into my little areas
there that I lovingly refer to as the
caverns I've got this Malley
double-ended brush this was the thing
that actually came with that palette I
was raving about in my best in beauty
video and I said you know it's too big
for my eyes for eyeshadow but I love it
for some concealer so I'm just going to
dab this product in all over it's not
the coverage I'm accustomed to now but
if you just had little issues you know I
could see it being enough like just the
redness around my nose yeah it can do
that but on top of this cream to powder
makeup it kind of looks cakey and I
doubt I had the proper blending tools in
seventh or eighth grade so what was I
walking around looking like honestly my
skin probably didn't even need half the
things I was putting on it I feel like I
should have like a late 90s playlist
going like in the background wouldn't
that be awesome but I don't know about
the YouTube like you know copyright
stuff if I could get away with that but
that's what I'd want to be doing I still
feel like I've got darkness here and
this was the staying power concern for
me actually yesterday when I was wearing
this look I felt like the under eye
circles kind of came back through but my
overall face makeup that was covered in
this stuff seemed to do okay so yeah
this invisible concealer there's maybe a
reason for that name
now for powders I think I remember
feeling like I had an oily skin issue at
that age so I was buying the Maybelline
shine-free pressed powder and I actually
had continued to buy this alright I
repurchased it sometime
more recently and have used it a lot and
hit pan on it and it's in the shade
golden so I'm just going to dab this on
with my ELF complexion brush and kind of
use that setting the under eye a bit I'm
not going to do a ton of powder
elsewhere just because I've got cream to
powder foundation on now my very first
bronzer I ever purchased I believe it
was from the bonnie belle line now
there's a line where a lot of my lip
products came from like before I ever
got into makeup makeup I was all about
the lip smackers and then remember lip
licks and lip lights like those gateway
makeup products that body bill was
putting out and she had bronzers and eye
shadows and I got into that stuff too
but that's of course a line that's not
available anymore but I remember one of
the earliest things that I ventured into
from another brand was this Rimmel
natural bronzer and the shade sunlight
is what I have here so I recently
repurchase this to kind of dive back
into this old guy and this is honestly
quite a nice bronzer I don't know that
I'd contour with it because it is pretty
warm but I will kind of you know hit the
cheeks with it just to warm up my skin
some and it looks like bronze are
definitely not one of my earliest things
though to pick up in terms of makeup I
remember you know having some kind of a
foundation a face product having a
powder having some eyeshadows and lip
products and blush first blushes 100%
came from the covergirl cheekers line so
this little size of blushes I remember
one of the first ones I picked up was
soft sable but the very very first one
and I think my mom put it on me like
before we went to get our church family
pictures back in the day I remember
standing in front of her mirror and she
said you know everybody looks better
with a little blush and she used the
shade pretty peach that comes in
and she swore up and down that that was
the best shade for absolutely anybody
and so I did use that shade for a while
now this shade is soft sable it's kind
of a neutral with a little shimmer
apparently more of a recent repurchase
by me and this is actually a great shade
I love this it kind of reminds me of the
soft mint color that I have and that I'm
more recently talked about in the
classic color blushes that are a little
bit bigger nothing at all wrong with
these blushes and remember in my
earliest days of YouTube there's a shade
I think called golden pink that I was
really into from this line as well so
it's definitely I think kind of an
overlooked blush line from the drugstore
now I never would have highlighted back
then I don't know that I had a clue what
highlighting was and there certainly
weren't products that I knew of being
sold that were really labeled as
highlights maybe there was something
from the Bonnie Bell line that was kind
of like a glowy bronzer you know but
nothing really like marketed as
highlight or contour but the one thing
that I am certain was being sold at that
time that did contain something that you
could highlight with was the covergirl
instant cheekbones blushes that have the
deeper blush the medium blush and then
they always have that highlight color
that would be the only thing I can think
of that had was like a legit highlight
from the drugstore in that day so I'm
going to dab into that and I love these
you guys know how I feel about these if
you've watched probably like any hidden
gems type videos that I've done or maybe
the what sold at the drugstore like I
think these are just beautiful and this
is coming from the peach perfection I
could have just used this peach blush
and made it really easy but I wanted to
reference the other style of blush which
was the first style blush that I picked
up from covergirl definitely needs some
kind of glow happening on this skin
because it was just so so matte with
those other products on it am I allowed
to bring in a setting spray I never
would have had a setting spray back then
but I mean come on can I please just put
on a little bit of hard candy sheer envy
primer mist oh yes okay
feeling good something about that
just a mental thing like I know I've
applied some setting this so I know my
skin does not look quite as dry as it
did before
can we talk brows for a second I can
tell you for a fact when I started
makeup I did nothing with my brows I
still probably had my little like
unibrow happening in the center there no
just a little bit of light hair that was
coming in here that people like to come
over and touch but nobody told me hey
maybe I ought to tweeze that huh I tell
you and then I got midway like into high
school and I way way over plucked so in
some of my years on YouTube when some
people are like you know your eyebrows
they're way too thick
there was no way in hell I was going
back to that tweezed up look that I had
in late high school or was it into
college as well it might have been that
like transition between the two it was
not cute but I never did anything with
actually filling in
they went from too thick to too thin and
I never did anything with them other
than some brow gel but when I finally
did decide to you know touch him up with
a little something it was the Maybelline
definer brow this I think is the mother
of all like skinny brow pencils it's
just got that itty-bitty tip I have this
in the shade medium brown I do remember
talking about this back in the day so
I'm going to just do a little filler
room here this does feel like a really
similar formula to that L'Oreal one that
I was just talking about my best in
beauty but it's like why can't we talk
about the old stuff too huh
because define a brow has been hanging
around in there in the drugstores in the
little you know bottom level of the
product selection and just saying hey
look at me look at me I'm bright green
pick me up but you know the funny thing
too that many of us say and I know I've
caught myself saying it as well
drugstore products seem to be more
expensive than they used to be but if
you shift your focus downward in the
display two chances are what are some of
the older things in the line those
things are pretty darn cheap like a
mascara from the covergirl line that's
been around since God knows when is
going to cost you you know several bucks
less than a newer one that they've put
it out and same goes for pretty much any
line if they've got some older products
versus their new releases the older
stuff is kind of like going back to the
drugstore prices maybe you remember one
thing I don't love about this though
like this little comb is kind of nice
but I don't like it as well as having a
spoolie on the end so there's where the
Loreal winds and the brow gel that i
know for a fact was the first I ever
used was the covergirl professional that
comes like this and this is the new
packaging now what I don't like about
this product is that it will become
cloudy and like look yucky in time but
my favorite current drugstore brow gel
would be the NYX control free because I
think that holds better than anything
but this holds all right - and who can
tell me they started with anything else
I mean I know so many of us kicked off
our brow routines with this may have
even put it in our lashes you know for
that no lash look brows are done and
just like I had to pull in a little bit
of setting mist I'm going to cheat one
more time and pull in some eye primer
because if my current self could have
told my former self anything and I'm not
sure what brand would have been putting
it out in the late 90s surely there was
some brand that was making an eye primer
I would say you've got to get an eye
prior because you're cheapo shadows will
look ten times better on top of an eye
primer so Milani eyeshadow primer that's
what I got now it's what I use in love
very religiously and just put this on
all over the lids
and there's one trio and one trio only
that comes to mind when I think of the
first eyeshadow I ever used was there an
unwritten rule where those of us who
were born in the early to mid 80s born
with some kind of a chip in our mind
that said the first trio you will buy
from the drugstore is covergirl
shimmering sands because I feel like
everybody had this maybe I just like saw
that everybody had this so I felt like I
needed to go get it - I'm talking about
like classmates and stuff like it's just
the most natural easiest trio still sold
today I mean you cannot tell me of
another drugstore brand that is still
selling some of the same shades in their
makeup went from the late 90s as they
are still today another thing I used to
have was a rockin covergirl shimmery
light blue eye shadow but in honor of
the good old days I am going to be
busting out a sponge tip and I'm never
going to be one to hate on a sponge tip
anyway so I'm going into this lightest
shade and this is still just a really
good little trio for anybody for a
natural look I will always have love for
you shimmering sands so dabbing that
light shade there and then I think I'm
going to flip over my sponge tip and go
into this Brown start dabbing that on
the outside here I know I can't be the
only one who feels a deep emotional
connection to this eyeshadow trio this
might have been the most recent and
third time that I fought it in my
lifetime I pull in my Sigma e25 brush
I'm going to go into that Brown and then
I'm gonna apply this to the crease I
never even thought of this but this kind
of feels like back to school makeup you
know I didn't think of my timing of this
but I am totally thinking about like my
school years my early school years and I
never would have had a brush like this
to work with but like I said trying to
integrate new techniques and things that
I've learned over the years with the
older products that I started with like
we need to like hashtag this like
shimmering sands Pham and you need to
tell me if you ever owned this and if
you currently own this you get to be
like I don't know you get to hold a
position on the board of the Shivering
science fan what am I talking about
I'm going to go to the medium shade I
always remember using this middle shade
under my brow because I felt like the
lightest shade was too light so put this
there and remember the golden sunrise
trio I loved on that in my early YouTube
days and that was more bronze II like
actual gold then because I'm really
trying to make the most of this I'm
going in with an even smaller brush this
is the MU a professional 315 it's that
little crease brush that I like and I
got mine at CVS about an $8 brush worth
every penny and I'm kind of like
deepening up the color in the outer
corner I am so excited I'm going to see
Carrie Underwood and less than a wig at
the grand ole opry wheat Tyler and I are
going to Nashville celebrating our 10
year anniversary and we're going to have
a little getaway mom and dad are going
to be here watching Belle and cupcake
and we're just going to go it down and
have a freaking blast I have never seen
Carrie Underwood life I've never been to
the Grand Ole Opry I have been to
Nashville and no I love that so it's
going to be so fun
eyeliner was one of those things that I
was definitely slower to start using I'm
almost certain in junior high I wouldn't
have probably worn any getting into high
school I actually started experimenting
with liquid liner I remember and one of
the first that I had was the NYC liquid
eyeliner so that is still available to
this day and I was wearing this
yesterday and I guess there was a little
let down by the staying power
I walked out of a store and walked right
out into the Sun and my eye immediately
started watering and I like went to dab
around it to dab it off and I could see
eyeliner coming off I'm like now in it
because it's a great black liner it goes
on easily but the Jordana color Envy
that you often see me using in tutorials
can kind of hold up a little bit better
than this but for nostalgia sake I'm
be using this NYC liquid liner today
it wasn't till like post-college years
that I would have ever attempted winged
liner so why not go ahead and add some
way
I also remember like some of the first
pencil liners I bought were probably the
covergirl perfect point plus that had
the smudger tip on the end and then on
the Revlon Colorstay pencil eyeliners
the twist up kind so going back to the
good old days I repurchased a Revlon
Colorstay pencil liner and yes I got it
in the shade sapphire because I remember
there was a girl when I was in high
school she was a little older than me
and she was always wearing like blue
eyeliner and I always kind of wanted to
be like that so I got myself a blue
liner and these Revlon ones now have a
smudger tip at the end they didn't use
to have that and can I tell you this is
kind of feeling hard as a rock right now
I'm going to do a little on the lower
inner rim and just kind of smudge a
little bit on the lash line too it's not
going to be super intense because for
whatever reason this feels dry as a bone
okay so I don't know if you can see
what's happening there but there is some
blue eyeliner got smudged under the eye
and into the lower inner rim because
that was something I attempted to do at
times in my high school life I did
always curl my eyelashes I remember
always doing that and the first mascara
I ever purchased and this would have
been one of the first like real makeup
products I ever bought outside of like I
said the gateway Bonnie Bell products
and it was this covergirl professional
mascara I think I got it because I saw
someone else in my class had some and so
it looked like this it was maybe a
little bit more squared off on the cap
or something but I went and got this
puppy again and the brush looks like
that decent looking brush that's just a
very like natural average type of
mascara to me it ain't no super sizer
but for the purposes of this video we
will relive the effects of the covergirl
professional mascara and you know I can
practically remember walking with my mom
into the Walmart taking hanging a quick
left into the cosmetics department going
to the back wall where they had the
cover girl stuff bending down and
finding this particular mascara that
they were selling isn't it crazy how
some memories are so vivid to you I'd
probably didn't hang too quick of a left
into the store because there was that
snack bar in there at that time but just
past the snack bar and into the
cosmetics section it was nice how those
two things were conveniently located is
the thing my dad and I would always do
was while mom was still shopping we'd go
sit in the snack bar when I was really
young and eat popcorn and dr. pepper
the thing that I'm a little bit jealous
of these days is that the small town
where I grew up now has a Dollar General
and Dollar General sells a surprising
amount of makeup Walmart in either
direction from our town was going to be
a half hour drive either way you know
that was a closest place to go buy you
know your drugstore makeup and
everything
we had a little like grocery store in
our town but in terms of a drugstore or
like a Dollar General that would sell a
good amount of makeup we didn't have
that and now they do I think they got it
just as soon as I left town seriously I
remember buying a few things there
before I left for college and it was
like I really could have used this place
I'm going to do a little bit of that on
my lower lashes - I think my lower
lashes went untouched for much of my
high school years I don't think I ever
put anything on there because I believe
I did once and I was burned by it
because I got horrible smudges feel like
I could use a little more powder on the
under eye a little bit more of this
maybe it's not helping I don't know you
know one way I'm going to dress up this
look is something I never did until I
was well out of college and into my
early YouTube days I never did false
lashes and you know how much I want to
go back to the little me go into a prom
and pop some false lashes on me we live
and learn right so I'm going to go ahead
and add these to this look these are my
salon perfect 6:15
that glue is drying yet that would have
been a really fun touch for a prom you
know like a big game you a cheer net at
Mons false lashes but no never touch the
stuff until I was far beyond college as
far as the first lip product or actual
legit lipstick I ever remember getting I
believe it was from covergirl and it was
from their continuous color line and it
was like a bronzy type like shimmery
brown color and I thought I was going to
find that at Ulta I just for some reason
thought Ulta was going to have the best
selection they're not even carrying the
continuous color lipsticks they're if I
went to Target I probably would have
found it in hindsight and this one is
one that I've actually raved about more
recently if you like kind of a pinky
mauve color I had picked this up from
Target not that long ago in the shade
550
I really like the feel of these
lipsticks there we go guys finish makeup
look shall I take my hair down so we can
really make this serious finished look
time now maybe that wasn't such a good
idea my hair is not done at all but when
all else fails just throw it over one
shoulder right but yeah there are
definitely some things I like about this
look some products of the past that I
enjoy would recommend would continue
using also some things that I was not so
impressed with so the takeaway from this
video would be that I'm probably not
going to be using the ultimate finish a
whole lot because that cream to powder I
feel like it gives you an instantly like
slightly cakey look that doesn't
continue to look so hot once
other products get piled on top of it
you know a clean and visible concealer
if you've got minor issues fine
but if you've got like actual under-eye
discoloration or something like that age
spots sun spots it takes quite a bit of
product to cover that nothing wrong with
the maybelline shine free pressed powder
really haven't reached for this in quite
a while
but as I recall this keeps the skin very
very matte they also have a loose
version of this powder - absolutely love
the Rimmel bronzers and these are so so
cheap these were like less than four
dollars I think maybe three bucks and
change he covergirl cheekers and instant
cheekbones blushes there are so many
like great little shades within these
ranges and it's really cool how the
instant cheekbones do give you a
highlight because that glow on my cheeks
I am really really enjoying that the
shimmering sands trio yes I really think
it's a legitimately good eye shadow trio
truly and I have pulled this out from
time to time I would really recommend it
to somebody who is just starting out
with makeup because you can't go too
deep and dark with this like even if you
build it up as you saw I did like in the
outer corner and stuff it wasn't getting
to dramatically dark NYC liquid liner
and definitely one of the first things I
use liquid liner wise but not one of the
best anymore sadly I mean it's got nice
black intensity but for staying power
sake Jordana Keller Envy is good also
this was before the days of the nice
little easy pen style liquid liners like
the Physicians Formula eye booster love
that one that's a great kind of training
type eyeliner it's Revlon Colorstay
eyeliner that I just bought is so dry I
was so not impressed with this I mean
there are so many nice creamy eyeliners
now in the drugstore I'm thinking of
Milani I'm thinking of these like
Maybelline master skinny Physicians
Formula has some nice retractable pencil
liners this this was not cool brows yes
this is just a totally fine brow pencil
but I wish it was a spoolie on the other
end there really is I think an advantage
to that with kind of helping to shear
out color you put in your brows and
helping blend it on through this gel
it's just fine too I'm a firm believer
that you don't have to spend a lot on
brow gel but if you want something that
holds really really well and never makes
your brows feel overloaded that's the
thing when this is new your brows really
feel like there's a lot of product going
into them so the NYX control-freak brow
gel is a favorite covergirl professional
mascara I mean it's not the worst but
it's not the best in my opinion but
definitely was the first that I ever
purchased and then this lipstick like I
said I love this shade so I've raved
about this before the 550 covergirl
continuous color I think that's really
beautiful
so yeah what's old is new again I would
love to hear in the comments section
love love love to hear what were some of
the things that you remember first
buying for your makeup collection give
me a sense of what your makeup bag
looked like if it was high-end stuff
tell me you know what was I had some
friends that had really really sensitive
skin and couldn't pull off like certain
brands of drugstore makeup so I remember
some of their first things were like
Clinique and I just find it interesting
you know where did you start and looking
back were those good decisions or bad
decisions or how would you improve and
change up the look I want to hear your
story
thank you so much for watching this
crazy old video and I will see you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
