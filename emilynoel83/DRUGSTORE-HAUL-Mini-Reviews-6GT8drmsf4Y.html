about a bunch of new drugstore stuff
that I've come across very recently I've
got a lot of new lip type products in
this video and just some really random
things as well first thing I'll mention
I've actually had on hand for quite a
while and I just thought since I was
talking about some other mini makeup
sponges I would reference these too but
these are from Swiss PIRs and this is
something I found at Walmart kind of
near the cotton pads in q-tips type area
if you look closely in there you may
find these this little mini blending
sponge duo so there's a purple one and
also a pink one and this is what like
after it's been saturated I use this
today with my concealer this is what it
blows up to be like and they're really
really soft I would say they end up kind
of expanding to get a little bit larger
than a Beauty Blender micro mini and
they don't keep maybe quite as much a
point toward the tip I mean obviously
it's still decently tapered there but in
terms of just softness and the ability
to blend you know a very delicate area
like your under eye without applying too
much pressure or feeling like you're
tugging it product it works really well
like it's very very comparable and I
have enjoyed those very much and I think
a micro mini Beauty Blender is probably
the kind of product a lot of people look
at there may be a little skeptical I can
do I really need something like that for
the under eye so if you are a mini
sponge skeptic that might be a good
place to start out and see if you like
that because I really think it's a
fantastic texture it gets really really
soft and then Ulta out with this set of
3 mini sponges and they look like that
there's also an orange and this is not
saturated I use this one the other day
these do expand to be about the same
size as the swiss firs one i would say
these are definitely usable they do
soften up quite a bit as they grow on
when you stature ate them under the sink
and then you definitely want to wring
them out as completely as you can and
then that's your sweet spot you know for
blending out concealer but these do stay
a little more firm than the Swiss pers
ones do those get really really soft and
remind me I think even more
of a Beautyblender brand micro-mini
after it some really really bad many
sponges I'm thinking of those ones from
up and up that just were like rocks they
didn't do anything for me these I think
I definitely could get use out of I just
happen to like thus whispers one better
for their softness whispers that feel so
funny say one thing I did use and blend
it out with one of those sponges today
on the under eye area was this new color
correcting stick from ELF I got it in
the correct dark circles light skin
tones shades so I think they have an
even deeper richer you know peachy
orange e-type color this is supposed to
help dark circles and dark spots and
it's been infused with vitamin E to help
hydrate the skin and it is a really nice
smooth texture here's what that looks
like swatch tout it really does have a
lot of peachy pigment to it for me
though I was a little disappointed I
just wanted some more coverage it was a
nice texture to work with I thought it
blended out super easily on the skin but
when it was all said and done and I was
finished blending it out I thought I'm
still seeing some issues through that it
almost needs to be like a little thicker
or richer in consistency it's not quite
doing for me what a benefit erase paste
might do but it may just depend on the
severity of your issues you know they
have all different tones I think they've
got some green and lavender ones and
depending on what your need is some of
those might be great for you this for me
though is just not something I see
myself repurchasing revlon has several
new products that you're going to see
sprinkled throughout this video and one
of them is this insta blush stick and I
got this in what I thought was the
deepest shade available called berry
kiss 320 I feel like I've got kind of a
decent selection of preamble edges so I
was just trying to go for something that
seemed different from a lot of the stuff
that I have but it's just a twist up
stick and it kind of was a letdown for
me the stick is rather dry I think
they're trying to make it something
that's going to not be super sticky on
your skin and difficult to blend in that
respect but at the same time I feel like
it's almost a little too dry it's kind
of hard to pick up products straight
from the stick with a brush or if you
want to take this across your skin I
feel like it totally unpause too much
and when you feel like a cream blush if
you have to work
to pull that across your skin or apply
much pressure at all to your skin it's
probably messing up your foundation and
stuff underneath so it's not a bad tone
I mean if you really want to spend some
time working with it I feel like I can
get this sort of rosy look on the cheeks
but Maybelline so I think they're called
master glaze cream blush sticks our head
and shoulders above this in my opinion
I've got that in several shades they
just require the lightest little bit of
pressure you can easily blend them out
no unusual texture left behind it's like
I said just a little too dry for my
liking kind of hard to work with I had
kind of a cool find from five below and
it was this little contour palette I
believe it was exactly five dollars and
it's by profusion and sometimes you know
you start looking through all these many
palettes at five below and it's just
kind of overwhelming and you're thinking
are any of them really going to deliver
and this one for whatever reason I went
ahead and picked it up and I actually
think this is fantastic really pigmented
a couple of different tones of highlight
up top that could even be like a glowy
blush for someone but it is very glowy
and then everything else in here is
matte you've got a couple of matte blush
options one a little more pinky one more
peach and two options for contouring and
this depending on your skin tone this
could be kind of a neutrally blush as
well I have been able to get a lightly
contoured effect with that but this one
strikes me more is like a deep bronzer
kind of like a Too Faced chocolate
Soleil type product today I contoured
with this I use this as my blush and
this one is my highlight so that's
what's working color wise on my face
today and they're all very pigmented you
just lightly tap into them to pick up
some product they do give you a strange
little brush in here it's really really
stiff I feel like that could be good for
something I don't think I would
necessarily use it for any of these
products because I would want it a
little more diffused across the skin but
it's very stiff and kind of dense it
kind of reminds me of the appeal that
that it cosmetics genesee quoi palette
had with the four products and one and
they were giving you the blush the
bronzer the highlight but also a light
kind of finishing powder like pore
reducing powder and that element
that I must say I really enjoyed that
cuz I felt like that particular product
could take the place of pretty much any
powder I needed to use and I would have
liked all powder needs covered in one
this does give a few more options shade
wise though and it's five dollars
another new Revlon thing that I ran into
are these cream eyeshadows and they're
in little pots that look very very
similar to a Maybelline Color tattoo
only the cap is a little bit taller one
reason for that they put a little brush
in the cap and it's actually a very
usable brush as far as you know if
you're going to put one of these shades
all over your lid it picks up the cream
shadow rather nicely and I have no
complaints about that I think that's
kind of cool that it's in there this
shade that I got I mean it just really
struck me out of the whole lineup it's
called black currant it's number 740 it
says long-wear cream eyeshadow built-in
brush wears up to 24 hours the
consistency of this is very smooth and a
little bit thinner than a Maybelline
Color tattoo as you feel this going
across your lid I think it's more
comparable to the Maybelline Color
tattoo Stix which I've always felt were
just a little bit smoother and creamier
here's a swatch that's been on my hand
for about 15 minutes now and as I rub
across it I can kind of see the shimmer
because there's a lot of shimmer in this
color and really all the colors that I
was looking over to shimmer can kind of
be rubbed away like if you're really you
know going at the swatch it can
certainly start drifting not in a really
dry messy way like if this were a loose
pigment or something but it's just you
know it kind of spreads a little bit but
the overall like metallic color of this
shadow seems to stay in place pretty
well and I was wearing this yesterday
and well I felt by the end of the day it
certainly had faded it was like the only
thing I was wearing on my eye except for
just a very light crease color I would
say I had it on for 16 hours and it
definitely had faded by the end but it
didn't crease like crazy it didn't feel
like it was really collecting in the
crease of my eye which I will sometimes
notice with certain products but I'm not
a person with major oily lid issues so
some people have that worse than others
and if you do you might have a little
more problem but today this is the shade
that I've got um just all over my lids I
think
it's beautiful like color wise it's just
gorgeous and it doesn't feel sticky it
really doesn't feel any different from
the texture of the powder shadows I've
also got on today I don't know if you
really wanted to put it through a
24-hour test you might notice like yeah
it's technically still there but I'm
pretty sure it would be very faded
considering the fact that it was really
pretty faded on me after 16 hours but I
think I need to give this some more
tries use it under some different
circumstances you know one given day
trying something out really isn't the
best indication of how it can work and
with today's look I packed on the
product a little bit heavier so maybe
that'll also give me kind of different
indication of the way it wears another
eye product that I found is this new
mascara from covergirl it's called soul
ashy and it's a blast Pro mascara you
know they had the lash blast Pro and it
was in a black tube with a red cap so
this has the purple cap and it's a
really interesting shape on the brush
it's got this sort of spiky ball on the
end and it's kind of got these four
wings of bristles down below it and what
I noticed when I first take the wand out
is that little ball at the end is very
overloaded at least at this point with
it being like my third application of
this product I'm taking it out and I'm
really needing to clean that little part
off like look at it just now I mean it's
got a lot of excess there so you're
going to definitely want to get rid of
some of that so you can actually see the
spikes and feel like you can use those
spikes you know to get through your
lashes I was kind of concerned that that
would interfere um more than it does
with these other little parts of the
brush actually being able to get in
contact with my lashes because the
spikey Bowl is so big but you actually
do feel like you can use this end you
know these two kind of arched ends to
get through your lashes and get some
separation the length that this gives is
kind of nice but I do get the feeling
that my lashes are getting kind of
overloaded with product and I know that
is sometimes my take away when I've only
used a mascara a few times and it needs
to you know get a little more air worked
in there it needs to dry out a bit more
and get some of the product used up a
little more but
must say I am a little discouraged with
this because with covergirl super sizer
mascara that one works really well on me
out of the gate and it helped hold a
curl this weighs down my lashes so
quickly it's kind of a lot of work to
comb through them and just get some of
that excess off and by the time I've
done all that I'm like where the girl do
my lashes go also this is pretty
difficult to apply to the lower lashes
because I find myself working off of the
end of a mascara wand with a lot of
products that I use down there and with
this you know even when you clean off
the tip it's kind of got a lot there I
always like my lower lashes to look a
bit softer and that's kind of hard to
accomplish with this brush this is not
an instant home run for me but I'm going
to keep you know using it a little bit
more I've got a load of lip products to
talk about here and these AOS lip balms
I've had these on hand for a while and I
really haven't been all that impressed
these are the kinds with shimmer and one
is like a whitish pearly shimmer and
one's a little more pinky and here's my
gripe with this you're going to use an
EOS lip balm I reach for pretty much any
lip balm lip balm when your lips are dry
maybe cracked chapped you know just
visibly needs some help
and when the product has shimmer
particularly light shimmer it takes your
flakes it takes your dryness and any
kind of issue you're having on your skin
and it just exaggerated sit from a
distance sometimes I put these on and
I'm like oh my lips just look kind of
glowy and nice but then I look closely
it's like no that's not an attractive
look I'm seeing way too many issues the
pearly one really spotlight some
problems the pink at least adds a little
bit of color to the mix and the texture
is nice and smooth I got to say it
almost feels even creamier than some of
the other AOS lip balms that are out
there but I just that shimmer feature is
just not for me might be for someone
else or you know if you know your lips
are just in perfect condition and you
like light frosty lips then go for it
another new EOS balm that I got is their
fresh grapefruit it's not SPF 30 and I
love this scent oh that is so refreshing
that is a great like wake up your day
type thing to put on your lips this does
feel like quite as rich and creamy as
the others but it's still really good
and there are some of these EOS lip
balms that I think make really nice lip
primers because they're not too soft
they're not too greasy and this would
certainly be one that I put in that
category and I just love the scent and
it's colorless you know it's just going
to be a regular standard balm that you
put on now we take baby steps away from
colorless lip balms and we go to these
which are the Revlon kiss balms these
are new to their line they've got a
number of different flavors I guess and
colors I have the one called sweet
cherry these are also SPF 20 products
and then I saw a limited edition shade
at my Walgreens and it's called sugar
plum
so this one has a little bit of shimmer
in it and as I was just looking at the
darkness of the color in the stores like
that's that appeals to me I'm kind of
curious about that sweet cherry just
like with one basic swipe across the
lips you know it's giving you this light
kind of pinkish red tint to the lips but
you know they're lip balms overall it's
gonna be sheer you can apply a little
bit more if you want to build up the
color somewhat but they're not super
long-lasting they are hydrating to an
extent before a real treatment if that's
really necessary on your lips I don't
think these would stand up to my Nivea
balms very well or like the fresh sugar
lip balms these don't get me wrong they
feel nice on the lips but they're more
of a lightweight as far as a balm that's
actually going to treat your lips would
be but I do really love the color
especially the sugar plum this has just
a teeny bit of shimmer to it but I like
the color I like how it feels so light
on my lips it's very easy to wear but
yet this particular shade has some depth
to it I guess my take away with these is
these are nice kind of casual lip
products but I'm not really over the
moon what I am really loving that Revlon
has put out are these and these are
they're calling them they're Ultra HD
lipsticks and they already had Ultra HD
lipsticks that looked more like a
traditional lipstick tube I think I just
have one of them and it's in like a
silvery packaging I remember very shiny
very pigmented a lot of scent in them
and these seem to have those kinds of
qualities as well I always like a skinny
stick
like this though I think that makes
every shade just a little bit easier to
apply and I feel like these are kind of
the second coming of lip butters you
know they discontinued lip butters and
these really have that same kind of feel
the same color intensity kind of a
glossy shine on the lips so if you loved
lip butters this may be the aspect of
Revlon's line you want to start looking
to now but I actually really love both
colors that I got I got seven ten which
is HD desert that's what I've been
wearing throughout the video it's like
just this beautiful rosy neutral color
very easy to wear works with anything
type of shade and it's creamy there's no
shimmer and either of the colors that I
have a lot of shine but yet they don't
feel greasy like they're slipping
outside the lips also that 760 which is
HD vineyard so this is a very I think
wearable soft berry the scent on these I
wish I could pinpoint it I'm getting
kind of like a tropical vibe with it
like not all-out coconut but does anyone
else think they smell kind of like some
sort of tropical cocktail I can't quite
put my finger on it but the scent is
really pretty strong with these like if
you take off the cap and actually smell
it once it's on your lips I don't really
get much but these products I don't know
why I never really dug into this line
when it was more just like standard
lipsticks but I would totally get more
of these I really like this format and
shape of a lip product and they do feel
to me just like lip butters all over
again
last few things here super random and I
know I mentioned this in my video on the
drugstore gift ideas like under $15
stuff I mentioned that Burt's Bees has
some seasonal lip balms out ginger spice
really yummy if you like kind of a
gingerbread cinnamon spice type scent
you might enjoy that they've got a mint
cocoa as well that I found at Walgreens
and for just under a dollar soft so
really I love the Bath and Body Works
foaming hand soaps but for whatever
reason these caught my eye the
peppermint candy cane there's a red
berry cobbler I think they may have had
like a vanilla sugar cookie scent these
those smell fantastic I'm a sucker for
some seasonal scent so I'm excited to
replace some of the things than our
other bad
rooms the way I've already got in there
with these so hopefully this was a
useful little heads-up for you on some
new things that are out I would say to
meet my most exciting things from this
little hole slash you know new at the
drugstore type video I really like thus
whispers mini sponges and the Revlon HD
lip colors these skinny sticks I think
those are awesome too with other things
I'm not saying about a lot of hardcore
dads here but like I feel like I need to
use that cream shadow a bit more I need
to use the mascara a little bit more
before I really form a definite opinion
on it you know so thank you guys again
and I will talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
