here in this video I wanted to focus on
some new drugstore stuff some of its
really really new to me and some of it
I've actually had for like a few weeks
now and I just felt like I didn't have a
great opportunity to talk about it till
now so here it comes
some of this stuff I would actually say
is like hidden gem type status like just
because it's new to me some of its not
necessarily new on the market as a whole
and I've definitely run into some cool
items and by the way the eye look look
at the blue love the lower lash line
I am so feeling this look so much so
anyway we'll get to that I'll touch on
exactly what I'm wearing as I go here
but first things first there's a brand
new foundation from covergirl that I
snagged off the Ulta website it's called
vitalist
healthy elixir foundation with vitamins
and specifically e B 3 and B 5 and it
also has SPF 20 it claims to be oil-free
and I have it in the good old shade
creamy natural and that is what I'm
wearing today and I've worn it just a
few times so far not really enough in my
opinion to give you a solid review by
the way I just did a little poll on
Twitter like how long do you think a
reviewer should be using a foundation
before they pass along their review to
everybody and most people feel like
about a week is the best gauge for that
and I would tend to agree and I do think
a foundation is something that it can't
just really be a one-time thing like how
did it wear on that one random day
because circumstances can be different
every day and other products you combine
with the foundation can make a lot of
difference so that's kind of what I'm in
the stages of figuring out right now but
I can tell you it's like regardless of
primers and different powders I might
put on top I do really like the way this
foundation looks immediately after
application what I've noticed so far
though is that I do get kind of oily and
the staying power has not been great
with this I don't know what my deal is
because I felt like my skin's been like
normal to dry for quite some time now
but certain products I think are really
bringing out the oil and I'm really just
breaking them down in my t-zone area
this is one of those that just has not
had fantastic staying power for me so
far it's just kind of a little progress
your board on it that's what I've
noticed and I will see like with
different kinds of maybe setting powders
or different types of primers how I can
help that situation today for the first
time I'm trying my Smashbox pore
minimizing primer underneath it and that
has really helped a lot of my
foundations last better so we'll see if
it works for this one too but don't know
if I mentioned it's a pump style like
dispenser here it's a glass bottle and
it's just that kind of foundation where
it's like I wouldn't call it full
coverage but it's a strong medium
coverage and it really evens things out
nicely
I like applying it with a brush and I
just I feel like right after I put it on
I can look up super close at my skin and
be like yeah you know that looks really
smooth and very skin-like so I promise I
will follow up here I'll keep you
updated on that I got a new la girl Pro
conceal concealer in the shade light
ivory I actually already had one of
these and it's kind of like running low
actually is I'm using up product there's
a product that was kind of like
rediscovered in my collection pulled it
out after not using it for quite a while
and I was really pleased with what it
did for my under-eye area so I thought
when I noticed this is being sold on
oldest website I picked up another I'm
wearing that today on my under eye and I
just think it's a pretty solid concealer
it doesn't necessarily take as much
product as you might think that's
another one of those concealers that
like in the Instagram and social media
world you see people like just friggin
slathering the stuff on you know for
contouring and highlighting and whatnot
I just actually think it does a pretty
effective job of covering was like a
small to moderate amount so I got
another one of those and I thought I
would try one of their setting powders
in the banana shade because I already
had one of their like light or white
basically setting powders and I've been
using this on-and-off to set the
under-eye area and I'm really liking
that too I think recently I talked about
a loose powder from Make Up For Ever one
of their setting powders and how it
feels just incredibly next-level silky
you know as you wrote it between your
this doesn't feel quite like that it
feels to me a little bit more like a
traditional powder but it's very smooth
and it's very very fine and it is kind
of yellow toned but it's not super dark
yellow so it still seems to brighten a
little bit on my under-eye area it does
not wear as flawlessly throughout the
day as the Laura Mercier does I mean
that stuff has like you know 50% powder
50% magic in it and it like I don't know
what it is about it but it looks great
at the get-go and then I can look at
myself in the mirror like 3:00 in the
afternoon and be like what I don't look
like you know 95 years old here no
offense to any 95 year-olds watching
seriously though it's really hard to
find a powder that looks good in real
life in that area because so many people
can pull it off on camera yells perfect
lighting on you or whatever it stuff
looks great the true test as under-eye
powders is how is it actually going to
look you know when you're 75 percent
through your day and this one I would
say in that sense it's good but not
great here's another LA girl thing that
I got that I absolutely love I love the
shade so much if they're just blushing
blush in the shade just playful one of
those kind of dusty rose type blushes
wearing it today it's good you know
that's the kind of blush you want that
can just kind of go with any situation
it's intensely pigmented and it is super
soft to the touch like that just feels I
don't feel like a little rock eyeshadow
or something when I touch it but this is
one of those lines of products now that
has piqued my interest and I'm
definitely going to be thinking about
makes trying some other shades because
this seems to be a really really good
formula can I talk about my lip color
for a second because I just laid eyes on
this guy at the Neutrogena revitalizing
lip balm SPF 20 I have this in the color
soft caramel and I've had these in the
past in a number of shades but you know
makeup doesn't last forever and I've had
to throw out some stuff over time and so
I decided to repurchase one of these and
I have reef all inand love with these
lip balm I mean Neutrogena freaking
knows what they're doing when it comes
to lip products I'm
telling you the moisture smooth color
sticks they've got some nice glosses
these days and these lip balms are just
phenomenal I've got it on my lips today
and what did I throw on with it just a
little bit a little bit of lip liner
this Milani color statement lip liner in
spice just to kind of give my lips a
little bit more definition on the
outside but this is what this balm looks
like it just kind of like a attentive
nude to the balm mmm it feels it is just
a perfect lip balm texture you guys out
as far as stick lip balms go this is so
good and it makes my lips feel like full
it I don't know what it's doing it's
definitely not got any kind of stinging
plumping action to it it smells just
like I don't know kind of a light fruity
smell but it's smoothing out everything
on my lips these lip balms my gosh I've
got to go back and get some first why am
I like that it's like once I like one I
got to get all the colors but no I
really like this one and I think this is
so like everyday wearable that my
friends is a hidden gem of the drugstore
and here's another odd little purchase
that I made a covergirl brush how many
of you have actually tried a brush from
covergirl now they're not known for the
brushes they don't make a lot of brushes
but they got one here they've got an eye
brush that's double ended and one side
of it at a glance in the packaging I
thought is that going to be kind of like
my Sigma e25 well it's not as fluffy as
that but it is tapered in a very similar
way by that I mean it's got like shorter
bristles here longer bristles right at
the tip top of the brush it's also
tapered down that side as well I'm here
to say I did the entire eyeshadow look
with only this brush I mean it padded on
the lid well it wedged into the crease
that was the best thing about it I
thought was that when I wanted to get
color in my crease and then kind of pull
it up and get this nice light kind of
diffused bust-out quality to the
eyeshadow it did that so well and then
the other side is an angled brush which
it's not the star of the show here let's
be honest but it's nice and I use that
to smudge out my pencil liner on my
lower lash line so
I don't know this is kind of cool it's
sort of one of those one-stop-shop does
it all brushes because much like my
Sigma e25 it's effective in the crease
but what this is sort of going beyond
with is being just a little bit flatter
than that
so I actually can lay down some shadow
on my lid and it's not too oversized by
the way like I don't have massive
massive eyelids but this is what we're
looking at in terms of size to the lid
so I'm surprised I'm really surprised
that I like it but it's good and here's
another thing that I like and this is a
little bit newer this is the Physicians
Formula natural nude in store ready
multi finish eyeshadow palette the
mattes in here are killing it they're
really good this now I know we're loaded
you look at this and how many people
just rolled their eyes because they're
like a neutral palette I'm not talking
about this saying like everybody needs
this or this is going to replace like
this that and the other that's already
in your collection no if you've already
got neutral eyeshadows that you're happy
with
feel free to tune me out but if you're
looking for drugstore price range
something small and maybe you're a
beginner and you feel a bit overwhelmed
by some of the SuperDuper pigmented and
intense eyeshadows that are out there
even from the drugstore like wet and
wild can even be a little bit much with
some of their palettes in terms of
intensity and if you're looking for
something a little bit softer and
natural like it's still pigmented don't
get me wrong it shows up beautifully on
the eyes but there's a softness to these
shadows it's just like they're a little
bit down a notch intensity wise but they
show up enough to definitely get the job
done so this is what my eye look is all
about today I've got this shade in the
crease that's what's giving me this
beautiful like straight-up
caramel Yves ibed there I've got the
dark matte Brown in the outer corner
I've got some of this white shade on the
lid and a little bit of this shape that
has some shimmer too but what you're
doing in this palette is mostly matte
with a couple of pearly shades and then
this shade that is about as sparkly as
it gets and that can be you know a
little bit flaky but it actually looks
really pretty on the eyes so that's
what's going on on the whole upper part
of my eye and I did it all with
brush like this end of this brush it was
a one brush look so pretty good stuff
there they blend so well across each
other though so it's a very easy palette
to work with and get a look out of and
there's also a little brush included
here yep just right in there little flat
brush you might like it just for packing
shadow on the lid but I like how it's
just part of the packaging design and
what's on my lower lash line is actually
not part of this whole but I'll just
tell you really quick what I'm talking
about
eyes I use this Makeup Forever aqua
excel in m22 on my waterline and I
smudged it on the lower lash line with
the angled side of this covergirl brush
and then I fully committed to blue on
the lower lash line I used my voluminous
blue mascara this came in like a PR
package that's why I think it's got this
golden cap are they selling the Golden
Cap ones in the store I'm not sure but I
was kind of hesitant because L'Oreal
mascaras have not always been the best
in terms of staying smudge free
voluminous specifically like I've had
some smudgy issues sometimes with that
so this may be a hot mess by the end of
the day on my lower lash line but it
looks really pretty now and this
definitely like accentuates that blue
liner I don't know if it's maybe coming
off as much on camera but in person I'm
like wow that is a blue lower lash line
so yeah that's the story on my eyes so
it's okay we don't have any makeup
casualties as a result of that fall
everything's intact makeup revolution
got a couple of these shimmer brick
looking guys and you guys know I've
enjoyed this Bobbi Brown compact here
that has the three different ones it's
got gold
it's got bronze and this one's called
wild rose and I don't think this compact
is available any longer but each of
these shades is something that's
individually sold in the bobbi brown
line so I kind of got obsessed in
thinking about possible alternatives to
those shades and makeup revolution has
one called rose gold and this to me
looks very much like the color scheme of
bronze and bronze is one of the most
versatile ones in this palette to me
because it can be kind of like a bronzer
on the skin it can be a blush when you
use some of the more
centralized shades in the brick and it
can also be a highlight too but it's got
that very similar color scheme here so I
want to do some more comparisons I might
I don't know maybe do a dupe video if I
can find some more to throw in but then
I also got the one in pink kiss and that
to me looks a heck of a lot like Wild
Rose or at least similar these makeup
revolution ones I think a difference
might be that they seem even more
metallic but the color scheme is
certainly there so I'm excited to play
with those a little bit more what I did
today on top of that la girl blush I
used a little bit of this and I just
went sort of for the main part of this
palette and I just topped my blush just
went straight over exactly where I put
my blush and then this top shade up here
this is interesting this top shade is a
very similar shade to the Becca
prismatic amethyst highlight and I love
that that's a highlight that has this
little hint of a like pinky lilac twist
to it and I've got this just the top
part of three seriously and then this
happen okay I'm going to fit this brick
together what you guys I totally fit it
back together like I squished it in
there
it seems solid okay I'm rude but as I
was saying the top one the top little
strip here if you can confine your brush
to that which I could I'm using my
little Mota highlight and blow brush
this reminds me so much of that
prismatic amethyst from Becca and I
think that's cool you know I like that
it's combined in here and this already
has a lot of pinky tone to it could
probably be a blush type shade on its
own but anyways that was tense there for
a couple moments I do enough puzzles
with a toddler around I don't need to
have to go back my highlights last few
things here this new mascara from
Physicians Formula is kind of cool on
the packaging see how it's very spirally
and neat
this is called the lash contortionist
curl and lengthen mascara it says it's
an interlocking fiber mascara whatever
that means you can see that the brush
spirals around but it's like a flat
layer of bristles that's doing that and
where it spirals in there's a lot of
product being held there like you can
potentially get a decent amount of
product on your lashes and then kind of
turn it and pull through sounding a
little super sizer ish to anybody
because that's sort of what it reminded
me of but my problem with this is that
the brush does not separate quite well
enough and it might be the newness of
the mascara so don't take my word for it
just yet but it lengthened out it
sickened them up but as I kept going
through my lashes which I didn't think I
spent a whole long time on them but I
kept sweeping through to get everything
coated and I felt like stuff started
sticking together so maybe as I use this
more and some more product gets used up
out of the tube I won't have quite that
much of an issue but it certainly does
not separate like super sizer does and
then I picked up a couple of wet and
wild brushes that I have not yet used
one of them is this sort of crease brush
or blender brush looking thing it's
interesting because it's not very
tapered you notice the flatness there
across the top it's just round all the
way around here it's not pinched in at
all but it's just not very tapered but
it's extremely soft and I think it would
be a great just straight up blender type
brush and then I got this eyeliner brush
and this is so nice and stiff I think
this could be perfect for gel liner I'm
hoping I'm hoping it's not too fluffy
but I feel like once this comes in
contact with a cream or gel liner those
little bristles will really hang
together well and I like the bent nature
of that little top part there the
ferrule so we'll see I hope I can get
excited about this and bring some of
those gel liners that I haven't been
using back into the rotation so that's
all I've got for you for now everybody
just some of the new drugstore products
that I've been trying some like really
new on the market so I'm just new to me
but a couple of hidden gems here this
from Neutrogena you want to be getting
you one of these lip balms they've got a
range of shades but this is the caramel
that I have this covergirl brush oddly
good I mean very multitasking a whole
eyelids with just the one end of this
and I think it's a pretty decent eye
look for that matter who knew these
makeup revolution things you know
they're nice but try not to drop them
for crying out loud this la girl blush
is really really good like this too so
I've had some good hits here my hair on
the other hand I tried a high ponytail
today and it's just flat all over but
thank you guys for watching I really
appreciate your time I so appreciate all
of your kind words in the comments
section you guys are so nice not only to
me but to each other and that is so so
appreciated so I will talk to you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
