today's video I'm going to be talking
about my favorite drugstore nude lip
pics and I've been really enjoying a
nude lip lately and I've also been
liking to see how I feel like when
brands put out lines of nudes it seems
like the definition of a nude lip has
really expanded to suit
I think people of a variety of skin
tones kind of recognizing that one
person's nude is not everyone's nude and
just kind of erasing that notion of a
nude lip only being a shade that looks
like you've covered your mouth and
foundation or concealer and being
something that is more like a your lips
but better shade kind of going off the
natural tones that exist in our lips and
being something that might be a little
more peachy a little more pink a little
more Brown so I'm really going to be
offering up some favorites that cover
the whole gamut of nudes I think in this
video it's funny because I am wearing
one of the lightest ones on my lips
right now I went pretty like pure
stereotypical nude for just sitting here
talking throughout the video but I will
be trying everything on and it's a big
focus on lipstick so that I will mention
a couple liners and a gloss that I love
as well and some of the first ones that
I mentioned certain ones you've heard me
talk about a lot some of them are very
long-term favorites but then I've got a
few new ones that I found that I want to
tell you about from the Rimmel line that
I tracked down at Walgreens the Rimmel
Kate Moss lasting finish nude lipsticks
and these are gorgeous - and a great
formula so I'll mention those at the end
but first nude that I want to talk about
is a kind of lip gloss lipstick in one
so it's like the shine of a gloss but in
a lipstick format I'm talking about my
Sonia Kashuk shine luxe in the shade
sheer pink lust and this is sort of the
peachy nude of my collection it does
have some warmth to it it has a
tremendous amount of shine I like that
even though it is so shiny it does give
off a lot of nice color on the lips as
well it's not a totally like sheer tone
next one I'm going to mention is my
pinky nude I know a lot of people love a
nude that has a little bit more of a
cool vibe to it kind of a pink twist and
this also happens to be I think the most
nourishing of everything I'm going to
talk about like if you want to wear your
nude lip and you
know your loops are chapped or really
really dry this would be a great one to
put on for comfort and for hydration
talk about my moisture smooth color
stick from Neutrogena in the shade pink
nude and as you look at this side by
side with the last one you can see it's
more pinky it's less shiny it has more
like just that subtle shine the lip balm
might have and it goes on the lips so
nicely super smooth has a nice bit of
thickness to it that I think really
makes the lips feel hydrated so this has
really become a favorite of mine next I
want to go slightly deeper than that and
this I think is the true like your lips
but better color at least for me for my
lips and it's the l'oreal glossy balm in
the shade lovely mocha so this is a
little bit more like a mafia nude
perfect natural color for everyday I
love as I apply it I feel like I can see
the natural tones in my lips just being
nicely evened out looking a little more
finished but it's just a very casual
easy throw on color has about the same
level of shine I think as the Neutrogena
not maybe quite as heavy duty hydrating
as that but still feels great on the
lips next this is kind of a new love for
me but if you like more classic nude and
into a brownish type nude you might like
this too and one product from ELF I
think this is a great formula that
they've gotten these day-to-night
lipsticks and this is the one called
needed news so I got both tones swatch
together here for you again one looks
like a very normal classic nude one is a
bit more warm and brownish and then I'll
try them on separately here you can see
the nude shade not often that I wear
that one alone but it really does look
nice just as is and again the formula is
fantastic super pigmented then I'll show
you the deeper side and this just makes
me think of a nice like caramel e-type
color I love the depth that it has I
think it's really pretty it's very
on-trend for people who are enjoying a
little bit more brownish look on the
lips but most often the way I find
myself wearing this little lip duo
because I just can't hold back I know
that there's two so I got to wear them
both at the same time and when I do that
I think it's kind of fun it adds a
little bit of dimension to your look you
can make your lips appear a little bit
fuller by having the lighter part on the
inner part of say your lower lip or your
middle of your upper lip so I love that
I think that's a great release from ELF
now after all these things I mention
I know there are some people who are
saying I like it totally net free from
shine so a couple that I would like to
recommend that I think are both
classifiers news are from the maybelline
creamy mattes line one is called
daringly nude and as you look at this
one swatch down I can see more pink in
this than I ever realized but putting it
on the lips this is a shade that is
ultra full coverage I do think this
would suit a lot of skin tones because
it's got a hair more depth than some of
the lightest nude lipsticks out there
and then I also am a huge fan of touch
of spice this one lives in my purse a
lot hence the round enough lipstick that
I'm dealing with you right now but this
is kind of like a nice deeper richer
rosy nude it's really walking the line I
think of maybe even being called a nude
but I do think it's a very natural
looking shade and I love how these
creamy mattes you know they don't look
shiny at all but yet they don't feel
like an uncomfortable super drying matte
lipstick and this is another little
pairing that I like to wear together
I'll do a lot of the touch of spice
shade and then kind of brighten up the
center of the lips with daringly nude
they're a great duo I know I've talked
about them before so you're probably
like yeah yeah broken record keep
talking but those are a couple of my
favorites now if I may I would like to
tell you about what I found at Walgreens
over the weekend
these Kate Moss nude lipsticks so you
can see the packaging on all of them
regardless of the shade of nude that
they are they are this pretty light
peach packaging and it does have the
little Kate signature in the heart on
the top part they are the regular
lasting finish formula they are cream
lipsticks I got a look at almost all of
them in the line there were two shades I
think that we're sold out and overall
we're talking a range of like eight or
ten different nude lip colors it's a
really big lineup and from what I could
tell these are all just classic creamy
lipsticks not seeing shimmer in any of
them and it's just a super comfortable
formula I think it's been a while since
I've just used the regular Rimmel
standard lasting finish lipstick formula
and these feel even smoother even
creamier than I really remembered and
you know I like the Rimmel matte
lipsticks as well so we're just kind of
killin it with their lipsticks so I
chose three from this nude line and you
can look at the bottom and kind of
what we're talking about in terms of
shades some went just as light as
humanly possible and then there were I
think one or two shades that went deeper
than the darkest shade that I picked up
so if you are into the deep rich brownie
nudes or you're into just the lightest
possible shades they've got it so I'll
show you the swatch first I got shade 42
and this to me seems like the most
classic nude I really wanted to pick up
the thing that most people would
identifies like a regular standard nude
lip and so that is what I've been
wearing throughout the video as well I
think it's a really gorgeous color it's
definitely growing on me at first I
thought oh it's a little bit too light
for me to handle I threw on just a
little bit of the lip liner that I'll
mention in a second and I really liked
the effect on my lips so very much
enjoying that it's very comfortable and
it has surprisingly good staying power
for being a cream formula lipstick then
I went for number 45 and this in
comparison to the last one I see more of
like a very light mauve like the
lightest mob ever I'm not so sure I have
any shade in my collection that's
exactly like this because it's not like
a warm pink this is the coolest color
I'll be mentioning in this video and it
kind of surprises you when you see it on
the lips it's very full coverage it's a
little bit different kind of look but
it's a fun way to switch up your regular
news and lastly from that line I got
number 47 and this is a really nice kind
of warm rich brownish color but not too
dark of a brown you know what I'm saying
it's kind of similar to the darker end
of that elf lip duo but not quite that
deep and it's not quite as rosy as touch
of spice so I see a lot of Brown in this
color I love this shade I think this is
going to be a gorgeous like late summer
into fall shade although you know where
it anytime but I just love to see this
really wide range that Rimmel had put
out because like I said some go even
darker than this they are again a cream
formula lipstick you might notice a
little more shine at the onset when you
first apply them but I just think
they're gorgeous colors I'm so happy I
found those and I have to tell you about
a lip liner pic that I really think
would work for absolutely anything I've
mentioned
and it is the next slide on lipliner in
nude suede shoes I use this a little bit
just kind of defining my Cupid's bow a
little bit more a little bit on the
outsides of the lip for this shade which
was again I think one of the lightest
shades that I mentioned today and I
really just love the way it finished
things off but this is a super long
wearing product so you wear this all
over the lips under anything that I've
talked about it will change up the color
somewhat because this may be deeper than
certain shades it'll have really good
staying power that way or like I did you
know just use it kind of as a finishing
touch to clean up your lips I love that
shade I love how workable it is and then
if you do want something a little bit
deeper to mix in with your nude lips
that might be lighter I have talked
about this one a lot lately but it's the
elf matte lip color in praline love this
shade very brownish just about as brown
as anything I've talked about today it
can go very deep it looks pretty with
just all over the lips you know filled
in but it's a nice little kind of
accessory to the things I've talked
about and then you know I've got to talk
a nude gloss real quick and I had pulled
out like four or five nude glosses from
the drugstore that I loved and then I
thought you know let's just simplify
this you know that there's one true
favorite and it is this it is the
l'oreal extraordinaire gloss in the
shade nude ballet i really feel like
this is the best new gloss pretty much
in any price range and it looks good
paired with a nude lip it looks good
alone it's got a great comfortable non
sticky texture i enjoy the applicator
that kind of comes to a bit of a point
there and I just love that today thank
you guys so much for watching this video
I hope if you're getting into the nude
lips whether they be a light nude a
peachy nude a pinky nude a bratty nude
that maybe you found something that will
appeal to you in this video and I am so
excited about that Kate Moss line if
you've tried anything outside of the
number 42 45 or 47 that you'd like to
recommend to me and tell me about I am
totally game for checking out some more
of those so thank you again guys and
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
