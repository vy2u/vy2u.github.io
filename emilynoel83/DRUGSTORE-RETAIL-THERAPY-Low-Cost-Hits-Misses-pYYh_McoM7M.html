into what I'm going to refer to as a
retail therapy hall this is the kind of
hall that happens at like 11 o'clock at
night after the kids are in bed you're
logging on thinking you're only gonna
get false eyelashes but you just kind of
start digging through the whole website
and picking out some other things and
you don't feel too guilty about it
because everything on the site is very
affordable this is I Kate house this is
a website I've ordered from quite a few
times actually they've got a number of
affordable brands that you might not see
in drugstores and then some that you do
like for example I think they sell
Milani on this site they also have like
a huge selection of false eyelashes and
palettes and stuff so anyway I came for
the lashes I ended up with a lot of
other things and it honestly did feel
rather therapeutic so I'm gonna jump in
and talk about the lip products I really
want to let you know what's happening
here with the lips it gets nikka kaor
nicka K they're whipped lip glosses and
judging by just the name the description
I thought maybe I would end up with
something that was a lot like those
Loreal Pro matte glosses that I'm loving
so much right now and I got him home and
instantly putting them on the lips I
thought yes this feels just like those
oh but alas they started to dry down yes
I said alas major liquid lipstick style
dry down these are called lip glosses
they are not lip glosses they are liquid
lipsticks they dry to a point where
you're gonna feel just a little bit
sticky like if I let my lips press
together there's like that cling where
they're actually sticking to each other
and then you start to get a patchy look
because when they stick they pull from
either the top or bottom lip maybe it's
showing on camera maybe it isn't but
it's a little bit patchy here on the
lower lip and it's strictly because as
you press your lips together and you
talk like it's pulling a little bit from
one lip to the next so these are not
worth it although I do kind of like the
colors the one I'm wearing today is
arrests it and the dry down does darken
these up considerably I think it's kind
of a cool shade and I also got redwood
and Redwood is a little more rosy like
less peanut buttery and you know it is
gonna dry down just a bit darker than
that I mean
pretty colors but it's just the thought
of it being a lipgloss is kind of
misleading and the texture does not feel
nice okay what else did I get let's talk
about the false lashes I love a red
cherry number forty three false lash and
there are actually a lot of brands that
make what I believe is that exact same
style and these lashes I thought and
feel like I think a dollar a dollar
ninety-nine and the brand is the cream
shop number forty three so this is what
they sell on Ike a house that's just
like the red cherry 43s I'm wearing
another pair of those right now so you
can see them on I think they're
beautiful lash like they just they frame
my eye shape really nicely there's a
good amount of length to them on the
outside you can see they're pretty
tapered in on the insides but I do think
that makes them blend kind of nicely
with your natural lashes so I got two
sets of those and then I got these
cherry blossom 5:23 and here's the deal
with these these stay longer on the
inner corner however as a whole I think
they're shorter these appear that they
might be longer but I'm pretty sure
these 43 slike extend out a little
further and I can just see it when I get
him on my eyes I'm gonna be coming back
for these so that was a great deal and I
really liked that lash style and the
bands are nice on these too I've always
struggled with elfs false eyelashes
because I just feel like you know no
matter how I work them around and Bend
him and kind of prep them for my eyes
before I put them on they're still just
all over the place these are really nice
and after like one or two wears they're
totally going to just sit right on your
eyes where they need to go I got a few
things from LA girl these blushes I
really like these blushes the one that I
had before is called just playful so a
neutral kind of blush I think they're
selling these on ulta.com as well but
these are nice just full colored matte
blushes I've got a little bit of the
just playful kind of right here on the
apple of the cheek although I'm getting
tidbit washed out on camera today I
think it's like the darkness of the hair
and the eye and then my skin is looking
like way lighter on camera than it is in
person but I got two more sheets and
they turned out to be really bright like
even brighter than I was
anticipating they here's a novel idea
let's just open them up and then you
won't have all that glare on top of the
color this color here is just pinched so
a really rosy pink type shade and I've
got that actually right in this zone of
my cheek and then this is a really fresh
pink called just kissed when I was
mentioning what was it in one of the Too
Faced palettes the set of three there
was a really hot pink blush and one of
those and I was like you know I find
this kind of hard to work with it was a
hot pink but it was kind of like a I
don't know a deep magenta pink and this
one in contrast is a lighter hot pink I
find this shade very easy to work with
on the cheeks it gives a really nice
flush just a very healthy look easy to
sort of blend into your skin and make it
work but that one in the Too Faced
palette it was a deeper hot pink and I
found that a bit of a struggle for my
skin tone but might not be so bad for a
deeper skin tone this it's gorgeous it's
a great shade think in from the cold
type of flush on the cheeks I love that
but these are these are really nice and
then if you like something a little more
neutral I mean let me just pop this one
on again this is the one I already had
but it's coming back to life for me in
this video like just a little neutral
easy works great with this kind of color
scheme I've got on my skin right now
definitely something you want to look
into if you want a nice pigmented blush
and the shade range was huge so lots to
choose from and then I realized oh
they've got these eyeluxe little quads
here from la la girl or la colors it's
this la girl I always confuse the two
brands but I got this one and energized
and I got it kind of realizing there
wouldn't be a ton of contrast between
these colors like nothing's overly dark
in here but you look at the swatches
they're very very smooth it's a nice
buttery feeling formula you got this
like matte peach and then varying
degrees of kind of like bronzy rose gold
I dig it I haven't done a look with this
yet but I'm going to I just wanted to
throw that out there and then I got to
larger palettes I'm gonna start with the
smaller of the two and it's the one that
I am wearing on my eyes today get I have
full-on red on my lids and I just I saw
this on the website and could not turn
it down for I think $5.99
it's again from that nicka or Nika que
brand and it says perfect 23 perfect 23
matte colors and as soon as I glanced at
it I started thinking of my busy art
like dark matte palette just seeing this
spread of colors it made me think that
and then the first time I opened it I
busted one of the sides like I will take
ownership of this this was operator
error but I made that little thing pop
off there so I'm sorry palette but it
may not be the most expensive quality
palette $5.99 oops it's also a sponge
tip taped in there - we've got like two
rows of matte neutrals a row of super
vivid colorful shades here and these are
labeled blush on the back to me these
are eyeshadows I don't think I could see
those colors working on my cheeks but
and then some cool shadows here and like
some sort of base highlight type shades
over on this side but they are mattes
well the color scheme might make me
think of busy art intensity wise you
know it's not really on par with that as
you look at the swatches there are dark
shades that you know should be going a
little darker and more intense just as
far as what the shade appears to be but
there's a lot of workable stuff going on
in here I mean that red the red that
I've got on my lids today is probably
the strongest shade in this palette just
intensity wise and I used this palette
and this palette alone to get the look
I've got the red on my lid and then I've
got like some of this shade in the outer
corner some of this kind of mustardy
shade blend it out over the edge some of
the warm Browns on the lower lash line
and I do see some shades kind of
repeating themselves a little bit like
some really close colors in this top
couple of rows I'm not gonna complain
about too much because this again was
just a $5.99 eye palette but even the
subtle differences between the shades is
I was finding as I blended things out it
was kind of nice to very easily work
from one shade into the next into the
next you know when they're really close
like this so it's kind of a cool palette
and you can definitely get some intense
eye looks if you like the reds the
purples in here while they seem like
they're just screaming at you purple
from the palette they're not really that
strong and this shade which one this one
right here is more of a pink actually
but there are definitely some
interesting color combinations you
get out of that one and I was intrigued
no you're not getting the world's
greatest eyeshadow there but you're
getting some pretty good stuff and then
outside of the lashes this might be my
favorite thing I got one of these cara
palettes or cara let me know in the
comments section if you tried anything
from this brand this is like a $15
palette I got the eso 635 color
eyeshadow palette why can't they just
give these in name why can't we just
call it like fall fun times or I don't
know I got this palette because I
thought this is doing some things that
the Anastasi of Beverly Hills subculture
palette is doing you know it's got some
dark like teal type colors working in
some greens some real orange shades and
mustardy yellows there's all kinds of
finishes in here too we go from matte to
ultra metallic like really bright
metallic shades to a little bit softer
shimmery finishes and look at the Reds
down here too I probably could have
gotten this very same look that I'm
wearing right now out of this palette
and I think the quality is actually
surprisingly good in here I did a look
with this the other day I thought the
mattes blended really really nicely very
evenly they were what I would have
expected you know intensity wise out of
some of the darker ones and the
mid-tones really showed up well too and
lately as I said in my lorac video
although that palette was kind of the
exception to this but I'm more into
smaller palettes you know dalits that
don't give me a lot of unnecessary
shades and just a lot of colors to sift
through I'm appreciating these days more
small palettes where every color is
important and has its place this is a
larger palette and there might be some
shades in here that are honestly pretty
close to one another then you gotta
remind yourself
oh yeah it's $15 and the quality is
surprisingly nice so a very like
fall/winter rich type palette if you
like the warm colors you might be really
into this I noticed there was a lot to
choose from though from this line on I
Kate house like different color schemes
and it makes me think of Coastal Scents
which puts out some nice quality
inexpensive stuff too but I think maybe
what makes these palettes a little more
special in my eyes is just the color
configuration may or may not have been
inspired by the subculture palette but
it's not just like okay
here are warm neutrals just the full
spectrum across the board with nothing
else thrown in like they put in a plum a
teal a couple of greens some really
reddish shades a few taupe sprinkled in
there so it's kind of a little more
unique for that reason but I like that I
like it a lot so guys that concludes my
retail therapy haul if you've ever
shopped on I Kate house I would love to
know like what are some hidden gems on
that site that you really enjoy for me I
think the false eyelashes are great
there's some nice products from la girl
on there and that Cara palette is really
good stuff so thank you for your time I
hope you guys have a great day and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
