this if you want to see how I
transformed into a Dancing with the
Stars dancer keep on watching I'm going
to go through what I did for hair makeup
tanning pretty much every part of the
process I'm going to cover it at least
briefly just so you can get a taste of
how I achieve this look and keep
honoring everybody we're here in my
bathroom I just took a shower and yes I
am closed I exfoliated a little bit got
ready for my tanning action I've also
got my Turbie twist on this is actually
something I'd really recommend because
it's a super absorbent towel and you can
just wrap your hair up in it it's a lot
less bulky than say just you know taking
a full-size towel and putting it on your
head so I've got my hair soaking up
there that also accused my hair on my
face where I while I put some tanner on
my arms legs and a little bit on my face
for my face Tanner I like to use this
L'Oreal sublime bronze it's a dual
chambered thing with a bronzer anatase
on my body I'm going to be using this in
Neutrogena instant bronze and this I
don't even know if this is still being
sold at stores this is in deep so this
is a very dark tanner and I mean I think
it would be similar to like the San
Tropez mousse bronzer stuff but it's
just something I found that I think
would give me a really dark tan so we'll
see towards the end of the video how
well that develops and basically pump
out some of the mousse here this isn't
really a tutorial I'm just kind of
showing you for instance what's going on
and yeah it's a pretty dark contrast to
my skin so I'll just keep blending that
in and I'll join you in a little bit is
getting to a very fun part here with the
eye makeup of what I've done is I've
taken one of my dark shades of Coastal
Scents cream liner the shade is stellar
and I just patted that all over my lid
and then I topped it off and kind of
shaped this outer V part with my makeup
forever a diamond shadow this sparkly
black shade and what I just did because
I wanted to incorporate red in this eye
look which is kind of hard to do you
have to sort of be careful about that so
your eyes don't look like you know
really bloodshot or whatever I would sit
my creative me palette went for this red
shade right here
I just kind of took a medium medium
shadow brush and just kind of went right
over the border of the black to kind of
get this unique red look so start that
on this side as well I just kind of just
kind of going over first over the border
and then kind of building it out it's
really interesting I like it there you
can see some of that red starting to
build and you could just build this out
as much as you wanted to and it's a fun
way to incorporate color you know while
really keeping a smoky look so you could
take any color and do this you could do
this with purple or green or you know
you can just go nuts with this but I'm
enjoying the red because it is just so
different so hope you like this look
guys I'm also going to be highlighting
on here that's something else I did here
I highlighted kind of right in here and
up here so I'll go ahead and do that on
this eye and I'll show you the look what
I might guys little progress report here
on the look I just got my false
eyelashes on and boy are these intense
these are the Ardell fashioned lashes
107 in black and so I've got those on
there I've gotten my eye look complete
here when it's just really dark smoky
just a little bit of highlight in the
corner and the top otherwise it's all
dark with this little red border which
I'm really loving I think I'll try doing
that list of other colors pretty soon
but I just these are still drying so I
need to keep them kind of boosted up
here but as far as the rest of the face
goes I really concentrated on getting
the flawless complexion overall with my
maybelline superstay foundation and then
I used a lot of bronzer I did a lot of
contouring with the cheeks so you got my
brows complete there but I mean beyond
this is just a very glowing bronzed and
you know no feature is left untouched
you know it's not like you know you can
forget the strategy of just accenting
one feature because I've got bright red
lips dark eyes you know ten contour
blush everything so
I would say if you're trying to
duplicate this look for the Dancing with
the Stars look just really pay attention
to kind of the glow the overall glow at
the face
one thing that was useful meant for me
was my Smashbox flash powder this has a
nice kind of shimmery pearly sparkle to
it so I used that on my cheekbones here
and just a matte bronzer to help you
contour and stuff like that really helps
on my lips I used my Rimmel exaggerate
lipliner and ravish my favorite red lip
liner and then on my lipstick I used my
NYX round lipstick in chaos so that
bright red tone that we're getting in
there so yeah I hope you like this look
guys it's definitely fun just with the
liner I don't know if I mentioned that
before but just really went in very far
with the corner took it all the way out
here I did liquid on top and I did a
Smashbox waterproof cream liner on the
bottom and just kind of really winged it
out and put the eyelashes on top
all right guys back in the bathroom now
and I am curling my hair with my little
cheapo color a little straight there I'm
just kind of taking it all over in two
sections I've got the the shorter layers
pulled up right now but basically what
I'm doing is taking out a strip of the
hair and just kind of twisting it around
the straightener and very very slowly
pulling it down so I can get that curl
and so I'll just continue to do that all
over and I'll join you at the end and
talk what I'm talking about my
accessories that I'm using I'm going to
incorporate a little flower into the
hair at the end so I'll see you in a
minute
I think accessories are a big part of
this look as well as you can see I added
this red flower here to my hair just
because I think that kind of makes you
think dancer when you see that also you
know the sparkly earrings they're very
formal on that show you know it's all
like the classic ballroom dancer kind of
stuff got this little kind of cuff
bracelet I got from Wet Seal here didn't
really go with the necklace or anything
just that was basically it
I've got shoes with the ankle strap on
them so that you can you know those are
dance shoes so that's what I did for you
summer so anyway as you know I am 1/2
I'm 50% of our outfit tonight and Tyler
is the other oh yeah the vest he is
ready to do a Samba or a cha-cha or
whatever and he's thinking how did I get
into this right first time I've ever won
body glitter will expose here's what
happened to Tyler today I take Sun loss
tandem twice open up the best Tyler let
us see yeah I said let's tandem not once
but twice I contoured him with like
bronzer and stuff and it really makes
his muscles stand out more I also put
body glare all over him as you can see
you got to do that for Dancing with the
Stars at work and we're doing it a
little cheesy anyway and also on his
hair you can't really see it since he's
blonde but I did put in some like
metallic gold hair mascara and he's also
got some kind of bronzer stuff on his
face so yeah I think we pulled it off
rather well thank you so much for taking
the time to watch this video maybe
you'll get some ideas for a next year I
don't know the next time you I go out
with your friends thanks so much for
watching have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
