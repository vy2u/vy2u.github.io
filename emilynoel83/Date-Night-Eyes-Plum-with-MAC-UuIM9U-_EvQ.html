to leave anybody out so while I do a lot
of drug store looks using some really
affordable brands I know I have some
viewers out there that also love the
high-end brands the mac and things like
that so I thought hey I'm going to do an
All MAC eyeshadow look and it's going to
be sort of a purpley toned look but
alone you know a little bit smoky it's
totally the kind of look you could
customize and really make it your own
but it's it's some shades of purple and
plum that I think are really flattering
would be a great date night look and I'm
going to just take you through how I did
that and also how I used a very unique
kind of false lashes for this so if you
want to see how I did it keep watching
guys the first thing I did was applied
my Too Faced shadow insurance all over
my lid then I'm going to take the mac
eyeshadow in tracks this is a really
pretty purple eat own shadow that
actually has some really neat gold
reflective qualities to it so it really
is an unusual shadow and I'm going to
use my ELF eyeshadow brush just to get
that on there and then just apply that
all over the lid like I said this gig it
can look golden at times but it also
gives off that nice overall kind of
medium purple shades so I'm just getting
that all over the lid and not only the
lid but taking it up just a little bit
and working it into the crease just
slightly
you
next I'm going to take a little bit
larger shadow brush this is the Revlon
contour shadow brush and I'm using
another Mac shadow this one is in sketch
and it's kind of a nice deep sort of
purple a brown with just a little bit of
shimmer to it it's a velvet shade and
I'm going to get some on my brush here
and use this as an overall contour it
works really nicely with tracks so I
like this a lot you get kind of a warm
purpley plummy look without being like
in your face purple so if you like more
understated purple tones you'll enjoy
this look and you can just work it up
and out as much as you want these blend
beautifully so I'm just getting that in
there and there we go then I'm going to
go for carbon right here just a matte
black shade use my fine crease brush
from essence of beauty and we're just
going to use this to deepen up just the
outer part of the crease you know just
kind of give it a little added contrast
there from all the purple
I'm just kind of work it out and sort of
do that outer V if you want to it's
totally up to you how intense you want
to make that or if you you know like the
intensity of just the Purple's just skip
this step altogether um then as sort of
a blending step I'm going to take my my
Sephora rounded crease brush which is
just really nice for kind of finishing
off the edges of looks and I'm going to
take trax again and just kind of go over
the outer border here because when
tracks hits the light it can give you
that nice golden effect and so i'm going
to i'm just using it super lightly a
really light touch and just getting that
kind of up to the brow bone and then I'm
going to take um max and naked lunch and
just get a little bit on the same brush
go right under the highest point of the
arch and also i'm going to take my
lowepro nail one quarter brush my real
little brush and just put a little of
that right in here in the inner corner
and there we go now it's time to think
about our liner i'm going to be using
revlon colorstay liquid liner in black
shimmer so it's really close to black
only it has just a little bit of some
shimmery bits to it I guess you'd say
but it's nothing crazy I mean it's going
to come off mostly just like blackest
black does but oops just gonna basically
trace my lash line here got that a
little thicker than I wanted right there
in the inner corner but you know it
happens from time to time and I'm just
kind of thickening it a little bit here
on the corner and then we're going to
move on and do some lower liner and but
we're not really going to lose liner I'm
just going to use the carbon I shadow
just that nice matte black shade because
it is so rich I mean it kind of is a
really nice alternative to using a
pencil or something like that so I'm
going to grab that now that's carbon I'm
going to use my tackle on liner brush
from Coastal Scents the angled one just
get some of that product there on my
brush and basically just get right in
there right in your lower lash line and
go you know as far in as you like I know
some people don't like to go in all the
way if you don't then don't I do so I
will i mean i'm not using a real heavy
hand here but I just um I find that
things come off a little more bold on
this camera maybe especially this close
in they do in real life so I'm doing how
I would like to see it in real life and
but there we go there's our liner step
then I'm going to take my eyelash curler
curl my lashes and put on some Too Faced
lash injection mascara I'm going to do a
coat on the bottom I code on the top and
then I'm going to join you with some
different kind of false lashes okay guys
i'm back with you and those different
false lashes i'm using their the revlon
fantasy links but they are not the self
adhesives they are these individual
little like bundles that are bigger than
say you know your typical individual
lashes like say these from ELF are you
know they're they're a nice little size
clump and I put two of them on this I
and I'm going to do the same over here
and basically what i'm going to do i'll
show you one of them they're basically
all the same size 12 the next except i
think the ones on the outsides of these
little of the way they're placed on
there might be a little bit thicker but
i'm going to just go ahead and use the
little glue that they give you again
this is revlon product not self adhesive
so i'm going to put a little bit of that
glue on there and just let that get
tacky now once this glue has gotten just
a little bit on the tacky side i just
wait like between 30 seconds 45 seconds
somewhere in there i'm just going to lay
it on my lash line close to my natural
lashes just sit it on there and lightly
press down and then kind of boost
sit back up so it kind of dries in that
upward fashion and we're going to go
ahead and put I not only this one but
one more kind of right in here beside it
and then I'm going to top it off with
another coat of mascara so it all joins
in and then I'll join you with the
finish guys all right I'm back with the
finished look this is just a really
simple look using some different
high-end products which I don't usually
use but I thought hey let's switch it up
a little bit and do something different
here it's a kind of purply look but it's
more on the plum side so I think it
makes it more wearable for a lot of
people that don't want to wear too much
color but just want that little hint of
something different and also using these
Revlon fantasy lengths lashes that are
more the individual kind these are
called lush that's what it says on the
packaging here and it's just little lash
bundles that you can place their on your
lash line to give you a little bit of
added thickness there so just an idea if
you don't like messing with the full
strip on my lips I use the Rimmel
exaggerated lip liner in East End snob
is just a light pink and then I used my
NARS lip gloss in Turkish delight so
just kind of a light semi-transparent
pinky nude there so I hope you guys
enjoyed this look I think it would be
great for a night out or a date or
something like that so thanks so much
for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
