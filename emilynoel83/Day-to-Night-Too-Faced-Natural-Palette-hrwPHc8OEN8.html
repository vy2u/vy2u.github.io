tutorial in this video I'm going to show
you how to use the two-faced and natural
eye palette to get a natural daytime in
a dramatic nighttime look now the
daytime look is not only very natural
but it's also very very quick and easy
to do so great when you're in a rush to
get out the door it's using some of the
matte shades in this palette as well as
you know this unique shade right here
that I love the nighttime look it's just
all about building up the intensity on
the eyes we're going to be going into
some of the deep shades in this palette
and really really working with them not
only in terms of shadows but we're gonna
amp up the liner a little bit and she's
gonna be a really really special look I
think it would be absolutely perfect for
any holiday parties or get-togethers you
have coming up where you just really
want to look special and really polished
and dramatic I think this is the way to
go
okay this first step of the eye tutorial
is so easy we're going to go for this
shape first right here it's called
heaven and it is a matte kind of creamy
white shade so just take any flat
eyeshadow brush and just get that all
over the inner part of your eyelid next
take the shade right next to that which
is Velvet Revolver and this is another
matte color it just is kind of like a
matte very very light taupe and it's
almost hard to distinguish the
difference between these two shades that
I can kind of tell that what I'm putting
out here on the outside is just slightly
deeper than what I have on the inside a
fluffy brush go back to heaven that
first shade we used and just kind of
apply that all up under your eyebrow
just for a touch of shimmer I'm just
barely touching my brush to silk teddy
right here it's a super shimmery shade
if you apply it concentrated but use it
with a fluffy brush and you just get the
prettiest little sheen right there on
your board I'm gonna take a medium sized
crease brush this is from my essence of
beauty crease brush duo and I'm going to
go to this shade one of my favorites in
the set and it's called push-up and you
can see it's kind of a warm kind of a
medium brown but it's got a lot of warm
rosy shades to it as well or tones to it
and so I'm just gonna look down in my
mirror and apply this in my natural
crease and you're gonna see some just a
little bit of deepening there but it's
nothing too crazy or unnatural the more
of the shade you apply the more of sort
of a warm rosy tone you're gonna get
here in the crease so I just like to
maybe go back for one more application
to make it a little more concentrated
and then take my fluffy brush and use
that to really buff it out and keep this
a very natural look I'm taking my Mac
fluidline in blitz and glitz and this
does have a little bit of a sparkle to
it as you can see there but overall it's
kind of a dark dark black shade and so
I'm just going to apply that from my
inner to outer corner here of my upper
lash line and I'm not winging it out
right now we're keeping this sort of
you know obviously the natural version
again when we get to the outer corner
I'm not doing anything fancy with it
just kind of pulling it to the outside
the lower lashline I'm kind of making a
little bit of a connection here in the
outer corner and just taking whatever is
left on my brush and smudging that right
in my lower lash line so it's not going
to be a lot and it's gonna probably take
you about halfway this shade and the
palette is called six spresso and it is
a deep deep dark brown and what I'm
going to use for that is actually an
angled liner brush you think I grabbed
the wrong one at first and I'm just
gonna top off take it in and under my
lower lash line then I'm just taking a
pencil type brush run it over all of
that on the lower lash line and just
buff it out it's gonna look really
natural but still a little bit of
definition to complete the natural look
I'm just gonna curl my eyelashes and
apply a coat of magazine lash mascara
this is the first time I'm using this so
just kind of want some length out of
this for the natural look so I'll put
that on and I'll join you with the
finished look
so here's the finished natural look I
mean it really just kind of polishes off
the features without looking like too
much I've been asked for some really
really just super no-frills makeup looks
and this would be one of them I think
and so if you don't have this particular
palette I mean you can come up with
these colors elsewhere probably in your
collection something a little bit
similar I also did just a little bit of
the Maybelline lash discovery on the
lower lashes just to bring them out a
bit more I think that's a very natural
way and you know if you do it lightly
that's a natural way to define the eyes
as well on my lips I'm using a new Mac
lipstick that I got it is a cream
machine and the shade is called cream
cup so that's where this kind of light
pinky lip is coming now let's take a
break from the natural and get a
step-by-step look at the dramatic look
all right for starters one of the
easiest ways to sort of transform the
way your eye actually looks is to line
your waterline so I'm going to be using
my L'Oreal pencil perfect eye liner here
and just just go from the inner to outer
corner there and you will see kind of an
instant difference in the way your
eyelid one of my favorite shades in the
palette it's right here it's called
erotica and it looks like kind of a
charcoal gray ish taupe and it's just a
really pretty shade I'm going to get
some of that on a smallish either like a
pencil brush or a small crease brush
whatever you have and I'm going to start
in on the inner corner actually and so
we're gonna build up a little bit more
of a crease going right in here so it's
definitely gonna be different from the
other and different from some of my eye
looks where I only concentrate the
shadow on the you know outside we're
gonna do some on the inside here go up
as far as you feel comfortable and
remember you can always take a bear
fluffy brush and kind of blend this out
just a little bit more using that same
brush I used to initially apply that
it's kind of a smudgy pencil type brush
I'm gonna take erotica down under the
eye as well this is just such a pretty
shade because it has that shimmer and
shine but yet it's really dark I don't
know it's just a nice combination really
easy way to transition your makeup from
day to night if you don't want to go
through you know redoing it all
completely from scratch you know you can
just extend your liner out and you've
got a cat eyes so going back to the
cream liner we used it first this is
again Mac's fluid line and blitz and
glitz and I'm just gonna pick up a
little bit more of that product and
basically extend the liner out to form
the sort of cat eyed look so I'm
extending the liner from the top as you
see there but I'm also creating more of
a connection around the bottom and
bringing it down under the lower lash
line somewhat so I just want a little
more dramatic on the lower lash line
about halfway under with the fluid line
there and so now we see what we've got
to work with in terms of doing the way
the outer vite with the shadow so I'm
taking the darkest shade in this palette
expresso right there and I'm just gonna
pick some of that up on my fine crease
brush so this is like pretty much the
smallest crease brush I have and this
gives me a lot of control for steps like
this so get my hair out of my face there
and I'm going to start about the middle
of my crease just overlapping erotica
and you can see it's all deepening out
and I'm kind of working off the tip of
the of the liner and just pulling it up
a little bit higher than that once
you've got the shadow applied you know
it may look a little bit rough right at
first but if you shave czar so blendable
just take a fluffy bear brush and buff
over the top of it and you will have a
blended out look now with an angled
liner brush I'm taking six preso again
I'm going just under the fluid line and
this is just gonna soften that look up a
lot so we want to accent this look a
little bit more with some more bold
highlights so I'm gonna go to silk teddy
this shade right here it's pretty
shimmery and I'm gonna pick some of that
up on a flat eyeshadow brush and just
get some of that working for us is more
of a highlight right under the brow then
we're really gonna make the corner of
the eye pop with this amazingly shimmery
glittery shade right down here at the
bottom called nude beach this is just
out of this world sparkly so I'm going
to take a small detail brush and I'm
going to just go Pat that right around
the tear duct obviously staying outside
the tear duct but I'm just patting it on
right around there it just kind of
looked like a little explosion of
sparkle right in the corner of your I'm
gonna give myself one more coat of the
zoom lash on the upper lashes and
another coat of the lash discovery on
the bottom just because we have been
working with a lot of shadows here that
could I guess sort of tone down the
blackness of that
Scarah so I wouldn't top that off for a
finishing touch and then I'll join you
with the finished look
alright guys here is the finished
dramatic look as you can see much more
contouring on the eyes and it you know
it's a little more time-consuming than
the first look obviously because you're
kind of building on that first in mind
you know if there are some steps that
you would rather not do if you just
wanted to stop at the point where we
kind of did the erotica shade there on
the on the crease and made it a little
more heavy that way and you want to
leave out the winged liner or whatever
you know use whatever portions of this
look you enjoy the most and just make it
your own if you want you only changed up
the lip a little bit and that I made it
a little more pouty for the nighttime
look I took a light shimmery light light
light shade it's lip light spot from
Bonnie Belle and spun sugar and I just
put it on the lower uhm the on the lower
lip and it just gives you that instantly
pouty look so I didn't really do a whole
lot to change the face makeup I just
kind of like to help was I thought it
looked for but it worked for both
scenarios but if you wanted to bump it
up with a little more contour or a
little more highlight by all means go
for it really I'm a fan of this palette
because I feel like it offers some
unique colors that I really haven't seen
a lot such as these two right here that
I love some ultra shimmery highlights I
mean this is just a great little
sampling of highlight shades to have
here you've got a mat you know creamy
shade you've got a shimmering metallic
and then you've got ultra ultra Sparkle
so I love having these options and it's
just great to have a palette that can
take you from day to night and I also
want to point out with this palette
there's a little place here where you
slide out and they give you ideas for
several different looks today
classic and fashion and that's basically
if you look across it's designed so the
shades work in threes across so keep
that in mind if you've got this palette
and you're looking for ideas or your you
want to go beyond what I've shown you
here those are some options you have as
well
I just want to tell you real quickly how
I got my hair in these videos and it's
super easy I mean the hair in this is
just as easy as the makeup was I
basically had my hair just a little bit
curly and already and so what I did I
gave it a little bit of a tease in the
crown and then I just took a clip this
is kind of just a i'll just unclip it
cuz i can just as easily redo it for you
umm one of these clips I mean I know
some people don't like to use big Clips
but in a way I mean I feel like this is
just very natural it blends right in
with my hair but I'm pulling all my hair
over to one side and just clipping it
just kind of pulling this right down
behind my ear to gather it up can't even
see the clip from the front that it just
kind of collects all your hair there at
the side and it looks like a cute little
side ponytail can't get much easier than
that now for the nighttime look for the
hair you could obviously go the same I
mean I think the first do was kind of
appropriate either way but I threw on
this little headband that I showed in my
recent haul video this is from forever
21 but I've seen these in a lot of
different places and I think that's
sparkle even if it's kind of a casual
super easy hairdo I think this
automatically makes people think maybe
it's a little more fancy that's so much
like the eye look the hair look just
builds on itself instead of leaving this
in a ponytail I just kind of scratched
it up into a little low side bun nothing
hard or complicated and then I stuck the
clip kind of right underneath the bun in
the back so it's really not even that
detectable if you are looking at it from
the back side but it's just real easy
don't stress yourself out too much about
it just keep it kind of loose and simple
and it's really fun so thanks so much
for tuning in to this two-in-one
tutorial these are always
much fun to do and I hope you have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
