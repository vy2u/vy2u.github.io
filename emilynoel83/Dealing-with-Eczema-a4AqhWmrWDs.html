me for this video this one's gonna be a
little different than usual I'm gonna be
talking about a particular skin related
issue that I have dealt with probably
over just the past month here and with
the house situation and all that I
didn't really have a whole lot of time
to get into explaining this to you but I
definitely once it was happening I was
like this is a topic that I think would
help a lot of people if I brought it up
first off I need to say I am NOT a
doctor nor do I claim to be I'm just
gonna tell you about my experience with
eczema skin condition and how I dealt
with it and basically my suggestion to
you which is ultimately to see a doctor
so kind of fast-forward through
everything I say that's what I'm going
to recommend to you but first you know
some of the things I tell you about
might help you identify if this is
something you're dealing with basically
eczema is a condition with the skin and
as a symptom of that you may notice
extremely dry skin it's not necessarily
like widespread all over your face or
your body but sometimes just certain
areas for me the only place I was
noticing this was actually around my eye
area it was on this eye and it was too
severe dryness from about here up to
here this whole area going all the way
up to my brow into the crease of my eye
you can imagine that was not fun to deal
with makeup wise and it really made me
scared because I thought what's what's
going on why is my skin so drying and
this is affecting you know the way my
makeup looks and stuff like that so
going back again about a month ago I
noticed my skin was just starting to
seem a little bit drier in that area so
it's for me this problem sort of crept
up on me a little bit it wasn't like
instantly my skin was super flaky you
know it was just a little bit drier
there and so I thought you know oh well
my skin is just being strange I'm gonna
put a little extra moisturizer or eye
cream or whatever around that area I
think I got some temporary relief from
that and wasn't too concerned but as
time went on I get you know over the
series
a couple of weeks there it got quite a
bit worse and I spent probably a solid
week eventually with very flaky skin and
not just like flaky like you know if
you've had a sunburn and your skin kind
of peels off entirely and then you're
left with kind of bare skin
it was just a continual flakiness like
even if you put something on it even if
you put like a gentle gentle moisturizer
like the Clinique dramatically different
was something I thought you know okay
this isn't gonna cause any any
disruption to my skin but even so it
just had this continual state of dryness
and flakiness and this is so obviously
once that started to get in the way of
my makeup routine and just get concerned
why is it just this area my whole whole
rest of my face was fine
I had it nowhere else on my body it's
not to say this can't happen elsewhere
on your legs or your arms or wherever
but for me this was the only place it
was around my eye and so I was growing
rather concerned about this and my view
this was about the week before like the
week leading up to our move at the house
and I start looking the stuff up online
because I am an instant like if I know
his something's wrong or or anything
like that like I instantly go to the
computer I think a lot of people will
turn to Google and try to figure out
what might be going on before they ever
consult a doctor what was coming up and
what was really sort of making sense
with my symptoms was that it was eczema
and so I read up about it and and yeah
dry flaky skin it can be around your eye
area some people have it on their eyelid
mine was very close to my eyelid and I
read about different things you can pick
up from the drugstore a Eucerin makes a
lot of products that are supposedly
calming and good for the skin condition
and so when I figured that out I was
like man you know I'm going out and I'm
really gonna get some of this because
they reached a point where it was this I
was looking a little more swollen and
thinking back to see if there's any
video where you could identify this the
last and
world that I did I was probably
experiencing some of this but I had
started to get it a little more under
control but anyway I had not only some
swelling a lot of dryness and then
occasionally it was like the area and my
crease was secreting just a little bit
of moisture and I didn't know if that
was because so much skin was flaking off
or something like that I don't know what
this was but it was very consistent with
what I read about eczema online anyway
got some Eucerin products put a little
bit on here but hardly any because then
I started thinking wait wait wait this
stuff does not necessarily say it's okay
for the face and this is my eye area you
know if some of this gets in my eye or
too close to my eyeball or my tear duct
or something like that I don't want to
deal with more severe consequences than
I already have
I went ahead and made an appointment
with my doctor which had I been able to
identify this a little sooner my mom
hasn't had anything like this my it
doesn't run in my family so to ask about
it no one else was really sure you know
so I wish I would have identified it
even sooner than I did but ultimately
called the doctor I did not go to I I
went to like a clinic it wasn't an
actual dermatologist but the doctor was
able to come in give it a look and
basically say yeah that's ex um I've had
that too around the eye the inner part
of her eye she said so she prescribed
something for me it was it's a
prescription lotion it was called the
decimide lotion for external use only
she said and I think this has a steroid
in it and so she advised me only use
this for five days twice a day so like
when you go to bed and when you get up
and and she said keep it a very very
thin layer so I guess whatever is in
this exactly you don't want too much and
you also want to use sparingly around
your eyes so I did that and within the
first day I mean I went from having
flaky flaky flaky to finally something
that could control it and after like I
said the first day I noticed some
results
day everything just continually got
better right now I mean I feel like
you're seeing completely smooth skin
right here this is dry this is not flaky
you know it's it's it's how it should be
it's consistent with the rest of my skin
but stress is one of the triggers that I
found can be a stress can trigger eczema
a lot of people have said on discussion
boards and things like that if they get
stressed that can happen well I was
moving in one week I was packing up my
whole life and moving it to a new place
kind of nervous about that and that
could have very well been part of it
when I was at the doctor they asked me a
lot about was I using a new product or
was I was there any possible reaction
with anything that could be happening
there and I really wasn't doing anything
out of the ordinary I mean I hadn't
tried anything crazy and that I'd never
done before and once I noticed any
dryness
I was definitely toning down what
different products I was using around
that area and using a lot less of them
once that started happening but anyway
they were able to prescribe me this I
used a very thin layer it this may not
be necessarily what every doctor
prescribes but it worked for me and it
really cleared up the issue quickly she
also advised me to use Johnson's baby
shampoo says it's gentle to the eyes as
pure water
she said used this when you wash your
eyes and that was when I first started
this she said you know you can use
whatever to you know get the bulk your
makeup up but if you're doing something
around your eye area use this so that's
what I did I still use my Olay facials
daily cleansing cloths got all my makeup
off and use this around my eye area it
is very gentle even though this was a
sensitive area for that time didn't feel
a thing with this on it so basically
yeah I feel like I've talked forever and
I'm sorry my objective was not to talk
your ear off about this but rather to
maybe just let you know that if you
notice something unusual with your skin
that's not consistent with the rest of
your skin at all this could be elsewhere
on your body or it could be like I had
right around my eye area
um I would advise you to ask a doctor
about it they chances are they've seen
something like this before
you know the dermatologist would
probably be ideal fortunately my the
doctor I went to had experience with
this and they were able to identify it
as well but it's something you need to
be aware of you don't want it to get
more severe or something that you know
takes might take you even longer to
treat or take a different kind of drug
to treat it and you know I know this
works for me it's not necessarily what
will work for you but it was a struggle
because I was still going on the air
doing the news and concealing it as best
I could fortunately we're not on HD
cameras yet work Mars station is going
in that direction but it wasn't showing
up there really so I was getting able to
conceal it or control it or whatever but
that's very hard to do this is flaky dry
the texture is not anything that you
want to work with makeup wise so I just
wanted you guys to be aware of this
and tell you my story thanks again for
watching and I hope I was able to help
you have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
