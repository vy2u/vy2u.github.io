wanted to show you my outfit of the day
I've got a little mint green shirt on
here leopard print scarf some stud
earrings hot pink mittens chemically
though I don't usually wear this outside
of the bathroom this is my Sigma brush
cleaning glow know why I feel the need
to continually have the glove like up
here in the shot the whole time but it's
a really great tool for cleaning your
brushes I'm going to show you how it
works in this video and I have gotten s
quite a bit about how I clean my brushes
and for the longest time I guess I
haven't really been proud of the method
I use which involves really you know
taking a dirty brush and swirling it in
my hand using my hands is like a
makeshift Cup and you know you've wet
the brush under the sinews a little
brush cleaner and you just swirl away
and try to get all the gunk out it
usually takes some time I ended up
adding more brush cleaner to it and it's
just not something I enjoy doing or look
forward to doing especially I see it as
kind of a makeup chore I recently got
this mitt to review from Sigma and of
course it claimed to be you know the
next big thing when it comes to cleaning
your brushes and I'm kind of course
thinking you know really is that truly
the case totally open to a new strategy
given my not so great previous strategy
for cleaning brushes in terms of how
often I clean my brushes I'd say I'd do
it probably once every three to four
weeks and that's a deep cleaning you
know that I'm going to show you in this
video using the sink other times I may
take a little brush cleaner spritz it on
a like a tissue and just you know rub
the brush back and forth to get some
product off if I'm trying to use you
know a fresh different thing and I don't
want the colors to interfere that I had
been using the overall concept with this
mitt is that it's got a variety of
surfaces it's got different textures all
over this whole mitt and the thought is
that you're going to you know use a
little brush cleaner use a little water
run the brush back and forth and it's
like these little nubs and different
things that are all over this this mitt
are going to sort of agitate the brush a
little bit and get some of that product
out when I swirl a brush in my hand or I
swirl it on the bottom of
which I would sometimes do that as well
it doesn't create any friction with the
product coming out and it's kind of like
you just keep going and going it takes
long so I'm gonna give you a closer look
at this mitt and do a few demos cleaning
off brushes for you so you can see how I
do it and also show you the brush
cleaner that I recommend to use with
this as well I want to give you a closer
look at the mitt we're looking at the
face side right now we've got some sort
of horizontal lines here under the rinse
part some really coarse bumpy thingies
here where you can wash the brush and
then here we're looking at a much finer
texture towards the bottom and around
the thumb we've also got some grooves
here where you can kind of squeeze and
sort of get some of the moisture out of
your brush when you're done washing it
then on the other side we're looking at
rinse again with a little bit finer
texture this is for your eye brushes so
you think well it's a smaller brush it's
going to need an even finer texture to
sort of work out some of that product so
that's the difference on each side again
it's got a little lining that you can
take out wash separately if you want to
cleanser I like to use is from Sonia
Kashuk and it's the brush and sponge
cleanser I've also made my own from
Oncourse recipe he's another youtuber
you can do that and use it in the very
same way I'll do this but this works
really well also like a spray is a
really good format for just getting the
minimal amount of product because when
you're dipping your brush into cleanser
a lot more of that cleanser is probably
getting on your brush than you actually
need here you're just getting a fine
mist and with every brush I just used
like one mist of this maybe two but
that's still far less than with other
methods because the little textures on
this do cause whatever cleanser you're
using to lather up a whole lot more so I
want to take you through how I do this
start to finish I like to start with a
glove that is wet I feel like um
everything responds to the cleanser a
little bit better when this is damp then
I do take one spray of the cleanser I'm
going over on the main part of the glove
that I'm going to use to wash the brush
so there we go just one square root of
that then I
to dampen the brush I'm working on just
a little bit there
then simply swirl that brush on this
very coarsely textured part of the glove
and you can start to see the product
really coming off of that brush and so
we swirl swirl swirl then I like to get
the brush wet one more time and go over
the rinse side there I can just see the
product again running right from these
these grooves go over the really finely
textured side I feel like there it's
like okay if there's anything still left
in this brush this part of the mitt is
gonna get it I give it one more rinse go
over that rinse sides rinsing clean I
can see that from what's running through
these grooves and then give it a little
squeeze and get rid of some of that
excess water I find before I like to tip
my brushes aside to dry I'll just squid
give them a good squeeze with a paper
towel and that takes away a lot of extra
moisture they could be harboring then I
just set my finish brush over here with
the others on my towel to show you one
on the eye side it's the very same
concept I get the mint wet I give it one
spray of my brush cleanser right here I
then also get my brush wet and then I go
over this textured side and you can see
we're using a white brush it'll
definitely show you if there's any
product in there and you can see it
really foaming up just with one spray of
my brush cleanser then rinse it go over
this side here we can see a lot of that
product rinsing out and then just for
good measure we go over the really fine
textured side and make sure all of that
product is gone give it another rinse
here and the water is coming through
clean I'm very paranoid about still
having any product on the brush so I
really want to make sure it goes through
clean and then you can squeeze out the
excess water squeeze over it with a
paper towel and you can see we've got a
very clean brush here something I notice
with these white brushes particularly
from Sigma is the
sometimes they'll dry and these little
ends will fray out and it will lose
shape so I like to take these brush
guards which I've mentioned in my Emily
awards video you can pull it just there
pass the tip of the brush store it
downward in a glass like this and I find
not only does it really pull any excess
water South basically from the brush but
it also helps give it a really nice
shape and by the time this brush is
completely dry it's going to be totally
shaped the way you want I definitely
enjoy this product I think it's
extremely innovative and I feel like if
you've got a lot of makeup brushes to
clean and you feel like it's taking you
too much time and it's taking too much
effort to do it this really makes the
process go by faster personally if it's
making brush cleaning faster easier and
quite frankly a little bit fun I'm going
to be more likely to clean my brushes
more off that's gonna be more clean
brushes being used on my face and the
brushes are just going to be kept in
better condition I hope you enjoyed the
video
finally a brush cleaning technique that
I'm kind of proud to talk about and
share so thanks for taking time to watch
and I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
