got it's a really really dark one and I
thought it might be fun to just go ahead
and shoot a tutorial on it when I
started I really wasn't sure how it was
going to turn out but I think I'm pretty
happy with it and this is a Maybelline
eye studio quad in Smoky night so it's
got a little variety there of dark smoky
colors so I used that I also threw in
another drugstore favorite the walking
on eggshells palette from wet and wild
look it's not hard but it utilizes
certain brushes and blending techniques
to make everything look really polished
and finished even though it is such a
dark look this could be fun for a night
out or a date or something like that but
here's how a primer potion and blend
that in on my lid then I'm taking my
Maybelline eye studio smoky night quad
and going to the purple shade which I
feel is actually showing up a little bit
blue but whatevs
and I'm gonna pick some of that up on
the sponge tip that comes with it and
just kind of start blending that in on
all over your lid as you can see I
didn't get right into the innermost
corner but pretty darn close I'm using
the black shade in here and blending
that on the outer outer edge of your lid
I'm just gonna continue with that black
shade and I'm using my fine crease brush
from my essence of beauty crease brush
duo that I've had for seems like ages
and they still work great just kind of
working in circular motions on the outer
corner and sort of building a bit of an
outer V here just I'm really working off
the outer corner of the eye and working
kind of a shape like that and then
taking a little bit more of these purple
and using that to be my crease shade in
the inner part here because these dark
shades are just very
cool I'm going to give a nice little
border around it that's a little more
natural-looking so I'm gonna go to my
walking on eggshells trio from
wet-and-wild go to the crease shade with
sort of a fluffy brush and blend this on
the outer edge of the dark stuff and
you're gonna see it just kind of become
in a sense a little more natural even
though this is clearly an unnatural look
it just kind of helps blend it towards
skin tone you know we're gonna come back
to some final steps there under the brow
in a second but first I'm going to take
my Urban Decay 24/7 liner in zero any
black liner will do really just making
an effort to get right kind of in with
the lashes and just go all the way
across the top and pulling it out just a
little bit there at the edge and then
continuing to line my lower lash line
with this keeping this a little bit of a
lighter line maybe smudge over that line
a little bit with your finger you know
you just got that nice depth next to
your lash line but for false lash
purposes and just to make everything be
extra intense I'm taking a liquid liner
this is my wet and wild mega liner in
black and this is just gonna be super
super close thin line next to my lash
line
nothing fancy with it just keep it
really close to the lashes and you're
done then we're gonna do some work
getting this all nice and smudgy and
smoky I'm gonna go to this shade again
with a pencil brush this time over that
outer part the idea is to get it looking
less like a pencil line there and more
like just a smoky effect and using the
same brush I'm going into the brown
Brown is what's making this whole thing
a little bit more blendable I'm going
under the lower lash line and somehow it
keeps it from getting too deep and dark
I just like this as sort of a blender
and we will play with some light which I
think really makes
look pop I'm gonna go to the lightest
shade in walking on eggshells use any
small brush or a small sponge tip that
you can really feel comfortable getting
in small places with and I'm gonna use
this to go right around the tear duct
and when I'm doing this on the lower
part I'm doing a little more than I
normally would so I'm kind of covering a
little bit more of an area right here
around the inside and then it looks kind
of cool when you take it up a little bit
right in here and it almost lightens
that that purplish blue to lay down some
of this lighter color right under my
eyebrow just really highlighting you
know where the arches and then just grab
any fluffy brush bare and this is just
gonna sort of ensure that that light
brown and the cream color are sort of
like as one up here next just curl the
lashes then I'm gonna apply some
covergirl LashBlast to the upper lashes
using Maybelline lash discovery with the
really tiny brush because we want to
create some nice fringe here on the
bottom as well so I like to wiggle it
right at the root of the lower lash and
then just barely kind of graze it
through having some issues with my
rollers your hummus I'm taking some of
my favorite lashes the ardell demi
whispies a little bit longer on the
outside and apply some glue to the lash
band pop those on and I'll join it with
the finished look in terms of the blush
it's kind of a subtle blush here this is
the covergirl cheekers blush in pretty
peach and my lips I'm using a trio of
projects here so I'm using the color
burst lipstick and petal so this is kind
of a light peachy colored lipstick there
it's got just a little bit of a pearly
glow to it i line my lips with Mac's
whirl lipliner it's kind of a deeper
neutral liner just to give myself a look
a little more sort of definition there
but it's not really that dark or
anything and then I topped it all off
with the peach petal Super Lustrous lip
gloss for a little bit of shine so I
hope you guys like this look thank you
so much for watching giving me your
feedback giving me your video requests I
really really appreciate it have a great
day and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
