video I was sporting a pretty smoky
olive I look and I have recreated that
even taking it up a notch drama wise in
a couple of ways but it's using this
Maybelline eye studio quad called smoky
cinnamon I really love these eye studio
quads for Maybelline because they just
have such great pigmentation and colors
and a lot of times I like you know the
way they've grouped the colors together
and I think that's really key in this
you don't have this exact quad I think
you can still put it together with maybe
some similar shades you might have in
your collection but this just kind of
makes it easy having it all in one to
show you in this tutorial also all the
brushes I'm using are from the sigma
essential collection so that was the
first kid i ever got and there's some
really great basic brushes and yeah the
whole look is drugstore so I hope you
like it first step I'm gonna take my
color tattoo in barely beige it's a
pretty like shimmery champagne color a
great like pearly eyeshadow base and as
you can see I just got a little bit on
my finger I'm gonna run it up just a
little bit on the inner part here and
we're taking this beautiful mossy green
olive colored cream shadow and I'm going
to apply that on the outer part of the
lid I find that the color tattoos are
kind of buildable so if you wanted to
you know make it a darker green just add
a little bit more and then I just kind
of blend up toward my crease a bit this
color tattoo is nice because it's dark
to the point that it makes a really nice
liner so I'm going to be using just a
little liner brush here and we're
actually going to take this under the
lower lash line just getting it in
really close we're moving on to the
shadows and we're gonna be doing kind of
a fade effect on the lid from light to
dark and I'm gonna start with this
pearly color right here just pick some
up on a typical eyeshadow brush you
might want to knock off some of the
excess there and then you can really
cover the full tear duct with a flat
eyeshadow brush like this just by kind
of blotting it right over that point
and then I'm gonna carry it up just a
bit here onto the lid then I'm gonna
clean off my brush and we're gonna go to
this shade right here it's a really kind
of a unique sort of yellowish green I
really like this we're going to put kind
of just over lapping the light shade
these shadows are just so intense and
they really remind me texture-wise at
the Lancome color design shadows it's
really intense and shimmery then we're
going to the darkest shade this gorgeous
olive it coordinates really nicely with
the color tattoo and I mean you could do
this look without the color tattoo
underneath I think it just helps the
staying power and it also makes these
intense shadows even more intense so
we're gonna begin blotting that green
overlap the lighter green and just kind
of bring this right to the outer corner
I just love looks that do this I love
seeing that nicely blended sort of
gradient effect across the lid and then
I'm flipping my brush around you can
just use your same flat brush to pull
that shade up through your crease will
blend that in a second but just to lay
down the color I'm just using this
angled brush don't have anything on it
just kind of wedging it with that angle
right in my crease and that will be you
know what will buff out that green shade
it's really important with shades like
green and blue to make sure you've got
them really nicely blended out and
there's another color in this kit that's
gonna help you do that cinnamon color
and this is kind of bringing it back to
you know okay this is the kind of tone
that might stem from the skin where I've
used the cinnamon just to show you on
the finished eye is right in here and
you see the kind of effect that that
makes it's very subtle but we're instead
of going from green to suddenly okay
skin or a light white highlight we've
got that little bit of a transitional
shade so I'm taking a big fluffy powder
brush little goes a long way kind of
stamp it into that coppery cinnamon
color
and then this is going to be the shadow
that goes on the border of the green in
our crease and go to that white pearly
shade that we started with in the inner
corner and I'm going to lightly dust
that right under the brow I'm gonna do a
little liner for liquid liner I'm
actually trying a new one today it's
from essence and it is the essence
liquid liner and it has kind of like a
little felt tip that's not a brush
that's just a little bitty short felt
tip and I'm just gonna take this right
across my upper lash line from the inner
corner to the outer corner thickening up
the line toward the outer edge I'm
taking my Maybelline master drama liner
and we're gonna do this right in our
water line here this is totally optional
if you didn't do this you would still
get you know of course that kind of
smoky look but this just adds just a
little more intensity to it connecting
it up to the liner there and just kind
of dotting that right there in between
the lashes on the outer part of my lower
lash line helps the waterline part look
a little less stark when then you get on
your actual physical lash line and do a
little bit of liner then taking just an
angled liner brush going into the all of
the deepest shade and we're gonna top
off what's going on here on the outer
part with some of that green and then
just carry it on in on our lower lash
line it's gonna make the go friend
looking kind of precise and stuff to see
how it's just a little more smoky there
underneath next I'm curling the lashes
and I'm using almas get up and grow
mascara you could end with you know the
mascara but I am going to apply some
falsies to this look to the lashes I'm
using are the red cherry
7:47 Elle's they're really full and
they're really long from left to right
so I'm going to trim a little bit off
right in here and then apply them to my
upper lash line applying some
lash glue from kiss to the band here it
has a nice little wand applicator you're
gonna wait 3540 seconds or so till that
gets tacky like to Center my finger on
the lash band and then Center that up
with the middle of my eye once you've
got that Center part on just kind of
attach the outer part of the lash and
then the inner part blue is drying I'm
gonna do my lower lashes you guys know
the mascara I love these there's the
Maybelline lash discovery because it
doesn't flake smudge or clung kind of
wiggle it towards the root and then just
lightly pull through and one more step I
think a little more mascara these are
really long feathery sort of lashes and
I don't want them to seem like loaded up
with mascara so I'm just taking a little
more of the get up and grow and you can
see I'm not even really pulling it
through the lashes I'm just wiggling it
sort of where my natural lashes I'll
give us the look of more thickness right
at the base but not a bunch of spidery
ends throughout
alright guys that wraps up the look
using some limited edition new stuff
from Maybelline I really like those
color tattoos I love how you know the
beige one is so versatile because it can
be a great like highlighting tool but
also the olive is nice because that can
double as an eyeliner so really cool
stuff there and of course the eye Studio
quad I think is great for just those
bright shimmering intense colors
elsewhere on the face I went kind of
neutral on the cheeks couple of cheek
products I would recommend are the
covergirl blush and Sierra Sands I use
this as a contour so this is what's
going on right here and I think it just
works really well with the whole look
we're kind of drawing together those
cinnamon tones in the eye and then as a
blush I used NYX blush and pinched and
this well looks kind of pink here it
really gives off kind of the golden a
peach vibe on the cheeks for lips I'm
using a couple new products I picked up
from NYX
it's the glam aqua luxe lipstick and the
shade is called elusive it's actually a
really highly shimmery peachy color and
I topped that off with the gloss in VIP
which is also pretty shimmery it works
well with the look even though it's
shimmery it's not like it's a super
bright colored shimmer so I think it
still kind of meshes with the whole fall
thing we've got going on here so thanks
so much to everybody who requested to
see this look it was fun to do if you're
having a great day and I will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
