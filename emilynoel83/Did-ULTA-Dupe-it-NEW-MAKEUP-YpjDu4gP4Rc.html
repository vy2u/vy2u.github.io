this video it's kind of coming as the
result of a lot of requests and a lot of
interest in the Ulta brand the store
brand makeup line the prices aren't dirt
cheap but they are definitely less than
some of the more high-end brands in the
store and overall I'd say it's more
along the lines of a drugstore price
range product and recently I saw they
come out with some new kind of
interesting products and each one of
these sort of tripped off a little
thought in my head I wonder if that's a
dupe or trying to be a dupe of a
different high-end product so I'm going
to be talking about their makeup
blending sponge duo today they've got a
sculpting like contour and highlight
stick trio they've got a strobing face
kit of like liquid illuminators and they
also have an eye contour palette that I
was kind of interested in so I'm going
to be talking about these and kind of
reviewing each one and talking about how
it compares to a different high-end
product first off super super excited
about this blending sponge duo like I
cannot contain my excitement for these
little guys these are so soft they are
so spongy I mean I have really kind of
gotten accustomed to trying something
that seems like it would be close to the
Beauty Blender and it ends up being hard
as a rock or it doesn't really absorb
water when you put it under the sink
well these I would say are actually even
softer than my original Beauty Blender
sponge so you get a 2 pack it's $10 one
thing I cannot comment on because this
is fairly new to me is just the
longevity of the product how well it's
going to clean up time after time after
time so that will be something I'll need
to update you guys on but first off I
will show you this side-by-side with a
Beauty Blender when they are dry you can
see that the Beauty Blender is a little
bit less chubby the Ulta sponge is a
little bit more full at the base or the
butt end as I like to call it oftentimes
the way I like to use these blender
sponges is wet so you take them under
the sink you kind of squeeze it a few
times really get it saturated with water
and then you really want to wring it out
so you don't feel like you're actually
sponging water all over your face but it
can't help the blend ability of
different products so you look at both
of these side-by-side
I in there fully you know saturated mode
and both of them get quite a bit bigger
I would say the Ulta one is a little bit
fuller at the bottom and it doesn't come
to as much of a point toward the top but
just as far as the feel of them you know
the Beautyblender is very soft and
spongy and this feels just the texture
the material feels maybe even a little
bit softer than that or Foundation I
think they both do an equally good job
so I used my Maybelline Dream velvet
it's a matte foundation and I think it
really benefits from a blender type
sponge to apply it and so on my right
side of my face I use the Beauty Blender
to get that all blended out and then I
just wanted to show you what it would be
like with the other sponge the Ulta
brand sponge on the left side of my face
and I do feel like I got a really
similar result again there's a lot of
softness with this Ulta sponge it's not
maybe quite as nimble as the Beauty
Blender for getting around the small
areas I also applied my Fionna styles
peach corrector under each eye and the
Beauty Blender has a little bit easier
time getting around that area still I
think it's a little big for the under
eye I prefer you know their down size
like the micro mini or even the new one
for blush that's a little bit smaller
than this all around I think it gets
around the eye area much more easily but
then over on the left eye with the Ulta
sponge you really kind of have to pinch
it or form it a little bit if you want
to get right there on the side of your
nose otherwise for large areas on the
skin for the larger planes of your face
that sponge really does fine did Ulta
dupit I don't think it's an exact Beauty
Blender dupe because it's just not the
exact same size in shape but it's a
really nice quality sponge and getting
two for $10 I think you'll be very happy
with the softness of these sponges I
also find this to be a little softer
than my Real Techniques sponge the kind
of nice thing about that sponge for me
is I really like that flat edge that it
has but I do think this is a really good
buy and if you're in the market for
something that's a little smaller than
this and you want to save Ulta has
something called the super blender and
this is the mini size of that but it's
actually called the small super blender
and it's $4.99 for two and this is
actually a surprisingly soft sponge and
it's just a little more tar
it's kind of nice for the areas around
the eye I also noticed Ulta came out
with this sculpting trio so it's three
different like highlight and contour
sticks it's $15 one says contour one
says warmth and one says highlight
there's no shimmer in any of these so
they're just nice creamy shades and I
don't have an exact trio on my hands
from a high-end brand that matches up to
this but I do have this thing from Tarte
called the sculptor so it is you know
their take on a stick contour product
and while the tone of this one from
Tarte can look a little bit more like a
bronzer to me and less like you know a
cool contour shade would be I do really
like the texture I think it's easy to
blend it's got a little element of
Sheerness to it that I think kind of
helps the product and gives you a nice
ease of use with it so I went ahead and
applied the Tarte one on the right side
of my face I just applied a little bit
in the hollow of my cheek and also
around the hairline those are the two
main areas where I would do any sort of
contouring and I blended it out with one
of my blender sponges and then I used
the let's see the contour stick from the
Ulta kit and I use that on the opposite
side of my face I can instantly tell
that there's a drier consistency with
these while they do seem to be a little
bit more full color the texture is a bit
thicker and drier so it's going to take
a little more effort to blend this out
on the skin and that's something I don't
really want to have to work too hard at
especially when I'm going over a
foundation I don't want to mess with
that foundation too much honestly I'm
not that cracked up about the stick
format of a contour product to begin
with I think it's easier to have an ice
cream compact where you can dip into
that with a brush get a nice kind of
wide sweep of color on the skin and
it'll be easily blended in if it's a
good formula so I think my mascara
compact is great for that I think my ELF
cream contour compact is nice for that
I'm not saying these sticks are unusable
but they're just not you know my
preferred format and I went ahead with
the highlight stick and I didn't have
like a dupe alternative to this so I
just used it on both sides so you can
see how it goes on and tone wise I think
it's great for brightening and I do like
the fact that it doesn't have shimmer
but again it's a
little bit stiff on the skin a little
hard to blend out my experience with
products if it looks dry right after
application it's only going to go
downhill from there for the rest of the
day in terms of looking dry not awful by
any means but not my top pick for cream
contouring now when I saw that there's a
strobing face kit you've got these three
little pumps actually they're pretty
good sized pump out products here it
made me think of my Becca shimmering
skin perfecter liquids and here you're
getting actually half of a fluid ounce
in each one of these so I think that's a
pretty good amount one is labeled bronze
one is rose gold and one is shimmering
pearl and when it comes right down to it
I think only one of these is a dupe
candidate and that is the shimmering
pearl at a glance on the website I
thought this kind of rosy color might be
close to Becca shimmering skin perfecter
and opal but this is just much more of a
blush and this is very very deep so well
this is called a strobing face kit I
don't think any of these are all that
shimmery I think it's a very subtle glow
and to me they each have a really
distinct purpose so before we get to my
Becca comparison I will start with the
bronze II type shade this has a little
bit of a golden Esha myrrh in it it's
not a lot I had to look pretty closely
to even detect it but I kind of liked
applying this around the perimeter of my
face I used one of my ELF stipple
brushes and I kind of went under the
cheekbone and around the hairline and I
thought it gave a really pretty look
actually it was easy to blend in you
have enough time to work with it and
blend it out and then once it does get
totally blended it doesn't remain with
any sort of weird texture on the skin
and then I used the rose gold shade as
my blush and this is really pretty I
love this shade I like that it's not -
glowy it's actually rather pigmented and
I just kind of dab that on the apples of
the cheeks I think it gives a really
fresh look you don't even need to be too
careful with this product it's not one
of those like for example elf has those
liquid HD blushes that are just you know
you only need the tiniest bit with this
you know you can go a little more free
with it and it's not going to look
outrageous on your cheeks now I was
really interested to see if this
shimmering pearl was like my Becca
ringg skin perfector in Pearl and I'm
just holding the small size here because
I have it from that trio that I got a
while back and they are very very
similar because these are subtle
highlights this one you know it's not
like it's loaded down with shimmer or
flexib litter and this isn't either it's
really to me a look of undetectable
highlighting like you look like there's
a really nice glow on the skin but it's
not necessarily as the result of product
that was placed there you know so I love
that about this product and I was really
happy to see that I got the same effect
from the Ulta one and I think it's
important to know that these are subtle
highlighting products this kid is called
strobing and to me when I think strobing
I think an intensely highlighted look
these are the most subtle glow products
really in these different liquid pumps
that they've put out I've talked about
this before but if you're just looking
for one product that's similar to the
Becca pearl and you don't want to have
to buy this full strobing face kit you
might just get this little one dollar
thing from ELF it's the shimmering
facial lip the shade is called spot
light very very similar effect to the
Becca now the last thing I want to talk
about it's called an eye contour kit so
the buzzers rang in my head as Kat Von D
calls hers the eye contour kit you know
the shade + light eye contour palette
and I guys say the only thing that puts
this palette in the dupe conversation is
just the title because once I got my
hands on it I ordered this online I
looked at the shades and I'm like okay
this is a matte and shimmer palette this
is just it's not going to be any sort of
dupe of the kat von d palette but I
thought I'll go ahead and talk about it
in this video give you my thoughts on it
if you were curious about it it's a 6
color palette you've got 3 matte Browns
in here one says deepen one says
dramatize one says shape and then you've
got several shimmery shades with one
labeled highlight one labeled
illuminates very brightening frosty type
shade and then this one's called accent
it's kind of like a rose gold and the
quality of the shadows is decent I got a
nice little look out of it so I'll show
you what I did I applied a primer first
and then I use the shape color in the
crease just to get a little softness
going there you then I use this
warm Brown cold dramatized in the outer
corner just to build that up a bit more
I use the highlight shade under the brow
and just kind of blend that all out and
then I used accent which is this rose
gold right on top of the lid I was
noticing quite a bit of powder eNOS with
this shade but it does give a pretty
look to the lids and then I used deepen
which is the darkest matte Brown on the
outer corner with a small flat brush I
really thought this should have packed
on a little bit more color I realized I
was overlapping something lighter but I
thought this needed a little more
pigment and I also smudged that on the
lower lash line as well and just finish
the look with a little bit of black
liquid liner and some false lashes and
that was that so it ends up being a very
natural workable look the texture of the
shadows is pretty powdery you're going
to notice them kicking up quite a bit of
powder when you initially tap in tapping
off the excess is a must with all of
these shades my overall feeling on this
is it's an OK palette but it's
definitely not one where oh you got to
run out and get it it's so different if
you've got a lot of eyeshadows or
eyeshadow palettes you've probably very
likely got these shades already and the
thing that really makes me feel ho-hum
about this is the packaging I feel like
they tried okay they tried to give us
something where you've got this you know
overlay here of an eye and it's got the
different shades labeled one two three
four fives you can kind of see where the
placement should go on the back there's
a little card you can pull out for tips
a more detailed description of what to
do so I think they're trying to make
this kind of an educational palette but
here's the deal this barely magnetizes
shut like the magnet is so weak it just
drops open and then you've just got this
very flimsy plastic window there that
you know you could totally press through
it and touch the actual eyeshadows all
that being said I think $15 for this is
actually asking a little too much I
think there are loads of other things on
the market that can give you this kind
of a look so I hope you guys enjoyed
this little experiment using the Ulta
brand products and I think I definitely
came out with a couple of things I'm
going to really like using including
with strobing face kit I thought these
were really fun and also the blending
sponge duo 2 for $10 a really nice
quality sponge
I think I'll continue using my
regular Beautyblender and my Real
Techniques sponge but it's nice to have
yet another kind of sponge that's
workable in the mix so when something
else is dirty you can kind of rotate
another one in and I will report back on
how these clean up hopefully we don't
have any unexpected things happen there
but thanks again guys hope you're having
a great day and I will see you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
