like like like $2.99 can I get a
hallelujah
for $1 apiece 1 1 $1 a piece just be $1
can I get a hallelujah Wow right around
$2 to to $2 maybe less hey guys I am
super excited to bring you an update on
a video from way back in 2008 for the
past couple of years people have been
asking me to update this and it's
finally here it is the top 10 dirt cheap
products worth trying and I'm also going
to be doing the top 10 high-end products
worth trying that'll be kind of the part
two to this one what kind of brought
this video back to my mind was I did the
top 10 under 10 tag and then some people
said hey why don't you do your favorite
products under $5 and then I thought my
bet I can do you one better and in this
video everything's under $3 under $3
some is real close to $3 like $2.99 but
I mean under $3 there are some brand new
finds in this video there are some old
favor you guys know I am trying new
products constantly so if something goes
in this video that you've heard about
before
chances are it's beat out some other
things along the way you know what I'm
saying so top 10 dirt cheap products
worth trying real favorite things my
first thing is something kind of new I'm
a little bit in shock about this this
was a find at Fred's super dollar I
think it is Fred's dollar store it's a
chain dollar store basically and I'd
never seen this brand before it's called
ayane
cosmetics IO n I and this is the blush
this gorgeous kind of reddish orange
blush it looks more orange in person and
the shade is ecstasy this is a matte
blush this is not tested on animals this
is made in the USA a little research and
found that this brand is put out by the
same manufacturer of la splash cosmetics
that's not la color but la splash that's
sometimes sold in Ulta brand recently
launched in like 2012 so it's not in a
lot of places yet but the pigmentation
of this blush is intense I love it I'm
actually wearing it today and I
think you can see a little bit more of
that peachy orange e tone but man I love
this I think it's gorgeous and I so want
to go back and try some more things the
only other things I bought at the time
because I'm just really unfamiliar with
the brand I bought a couple pairs of
eyelashes which I haven't tried yet but
man this blush really spoke to me when I
saw it in the store believe it was right
around $2 maybe less and I'm so glad I
picked it out now an old face favorite
my NYC smooth skin bronzer in sunny this
might be the third or fourth of these
that I've had I mean I love this bronzer
this is a great totally matte bronzer
this was in my original video back in
2008 and to this day I continue to
recommend this is a great bronzer for
people with fair skin I don't feel like
it gives off too much color I am wearing
it today and it's just kind of something
to warm up my skin tone I've been
sunless tanning some so it kind of gets
my face more in line with my body but
Jordana lip liners oh my gosh love these
so much I know I probably recently
talked about these but these are
probably some of my most used lip liners
for a great pink pink that works with
like a whole range of pink lipsticks or
glosses baby berry you want that one for
your pink lip liner a great neutral one
which I'm wearing with the look I have
on today is tawny perfect for your nude
lips all the way to a little bit deeper
neutral lip and then another one that I
love so much is plush plums so if you
wear a lot of plum and berry lip colors
that's a great option for you too these
are like a buck ninety-nine or two for
three dollars I find them at Walgreens
they are so smooth and creamy if you've
not yet tried these there's a good range
of colors too so if you're looking for
just that right lip liner shade I think
you'll find it with these so excited
about this new lip product and this was
something I kind of put in my collection
and rediscovered recently and it's from
NYC it's a lipstick no it's not the
sheer red that I love I still love that
one but this one I think I might like a
little bit more it's the city duet
two-in-one lip color okay so there are
two shades in one stick Kapow
this is called the red hots so one shade
is a really true red if you're familiar
with NYC sheer red this is
a little bit more of a true red than
that that one's just a hair deeper which
I do think makes it fairly wearable but
this one just has a little more
brightness to it it's beautiful
and on the other side you have kind of a
Coralie color why is it cool to have two
shades in one well I think it's fun
because you can like brighten up the
center of your lower lip with this
lighter shade and then put the red
elsewhere you could just do like the
ombre lip trend and make it just kind of
light in the center and darker around
the outsides let me swatch it for you
here there's your two colors really rich
and creamy and pigmented and they really
are fun to wear together or look at my
other lip favorite recently which if you
haven't heard me talk about this yet you
need to catch up on my old videos and
these are the elf lip balm tints these
are two dollars each of the shades in
berry and nude I actually mixed the two
for this lip today mostly the nude but I
added in a little bit of the berry but
basically these remind me of the L'Oreal
hip jelly balms the color on these is
pretty impressive for what they are you
know like you think they just be a
little pot of some kind of translucent
transparent lip gloss but they give off
color and they have a nice kind of
vanilla sugary sent a nice little bit of
flavor to them as well so there's nude
and there's the rest Lee moisturizing
extremely comfortable on the lips I
would so recommend those swatch cleanup
I know I talked about wet and wild eyes
shadows all the time but the truth is
they actually come in under my $3 price
limit for this video so I had to give a
shout-out to my trios that I love got
walking on eggshells
we've got knock on wood this is a really
fun one too if you haven't checked that
out beautiful burgundy in that kit
silent treatment all time favorite great
smokey eye also don't steal my thunder
if you like the greys the silvers and
that kind of a smoky eyes so those are
great something I haven't talked about
as much from the wet and wild line and
these are even cheaper these are a buck
99 apiece and they are the singles have
you checked out the singles some of
these I think have like cult followings
like the Brule
and this is a great matte creamy shade
remember I talked about matte creamy
colors in my recent best in beauty video
I've mentioned Milani french vanilla
this is a lot like Milani french vanilla
loving using these matte creamy colors
as the highlight they make the blend of
your highlight and your kind of
transition or crease shade so flawless
when you use a matte shade there so I
love brulee lots of people like their
taupe shades
here's Nettie and this is a gorgeous
color great kind of for one shadow look
because concentrated it really picks up
the light that could go in your crease
as well and then one more pretty shade
here is penny and this kind of makes me
think rose gold but it is very peachy
very golden a gorgeous gorgeous shade
and again those are super inexpensive
and how nice would these be like
depotted into a Z palette another thing
I am really impressed with eyeshadow
wise are the elf custom compacts they're
the little white compacts that say
elements on them these are a dollar and
then you can fill them with your choice
of one dollar i shadow paint I realized
that total this would have cost five
bucks but really I'm thinking about the
fact that you could get any shadow you
want it would just be one dollar you
wouldn't have to put it in here you
could add it to your Z palette as well
but I've made a couple of these palettes
with some some shades that I really
enjoy I've got more of a neutral one
here
moonstone fantastic kind of greyish
taupe color mentioning these not just
because they're cheap and I did not just
throw things into this video just
because oh hey that's a cheap thing I'll
talk about that but I'm mentioning these
because they are really high quality for
what you have to spend there's pink ice
I love that shade and there's a gorgeous
teal look at that barely touched it love
these a red cherry number forty-three
false lashes can I get a hallelujah
these are my favorite false eyelashes
and they are two dollars and fifty cents
to 50 for these puppies and I love them
love them to pieces
number 43 I'm also wearing a pair today
I love the length I love the thickness
they're just perfect they're lightweight
on the eyes just the right shape and
length to go across my leg and you can
find these online in a lot of different
places some of you might even find them
in stores but I know the makeup geek
site sells these I think love eyelashes
dot-com recently sold out of these but
if you google you will find a lot of
retailers that have these so my next
couple of things are brushes they are $1
apiece so this will be my number 9 and
my number 10 of this list and I think if
you have these brushes plus like a
fluffier crease brush you can come out
with pretty much any eye look you really
want to do I mean it's just that simple
one is the elf professional eye shadow
brush had this for years I have cleaned
it so many times this is still an
amazing brush that I spent a dollar on
and this is your pack on brush you're
going to pack it on your lid can maybe
pull it up into the crease a little bit
but great for just that concentrated
application of shadow this works well
with also like loose pigments anything
you really want to press on pack on
build up color with that's great the
other one that I love so much and it's
more of a recent relatively recent
discovery is the eye crease brush also a
dollar this is a very small type crease
brush to show you in comparison to my
eye this is great for getting shadow
exactly where you want it to go I used
it for my like outer corner color I've
got a plum in there and it was just
perfect for precisely getting that
shadow where I want it so you apply it
and then you can buff it out with a
bigger brush but if you feel like your
eye looks are looking muddy or looking
like shadows are just you know
constantly overlapping more than you
want but you knew one or more targeted
application get a brush like this get
your shadow in there then blend it out
this is awesome alright guys that's it
that's my top 10 dirt cheap products
worth trying
I really rounded up some things that I
feel passionately about that I use all
the time and hey they're all under $3
which is really exciting so thank you so
much for taking time to watch and also
keep an eye out for my top ten high-end
products worth
I'll be coming soon see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
