for this video I just kind of ran across
something that I've been doing recently
with my brushes that has proven to be
very convenient and useful for me and so
I just thought hey maybe the people
tuning in to my channel might find this
useful as well and basically what it is
is on course brush cleaner cleanser and
I have made this I've used the recipe
it's very affordable and easy to make
and I actually have his video showing
exactly how to do this I have that under
my favorite so if you're on my channel
and you just look at my favorites it's
in there but he has a great brush
cleaner recipe I guess you would say and
I went ahead and put some of this in a
little spray bottle so i have this spray
and i know like when you clean your
brushes for example just show you this
little guy that i have here um you might
think well okay you have this in a spray
you just spray it on the end of the
brush but then you're getting it down in
here on to the ferrule probably because
the spray is not that easy to control
and you don't really want to do that
because you can kind of loosen the
bristles and how they are attached in
there and you can end up actually
loosening that whole little piece of
your brush so you want to try not to
submerge or really I mean you definitely
don't want to submerge your the ferrule
this part of your brush but at the same
time I don't think just to be safe I
don't want to get it really wet in
through spray either so what you can do
if you are in between brush uses if save
use a really bright colored you want to
clean it off real quick or you know say
you deep clean your brushes once every
few weeks and you want to still keep
them nice and fresh in between the times
that you use them you can basically make
your own brush wipes like for example I
have these brushed wipes from Sephora
okay I spent I don't know more money
than I probably should have
on on those and they're very convenient
but you can with this brush cleaner
spray and a tissue have your own little
brush white and like I said this is this
on course brush cleaner is so easy to
make and all you do is I mean you've got
your tissue I would just hold it out and
then just give you give it like one two
three sprays or something you can see
that it's kind of soaked in and then
just just take one of your brushes and
just kind of rub it back and forth on
the tissue and I mean you've basically
got you get the bulk of the color out of
there and if you are doing this you know
every day maybe after use brushes every
couple days then you're not going to
have a lot of buildup of product on your
brushes but you can see how the product
just comes right off on it and it's got
a fresh smell I mean you can see when
you stroke the brush then on there you
can see that okay a lot of it's gotten
off it hasn't soaked your brush so if
you wanted to go back and use that brush
even right away I mean just let it dry
dry out a little bit and you're good to
go so I thought it's kind of like making
your own brush wipes and like I said
this is not a substitute for deep
cleaning your brushes actually you know
filling a little tub of with this with
your brush cleaner and actually swishing
your whole brush around in it and then
shaping it and letting it sit out
overnight and dry I mean that's like a
or also on taking your brush under some
water and we're running you know running
the bristles of it under water that's
another good way to deep clean your
brushes that were a solution like this
but for a quick way I mean just totally
just put it in a spray bottle spritzes
on your Kleenex and then just swipe it
back and forth and you've got a great
way to just if you instantly want to get
color off of a brush or um just you know
keep it nice and sanitary between uses I
think it's just a great great way to go
about it so I hope
and if you guys hadn't already thought
about it which I'm sure some of you
probably have but I just wanted to go
ahead and tell you what I've been doing
because it's working really well for me
so thank you guys so much for watching I
appreciate um I appreciate your time all
the time that you guys invest with
watching my videos and the wonderful
comments you leave it just totally
brightens my day I mean I enjoy this so
much and i also am so thrilled with the
response that you guys have been giving
to the question of the week i am just
stunned by the amount of response i've
been getting on that I mean you guys are
so thoughtful it's just it's so
enjoyable to see what you're saying and
at the same time I know that as you

helping someone else you know it like
with the most recent question I put on
um was about like if you can you only
use one makeup brand what would it be
and you guys have put some really
insightful answers on there and it's not
