me this video is going to be kind of a
quick one and it is on the new
maybelline baby skin instant cheek flush
have you guys seen this I actually saw
this on in the aisles of Target but I
ended up ordering mine off of Ulta as
soon as I saw it I thought oh that's
something I want to test out and I have
it in the shade pinking of you and that
was the only shade available at the time
I was on Ulta site it says on here
foolproof shear blush and on the back it
says fresh tinted creamy gel formula
easily smoothes on for a hint of color
that looks natural not overdone and then
it shows in the diagram the product is
being applied directly to the cheeks so
this is what you have here a little
twist off end and you know the effect of
like an EOS lip balm practically but
then on the one end you've got like kind
of a place to hold on and this is all
just solid plastic there it's very dewy
and glossy like as I get some on my
finger and you see it catching the light
you can definitely tell that there is a
lot of moisture in this product and once
you get that on the cheeks it's going to
be a very glowy effect not for the fact
that it's highly highly shimmery but
just because you know there is so much
like moisture content to it but I would
describe this pinking of you color as
kind of a sheer warm pink it really is
not going to be a fully opaque like a
really dramatic looking blush color on
the skin and I've got this on my cheeks
today with no highlight on and you can
still really see how that's catching the
light this has been on my cheeks by now
probably a half hour and it still feels
just as tacky as it did when I first
blended this in so on each side of my
face I actually used two different
application methods I did on this side
just applying it straight to the cheek
because that's what they say to do and
to me just the act of raking this across
my cheek I felt was basically picking up
all the other product underneath and
once I started just lightly blending it
in with my finger I could really see all
my freckles coming through again not
that I really mind the freckles but
that's just kind of evidence of the fact
that the powder the foundation that was
underneath this just totally thinned out
and this creamy kind of oily feeling
product really just sunk right through
it you know what I mean and just to look
at myself with that product on my cheeks
I don't hate the look but if it's going
to have that kind of feel to the skin if
I would happen to touch it it's going to
feel tacky I do think that affects
staying power and I don't like the
thought that it changed the coverage
level of my other makeup so I brought in
my trusty elf small stipple brush for
the other side I used the brush to pick
up the product and then put it on my
cheeks and I do feel like I had a little
bit more control with the application I
don't think as much product got on my
cheeks at one time and I was able to
build it up a bit more slowly and
therefore I don't feel like I really
affected the lower levels of my makeup
as much I was surprised afterward
feeling each side of my face they both
felt equally tacky so if that's kind of
an annoying thing to you of feeling your
face and thinking you know okay it
doesn't feel like one nice smooth even
consistent texture all over this might
be kind of annoying to you and as far as
staying power you know I'll be trying to
check it kind of throughout the day and
I'll know that I can feel it there on my
skin I'll know that the top of my cheek
feels different from like down here my
forehead let's say because those areas
you know they're finished layer of
makeup is basically powder and by day's
end with this product I don't feel like
I have any visible blush still on my
skin but oddly enough for whatever
reason I still feel like I'm feeling the
texture of it on my face and honestly I
don't mind the soft look of it it's just
the texture for me that I think makes it
kind of hard to wear not so long wearing
if a really dewy look and texture is
what you're after this might be
something you want to look into but for
me I think the better cream blushes on
the market I love the Maybelline master
glaze Stix
these are awesome they're so easy to
blend in they're a little bit more like
that cream to powder texture I mean I
think they're really nicely pigmented
but then they're very easy to shear out
and I had talked about these Physicians
Formula One's which are met there's like
a peach one and this pinky one they
actually smell really good they're
really natural-looking but they're very
easy to blend into the skin and I've
also been a longtime fan of the
Maybelline Dream bouncy blushes this is
not so much that cream to powder feel
but it's just very easy to pick up with
this brush and get the sheer application
and a nice blend but it doesn't seem to
leave behind too much of a weird texture
thing on my skin so hopefully that gives
you a little insight on this new
Maybelline Baby skin cream blush stay
tuned because I will have a video coming
up on a lot of other new products from
the drugstore and kind of a lot of
reviews in one so stay tuned for that
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
