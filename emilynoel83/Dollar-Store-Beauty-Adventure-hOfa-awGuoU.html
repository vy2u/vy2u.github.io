different kind of video I am actually
going to be hitting the road to my local
dollar general store and I'm going to be
trying out some of the different generic
or not necessarily name-brand items that
are there to see just how well they work
I will be putting them to the test in
this video letting you know what I think
and you can tell me what store brand
items you recommend alright so napping
and napping alright so we're here in the
local Dollar General Store and I was
able to pick up some things so that some
things I needed some things I was just
curious about but I was surprised when I
started looking just how many like
Dollar General brand products that were
like right beside a name-brand item like
I knew there were some of that but when
you start looking for it there's a whole
lot so like I got some poor strips
that's coffee creamer unrelated item
there
I know Vaseline makes some cocoa butter
lotion I've been wanting to try you know
I've got the gel oil so I wanted to try
the lotion so I got this for a dollar
instead of like two or three dollars so
the Dollar General false eyelashes I've
got some nail polish remover we'll take
a closer look at this stuff when I get
home and I will be trying it out
thing I'm going to test out are the
Dollar General body brand makeup remover
tissues you get 30 in a pack they say
deep cleans and unclogs pores and
one-step moisturizes leaving skin smooth
and soft and it says compared to ponds
and so you'll find on many of these
products I got they do have that
comparable brand name item written right
on the packaging says gently stroked
issues over eyelids lashes face and lips
using both sides of the tissue to lift
away makeup all right this is about how
big it is so let's see how this does
let's I mean it's doing pretty good so
far I recently tried some Garnier brand
wipes and I found that they weren't very
they didn't feel like they had a lot of
moisture in these almost feel a little
more moist than those did I'm not
noticing that it's irritating my eyes
it's just kind of messy I feel like I
have to go over and over it again this
isn't probably my preferred method for
getting rid of my makeup but I do think
that it's getting rid of my makeup
better than the Garnier ones did so I
would give these probably about a
b-minus well I take back that be - grade
because I washed my face with an L a
daily facials cloth to get off the
residue and there is a lot more residue
than I thought even a lot of face makeup
on there still and of course you know if
you have to use one product and then use
a different product on top of it it's
not really saving any money so I'm going
to change my grade to addy on those
cleansing cloths now while I was in the
shower I tried the deeply moisturizing
body wash and this it says compared to
dove deep moisture nourishing body wash
this I really liked it's really creamy
it has a nice scent that's kind of like
very lightly kind of sweet and fruity
just but it's not overbearing it's not a
gel it's actually creamy like sometimes
gel body washes can leave your skin
feeling like squeaky clean you know it
like just a little too
and just kind of stripped of moisture
and this I feel like my I haven't put
any lotion on but my skin actually feels
salt would give this an a because I
enjoyed the scent I liked the way it
felt going on I feel totally clean but
not overly dry so definitely recommend
the deep moisturizing body wash now
we're going to try the DG body deep
cleansing poor strips so these would be
comparable to the Biore Pore strips it
removes blackheads unclogs pores that's
what the claim is anyway so basically
what I'm going to do is wet my nose put
one of these strips on and then we'll
peel it off and see what we get rid of
wait a little while see how this thing
turns out I like how the little packet
actually says nose cleansing strips it's
kind of funny but and therefore you know
so whatever um then the other thing I
picked up while we're waiting on this
I'll try it out it's the cocoa butter
lotion it says compared to Vaseline
cocoa butter deep conditioning lotion
and if you watch my videos regularly
chances are you heard me talk about the
Vaseline on the vitalizing gel oil which
I really liked but I've been wanting to
try just the regular lotion as well the
cocoa butter lotion so this says deep
skin conditioning and rich with cocoa
butter and vitamin E it does have that
classic cocoa butter smell you would
expect
I feel like it is absorbed in it leaves
me still with kind of a moisturized feel
sometimes lotions just go chunk in and
they don't feel like a whole lot you
know as you sit around and as they stay
on your skin but this feels pretty good
with the good scent and with you know
the moisturize feel that it gives me I
can't really dock this any points I
would give this an a I think this is
probably very similar to what you're
going to get from Vaseline the smell was
really the only sticking point you know
if this didn't smell right on target we
know what cocoa butters would smell like
so um I was happy with that all right
I've been putting this off because I
don't like removing bore strips I mean I
like finding out what the poor strip has
done but these are not always the most
pleasant thing to take off so basically
what happens is you put these on and
they do get kind of like a mask like
feel they harden a little bit so you
kind of just want to carefully like I
sort of loosen the edges up off this is
not gonna be pleasant
okay oh not fun I don't think you want
to see in high definition what this
thing has left behind actually it's not
a whole lot could be that maybe my skin
is in a little better condition than it
has been before I have been doing some
masks lately I feel like I would give
this maybe a b-minus I think it you know
did a decent job it didn't take up a
whole the same kind of feel as portraits
I've had in the past real quickly just
another dollar general item that I
really do like and I give this an a I
had this in my last shopping list ideas
but this is the revive eye serum and
this is indeed supposed to be a dupe for
olay regenerist eye serum and so I've
been using this actually before I do my
makeup I will kind of just put this
under here to get that area hydrated and
more hydrated this area is the less fine
lines and wrinkles start showing up
under your makeup and that sort of thing
another thing I've tried that I picked
up again is the Select lash so this
isn't DG brand but I've only seen these
at Dollar General cost I believe a
dollar 25 and they had a couple styles
he's an S 42 and as you can see get a
close look at this is the s 47 both of
these are actually very similar to a
couple of mix brand eyelashes that I've
tried only complaint I guess would be
that I wish these did come in a wider
variety of styles so for that reason
I'll give these a a - to really compete
with some of the other brands they do
need to get some more styles but I think
dollar store wise I'm really impressed
with that it definitely can find some
decent generic items at the store I mean
you look at the price usually they're
right beside the name-brand item and I
mean it's amazing what you can save and
when things like lotion or they had a
bunch of shampoo as well it's like why
not you know just try it out and see
what happens so thanks a lot for
watching have a great day and I'll see
you soon
