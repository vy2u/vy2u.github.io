showing you how to do a smoky eye but
also how to incorporate some pink into
that look I've done different pink looks
but I don't know if I've gone through a
specific step-by-step video tutorial of
how to get a smoky effect while also
using pink it's super easy it's using a
lot of the same concepts I teach in a
lot of these videos so I hope you'll
stick around and see how it step one was
to get a primer on there so I went ahead
and did that put on my Too Faced shadow
insurance and then to get myself some
additional staying power I'm gonna dot
on my Mac rubenesque Paint Pot and I'm
just gonna put that all over the lid and
up into my crease just a little bit
there just a very light layer it's
surprising what a small amount of that
can actually do to help out your staying
power and then I'm gonna grab my Coastal
Scents 42 double stack matte palette and
we're gonna be using this pink shade
right here and that's just gonna be I
mean usually I will do the opposite and
use like say a matte or you know less
sparkle a black shade and use the
shimmer for the color and this look I'm
going to do a little bit opposite of
that I'm going to use the matte shade
for my light colorful color so I'm gonna
pack that on my ELF eyeshadow brush and
basically just pack it all over my lid
here and this is just like a bubblegum
pink shade and it's packing it on and I
also want to make sure this gets up into
the crease as well so I can do some
blending and overlapping and that kind
of thing so if you just take that shelf
shadow brush turn it more so it's
pointing in at your eye it can get up in
your crease and blend outward just a
little bit and then after that as you
can see we've got kind of this halo of
smoky shade and for that I'm gonna use
kind of one of my new favorite black
shadows it's the glam Couture pressed
shadow in night in Vegas it looks
insanely sparkly there but as you can
see a lot of that sparkle doesn't come
off too major so it can be a really
really wear
shei so grabbing my Sonia Kashuk medium
shadow brush it's like a flat shader
brush I'm just gonna pack some on the
tip of that brush be careful because
this a little bit of this will go a long
way and basically I'm gonna overlap that
last little thing we did with our shadow
brush where we kind of pointed it in at
our eye and blend it up go right over
the top of that with this night in Vegas
shade and just blend around just from
your crease outward here so you can see
we're starting to develop sort of an
outer V there just a little bit but
while you're blending and really
concentrating on blending it out here
you also want to blend it down just a
bit into that pink shape so make sure
while you're doing the upward motion
you're also going doing a bit of a
downward motion - okay there we go so
next we want to now we've kind of gotten
that wash of color we want to define
that outer V just a little bit more for
that I'm taking my essence of beauty
fine crease brush dipping that into the
night in Vegas shade and basically
concentrating it more most on the outer
corner and kind of going out from the
corner of my eye up to a point you
decide where that point is on you for me
it's about that far up
just a matter of how dramatic you want
to make it we all have a different
amount of space between our eye and our
eyebrow if you're like me and you kind
of have a lot of space there you may
want to do what I'm doing and make it a
little more pronounced with your outer V
but totally it's all about what you're
comfortable with and what you feel looks
best on you and just go in a little bit
but mainly get that really dark there in
the outer corner alrighty now I'm gonna
go for a pink shimmery set of shades
that I have this is the Milani
glimmer stripes in Bury glimmer I used
this in my multi-purpose pink tutorial
but I'm gonna take basically that shade
there at the see that brightest shade
they're just gonna grab some on my
Sephora rounded crease brush and use
that to sort of just blend out the edges
of that black shade and give it sort of
a pinky glow as it fades out so we're
just using a really light touch here
getting that all over and then feel free
to take that white shade or any white
shade you might have and use that to
just kind of brighten up all over the
area right up to your eyebrow okay guys
next comes our eyeliner gonna be using
my Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black and the technique you've
seen me use dozens of times now just
starting in the inner corner and keeping
it very close to my lash line and going
all the way out to the end so once
you've got that basic line there then
we're gonna kind of play with it a
little bit let the corner wing it out
slightly or thicken it at the end
just like that just making it sort of a
thicker line and you can see it's kind
of getting right into remember how we
got it really dark here in the corner
thickening it right to that point we'll
make it look even more natural
kind of hard to think of darkening and
thickening is being natural but it makes
more sense then we're gonna take our
color state black liner pencil and just
starting at the outer corner I always
have trouble staying in the shot when I
do lower liner I do not know what my
problem is blending it in and keeping it
right basically on the lash line and
and there we go alright guys next step
you're gonna take your eyelash curler
and curl your lashes I generally hold it
there for like 15 seconds I'm gonna use
a new mascara that I'm gonna be
reviewing soon as the Revlon double
twist mascara it's in this really stocky
little fat tube and it's a mix of rubber
bristles and regular bristles so it
really thickens your lashes up fast um
show you how it goes on here
you can see it really kind of thickens
them up quickly then on the bottom
lashline I'm going to use my Too Faced
lash injection simply because I'm not
sure yet how this does smudge wise and I
really want to put something I can trust
for now on here so I'm just kind of
doing really super light I'm not really
one for dramatic lower lashes that's
about it dramatic as I get on the lower
lash line the lashes I'm gonna be using
are the Demi lovey's by believe they're
by Ardell I don't know where my little
packaging yeah they're the Ardell kind
you can get them at Sally's now that
I've gotten to the glue on the strip I'm
just gonna let that dry for about 30
seconds and I'll join you when I get
these actually laid on my lash line
alright guys we're gonna go in for the
kill here and lay this strip on my lash
line
and I'm just kind of laying them on
there being sure to first press on the
inner and outer part and then kind of
press in the center and there you go
there is your lashes that are finally on
there I don't want to touch them too
much while they're still in that drying
stage but once they do get dry I will go
ahead and put one more coat of mascara
not really for any sort of effect other
than more of a purpose just to bond them
together and then I'll join you for the
finished guys welcome back that is my
pink smokey eye I hope you guys like it
I've just had a lot of requests lately
for incorporating pink in the look I
don't know if that's maybe a prom thing
lots of people with pink prom dresses
that are trying to figure out that way
to work in pink to their makeup look
somewhere other than their lips but I
did use it here I used my wet and wild
lipstick which I think I used in
something else recently five-ten a is
the color it's just a light shimmery
pink and then to sort of brighten it
right here in the center of my lips I
used this shade which was it's from Savi
cosmetics the shade is buff diamond it's
just a really light shimmery gloss this
I don't believe is being sold anymore so
any light shimmery gloss that you've got
it's gonna work fine there so that's
basically the look guys um thank you so
much for watching and have a great night
or have a great day I don't know it's
night time here where I'm at now so
anyway bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
