this review video this is kind of all
about a rediscovered product something
that I tried back when I was in college
and really hadn't gone back to it since
and I did enjoy it but I just kind of
you know started trying new things and
and that's kind of the way it goes with
me sometimes because I'll find something
that I really like but I just start
wanting to review new things and testing
other things out and I may not come back
to it for a while but I had a question
on my facebook page about the dream
mousse products specifically the
concealer and I thought you know I kind
of wonder if that's if that's some good
stuff so I want to go to the store and
try it out again so unfortunately my
local Walgreens was having a buy one get
one free so I got the dream matte mousse
Foundation which I had tried before and
the concealer which was new to me
and I was kind of skeptical thinking you
know how is the concealer really going
to differ from the foundation because
the foundation has a very distinct
texture I don't know if you've ever
tried it before by the way my shade is
sandy beige medium one in the foundation
and it matches my skin perfectly but
basically what you're dealing with here
I don't know if the camera will focus in
on exactly what that looks like but this
is a very light kind of a whipped
exactly as described mousse sort of
foundation it is so easy to blend
I find this almost easier to blend on my
skin than mineral makeup is I mean you
talk about mineral makeup as being one
of those no-brainer type of things if
you've got the right shade in this this
is a total no-brainer as well this is
really really easy the coverage is nice
it's nice and matte one thing I was a
little hesitant about picking this up
because it's winter time and my skin
gets a little more dry and from what I
remembered from this product um was it
was it's not like necessarily that high
moisture content type of makeup you know
like you put on a certain liquid liquid
foundation and it feels like it's giving
your skin a little added moisture this
one not so much so I made sure I really
moisturize my skin before I put it on
and it still feels Amina I I feel like
I'm not overly dry however if you are a
person that maybe gets those sort of
like patchy dry places maybe in the
winter watch out for this because I
could see this kind of clinging to some
of those places and maybe not giving you
a totally even finish and so just
depending on skin type just be aware of
that um but I really really like this
texture and I had kind of forgotten how
much I liked it and how good the
coverage was when I put it on around all
over my face you know I was pleased with
how even it really made my skin look and
then I also had this feeling after I put
it on like maybe I don't even need to
put powder on like I just had that nice
even matte coverage I really enjoyed it
and I put it around my eye area as well
I thought that you know this is not bad
coverage even in the sense of a
concealer but you know I after getting
the concealer I kind of tested you know
to see what's the difference in texture
between the foundation and the concealer
and all I can tell is that I feel like
possibly the concealer is a little more
UNCHR Immie than it is light and fluffy
they're very very similar but I feel
like the concealer that I have here
might have just a little more moisture
in it and it's just not quite as light
like you put your finger in it and it's
just a little more like a creamy texture
and I love this I really do now I got
this the way these are the way the
shades work out if you can see this here
okay this says sandy beige is the name
and medium one like there's light medium
dark I'm a medium one and then your
supposed to be able to stay in that
medium one color family and just be able
to pick up your concealer but under the
medium one concealer is like that looks
way too dark so we went with light four
to five on my concealer here see that so
I went on the darker end of the light
scale and it actually worked out just
great this is the concealer that I used
it actually has eye
no it's it's got like a little bit of a
yellowish undertone to it which I think
really helps this be an effective
under-eye concealer and I was just
really happy with how creamy it was but
yet it didn't I mean I've worn this all
day now and I'm not seeing like get my
little close-up mirror here I'm really
not seeing like this getting into fine
lines and actually you know making
anything look really accentuated in
terms of fine lines around my eye I
continue to have a matte finish on my
face so staying power wise I mean I
wasn't I was shopping all day I wasn't
really doing anything incredibly you
know strenuous but still this all held
up really well I'll be curious to see if
it gives me you know the matte finish
that I really like in terms of like when
I would do the newscast because that
really you know the lights are coming
down on you and even if you think you
have a matte finish sometimes not
everything can hold up to that kind of
lighting so I will test that out and
probably report back but anyway I just
really happy with this like I said I
kind of rediscovered the foundation
tried the concealer for the first time
was very happy with how it concealed
around my nose and my eye area without
having to really try that hard at all
this blend so easily onto the skin and
also the blushes are really good now the
blushes were something that I have been
using you know but on and off um most
recently I've gotten the dream mousse
bronzer which is nice if you just like a
little more it's got a little shimmer in
it and this is in Sun glow and so that's
nice just kind of you know the tops of
your cheeks it's almost like a like a
bronzy highlighter so that's good but my
favorite actual blush shade is the
whipped strawberries it's a pretty pink
that does not have shimmer and it's just
very um like you get a lot of color out
of it so um I just wanted to pass that
along to you guys that though this is a
product that's been on the market for a
while you know maybe you tried it when
it was when it was new and then kind of
walked away from it for a while let me
know what you think I mean I could see
this as being a sort of product that
maybe some people really like it or some
people really
I think it's very dependent on skin type
but I just really think it gives you
that nice matte flawless finish if
that's what you're after if you like the
dewy more um I don't know
dewy glow shimmery sort of appearance to
the skin this may not be for you or you
may want to use this and rely on a like
like a highlighting powder to give you
that glow and I mean I think that's a
nice balanced way to go about it
actually because I did a little
highlighter like on my cheeks here so I
don't feel like my face is totally flat
but I do feel like it really really
handled the flaws quite nicely so thank
you guys so much for tuning in for this
video hope maybe this brought a few
things to your attention I'm really
really impressed oops almost dropped it
with the dream mist concealer though so
let me know what you think if you've
tried these products please pass your
like little reviews on to others so we
can all share our information have a
great day guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
