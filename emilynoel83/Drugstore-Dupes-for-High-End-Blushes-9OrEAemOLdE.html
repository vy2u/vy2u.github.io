big project for about the past month or
so I've been trying to find dupes for my
high-end blushes I've come up with 10
we're talking brands like Mac and Tarte
and Laura Mercier and the balm and then
finding less expensive blushes that
really match those high-end blushes from
brands like elf and wet and wild and NYX
and things like that is really exciting
to think that you don't have to spend
you know a big price to get a similar
look and a blunt really I'm looking for
exact dupes of these shades that's why
state can be so long at first I had like
four or five and then you know I wanted
to work up to a decent amount before I
shot a video on it so now I've got 10
keep in mind just because something
looks similar or might even look
different as you look at them
side-by-side in the packaging it's more
about the swatch that I'm thinking of
when I when I come up with the dupes I
mean you really do have to go through
and test things you also have to keep in
mind that um it's sort of more sheer on
your cheeks and some blushes you know go
on with a lot more heavy pigmentation
right off the bat so you have to think
about well how does that look when it
sheared out a little so lots of things
to think about but let's get started I
have been loving the blushes from the
balm and one of my favorites is called
hot mama and it's got adorable packaging
first off and the blush itself is kind
of like a light peachy golden shade kind
of like a blush that borders on a
highlight for some people because of the
amount of gold that shows through in
this so I knew I had to find a blush
that wasn't just flat peach but it had
the same golden shimmer and I found that
in the elf one dollar blush in glow and
when you swatch this when you wear this
the gold really comes through I'm
wearing this on my cheeks now and see
that little bit of highlight here I'm
not wearing a highlight this is the
highlight so it's kind of these remind
me of blush slash highlights and glow
from ELF is just like this I have a
couple of Tarte blushes and I've got to
say they are tough to find a dupe of I
mean I just looked and
and I couldn't see anything in my
collection that was similar but finally
I came across one that I'm really really
satisfied with as a dupe and it's for
this blush in peacefull so this is one
of those Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour
blushes
it's gorgeous these shimmery blushes
it's tough to find something that just
glows and has the same finish exactly
but this one from wet and wild love the
Wet n Wild blushes and this one is
called pearlescent pink and it is
beautiful and it has just the same
finish just that one from Tarte and this
is of course a drugstore blush that's
not going to cost you much money he's
kind of surprised and thrilled to see
that I had a dupe for this great laura
geller blush in mimosa this is a
beautiful kind of complex color here
you're seeing some tones of berry and
peach and a little bit of gold but I
thought you know what am I going to have
that's going to be similar obviously I'm
not looking for something that looks
just like that in the packaging but what
matters is how does it look on the
cheeks how does it look when you swatch
it and the NYX blush and pinched
actually the it comes off just like this
one does when you swatch it it's got
that little bit of gold to it that
little bit of peach kind of a pinky tone
as well so thrilled to find something
that dupes mimosa because I thought this
is a very unique blush this is something
I don't think I have anything else like
but pinched from NYX is a lot like it's
we have Mac's blush in floor power it
spelled FLE you kind of your classic
peachy pink lacking shimmer overall it's
a satin finish blush so it's not going
to come off with a whole lot of shine
and metallic tones and for a long time
I've kind of eyed a color in my
collection that I thought was really on
par with that both in intensity and the
exact shade and it's Milani minerals
blush in my tie this comes off the very
same way it doesn't have Sparkle so
again we're thinking not just about
colors here but the whole the whole
finish the whole appearance of the shade
and these
great dupes I got as a gift not all that
long ago this kit from laura mercier and
there's a really really pale pink blush
in here and I wanted to get some variety
in this video and not dupe a bunch of
blushes that all look the same but I'm
this shade called rose petal here is
just such a soft soft light baby pink
and I thought for somebody out there
wanting something similar to that and it
is it does appear to be relatively matte
I found a great dupe for it guys it's
L'Oreal True Match blush in baby blossom
so this really soft light pink and this
one here from Laura Mercier I think for
somebody looking for just one of those
barely-there colors this is going to be
like that I have Mac's dolly mix and
this looks like a really bright pink
blush it actually goes on a little more
sheer than this and it was kind of a
struggle to find a shade that really
matched up but oddly enough I found it
in a one dollar item here from ELF and
this is the elf blush and flushed and
these actually come off really really
similar it was tough to find something
that was just as sheer as this and it
still had that same pink vibrancy to it
so in swatching these and in cheering
them out and blending them out as well I
found these to be great dupes for one
another my favorite blush from Malley is
a color called Molly's glow and I think
this is just a really great pink it's
just a classic classic kind of rosy pink
on the cheeks and it does have a little
bit of shimmer so as I was searching for
a dupe for this the one that really
matched up for me was the Physicians
Formula happy booster blush and Naturals
you know a lot of different shades
altogether there but as you blend your
finger across them or you blend your
brush across them they really turn out
to have a look that is just like this
for a classic pink kind of blush the
Physicians Formula happy booster in
natural is a great dupe for this one
from Mallory and talked about this blush
from Mac which is a shade called breezy
and it's really a little bit deeper
blush and as you can see it has almost
that slight bit of metallic shimmer as
you look at it here it's kind of a berry
type blush the dupe I found for this is
from ELF and it's one of the three
dollar blushes from the studio line and
it's called blushing rose and this has
long been a favorite of mine because
this color comes off with a lot of
impact comes off so much like that matte
color and it was kind of surprising
because they I don't feel like they look
exactly alike as you look at them in the
packaging and that was what kind of
threw me off for a little while for me
been checking it out as a dupe but they
really are similar on the cheeks that
splush is from Mac and it's kind of a
dusty rose it's called desert rose and I
had difficulty finding something from
the drugstore that sort of had that you
know lack of shimmer lack of brightness
and something that was kind of taken
down enough it's just kind of you know a
little bit more muted and finally in a
little kit that I got but this is
available full size I got one of those
wet and wild color icon blushes in
mellow wine this is great these two
actually come off so similarly in a
sheer Doubt's wine color that is not you
know pure pink or pure peach you know
it's just a little bit dusty and so
these two colors actually work really
well as duke got a great color from Mac
here called ambering rose and it's kind
of like a bronzy rose I would call it
and it does have shimmer and I found a
dupe for that in my collection something
I've had for a while it's the covergirl
single blush here in Sierra sands I was
thrilled to find something that measured
up to this one and also while this one
looks a little darker it doesn't go on
quite as dark as it looks which works to
match this so it's kind of interesting
in the in the whole process of finding
dupes how things don't always appear to
be a dupe but they turn out to be so
that wraps up my video on blush dupes um
if as I get more blushes and try new
blushes maybe there will be around two
on this someday but I've got to tell you
this was quite a task and as I started
it I started kind of thinking like oh my
gosh can I even pull this off but I'm
really really pleased with the dupes
I've come up with and if you know of
some that you'd like to share please let
me know in the comments
section have a great day everyone and
I'll see you next time
