this video if you love dupes if you love
figuring out you know what's a
lower-cost alternative to my favorite
high-end products you're going to enjoy
this video this is drugstore dupes for
high-end highlight if you love this kind
of video I also have one for blushes I
have Mac eyeshadows and some different
ones so just check the extra info box
below if you want links to those other
kind of related videos but highlights
come in all forms you can use them as
powders creams liquid really thought
that this would be a little bit easier
than doing blush dupes just because
there wouldn't be maybe as wide of a
range of shades and I was right when you
really start looking closely you
realized oh my gosh sup one thing
shimmers you know it'll slightly
iridescent way this one has more pink
this one has more gold and I mean there
are still some in my collection that I'm
dying to you know find the dupe for but
I just didn't feel like it was good
enough to put in this video and
recommend to you so I'll keep looking on
some of those but I'm really confident
in the ones that I found I like using
highlights for a couple of reasons first
off they can give more contrast on your
face so if you're contouring and then
you're also highlighting you know
getting this little bit of glow say on
your cheekbone or down the bridge of
your nose your Cupid's bow area your
brow bone when you highlight those
different areas it really kind of gives
your face even more dimension so it just
makes you glow you know it gives your
face a look of health a look of you know
maybe a little more vibrancy than it had
before with a lot of cream highlights or
liquids I may just apply those with my
fingers for powders a fan brush can be a
nice really really light way to get you
know just the minimal amount application
wise I also like this small like kind of
egg-shaped brush from Sigma I find it
works really well in some very targeted
areas around the face let's start out by
telling you about a dupe for benefits
high-beam on this product obviously it
comes in a larger size normally but I
have the small size and I did blog about
this but I only had one dupe now I found
two more dupes for this as well this is
kind of a cream highlight product you
can put it you know basically in any of
those highlighting spots on your face
that I mentioned and it has the
slightest bit of a pinky hue to it but
it's not overboard on shimmer it's a
really really pretty lot of dupes for
that and the one that I really can't
take credit for because someone
recommend this to me this is boots
number seven highlights illuminating
lotion and the cost and size comparison
for you know compare this to full-sized
high-beam it's crazy it's like you're
getting double the product at half the
price basically so I blogged about that
showed some swatches I mean this is just
a really really great dupe but as I
looked in my collection I thought oh
there's more elf radiance enhancer in
spotlight this is like if you prefer
this kind of format where it's kind of
clicking through sort of the the tip of
that brush there it's so so similar um
it's still got that you know not
overboard on shimmer you're not seeing
glitter and another thing from elf that
I just discovered shortly before doing
this video is I was just kind of
double-checking everything is this elf
body shimmer in mystic moon lights so
this is something you use all over if
you're getting a lot of product you can
also use it on your face it almost looks
like a mini deodorant sticker but this
definitely again has that same looked as
benefit high beam but if you like more
of a solid form as opposed to a liquid
form like the red star this is going to
be another option for you another
benefit product here um they have one of
their little boxed blush bronzer things
called 10 and this one actually is like
half bronzer and half highlight and if
you look closer that highlight it has
that little bit of pink to it kind of
like I mentioned with a high beam and so
I've always kind of thought of this as
like high beam and powder for I feel
like the dupe for that is from
Physicians Formula and it's the happy
booster and translucent when you swirl
your brush in all these shades you'll
notice you got a little bit of pink
going on there and that's just enough
pink to disperse throughout you know
your brushstroke through the product to
give you the same look that you get here
and it's not going to be obvious pink
this is No
Neera blush don't get me wrong but it's
just going to have that slight hint that
makes it a lot like benefit 10 on the
highlights side so I just wanted to pass
that along if you're kind of liking
high-beam you're wanting a powder
alternative think about something like
that also have Sunbeam I actually have
Sunbeam in the full-size here and this
is an interesting thing because think of
it as a highlight but with like that
golden e bronzy glow it's again much
like you know a high beam it's in that
liquid format you're going to take out a
wand it's going to be really kind of a
liquidy creamy sort of texture there I
wanted to find a dupe for this I knew I
didn't have anything of that exact kind
of liquid cream texture started thinking
you know well how can we compare it once
it's all swatched out just the
appearance of the color and the way it
works on the skin and I found there's
product from hard candy called Glo away
and it's a bronzer and highlight duo in
one and the bronzer side actually comes
off looking just like a benefits Sunbeam
it's crazy it's like that just perfect
golden I mean I'm like they're calling
as a bronzer this is definitely a
highlight got Sunbeam on this side and
I've got this one on this other side and
it's just the same it's the same finish
the same look I want to talk about one
of my all-time favorite highlights just
a highlight that I've fallen in love
with I have the full size I also have
this small sizes from lorac it's their
perfectly lit powder and the shade is
called spot light what I love so much
about this is that it is that one of the
most subtle highlights you're going to
find it's almost has a little bit of
dare I say coverage to it because when
you put it on it almost perfects and it
highlights and it's a powder consistency
but it's not too flaky and it's got just
the slightest bit of beige and remember
maybe it was months ago having a little
Twitter conversation with the ktab about
this and you should check out her
channel for lots of great reviews but
we're talking about this one reserved
your Cabana from wet and wild it's the
color icon bronzer but again when you
look on the light end of bronzers
typically they're more like a highlight
this is definitely a high
light and the shade is called reserve
your Cabana this is huge this also has
an SPF in it I believe SPF 15 and it's
just the same kind of thing going on
there as lorac spot light in that it's
light it's got a little bit of beige
tone to it so it's not going to look
drastically different from skin and it
hasn't you know just the most subtle
amount of shimmer it's almost hard to
detect so I knew you know that is so
right on next two pairs of products are
going to be kind of like the the same
level of shimmer one's going to be a
little bit lighter and the other is
going to be just a little bit darker so
for the lighter of the two you can talk
about a much loved product from the balm
and it's called mary lou manizer talked
about this in my balm video it's just
the cutest packaging ever she's getting
her mugshot taken there but the shade is
just kind of like classic pearly
highlight and it is pretty darn shimmery
I mean I feel like it's almost
borderline getting a little bit of a
metallic look to it and I really
struggled finding a dupe for this
because and it was strange because I
thought this was the most typical you
know it wasn't like I had to find one
that was a little bit bronze or a little
bit pink you know it was just kind of
like classic light colored highlight but
finally I did and here comes hard candy
again coming in with a dupe but it's the
so baked bronzer and tiki really light
shade and this just has that beautiful
glow and keep in mind that with these
dupes the reason why I was having
trouble these don't look that similar
when you look at them side-by-side but
when you swatch them sometimes just the
amount of pigmentation one has is
compared to the other the swatches will
look similar and they look similar on
your face so you've got to try them even
if you maybe don't initially think
that's the do now something that's a
little bit darker than mary lou manizer
it's still a highlight it's still going
to be you know a light pretty glow but
it's just see how the tone is different
I wouldn't even call it bronze but it's
just like a little different tone but
still ultra shimmery and this is from
Mac this is the mineralized skinfinish
and soft and gentle and it's very pretty
it but as you can see it's highly
shimmery it's a very very shiny
highlight so when I was looking for
something similar I thought it's got to
be it's got to be real shimmery but it's
almost got to have a little bit of depth
to it so what I discovered is a dupe for
that was the shimmer strips from
Physicians Formula in Vegas strip and
it's not just any one part of this but
you got to run your brush through all of
it just like the other Physicians
Formula one I was talking about but when
you do it's a very similar look to this
these are very very shimmery they're
cool if you get one of these because you
can like use them as eyeshadows like one
strip at a time
but when used all together it's a
similar look to Mac's soft and gentle I
wanted to come up with even more I
really wanted to get to ten but a lot of
them were just too much of a stretch and
it just was not working so if I come up
with more I'll let you know keep an eye
on my blog that's where those might turn
up but thank you so much for watching
being interested in my dupe videos
because they're fun it's a challenge for
me so I really enjoy it and I'll be
doing probably some bronzers soon
shimmery and matte bronzers got a lot of
those to work on so thanks so much for
watching and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
