for this look lots of different things
going on here first off all drugstore
makeup
nearly all drugstore brushes I did have
to pull in a couple eye brushes that I'm
very comfortable with but for the most
part I'm trying to kind of go out of my
comfort zone with a few elements of this
look just a few of the application
methods and on the eyes what I'm trying
to do is work in like wearable fall
color I used that great emerald green
that I've been promising I'm gonna have
a green eye tutorial coming this is the
L'Oreal infallible golden emerald shade
I love it so much so we worked that into
the look I just wanted to put out a look
that was all affordable products if you
look that would be fun to throw together
if you had a dance or a formal or
something like that and if you're well
beyond school years you know this might
be date night this might be cocktail
party who knows but I do really love it
as a nice summer to fall transition look
with the light lip and kind of bronzy
skin I think we're still holding onto a
little bit of summer here but I'm loving
the deeper eye
okay so starting out I have already
applied my moisturizer and eye cream so
I'm going to use a little bit of primer
this one's kind of new to me I'm
comparing it in my mind to benefits
Porefessional it seems like similar
claims and kind of similar consistency
so I'm going to dab this around and
really focus it in around the nose and
sides of the nose where I might see
pores don't go a little bit on the
forehead as well just kind of blend
outward from the center of my face
definitely mattifies right away next I'm
gonna apply my Rimmel lasting finish
foundation I wear this in the shade soft
beige and I would love to know if any of
you have been with me like way way back
in the day like in the apartment days
when I was using this out of the squeeze
tube and talking about how much I love
this foundation I was soft beige then
and I'm soft beige now so I'm just going
to kind of start patching this around my
face it's a nice coverage foundation and
it's
just I feel like a really good middle
ground for various skin types you know I
feel like someone with oily skin can get
away with wearing this and setting it a
little bit but I could also see it
working just fine on dry skin in an
effort to try a different blending
method I have dampened my Real
Techniques sponge here and I'm just
gonna go with that blending it in all
over my face it's really pressing the
foundation into my skin not that this is
one of those foundations that needs a
lot of help like with looking natural or
you know breaking it down somewhat so it
looks good on the skin but I'm just
trying to do a few things that are a
little bit outside my norm you know with
this video and I have been using my
Beauty Blender on and off as well I know
I've had some questions about that since
I purchased it and I'm gonna tell you
right now I really kind of like this one
better
I really have kind of started to dig the
flat side of this little thing I'm gonna
do a little bit of concealing and I'm
using my Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda
concealer palette
what's that phone I'm just gonna use
this to brighten around the under-eye
area this is the lightest color right
now really getting into that you know
deep cavern on either side of the nose
so just me or does I keep getting deeper
with age deeper and darker that would be
the answer and I'm not going to do a lot
of drastic contour and highlight with
this video so I'm gonna kind of use my
concealer in certain places where I want
you know that little bit of lift and
then I'm gonna dab into this slightly
deeper tone of concealer and kind of dab
that right over the top and keep in mind
I'm not this isn't a total blend yet but
I think that helps it blend once I bring
in like a Beauty Blender or a sponge the
moisture that I've gotten this sponge is
really um helpful I think for creamy
concealers like this
and the thing in this little compact
that I love pretty much as much as the
creamy concealer is the little setting
powder you'll see I have hit pan on it
pat myself on the back for that I'm
using my little elf tapered brush and
we're just going to dab some of that
powder right here instantly just perfect
mattifies that area um you can pick up a
lot with your brush and so kind of tap
off some excess there and then I want to
do like just a very very light powder
all over the skin just for you know I
think it helps the staying power out
throughout the day for me I feel like my
skin benefits from even just the
lightest amount of powder on top so I'm
going to use some Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless shade am I in this
natural beige elf complexion brush has
been my go-to powder brush lately and
just kind of DAB that around as I go
over the under eye I don't really want
to be raking it back and forth as I have
pinks taking like concealed that area
but just lightly buffing it in down in
here and a light bit on forehead then
I'm gonna do some bronzing and I'm going
to be using a product I'm very excited
about for the bronzing this is my makeup
revolution all about bronzed palette I
think it may have been
oh it says on the front Ultra blush
palette but it is a bronzer ballot and
this shade right here is a little bit
cooler than the rest and maybe a hair
deeper so I like to pick some of that up
with my brush and I mentioned I'm not
gonna do you know super chiseled contour
but I'm just doing see how that just
gives me that little shadow
you know accentuates that area just a
bit I don't know I'm just liking the
softness I think it looks a little bit
younger
in some ways than a really chiseled
contour so then for my forehead area I'm
gonna go kind of back and forth between
that very sunny golden II bronzer and
the one I just been using these are what
I would call you know low impact bronzer
they're not gonna make you look too
orange you're crazy but they do warm up
the skin nicely tan or deep skin this
may not be deep enough for you guys and
then just for a little you know added
radiance on the face I'm gonna go to
this shake which does have a little glow
I'm gonna lightly sweep that right on
the tops of the cheeks across the nose
next I'm going to be doing my Chloe
highlight and then my matte blush I'm
loving layering a matte blush over glowy
highlight I just love the finished
effect and this is an up-and up brush
comes from the complexion set if you
watched my up and up brush video high
five to you but this is the makeup
revolution vivid baked highlight in
golden lights it looks white you know
but if I give you a swatch here you can
see there's kind of a just a golden
eagle oh that comes off of it I am going
to take it like top of the cheek where I
would apply blush but I'm also gonna
work it backward and if you feel like
wow that is pretty glowy ooh um and
you're cringing over it don't worry
because this blush step afterward I
think really works well for that I'm
using my up-and-up blush brush and the
blush shade is my Milani romantic rose
so you know a soft dusty rose blush is
gonna be great for this look not going
too loud and then outer part of the
apple of the cheek you're gonna overlap
a little bit of the highlight that was
on your cheek and kind of sweep it back
like I think I said in my favorites
video it's still glow but it just takes
the edge off a little bit for brows I'm
going to be using my new new ish
Maybelline brow satin I recently
reviewed this on the Express channel and
somebody was asking me on snapchat last
night what's the difference between your
two channels and the Express channel is
the one that is purely reviews they're
all around 5 minutes long one product at
a time whereas my videos on this main
channel you know longer videos tutorials
talking about lots of products at one
time basically anything else Beauty
related and it could be some reviews as
well that require a little more
explanation or comparison or whatever it
may be
this is the free-for-all beauty Channel
and that one is just I like to think of
it as your resource like there will be
so many products reviewed over there and
they're all categorized into eyes lips
face body beauty tools brushes whatever
it may be and you can go there and be
like oh she mentioned she had a review
on this or that and and that's your
resource for extra information when I
launched the channel I was doing videos
five days a week on there and after
having the baby I had to scale back a
little bit so I'm doing pretty regularly
on getting videos up on there three days
a week
there's also tide a Friday which is
Tyler's a random review of the week so
I've just taken the pencil side of this
and filled in my brows and then I'm
there's a powder end as well I'm just
gonna go over that a little bit kind of
sets the color I think it helps maybe
overall staying power of this and then
I'm gonna use a little control freak
brow gel just on top of that now I'm
gonna go to eyes first up priming the
lids I'm using this NYX proof it which
actually has served as a really good eye
primer for me throughout the summer it
does do a good job of just long wear
throughout the day I'm using this brush
this came from my morphe set that I got
off of Haute look see what it looks like
it's like a little couple of cups and
they're a little bit shorter brushes
almost seems like a travel set so I'm
trying out a few of these this is where
I would use my Sigma e25 typically and
I'm taking oops I forgot to say what
shade I'm using this is the matte shadow
by NYX this is the shade dance the tides
and this is a very similar color to
Mac's saddle so if you like that matte
kind of medium warm brown first place I
popped my brush was the outer part and I
am just blending inward a bit as well
then I'm just gonna blend out over the
edges of that with a bear brush I'm
using another NYX matte shadow and this
is in the shade skinny dip and it is a
plum I love the way plum colors look
alongside warm Browns so I'm picking
some of this up with the little flat
brush that came in that set and I'm
going to Pat this on the outside of the
lid outer part and I'm also going to be
flipping that brush over and just
allowing this to mesh in with that warm
brown in the crease
I'm also going to take some of that plum
down under the eye with a pencil brush
if I had other pencil and blending
brushes that I felt like could do the
job well enough I would use those if I
had lower-cost ones that I really liked
I'm not saying they're not out there on
the market but these are just my comfort
zone I just love how nice these matte
shades just work with one another they
blend nicely I'm going to take a little
bit of the brown what does that called
dance the tides take a little bit of
that and that's going to go under this
part and we may further smoke this out
once the lashes get on sometimes I
decide to you know go a little further
with the lower eyeshadow look once I put
lashes on
oh I almost forgot I am doing a dark
waterline as well I'm using my Milani
supreme Kohl Kajal eyeliner there
I like to kind of take it right
in-between the lashes as well
and then blend over it see how that
small step really enhanced the smokiness
of what we've got going on here for the
lids I'm going full on green and so I'm
using some my Milani shadow eyes this is
in green Safari I know it seems like
kind of a lot of products but it'll pay
off I'm dabbing this all over like the
inner two-thirds of my lid not really
going on top of that purple that we
applied just apply it from the stick and
then dab over it with your finger that
picks up any excess this is gonna really
make the shadow I put on top of it pop
even further because it's already a
pigmented shadow that I'm gonna apply
but this also really helps staying power
to my delightful golden emerald
infallible shadow I love this shade it's
just stunningly beautiful if you like
greens you've got to get this um this is
my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush just
begin dabbing this and you've got this
really pretty just jewel like emerald
glow on the lids I love it so much and
then as I get out toward that plum I'm
over lapping it I'm touching it but I'm
not really packing it on at that point
and I may even add a little plum and
kind of come back over but this is just
a fun shadow to apply because it just
totally translates you know it's fun to
use those shades that show up so true to
color so exactly what they should be
here's what else I want to do going back
with that flat brush and the plum just
dabbing a little bit more of that for
some added purpley intensity this plum
shades not playing around either it's
like hey I want to show up too and then
I feel like I need a little more going
on right in here so I'm going to pick up
a bit of the plum with this pencil brush
and just kind of gently take it right
above the green in the crease this is my
no man's land of the eye area I always
kind of struggle with this particular
zone I feel like I don't know why
I'm going back to the highlight we used
on the face and there's this brush in
the set that's kind of fluffy a little
bit angled I'm just going to apply that
right here under the brow
and I also want to place that shade
right around the inner corner so there
is this pencil II brush in the set it's
not quite like fluffy enough to do a lot
of typical pencil stuff that I want it
to do but it can go around my inner
corner all right going ever so slightly
up onto my green
then I'm going to take my Jordana color
Envy liquid liner just a little bit of
black liner across the upper lash line
here
doing just a slight wing at the end here
I'm just gonna take a little bit of plum
because it's like the deepest shade
we're working with and I'm gonna go
under my wing
I'm gonna curl lashes and apply mascara
the mascara I'm doing today is this
Maybelline chaotic I'm not wearing it in
the funky like super clumpy method that
you can wear it in if you want to I'm
just using it for a length of thickness
because it can do a pretty decent job of
that
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on my lower lashes lashes are going to
be the Vegas nay I'll or easy elegance
so a little bit flared out at the
outsides Revlon precision lash glue as
always sorry about my finger nails in
this video if you've caught a close
blunts of those I'm sorry
dabbing a little mascara here at the
base of the lash and then this is where
I just kind of look over everything and
see you know are things looking the way
I planned and I've got this nice warm
brown coming up above and I just want
more of that on the lower lash line so
again going back to the shade with the
pencil brush and going below the wing
for the lips I've got some bum on I'm
gonna take my Milani a nude lip liner I
know I'm always using spice but today
I'm thinking I want to go nude just on
the lips and so I'm just gonna apply
that here it's not you know like really
dull nude it's got some pink to it and
these color statement lip liners are so
so creamy like I haven't used this shade
in a long time and it's going on like
buttah and this is my L'Oreal
extraordinaire gloss the shade is nude
ballet love this nude gloss
but I hope you guys enjoyed this look I
feel like there's a tendency toward a
lot of natural back-to-school looks this
time of year which I think are great but
also you know people have dances people
have more formal things going on and you
might want to use some bargain products
for that kind of a look as well so I'm
really unhappy with the way this turned
out
I love how the really the jewel of this
eye look that emerald green is nicely
like encapsulated in all this pretty
matte shadow so thank you so much for
taking time out of your days to watch
these videos I really appreciate it and
I will see you again in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
