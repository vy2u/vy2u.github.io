drugstore haul yeah it's going to be
from walgreens and I went there this
past weekend picked up some things a
that I needed and B that I was just some
things I was intrigued about and really
wanted to try and possibly review for
you so as you watch this video if
there's anything that's particularly
interesting to you that you'd like to
see a review on or like to see used in
tutorials please just let me know um let
me know in the comments and I kind of
look through there and get a feel for
what you're most interested in but
anyway if you watch my bathroom video
not too long ago you probably noticed
that wasn't too wild about the shampoo
and conditioner that I had and I also
wanted to get something that would cater
a little bit more to color treated hair
not fading it out my hair I've had
questions about what color this is this
may look black I don't know in this
video technically it is dark brown the
shade is from Clairol it's the natural
instincts in ebony mocha and that is
called dark brown so um yeah I it's
really really close to my natural color
I like it because I feel like this it's
a semi-permanent hair color I feel like
it gives my hair more texture makes it
my really really fine hair a lot easier
to work with and manage and also
throughout the summer I mean my hair was
just getting quite a bit lighter showing
up a lot lighter on camera for work
during the newscast and I just kind of
wanted to bring it back to that rich
dark shade that it typically has so
anyway that's the story behind my hair
color but now as for the new shampoo and
conditioner I got I got the Loreal
everpure sulfate free color care system
and it says it's an anti fade system UV
filters natural botanicals and so I got
the volumizing ones its volume shampoo
and volume conditioner and the scent
is sent on the shampoo is rosemary
juniper and the conditioner is rosemary
mint so basically oh but anyway
basically these are supposed to keep my
hair more you know less likely to fade
and it's all natural stuff it's a
hundred percent vegan no harsh salts it
says no drying salts so we'll see I
guess how well as caters to my hair's
needs I'm just on the scent it is like a
a mint sort of scent which is ok I guess
I'm not it smells like more of a manly
shampoo I don't know it's not like the
over-the-top fruity stuff that I'm used
to using on my hair so it's not bad um
sent wise but I really do want something
that's going to be functional and good
for my hair so that's why I picked that
up also there was a deal I think it
might have been a buy one get one half
off on the yes to carrots brand and i
know i really like these lip tints so i
picked up one of those this is in cotton
candy and so it basically just shows up
as a really light kind of shimmery you
may be able to see it right there kind
of just a shimmery um sheer thing for
your lips and I just like the way the
bones feel they kind of remind me of the
Burt's Bees stuff I've got them in a few
different colors and I like the colors
but this one is definitely more of a
sheer one in cotton candy um and then
also I wanted to try out some there yes
to cucumbers hypoallergenic facial
towelettes this is just a travel package
of 10 they had a bigger one and it's a
really good price and if he's actually
costs like a buck 50 maybe just for this
little pat to try I'm just kind of
wanted to see how effective these where
I haven't tried face wipes in a while I
use the face wash clothes to wash my
face but in a situation maybe where I
want to remove my makeup start something
over or you know do something different
the end of the day and i just thought i
would see how good of a fresh start
these could give me some trying those
also on a buy one get one half off deal
were the maybelline i think was
Maybelline eye and lip products possibly
so I got a deal on the stylish smokes
quad I got the one in natural smokes I
already had the one in charcoal smoke so
that's kind of like a classic smokey eye
but I'd heard on YouTube several people
talking about how much they liked the
natural smokes so that's what i have
here as you can see you've got that
color there that um for the lid it
totally reminds me of like the color of
my shirt just that kind of topi kind of
brownish gray color so i really like
these i wore this quad today and I've
worn it for a couple of days and I just
love it so easy to use and the colors
really are smoky they blend really well
and I love that the thing I love about
the stylish smoke squads is that they
give you a truly dark shade and that is
a matte shade there that brown down
there so really works well very very
nice combination of colors that you get
so I got that one then my half off I got
the one in emerald smoke so the only one
I don't have is a purple one if I need
the purple one if you guys think that
one is really awesome let me know but
and this is the Emerald one it just
really caught my eye with that crease
shade there the lid shade is more olive
the brow bone color is kind of like a
little bit of a yellowy toned shade and
then the crease color is very dark but
it has kind of like some it's kind of
like an army green shade but very very
dark there's a look at that crease shade
I guess I should have been squatching
this all along right there are those let
me get the brow bone okay okay there
they all are as you can see they're
really pigmented um I I really like this
kind of section of the maybelline
shadows um and just to show you I guess
I'll swatch a couple here on the natural
smokes fighting in my hand right off
here um yeah
just a few of the shades so you can sing
they're really pretty blend lovely I'm
very glad to several of people that I
saw that that thought those were really
good products i agree so maybe some
tutorials on those I don't know if you
want them okay and then lastly something
that I for my own curiosity I needed to
try this and I've been getting an
increasing number of questions about it
it's the almay one coat dial-up mascara
this is the mascara that supposedly
gives you three different looks I've
saved the packaging because I always
save packaging so I can refer to it as I
do a review and you can see one is full
the next stage is fuller and the next
stage is full list so basically this
says go from natural too dramatic volume
in just three clicks you just turn this
dial so like there we can see it's at a
three now too and now a 1 so whatever
that's pointing at is what you're going
to get and I think it kind of is
adjusting inside you know when you pull
your mascara wand out and there's kind
of that stopper that either leaves more
product on your mascara brush or it
cleans a lot of it off I have a feeling
that's what's a jesting in there but um
I will review this I really want to let
you guys know how well it works but I so
far only used it a couple times and I've
only used it on the three setting the
most volume and its really it's a really
young it's a rubber brush it has a
little bit of a contour to it it gets a
little bit narrower there towards the
center um it's really flexible and bendy
um so I like it so far I've enjoyed it I
don't only have that on I have some
false eyelashes I have the Revlon
fantasy links on today and intensifying
but I have this on with it as well so
yeah liking it so far but i think that
the real thing will be is it that much
different you know from one to two to
three
and is it worth it do we need three
settings on a mascara I don't know i
will review that though and let you know
and as for my outfit today because i
haven't been very good about letting you
know like what i have on but I got this
top from jcpenney um I love the way
these tops are that kind of cut
diagonally across they almost look like
a wrap top and this one is like I said
kind of a taupe brownish light brown
shade and I just think that those are
such a flattering style and I was
talking to like the girl I was checking
out whether we were like wow you know
these really do our nice fitting tops
and then this necklace I have comes from
Claire's and it's just kind of it has
different metals it appears it looks
like there's actually kind of a gold a
silver rose gold its kind of multi tonal
there but it looks nice with the neutral
top so and then the natural smoke squad
up perfect so yeah I always get really
like satisfied when it all works
together like that some days so anyway
um thanks for watching my whole video
hope you enjoyed it and I hope you're
all having a good week so far and I will
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
