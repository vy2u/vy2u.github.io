frustrating story to tell you I had shot
a tutorial just a little bit ago really
really great tutorials so excited about
it and a big chunk of it when I like got
my video loaded up onto my computer was
gone like it was when I had started and
stopped it was like a separate clip of
video on my camera but um needless to
say it did not load up so I will be
redoing that at another time so I
thought for now you know I really want
to post a video today so I thought why
not do a haul video especially on
drugstore products because you know who
doesn't like to see that kind of stuff
because it's available to pretty much
everyone no matter where you live you
usually have access to a drugstore
nearby so I thought I'd just go over a
few things that I got if I've tried it
I'll tell you whether or not I like it
but if I haven't tried it I won't really
pass judgment just yet but first thing
here is the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
the color is blackest black and first
thing isn't the packaging cute like a
little telescope yeah
hence the name telescopic right and they
had a few different versions they had
something called clean definition they
had carbon black and then they just had
the regular and so I thought well I'll
just try the regular and see if I like
that and go from there and this is a
rubber brush mascara it's something you
may know I'm not a huge fan of all
rubber brush mascaras and it has a very
small wand that sort of has one two
three like four little sort of edges
that come off of it like one two three
four around it and they're very small it
but it really does lengthen I used it
just once just today and usually it
takes me a little bit a little while to
figure out if I really like a mascara or
not but I felt like this really like
elongated majorly it kind of reminded me
of double extend in that way it was easy
to go over it and do another coat and
get a little more thickness in a little
more length but I see why people like
this I've heard that this you know is
some
both like you know HG mascara Holy Grail
mascara so I guess I I thought well you
know since I was sort of running running
low on a couple that I really really
like that I have I thought why not go
ahead and try something new so more on
this to come I may feature this in some
videos if I think it's really worthwhile
or you know if not I still use some you
know in some random tutorials you know
I'll use a mascara I haven't you know
that I'm not a particular fan of but I
just want to use it up you know so
anyway what else here I've got I got
something that was new to me at least
knew that I had seen at Walmart from the
NYC brand it's called Metro quartet and
this shade is in the best of Broadway
and they had a bunch of different color
selections and I liked a lot of them I
thought there were some really nice
color selections there let me open this
up and show you what you get here you
get um four shades and a little
applicator that is let's all admit you
know not necessarily the most worthwhile
applicator it does have a little sponge
tip and then I got to looking at this
other side and it's like a little brush
with I don't know if you can see that
but it's like a little brush with a
knotch taken right out of the middle so
anyway I'll give it cuteness points this
as a really little NYC logo on there but
um it had a little like um thing that
here it is and this little like tray
that laid over the top that tells you
what's crease what's for highlight
what's for all over lid and what's for
contour so that um kind of might help
you sort things out but you can probably
figure it out too if you guys have you
know used some eyeshadow you know lid
shade a highlight shade and a couple of
darker shades there this one's kind of
got like a chocolatey Brown a black a
pinky champagne and then a very very
light beige there so I just kind of have
swatched these a little bit I'm not
quite sure how they work but I can tell
that the lighter one of the lighter
shades has a much softer
texture and consistency so it tends to
give better color than the darker shades
at least from what I can tell the spice
swatching but like I said don't really
pass that as a real judgement right now
I just kind of bought it because I like
the colors and I thought if this is nice
they have a lot of other cool sets that
look like nice you know color pairings
so I'll let you know if I like this like
I said it's a little bit different it's
a little more of like a sleep kind of
classy packaging and pretty small for
four colors I mean you're not getting a
lot of each but I'll let you know how I
like that I got another new thing from
NYC and it is called lip sliders tinted
lip balm the one I thought was in sugar
kiss so it's pink and it has this little
this reminds me of packaging on
something I don't know if it's tart
somebody I'll have to correct me but
what is that light lavender packaging
remind you of what brand has done that
before I think it's tart but I'm not
sure but it basically just slide it open
and this smells oh my gosh it smells
like cotton candy do you guys remember I
don't know if they still make them they
probably do the cotton candy lip
smackers yes this is what that smells
like I don't know if they all smell the
same I don't know if it's one where
they're all flavor different but this is
light pink and it smells like cotton
candy so I couldn't rate it higher in
terms of scent and then it's really it's
set that's tinted but honestly this is
gonna come off pretty clear it's not a
thick color whatsoever like if I swatch
it on my hand you might see a little
shininess but you won't see really any
color so don't plan on getting pink lips
out of this but it is nice it feels good
on your lips and it might be nice like
over a lipstick that maybe feels a
little drying on your lips or something
like that but this was really cheap oh
by the way this was maybe around three
to four dollars and I'd say this was
maybe two to three dollars so the
packaging is just adorable so I just had
to try it out so you know how I am with
lip gloss people so anyway um couple
other things I got I was at Walgreens
this is this is
while ago this is this Hall is
definitely taking up like a few
different trips but I was there and they
had buy-one-get-one-free on the lip
products and I was gonna try you know
maybe a lipstick here and a lipgloss
there and then I thought wait a minute I
really like the colors stay lip glaze I
have had this one in the past the
lasting shimmer I don't know how many
videos I've shown this in but and how
many times people have asked what's that
on your lips and this is the stuff
chances are I mean not every time but
sometimes and so I thought you know I
love that texture
I love the staying power I'm gonna go
out and get a couple new mineral in
place isn't it was buy one get one free
so I was getting like one of these is
like eight bucks so I got one for
totally free so that's great
the two shades I got here you can see I
got one in perpetual plum so a nice plum
II kind of deeper red shade I really
like this I've used this I've used it
for work I've used it just as is I mean
it's just a nice deep shade plum
I feel like looks good on a lot of skin
tones if you aren't quite into bright
red and you know and that kind of thing
but you want a little deeper tone to
your lips try a plum shade I really like
that one and by far the star of that
little duo is the the eternal blossom
it's light pink it's not too pink though
you know I remember how I told you I
found the perfect pink lipstick a while
back and it was rimmel's lasting finish
and vintage this is like the perfect
pink gloss for me anyway and it is like
I said Revlon Colorstay in eternal
blossom and it's just a beautiful
beautiful light pink so if you're on the
lookout for a nice pink gloss this has a
hint both of these have a little bit of
shimmer to them not too much not chunks
of glitter or anything like that but
they just look nice side by side I just
kind of like sitting them there together
and I love the shape of the tube -
anyway I'm moving on
I got myself a little I makeup remover
from wet-and-wild
this was selling for like a dollar
ninety-nine and I was like the reason
why I got this I have some eye makeup
remover that I really like but the
bottle is kind of big it's the Rimmel
it's the Rimmel gentle eye makeup
remover but I don't really like to
travel with this thing and I get kind of
scared that that little flip top is
gonna come open in my travel bag and get
eye makeup remover everywhere so I know
it's a big concerns in my life right no
I'm just kidding but anyway I don't
really want to travel with that so I
thought if I find a smaller eye makeup
remover I'm gonna get it and I found
this from wet-and-wild it's kind of it's
pretty little if you compare the size
it's not as big it's got a screw on lid
so I feel kind of confident with that
haven't tried it so I cannot rate it and
at all in terms of how effective it is
but it is oil free so I just thought you
know this will be good enough for me to
throw in my bag when a few q-tips to
travel with and it's small enough to not
get in the way too much so and then
separate occasion another BOGO at
Walgreens on rebel stuff and you know
how I like the lasting finish lipsticks
I mean I just think the lasting finished
stuff overall I haven't tried they're a
little powder with the little one this
is my philosophy stuff but you know the
powder was kind of like that this is
philosophy but I haven't tried that but
I mean the lasting finish foundation the
lasting finish lipstick love those love
them so much and I got a new lipstick
that I have on now it is in metallic
shimmer I had another one called
metallic seduction but this one is an
italic shimmer and it's really just an
all-purpose shade it's like I'm it's not
too red it's got a little bit of shimmer
to it like a little bit of that metallic
feel but not too much this is the type
of color that I could feel like I could
toss out to anybody and say this will
make your lips look better this will
brighten your face up you know it's just
got a little hints of mauve pink red
um a nice like slightly shimmery frosty
tone to it I just can't see this really
looking bad on anyone I guess you'd say
I mean it's just it's not over the top
bright not too dark just right in the
middle and a nice warm shade so that is
again metallic shimmer and then I was
looking for a new lip liner I've got a
red kick-ass lip liner in it's the
Rimmel exaggerate and ravish I've talked
about this numerous times great red lip
liner love it and a lot of my other ones
are either like nude or kind of the
barely show up kind and I just wanted a
pink one that I could use with my pink
lipsticks when I didn't want to you know
use the red and I didn't want to use
totally nude and so I just got a light
pink this is an East End snob which kind
of struck me funny because East End snob
in the gloss is like a total like
whitish nude and then this is pink so
that was kind of weird but whatever and
if I swatch it for you you can see it's
just a light pink so basically just kind
of one of those things like oh I need a
pink lip liner so a good one like not
really a major groundbreaking purchase
but anyway um that's my haul guys I hope
you enjoyed it if you have any questions
on any of these products or you really
want to see a review or something more
