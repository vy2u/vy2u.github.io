today and this is going to be the part
one so drugstore stuff a lot of cool new
things from hard candy
NYC wet and wild couple new skincare
items as well and then probably in my
next video I will share a haul of some
of the different new high-end items a
lot of different pallets both eye and
face type things so I'm really excited
to share that with you if there really
is a lot of stuff lots of cool new
things so I'm gonna jump in and start
talking about some of the new hard candy
things I picked up and hard candy is
available exclusively at Walmart you can
browse the line online but ultimately I
think the only place you can buy it is
Walmart so I got this glamoflage
invisible camouflage foundation
mentioned this in my contouring video
where I reviewed the NYX highlight and
contour palette and I got a lot of
compliments on just my overall base
makeup and this was what I was wearing
underneath all the contouring stuff and
I actually had this foundation in the
shade fair so the whole line seems to
run a little bit dark I think there
might have even been a shade lighter
than this but I'm not normally one who
is buying foundations and fair so
everything's running a little dark it
does have a pump and it's taken me
awhile to realize that I don't need a
full pump with this because it spreads
so well and it really really is a
lightweight feel so much more
lightweight than what I was expecting
because if you've tried the regular
glamoflage concealer not the glamoflage
light in the double-ended stick but the
glamoflage in the squeezy tube that is a
really really full-coverage heavy duty
concealer so I was kind of expecting the
foundation to be the same way but it's
so light it's it spreads so well if
you've tried the Estee Lauder Double
Wear maximum coverage foundation the one
I used in the melasma video
that's crazy full coverage but it
spreads so nicely this really reminds me
of that kind of blend ability spread
ability over the skin but it's a lighter
weight feel and it says a transforming
liquid powder foundation that absorbs
oil camouflages imperfections and
delivers a long-lasting velvet finish I
wouldn't go as far to say
that I feel it going actually liquid to
powder but it does just have that
velvety softness and really nice just
ability to spread across the skin so I
would say half a pump is probably what I
need to go all over my skin and I would
call this like a medium to full coverage
because I do think you can add a little
more and build it somewhat but it
doesn't take a lot it has surprisingly
good coverage for its thinnest this is
so I'm kind of loving this and I
wouldn't say it's a totally matte finish
either it's kind of a semi matte type
natural finish I'm just so enjoying this
I love the way it makes my skin Loni to
pay more attention to the staying power
I feel like it's been good but I
definitely need to keep a closer eye on
that for review purposes the other thing
from hard candy that's new is the sheer
envy eye brightening concealer so this
is a little concealer pen type thing and
I got the shade light in this and for me
it's not super brightening in this shade
I would say light is more of a skin tone
match for me so I don't feel like I'm
really taking advantage of a lot of the
brightening benefits that this product
claims to have because it says ten
Beauty benefits and one reduces
puffiness diffuses shadows softens
wrinkles even skin tone eliminates dark
circles some of these kind of could
overlap like it diffuses shadows and
eliminates dark circles but whatever
blurs lines brightens conceals corrects
lifts to me this seems really average
like it's a lightweight concealer I like
the texture of it but it's just not
packing in enough coverage for me I
really don't think it eliminates my dark
circles it's the kind of thing I'd need
to use in conjunction with a fuller
coverage concealer so not too cracked up
about that now this thing I was so on
the fence like I don't know how long I
stood in front of this product thinking
should I try it should I not it's the
sheer envy conceal and correct palette
now hard-candy when they first came into
Walmart stores years ago they came out
with a palette that had this exact same
amount of shades it was three skin tone
shades and three like color correcting
shades and they were all little circles
I think I probably have a picture of
this on my blog so I'll pop it up if I
find it but I found the consistency of
them to be
really thin kind of greasy and as a
result really lacked coverage for me
so I saw this and I thought surely
surely they have improved the texture
right like they've come back with
something that can really cover up and
sadly I don't find that to be the case
with these products they're still thin
they're still what I would describe as
kind of a greasy texture for a concealer
and well I get very light coverage with
these it's not enough to do what I want
a concealer to do you know so I have
this palette in the shade light/medium
and there's this little overlay it says
like the yellow corrects dark circles
and blue undertone redness relief for
the green and then the lilac or the kind
of I guess it looks a little pink on
screen but that's lilac and it brightens
and neutralizes yellow undertone and
then it says mix and match these skin
tone shades to conceal I will say that
these color correcting once I have a
little bit better texture you know it's
a little bit thicker and they have just
a little more pigment to them but then
these just feel so so thin I haven't
seen a little circular palette in
Walmart for quite a while and so I think
they brought it back repackaged it and
unfortunately didn't improve the actual
product inside real quick while we're on
the topic of these concealer type
products a really good thin consistency
concealer from the drugstore that just
it does a great job for as thin and
lightweight as it is is the maybelline
instant age rewind eraser I picked up
another one of these I got it in the
shade brightener I've had fair for a
while and I'm getting pretty low on it
and I've had this brightener before but
it broke on me so I just thought I'd try
the brightener again and I was just
reminded you know using this past few
days how great this is and I think a lot
of people you know might see this and
think okay a lightweight concealer type
product that's not going to look too
heavy on the under eyes but honestly
this is lightweight but it packs in way
way more coverage back to hard candy now
and a product I saw and it was like I
don't know the heavens opened up and the
Angels just went oh when I saw this
blush in the store god I thought this is
so beautiful it is the glow all the way
baked ombre
blush and this is in the shade sunburst
I had a picture of this actually up on
my blog with a little face of the day
and I've been experimenting with this
one quite a bit lately so look how how
beautifully those two shades just kind
of fade one into the next this bright
pink into that pearly highlight so the
question here would have to be is this
as good on the face as it looks in the
compact because that just looks
absolutely delightful to me and a hard
candy has a history with me anyway of
having great baked products I like the
baked blushes the baked highlight or
bronzer shade and tea key which is a
really nice highlight and the baked
eyeshadow duos are awesome so I was
prepared for this to be great when I
first touched it I thought okay it seems
a little dry to me so while it still
seems kind of bright and a swatch just
the texture the feel of it just seemed a
little dry and so I wasn't expecting it
to translate into much color on the
cheeks but oh boy watch out this is
sneaky it will show up on your cheeks in
a big way and in a pretty bright way too
I am wearing this right here it's really
glowy and it's definitely like a
bubblegum e-type pink color I don't know
that it would be everyone's cup of tea
for a blush especially if you veer more
towards the neutral tones or the peachy
colors this is really pink and very cool
and you can see it's not glittery at all
there's no sparkle in the product but it
does have a lot of glow coming off of it
so if that's something you try to stay
away from if you prefer matte blushes
you're not gonna like this extremely
glowy look particularly if you want to
layer the highlight over the blush I
like this product I just don't know that
it would be everyone's cup of tea for as
bright and glowy as it is I just can't
get happy with my hair today sorry keep
moving it around but the last thing here
from hard candy is this fierce effects
daring lip gloss I was wearing this in
my last video and this is whoa make me
blush I thought the name wasn't on there
but it actually is it's 963 it's really
like a soft warm pink very glossy gloss
love the applicator with the little
brush tip and it's surprisingly opaque
I really don't see any of my natural lip
color showing through it I can see a lot
of people liking this kind of tone very
shiny I'm pretty sure the display said
something about this being like argan
oil infused he had some really nice
shades so I would consider checking out
more of these but this shade in
particular really really super wearable
let's transition to some different lip
products now but these are from NYC just
found these right in there with the
regular NYC display and these are called
smooch proof liquid lip stain so they're
packaged just like a lip gloss would be
and I feel like we're starting to see
this trend now of you know the lip
stains used to be kind of confined to
that marker style format and now we're
seeing them in this more liquidy style
with a wand applicator and some liquidy
stains like you might think about
benefits Benetint you know it's just
like a totally transparent red tinted
stain but as you can see with this here
on the applicator this is creamy and
then you put it on your lips and you've
got still a stained effect so I'm
wearing this one right now and there's
not even a number or a name on this I'm
pretty sure this one's called on
everyone's lips this bright red I don't
remember the name of it but you'll see
it in the lineup it's like the fire
engine red I do like it and I find it to
be more opaque and kind of colorful than
some of the marker type stains that are
out there and you can build up the color
more easily with something like this you
just can feel more product going on then
if it's of this would be you know it
doesn't like kiss off onto your hand or
anything once it's dry it's matte you
know if you like matte finishes that
would be a good thing but if your lips
are dry which mine kind of are and
you're looking up pretty close at this
you will see some of the cracks and
dryness it's just the kind of thing you
should expect when you're dealing with a
non moisturizing just purely staining
type lip product see the texture of this
going on it's like a creamy stain type
product and then it dries down to not
have any shine and then let's swatch
this red one I have not used this yet oh
wow this is a really like orange --red
check that out so bright yikes here's
something to be aware of with this red
one I just wiped off what I just
and you can see this more neutral one
like there's that stain but look at this
it's a pinky stain that's being being
left behind on this bright red and it
was not at all that pink you know it was
really an orange II red so that's kind
of a bummer and something to watch out
for with some of these stains and you
can't know it until you try it some of
them don't always stay true to the
original color once they actually stain
your lips something awesome from NYC
like a total shocker I was not expecting
this to be so good this BB smooth skin
radiance perfecting powder I have it in
naturally beige oh my goodness the
texture of this powder is so nice so
creamy pigmented packs on some coverage
I'm not really sure why BB is thrown
into the title but this feels amazing
seriously a great silky smooth such a
soft powder like I continue to rub my
fingers together where I had that and my
skin just feels soft I've got this on
today on top of this foundation just
lightly I like to sweep this on with the
elf complexion brush just get a little
bit on there you can see the brush picks
up quite a bit so tap off some excess it
definitely adds some coverage it
mattifies but it doesn't look too chalky
I mean just a really surprisingly great
texture on that powder a few things in
the makeup world make me as happy as
when I come up with something that's so
low cost and so awesome I love that
gonna talk wet and wild for a minute one
thing I picked up I have not yet tried
but I wanted to branch out and try a few
new makeup removal things because I was
thinking after doing my skincare video I
have used those equate face wash cloths
so much occasionally maybe trying a
different thing here there and I saw
these wet and wild under the sheets 25
makeup remover towelettes packaged here
and I thought you know what if I just
give those who go and if they don't work
I can use them you know to remove
swatches and stuff that I'm doing for
videos there we're only like $2.99 and
so I thought well if they turn out to be
awesome that's a great deal but I don't
know I have not used him yet I found him
at Walgreens so we'll test those out the
other new wet and wild things these were
in a special
limited-edition display I can't remember
the name of the collection but these six
pan powder eyeshadow palettes I have
them in California roll and what's this
one vinyl collection I figured a lot of
people would be interested in the
neutrals so that's why I picked that up
but I really like the look of these
shades in this palette I also wanted to
get this so I could compare it to
comfort zone because it has some kind of
wet and wild comfort zone ish type
shades in there but all in all the
textures aren't quite as good like I
used it for my look today I like the
look but it wasn't as great to work with
as the comfort zone palette and for this
look by the way I use these two shades
on the lid I used a little bit of this
in the crease and kind of buffed it out
up above the crease somewhat and then I
used an olive eyeliner down here and
topped it off with more of that olive
shade I found this shade to be pretty
glarry and flaky and this one was kind
of flaky as well but the olive shade was
pretty nice here are the swatches you
know they're not that bad to work with
they're just not what I was expecting
they're not an identical texture to you
know walking on eggshells comfort zone
all those other regular collection wet
and wild palettes basically if you've
already got a lot of neutral palettes I
wouldn't like scour every Walgreens
until you found this because it's not
above and beyond now this is California
roll I got this for the matte peach and
the matte red I just thought those you
know could have a lot of potential if
they're really nicely pigmented those
mats
actually they swatch pretty well I think
that's gonna be a fun one to experiment
with but I can't say much about
application just yet because I haven't
used this one on my eyes lastly just a
couple of skincare items I wanted to
talk about I recently did my whole
skincare routine video and that's still
you know my routine but I didn't mention
using a face scrub there and that's
because I do occasionally use face
scrubs but it's not really a super
frequent part of the routine and I
really needed a new one I had recently
used up a little size of a st. Ives I
think it was called the green tea scrub
and so I got a new one from st. Ives and
this is the
even in bright pink lemon and mandarin
orange scrub doesn't that just sound
great and it really does smell good so
I'm excited to use that I haven't tried
it yet I didn't even notice this when I
was picking it up but it has this little
thing on the back that says exfoliation
factor and this is in the moderate
category another thing that I finally
finally found that it probably isn't
going to replace my Regenerist night
cream that I've been using but I just
want to try it I want to see how this
goes
it's the ultralift miracle sleeping
cream anti age plus anti fatigue night
cream from Garnier so it looks like this
I really like the packaging that
dark-blue says with essential oil and
hyaluronic acid which I know hyaluronic
acid isn't a lot of the CeraVe products
that I like says first morning hydrates
and brightens and over time reduces
wrinkles and fights signs of fatigue I
thought this would be a fun thing to you
know try and put to the test lord knows
I'm dealing with some fatigue these days
with baby and all and trying to get
everything done that I want to do it
says every night apply a pearl sized
amount on clean skin so on the nights I
use this I wouldn't put this like on top
of my other moisturizers or serums I
would use this on its own but it's just
funny because garden ape always seems to
put some really like major claims and
their stuff like miracle sleeping cream
is it gonna be a miracle I don't know
I'll have to try it and find out oh gosh
I feel like I've been talking forever in
this whole video I'm thinking is it
still light outside wow thank you for
watching I hope you enjoyed this little
discussion on some new drugstore
products and I will again have my
high-end haul coming for you soon that's
going to include some new pallet type
things that I can't wait to share with
you so that is it thank you guys I'll
see you later
