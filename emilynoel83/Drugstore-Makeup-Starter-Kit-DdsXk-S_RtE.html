this video because I think this is going
to answer a lot of questions all in one
video because I get so many questions
about drugstore makeup and just a lot of
individual questions here and there what
mascara do you recommend what's the best
I shadow this or that and so I thought
how about a drugstore makeup starter kit
so this is kind of like a compilation of
all-star products from the drugstore I'm
going to take you through the full face
routine and you're going to actually see
these products in action everything I
talked about is on my face right now
just felt like this is something that
people who have never worn makeup before
can benefit from or maybe it's been you
know decades since you've worn makeup
last and you know you're going to buy it
from the drugstore maybe you don't want
to spend department store prices and I
know the feeling when you walk in and
you feel kind of overwhelmed you know by
all the options and in a drugstore
there's not really anybody there to help
you make the decisions
so hopefully this can be helpful to
maybe even if you don't need the full
routine that just you know maybe you're
looking for an eye product suggestion or
a lip or something like that you know
this can kind of steer you in the right
direction
and I'm using minimal brushes for this
video I'm using two face brushes a
powder brush and a blush brush and for
eyes I'm just using a crease brush a
fluffy crease brush and a pencil brush
so here we go a primer there's a lot of
buzz about primers and frankly I think
primers can be valuable for really
getting the surface of your skin evened
out for your foundation so one that I
really love that I know I talked about
in my recent Rimmel video is Rimmel fix
and perfect Pro this is a newer primer I
think it's definitely an improvement on
the original fix and perfect and it just
leaves everything so smooth we're
talking about foundation there are
several that I really like from the
drugs I love maybelline superstay 24
hour I think that's a great long wearing
foundation and that's what I'm
demonstrating in this video it's got a
pretty good shade range and it just
lasts a really long time and I think
it's workable for a lot of skin tither
one that I think is great for a lot of
skin types is Rimmel lasting finish
although some really oily folks have
told me that they really need to set
this with some powder or else it became
a little too oily so maybe if you're
super oily there is an option for you as
well and I love the Revlon Colorstay for
combo to oily skin this is one of those
foundations if you're getting really
oily this is going to be that suit of
armour for your face almost throughout
the day if you want the most natural
finish I like using a damp sponge with
that one and if you do want just a super
natural finished foundation not too much
coverage really natural appearance and
if you've got great skin this is just
going to make your skin look even better
I think it's Neutrogena healthy skin and
yeah I'll use that on some good skin
days and really look radiant after I've
got that foundation on I love this
Revlon Photoready concealer stick it's
probably the most unique texture I've
found for a stick concealer most of the
time I would say you know they're too
dry but this really glides on the skin
and um it goes on in sort of a thin
layer and you go to blend it in with
your fingers and really press it into
the skin the warmth of your finger will
really kind of react with this product
and allow it to give you some nice
coverage for the under eye area for
great powder I have been a fan of
L'Oreal True Match for years and I
actually had run out a while ago
recently repurchased but this is one of
those powders where if you wanted to
skip foundation in
tirely this is a powder with some
coverage to it it's really smooth I
don't feel like it's too thick just
maybe blotted over my t-zone a little
bit just to make sure that that area is
kind of under control where the oil is
concerned there is one of those things
maybe it's something you don't deem as
an important part of your own routine
and that's fine but I love using bronze
this one is from NYC it's called sunny
it's lasted me a long long time and it's
matte I would say try to find a good
matte bronze you just take this all over
your face and you can also use this to
contour as well for blush a brand that's
really impressed me over the past year
has been the Milani baked blush is
because they remind me a whole lot of
the laura geller baked blushes which are
really great so they're often like a
little more complex where the shades are
concerned this shade is rose deorro but
they have lots of great colors and
they're usually you know they've got
some sort of other shade almost blended
throughout to give it a really
interesting look and this gives just a
really nice kind of peachy golden glow
to the cheek you feared highlighters for
the fact that they're shimmery this I
have on in a lot of places on my face
and it goes on really well and this is
the Physicians Formula happy booster and
this is I believe the translucent but it
I mean it just gives if I were to swatch
it on my finger see how it's just
lightly pearly there's no real flexible
like I could not find glitter in this
product so I think that makes it really
wearable and you can go light dusting
all over kind of target it like I did on
cheekbones and you know brow bones and
stuff like that or eyes I think a primer
is really important because it makes the
most out of any shadow you choose and
one that I think is great is from NYX
and it's the HDI primer and I like this
because not only does it give just the
right texture to the lids to kind of
accept those powders and make them stand
out more but it kind of has a little bit
of effect on any discoloration you may
have without taking them up with
concealers and foundations and things
like that I just use the base on my
eyelids then a great brand of shadow
altogether I think are the wet and wild
eyes
shadows I mean you're not really going
to find a lot of shadows from the
drugstore that had this much punch and
just a great color selection and an
amazing price so I really recommend you
know across the board the different
collections or the different colors they
have but silent treatment is great for
like my basic everyday look so I thought
that was what I would show you today the
shade labeled eyelid which is a great
kind of greyish taupe and took that all
over my lid and then I took the peachy
kind of brow bone shade and just took
that all over the brow bone going back
to that sponge tip applicator uhm just
went into the darkest shade and sort of
just darkened up the outer half of my
lid as you can see blending is not
difficult with this it you don't have to
have you know the most expensive tool in
the world to blend with however I do
like to take a pencil brush with that
darkest shade and kind of go under the
eye just a little bit for kind of a
smudged out lower liner I think this is
a really wearable kit and you could go
very dramatic with that darkest shade
great eyeliner from the drugstore that
really does last a long time it's kind
of competing with I think some of the
great high-end long wearing liners like
Urban Decay 24/7 but it's the Maybelline
master drama liners they don't come in a
huge range of shades but the black is a
nice classic color and I just use that
along my upper lash line this is
definitely something you can use in your
waterline as well or you can smudge it
down below you've got a little time to
smudge it out like you could smudge it
out with your finger or a q-tip before
it kind of sets and lasts for you and if
you are looking for a liquid liner I
didn't use one in this video but Revlon
Colorstay is a great standard liquid
liner that I like to use sometimes on my
upper lash line everybody wants a great
mascara and yet it's really hard to
please everybody when it comes to
mascara because I think we all have
different lash types and different
preferences but one that I think is just
great and one that has really created a
high standard for me as I have been
testing a lot of mascaras lately has
been the Almay one coat nourishing
mascara triple effect and this is what
I've liked for a really long time
because as you can see it creates length
that creates volume it's got a
that is kind of like two brushes in one
because one end is short bristles and
one end is kind of longer bristles and
it's a nice dry formula that builds on
itself nicely and I feel like it you can
kind of keep going over it and and
really sculpt the lashes you want
without the clump
I only for brows product that I think is
one of the best from the drugstore is
the maybelline define a brow pencil and
one of the reasons why I like it is
because it's just so tiny and it can
really help you create those hair like
strokes or in my case you know I'm not
trying to really reconstruct a brow but
just fill in like a couple places I have
a little scar on this side so this kind
of helps me fill that in making it look
natural I am a huge fan of a jumbo lip
pencil and NYX probably does it best
when it comes to the drugstore and this
shade that I used is called pecan but um
or pecan whichever you prefer but they
have a wide color selection so you don't
just have to use this one but as you can
see it's a large pencil and what I like
about a jumbo pencil is it gives you the
control of a lip liner but the coverage
kind of of a lipstick it's just very
quick to you like that you could use
that alone if you wanted to but just for
the sake of demonstration and forgetting
to those must have starter kit items I
also love the Rimmel moisture and new
lipsticks I think they have a good blend
of nudes colors creams shimmers you know
they kind of run the gamut this one that
I use today is called dusty rose I think
it's kind of a pretty fall mauve type
shade so I use that and then a really
great drugstore lipgloss it's not
limited to this particular gloss but I
do love
Super Lustrous lipglosses
the one I have is in the one I used is
called foiled and it's just the perfect
gloss to put in the center of your lower
lip to create some added fullness and it
looks great on its own for a new glyph I
find these glasses are really opaque so
you get color whatever color you expect
to get you know from what you look at in
the tube is what you will see on your
lips so I love that so that sums up my
broke store starter kit um I hope this
was helpful to those of you who are just
looking for some direction when you get
into the drugstore and wondering what
products to look for again you guys know
I love so many drugstore products it's
not just limited to just trying to keep
beginners in mind and also just some
products that I think a really user
friendly you know easy to use and that
have good staying power and will give
you not only a pretty look but a look
that can last you throughout the day so
thank you so much for watching this
video I'm so grateful for those of you
who have told me you know I passed your
videos along with my friend or my mom or
my sister or you know anybody who wants
just some more makeup advice because
that really means a lot to me and I love
making these videos and I will continue
to do so but I just am thrilled with the
response and I'm just so happy that you
guys appreciate the info enough to share
it with your friends so have a great day
