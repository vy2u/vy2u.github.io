to be about a real hot topic in makeup
that has been a hot topic for some time
now and it's all those naked and nude
eyeshadow palettes I mean we all love
the first Naked palette when that came
out and then you know we had the
wonderful Naked 2 that recently came our
way
I mean two-faced has the natural eye
palette and different ones and there's
just a lot of this trend going on now
you know these super natural eye kits
that can give you you know a naked eye
look or then give you something as you
can see here a little more smoky and
dramatic but it's all about neutral
shadows I want to touch on in this video
is really the drugstore side of things
and some of those different palettes
that have come out whether they're
specifically labeled you know naked or
nude or whatever but those palettes that
kind of follow the same theory as
palettes likethey not really out to just
give you a big list of dupes in this
video but to just tell you about some
palettes that are great in their own
right first one I want to mention is the
nude eyes palette from Physicians
Formula is this not the cutest package
came out not too long ago it was a line
of different sort of themed eye looks
from Physicians Formula in their shimmer
strips line and I had been looking for
the nude one and it was out of stock
almost anywhere I went and then when I
found it I was like oh my gosh this is
so adorable this reminds me of packaging
on I think a two-faced product I got
years ago color wise and just in terms
of the tone here it reminds me a little
bit of The Naked 2 palette but I have
been using this so much lately I used it
today on my eyes just kind of using some
of these taupe colors and I've had it on
at least a couple of times in my in alia
Ward's videos and I have gotten a lot of
questions you know what is that look you
got going on because this is a nice
palette to get not an outwardly brown
neutral look but more of taupe sand
grays and you've also got a nice black
here now something I should point out is
that all of these shades kind of have
that pearly shimmery look to them and I
must say I'm most impressed by this
end of the pallet just in terms of
pigmentation although some of these can
be great little brightening shadows as
you can see what I've got here you know
right on the inner part of the eye and
this is lasted all day this is an all
day look here it really is just a cute
great neutral basic palette from the
drugstore another palette that's kind of
directly inspired I think by the naked
palettes is the NYX butt naked eyes and
I've had this one for a little while and
I just couldn't wait to talk about it
with you because I think this is a
really cool palette and I think if
you're into neutrals and you're into
neutrals that are more on the cool side
again a little more naked too you know
we're not talking lots of browns here
but this is a really nice palette and
this does give you the nice mix of matte
and shimmer a nice kind of black or deep
deep charcoal it sits right there on the
border but that's a great color you did
get a plum in a really cool dark brown
but a lot of what you're getting are
kind of mid-tone pretty shimmery shades
this kind of peachy gold is just
gorgeous and then some Gray's some
highlight shades getting on 15 shadows
here so that's quite a bit and a nice
big mirror as well but then this palette
is one of those that gives you something
more and this I really was excited about
too you're getting four blushes and
let's see kind of like a couple of
bronzers / a definite highlight here
this you know kind of like a light
bronzer and a deeper bronzer but these
are great too because I love the NYX
blushes and these are just all about you
know the color you're going to get
really super soft looks with this you're
going to get really dramatic looks with
it as well so that's another recommended
Palli some other palettes that I wanted
to mention are not necessarily they
don't have that new door naked name to
them but they're palace' just come
across in trying different eyeshadows
and I think they're worth a mention is
the Maybelline eye studio color
explosion and this one is in caffeine
rush this is such a great palette I've
blogged about the very neutral goes with
any
you're wearing you know this is really
great for that it's all shimmery here
these kind of to the color design
palettes from Lancome it reminds me a
lot of those textures and the
pigmentation is really rich and and
pretty you're looking for a way to kind
of make your lids pop with some shine
and really make them stand out without
using color I think this is a nice way
to accent your eyes want to talk about
covergirl here first well the ones I've
talked about so far have been kind of
cool they kind of remind me of the
scheme that's going on like in The Naked
2 The Naked 1 or the original Naked
palette seems to have more warm Browns
and bronzy tones like that so I've got a
few that kind of remind me of that one
has been a favorite palette of mine for
a long time and it's the covergirl trio
in golden sunset and I was interested to
learn that for the Golden Globes this is
the eye shadow Sofia Vergara was wearing
and her eyes lit gorgeous but she is a
covergirl spokeswoman now and all her
stuff the makeup artist on a blog I was
reading it was all listed out what she
had on don't know if you can tell what
that Center shade is but it's a it's
actually this same color here which is
called golden sunrise I think that's
kind of a different more bronzy twist if
you love the bronze II shades if you
want to keep it a little more cool
shimmering sands I know I've talked
about this is a great kind of beginner
palette they're all shimmery
and they're all rather light this pink
is just a great great highlight shade
but that's a nice one to have as well if
that's sort of the route you want to go
and another one is a country woods and I
don't hear this one talked about quite
as much but this is going to be also you
know lighter shades your your look is
not going to be deep dark and intense
with this by any means but I love these
palettes because I like the quality of
these covergirl shadows from wet and
wild you might put several different
palettes into this category but one that
I love is walking on eggshells again
nude eyes yes definitely you can get
that here because the the deepest shade
is going to give you like the most
subtle crease it's just it's really nice
when you're wanting a
supernatural look and I mean you're not
wanting to mess around with a whole
pallet full I mean that's actually a
really nice little trio there and I've
actually duped these two each one of
these two am Akshay before with the
exception of the next one I mean we're
talking about a lot of shimmery shades
from these different drugstore palettes
but I do want to point out this really
great palette from Elle and it is one of
their 36 palettes and it actually has a
really nice variety and this could give
you just about any look you want I mean
this is probably one of my favorite now
this is my favorite elf eyeshadow
product that's out there I so love the
variety they've got in here I mean this
is giving you a straight up row of kind
of like rosy warm shades like that right
here but um you've also got your Browns
and your charcoals and a row of really
nice deep colors there at the bottom and
then a variety of highlights here at the
top and I know I've talked about well
sometimes you get these big palettes
from elf and they can be a little bit
you know hit and miss but I love so many
of these colors we wanted to set out and
recreate a Naked palette look that
you've seen someone do I think if you
get this palette I think it would find
what you need here most likely I mean
let's give them credit I mean the shades
in these urban decay palettes these
two-faced pallets a lot of these
high-end things they've got gorgeous
colors and I'm not trying to take
anything away from that but I'm just
saying if you're sir if you're trying to
look through your drugstore and think
what can I find that's kind of along
those same lines there's actually a lot
out there that's that's in that same
color family that same neutral eye look
and like I said earlier it's not going
out of style any time soon so um thank
you so much for watching let me know if
you've got any other suggestions for
people who are looking for some
drugstore alternatives I would love to
hear about them so thank you so much for
watching
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
