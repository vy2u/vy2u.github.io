for this video hope you're all having a
wonderful day I just wanted to run you
through a quick little technique here
that I use for nude lips I actually use
a lot of different techniques but this
is just something I've been doing lately
and a look that I've been enjoying to
really make your lips look nice and full
and also sort of a neutrally nude lip
look that doesn't completely erase your
lips from your face you know I feel like
it's it's glossy it's shiny it's full
and it still manages to kind of bring
out the rest of the features on your
face so I'm just gonna go ahead and show
you how to get started with that if you
feel like your lips are a little bit dry
maybe you haven't moisturized them with
any sort of lip balm in a while go ahead
and put some on I'm using just some soft
lips anything will work here I like the
UH sugar cookie
scent it smells really good but just put
that on you know nothing real fancy
there next I'm going to take a nude
colored lip liner I'm using the one
thousand kisses stay on lip pencil from
Rimmel and the shade is 49 natural and
so I'm just gonna be lining my lips with
that and this is very close to the
natural shade of my lips only just a
little bit deeper and it's just
definitely you know like a neutral
straight-up neutral color there's you
know real pink to this or any you know
distinct shade whatsoever so I just go
over until fill in my whole mouth with
that it glides on really easy since we
just did the lip balm and if you like
more of the matte look you know you
could leave that there then I'm going to
top that off with a matte nude lipstick
I'm using the Revlon matte in nude
attitude so this is the type of shade
that will kind of erase your lips and
what I'm doing is actually not going all
the way to the outer edge of my lips it
might look like I am but I'm leaving a
little bit of space there because I
don't want to completely lose my lip
line and it's not that I have a darker
line necessarily on the outside because
these are pretty close to the same shade
but it's just that
this is a teeny bit lighter now I'm
going to go over that with a lip gloss
I'm using foiled it's one of the Revlon
Super Lustrous lip glosses and I really
like these this is nice and light and
shimmery kind of a very very light
frosty beige and go over everything like
that and this is just so reflective I
love that about this lip gloss and so
now you've got a nice shiny pout there
and the next thing you want to do is
kind of enhance the fullness around your
lip spike situating your Cupid's bow
area that's right up here so for that
you can use a face highlighter or just
like a shimmery light colored shadow
this is like a mineral sheers duo from
Neutrogena and it comes with a really
really light shimmery shade there any
brand anything will do
I just get a little bit on my finger and
then see how I'm putting it right there
and you could use a q-tip here but I'm
highlighting that upper border where my
lip meets like my my where my actual
lips meet the upper lip area you know
what I mean so now that that's standing
out a little bit that's making the whole
area look like it protrudes a little bit
more and then use a little bit of that
shimmer right there in the bottom of
your lower lip I'm just gonna add to
fullness there and then just to redefine
the top part a little bit I'm taking my
liner and Guice going right over the lip
part there you can see everything is
nice and highlighted there but you still
got your the shape of your lip standing
out so I just have really been liking
this look for a nude lip that like I
said it's some of you might not even
think it's totally nude because I mean
it doesn't look like the erase lip look
but it's a very kind of light beige
natural lip look and it's easy to wear
but using all drugstore products I
recommend the products I use but
obviously you can use whatever you
prefer you can go a little bit darker
than this with the gloss
and get you know more of a deeper almost
brownish toned look if you wanted it but
I just wanted to pass that along to you
