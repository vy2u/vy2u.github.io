about stains today in this dead do poor
dream product video I'm going to be
seeing if these NYC lavada 'qs by demi
lip and cheek tints are a good
alternative to the tints and stains and
whatnot from benefit I got the full line
of these at Walmart there are four and I
think I overlooked them at first when I
got that demi lovato eyeshadow palette
cuz at a glance I must have just thought
these were nail polishes but they are
lip and cheek stains which makes them
even more interesting to me these from
NYC are only 399 apiece and Benetint for
example full size is $30 you're getting
0.27 fluid ounces with the NYC and point
four fluid ounces with the benefit
products so you are getting a little bit
more there but I mean it's still a huge
price difference I think to go from
about four dollars to thirty so from the
NYC livadas line you've got cheeky
strawberry cheeky berry cheeky pink
which looks kind of different from the
rest it's very bright and then cheeky
red and characteristic that these do all
share is that they look just like clear
liquids they like kool-aid or something
can totally see through the bottle
there's nothing creamy about these and
with the benefit products and you've got
Benetint which is that way as well it's
obviously got that reddish tint but it's
not creamy but then the other three from
benefits line lollitint posy tint and
cha-cha tint these all appear to be
creamy as you initially swatch them out
they have this kind of milkiness to them
but then once you blend them in and they
dry down they appear to stain just like
anything else whether it was clear or
creamy it's not going to have a
different look on the skin once it sets
so I've got I'm also watched out two by
two here on my arms so I'm just going to
take you through one at a time each one
and you'll see that you know some match
up more closely than others but that's
kind of what these videos are all about
you know what's a dupe what falls short
what's maybe even better they're just a
couple of non color related factors to
get out of the way first
Benetint does have a scent it smells
kind of rosy I happen to love that but
that's not something that's duplicated
in the NYC versions those seem to be
completely on
scented also just as far as staying
power the way these where is one of them
a more heavy-duty stain than the other I
feel like they're very similar in that
way I've been very careful over the last
few days that I've been testing these to
apply like equal amounts of each product
and make sure I wasn't way over doing it
on one side and they seemed to last very
much the same way something to know
about these with each brand is that you
can increase both the color intensity
and I think the staying power just by
building them up and applying more and
if you're really unfamiliar with the
idea of liquid lip and cheek tints and
how to apply them and how they work I
will show you a little demo at the end
because I am doing a little
half-and-half thing as I typically do in
these videos but just to kind of go down
the swatches on my arm and compare shade
for shade first off talking about
Benetint
which is the reddish tint from benefits
line it actually seems to be the closest
to the cheeky strawberry shade benneton
gives you that sheer rosy wash of color
and I feel like the cheeky strawberry is
just a little bit warmer it's a little
bit more toward red and less toward pink
I wouldn't look at these and say that's
a total dupe but they are pretty close
next up we've got cha-cha tint from
benefit and this would be that kind of
peachy well more of like a corally pink
type stain and it does go on creamy at
first but then when you blend it out it
stains just like anything else on my arm
here and the one that is closest to that
is actually the cheeky red shade which
is very much an orange to me I think
it's full on like peachy orange so again
I don't think we have a full-on dupe
here but if you are looking for
something more oranjee in terms of a
stain you might check out cheeky red
don't expect it to be red got lolli tint
which is another one of those tints that
appears to be creamy from benefit when
you first put it on this is described as
a candy orchid tinted lip and cheek
stain so you blend that out and you've
got kind of like a soft berry stain and
the closest thing to that is the one
called cheeky berry from the NYC line
and I do feel like these are so so
similar they've just got the very same
amount of pink in there the same amount
of depth and this would be one of my
favorites this cheeky berry I love that
color
and then finally we've got posy tint
from benefit and this is going to be
your pink stain and I'm comparing that
to cheeky pink from NYC and i've
swatched them both and I do think these
are nearly identical as well I think
cheeky pink from NYC actually has the
potential to go even brighter you really
kind of have to pace yourself or you
will end up with full-on hot pink with
that shape now what is on my face do we
have any guesses I did one brand on each
cheek and one brand on each lip as well
so I'll let you know now I've got cheeky
berry on this side from NYC and so the
way I applied this I do a few quick
swipes on my cheek and I'm talking quick
because you want to have that brush
handy this is not a good time to lose
your brush or else those streaks will
stain on your cheeks that way so blend
it out real quick you could use your
finger but to me this is where my ELF
small stipple brush is a total MVP
because it blends it in so quickly so
easily I get the most even application
when I use a brush like that and then on
the other side I've got lolli tint which
is kind of the more berry looking stain
from benefit again you want to work
quickly swipe it on blend it out and
then on my lips I did the lolli tent on
my top lip and I didn't like mush my
lips together I kind of let that get set
and I did very cheeky berry
on the lower lip and I just think they
totally stained the same way again you
could build either of these colors up
make them more intense one word of
warning before I go if you're planning
to use anything I talked about on the
lips and I don't notice this happening
so much with anything creamy so take
lollitint posy tint and cha-cha tint
kind of out of the equation but Benetton
or any of the NYC stains if you're going
to use these on the lips I don't
recommend just taking this little you
know nail polish type brush out and
putting it directly on the lips because
it's instant bleeding for me like I
could see it just going right up and
feathering into any small line there
might be outside your lips you might not
even think your lips have a tendency of
doing that but this is just the nature
of these liquidy products and it goes
for Benetton or any of the NYC ones they
will just kind of drip
right up so don't apply too much at one
time I like to get a little bit off on
my finger and apply it that way or if
you want to keep your hands clean maybe
you could dab a little bit of this off
on a separate you know clean pallet use
a separate lip brush that isn't so
saturated in product as this brush would
be pick some up and go across your lips
with it that way that could help you but
you are going to notice some
instantaneous bleeding if you take it
right off the brush so again I do think
we have a couple of undeniable dupes the
cheeky berry for the lollitint and the
cheeky pink for the posy tint I think
those are just SuperDuper close no pun
intended there and the others the
Benetint and the cheeky strawberry are I
think pretty close the biggest
difference would be between the cha-cha
tint and the cheeky red which comes off
much more Orange I think if you maybe
never really experimented with liquid
stains before you may not want to drop
$30 on one so try one of these out give
it a go thank you guys so much for
watching if you've got any other
products you're wondering about as far
as is it a dupe or is it not let me know
in the comments section and I'll see you
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
