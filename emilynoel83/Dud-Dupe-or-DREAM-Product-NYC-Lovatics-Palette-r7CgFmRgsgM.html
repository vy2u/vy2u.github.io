very very casual around here right now
um but I just wanted to let you know I'm
kicking off a new series here on my
channel as I sit here I'm still kind of
formulating the exact name but I'm
thinking something like a dud dupe or
dream product dud duper dream I don't
know I can't really come up with that
last word in the phrase I'm trying to
come up with something good and catchy
but basically I want to look at products
that could potentially be seen as a dupe
of something we're not really sure if
they're a dupe I'll test it out and let
you know if it really matches up to that
higher cost product or maybe it's even
better or maybe it completely falls flat
but what prompted this for me were a all
the questions that I get asking whether
one product is a dupe of another product
and B I just think there's tons of
overlap on the market right now there
are so many things that come out that
are so similar to something that's
already out there it might be something
you already own so is the latest and
greatest thing worth your money that's
kind of what we're going to talk about
so the product at the focus of this
video is going to be this new NYC lavada
'kz by demi palette and it was so funny
I saw this in at Walmart and it was like
this was the only one left it was as if
the display had been rushed by people
because this was like upside down and
backwards like kind of cockeyed on the
Shelf and it looked like I don't know it
just been raided by people who had
picked up this palette so in case you
didn't know demi lovato is a
spokesperson for NYC New York color
cosmetics if you go to their website you
will see her all over the place in
various makeup looks and she's got her
name on this palette personally I feel
like the market is just flooded right
now with wannabe naked palettes and it
would have been cool to see this you
know be something with a different kind
of shade selection or just a different
tone overall to it but it is what it is
and I figured for five dollars that is
what it costs some of you might be
interested in exactly how similar it
might be to a Naked palette so it comes
with a couple of sponge tip applicator
xin here on the back it kind of assigns
each shade in here a number 1 through 12
and then it kind of tells you how you
can pair those shades together for
different looks Packaging is just kind
of that
lightweight design no mirror in there of
course and the formula of these shadows
actually I find it to be different from
like the individualized compacts that I
know it talks about a lot and I've
actually given some really good reviews
on those those are a product and NYC's
line that went from like one of the
worst things I've ever used shadow wise
and then they kind of reformulated and I
actually really like some of the ones
that I have with these there may be some
shades that are kind of closed and feel
and texture to those palettes but as a
whole I feel like they've really
softened up the formula a lot in order
to make it and translate onto the eyes a
little bit better so by that I mean when
you stick a brush into it they do kick
up quite a bit of powder but at the same
time I find them a little bit easier to
get that color to show up on your eyes
actually my friend David was here a few
days ago and we were doing a little
drugstore makeup shopping and that was
when I stumbled across this palette and
when he was doing my makeup the
following morning he used this and he
was actually rather impressed with some
of the different shades he was working
with I think he used a lot of this light
shade and some of these deeper ones as
well so from an Estee Lauder makeup
artists perspective he was pleasantly
surprised with the formula and I think
it was very different from anything he
had used from NYC before so what is this
a dupe of to me as I glanced at it I
think it's definitely trying to be like
the Urban Decay Naked the original Naked
1 palette and just looking at the
overall color scheme the pattern of
shades and I'm actually wearing the NYC
palette on one of my eyes and the Naked
palette on the other so you might just
think about which is which and I'll let
you know before the end of the video but
as you see these swatched out side by
side I think there are some very obvious
differences first off just looking at
the love Audax palette as a whole I
think it is a little bit cooler the
shades that went more toward the warm
side in the Naked palette were shades
that the NYC palette wasn't really able
to make a good dupe of but virgin and
sin those first couple of shades are
close naked and buck are the two kind of
light and medium matte shades in the
Naked palette and the potential dupe
shades in the NYC palette are in the
ballpark but not exactly on par with
those
in the NYC palette trying to be like
sidecar it's pretty but it's more of
like a rose gold as opposed to that
metallic taupe half baked in The Naked
palette is a very metallic gold and the
NYC palette couldn't quite get there
with that shade also I see a big
difference in smog but getting into the
darker shades these can really perform
similarly on the eyes even if they're
not the exact same finish that's what
I've found so the shade that is similar
to Dark Horse even though those aren't
exact shade dupes they can look really
similar on the eyes the same with the
toasted color oddly enough you know
those aren't dupes at all I think those
are very different colors but they can
kind of perform similarly on the eyes
and then hustle that shade has shimmer
in the Naked palette it's matte in the
lavaud expel it and then our last two
shades both of them have shimmer in the
Naked palette but your gunmetal shade
the one on the very end and the love
Audax palette is matte so if you were
wanting more Matt's out of your naked
palette there are only two in naked and
buck and with this palette there are
actually four you've got these two kind
of light to medium shades that are met
but also these two down here at this end
or matte as well so I do think there are
a lot of similar shades the whole range
is kind of in the ballpark of The Naked
palette but as far as it being a dupe I
really don't say it's a dupe a dupe to
me is basically the exact same thing
like you would absolutely mistake one
for the other and seeing them all
swatched out I can't really do that I
can however achieve very similar looks
depending on the shades I'm trying to
you know mimic one eye to the next and
using a base I think bumps up these NYC
shades even more but texture really is a
whole other story because these shades
are so smooth I mean you can just tell
putting your hands in these and
swatching all of these shades and then
putting your hands in the Naked palette
it's like these are so smooth they
swatch so effortlessly so evenly whereas
here sometimes they're a bit more chunky
a bit more flaky just powdery overall so
I guess I would say if you've got your
Naked palette and you're happy with it
and you are the kind of person who's
going to go out and just experiment with
the various things on the market this
one may not really be worthwhile to you
because you're going to notice a
distinct quality difference between the
two now one thing that I do think is
worth pointing out is the naked smoky
palette
and some similarities between these two
because at a glance I can definitely see
some there as well while the whole color
scheme and the whole pattern of this
palette seem very similar to the naked
palette there are some shades in here
that are very similar to naked smoky I
just swatched out anything that I
thought looks similar so that light
shimmery color that golden a color
called dirty sweet in the smoky palette
is a little bit closer to the shade the
lavaud expalin than half-baked was from
the original naked and then the darker
shades like I said before easier to see
the dupes here and also you know if
you're just trying to do a similar I
look these are more likely to come off
similarly on the eyes I've got whiskey
on there which is the matte Brown in the
naked smoky and not a total dupe for the
dark brown and the lavaud expalin I also
added a swatch of smolder which again I
don't think it's a dupe for that dark
kind of brownish plum in the livadas
palette but you know that would be the
comparable shade if we're comparing
shade for shade here and then you've got
a couple of really dark cool shades in
the naked smoky palette black market and
dagger you can see dagger has shimmer
the corresponding shading the lavaud
expalin is matte but they do come off
very similarly and again with the smoky
as with the original naked you know the
textures are I think far superior to
this palette just smoother more even
more pigmented overall not that I was
building these shades up in the swatches
but there was just a little more
difficulty in getting a nice smooth even
swatch with these compared to these on
the ides if you've been wondering which
is which this is the Urban Decay Naked
side this is the NYC side sin and it's
dupe that's what I've got all over the
lid I've got virgin and it's dupe that's
the shade that's up under the brow now
remember I was talking about toasted and
this shade and how they're really
nowhere near dupes of one another but
I've got both of those shades in the
crease and on the outer corner and it's
crazy how similarly they actually do
perform and then to deepen things up
even more I took hustle which is this
shade right here that does have some
shimmer it's actually met in the NYC
palette but I use that shade to darken
up the outer corner on each eye and I
also smudge that color
underneath the eye so is this an
across-the-board dupe for this palette
no are the textures in this palette is
nice and smooth buttery creamy as they
are with urban decay no but can you
achieve a similar look with certain
shades I think you can and this is only
five dollars so you are saving a lot of
money if it's been a while since you've
tried NYC I think this was the case for
David when he was doing my makeup the
other day I do think you'll be surprised
by this formula it's a pretty good deal
if you're looking for something that can
give you that Naked palette type look so
hopefully this answers some questions
you might have had on the new NYC lavaud
expel it by Demi Lovato please let me
know of any product that you're
wondering about like is this a dupe for
this other thing let me know in the
comments section and I will see if I can
work those into some future videos in
this series so thanks again guys and
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
