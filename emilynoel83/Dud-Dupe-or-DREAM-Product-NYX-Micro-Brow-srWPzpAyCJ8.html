me in this dud dupe or dream product
video I feel we have finally hit our
head on a good dupe so listen up I'm
talking about the NYX micro brow pencil
and I feel it's a good dupe for the
Anastasia brow Wiz now this product from
NYX is not brand new I would say it's a
new ish product in their line but
they're always coming out with different
new things so I wouldn't be surprised if
many people have hit on the fact that
this is a very similar product to the
Anastacio but with that being said I
still see so many people raving about
brow Wiz and how fabulous it is so that
leads me to believe that some people
maybe haven't found out that this is an
awesome dupe for it what I'm talking
about here are a couple of the finest
tipped brow pencils on the market you
enjoy using a pencil in your brows and
you like getting that natural like hair
like stroke with it these are both
products that can give you that for my
last probably two three videos I've had
different brow products on each I have
been testing these both and nobody's
commented on seeing any difference these
both have a retractable pencil on one
end and then a spoolie brush on the
other that you can use to brush through
your brows kind of get them in place but
the big difference here is the cost
obviously and the Anastacio brow is on
ulties website will cost you $21 there
are nine shades and then from NYX the
micro brow is $9.99 there are eight
shades available and with both of these
you're getting point zero zero three
ounces so it's a very fine pencil and
neither of these brands compensated for
that we're like okay then we'll give
them an extra long one or something so
yeah I think in both of these
circumstances you're kind of paying for
getting that ultra ultra fine tip out of
your brow product and that's something
that is important to me if I'm going to
use the pencil I do like a finer tip
let's talk shade comparisons I have the
Anastasia brow Wiz in medium brown which
is a very very cool toned medium brown
and then for the NYX I have it in ash
Brown I actually have several shades in
the NYX and ash Brown seems to be the
one that is most comparable to medium
brown
if I'm getting incredibly picky about
this I think the Anastacio is just a
hair cooler and it's just a little more
like grayish looking that neither of
them are different enough to have a
different look on my brows so as I said
today like the past few days I have each
one on a different brow I don't know if
you can tell or maybe have a little
guess here right before I tell you but
on my left brow I'm wearing the
Anastacio and on my right brow I'm
wearing the NYX and it's really they
feel so similar to apply them I think
it's a very comparable texture the NYX
might be the tiniest bit softer it I
feel like it transfers on just a little
bit easier which I do like but this is a
great product - I'm not knocking the
Anastacio brow is one bit I see why so
many people adore this product and this
one went on easily enough this is the
side that I have a little scar on and it
went over that just fine which a lot of
pencils will struggle to do for me but
for that point zero zero three ounces
that you're getting in a product like
this is it worth it for me to continue
repurchasing this at $21 or would I just
get this for 9.99 I just can't see
enough difference at least if we're
talking about this medium brown to ash
Brown comparison here now I haven't
investigated each and every shade in
this line to know like you know maybe
the quality of the Auburn pencil and in
the brow Wiz is way superior to whatever
they're offering that might be similar
in the micro brow I'm not sure if you've
tried different shades or if you've
tried to make this comparison with the
blonde colors or the reddish colors let
me know how did it work out one thing to
keep in mind these don't provide any
extra hold to your brows so if you want
that you'll want to put on you know an
additional gel NYX control-freak brow
gel is one of my favorite clear gels to
set the brows they also have a really
nice tinted gel as well that has a lot
of hold so again I can't speak for every
single shade in the NYX micro brow line
and say across-the-board they are all
better than their brow wiz counterparts
but for these shades for me I think I've
definitely found a dupe I'm excited to
be sharing it with you and thank you
guys so much for watching let me know
your requests below if there's any
product you're curious about you're
wondering would it be a dupe
