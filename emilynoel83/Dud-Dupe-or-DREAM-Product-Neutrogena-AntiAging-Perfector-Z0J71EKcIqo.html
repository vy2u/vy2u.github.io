second video in my dead do poor dream
product series the first one I did was
on the NYC lavaud expel it by Demi
Lovato thank you guys so much for the
great feedback on that video I'm glad
you're enjoying this concept and I just
think it's a really fun way to basically
review a product by way of comparison
and seeing you know exactly how similar
is it to this other thing is it better
is it worse is it about the same and
sometimes with dupes I truly feel like
it will appear that one product is
really being fashioned after another
high-end product that's kind of the way
I felt with that Lobot expalin with this
video I feel like the comparison is
definitely relevant but it's maybe not
quite as clear-cut like this product is
trying to be this product but I do think
they have similar purposes and I'm going
to be talking about this Neutrogena
healthy skin anti-aging Perfector and
I'll be comparing it very closely to
this it cosmetics your skin but better
CC plus color correcting full coverage
cream just looking them both up on
ulties website the Neutrogena sells for
$13.99 and is available in six different
shades and the it cosmetics is going to
cost you $38 and it's available in five
shades packaging wise they are very
similar you're getting like a squeezy
tube with a pump on the end really like
having the pump because it helps me you
know when I settle in on the exact
amount of product I want to use each
time I can be very consistent with it
when there is a pump I wear it in the
shade light to neutral 30 and the
description here says it combines
retinol SPF 20 moisturizer and blendable
sheer coverage to give you beautiful
younger looking skin even after you take
it off and thank you to someone in the
comment section it was either in the
comment section or a tweet they said you
should compare it to the it cosmetics
and so this it cosmetics version I've
been using for much longer this is
really impressed me as being one of the
best CC BB type products out there with
both of these it's kind of like
moisturizer and a coverage product in
one for some people with really dry skin
I always say this but you kind of have
to test drive these products and see
okay is this enough moisture for my skin
or next time around would I just apply a
little bit of moisturizer first and then
top these off for me for both
these right now like I can wear these on
their own and I don't feel like I need
any extra moisture what is always made
the it cosmetics special for me I wear
this in the shade medium by the way what
is set this apart it's got amazing sun
protection with the SPF 50 and I just
think the coverage is unmatched
there has been no other CC BB type
product on the market that has really
provided as much coverage as this and I
find it also has fabulous staying power
for me and despite being a product that
does have foundation like coverage it
doesn't look too thick on the skin it
seems very natural so I am wearing both
of these on my skin I'm wearing one on
one side one on the other I'm going to
go ahead and tell you which side is
which I do have the Neutrogena on this
side and the it cosmetics on this side
and I'm going to go right into the demo
so you can see these I use my fingers to
apply them both and the Neutrogena it
you know it's got a really nice like
light moisturizer type consistency but
you can tell that there is some coverage
there so I just blended this all over my
skin I actually had pumped out a little
more product than I might have needed
just to get around half of my face I can
tell it absolutely will even out my skin
tone as a whole as far as little
imperfections little like you know
freckles and sunspots and things like
that I can still see that stuff even
after applying this product then I
brought in the it cosmetics for the
other side of my face this does have a
thicker kind of richer consistency to
the product you feel like it's going to
be a lot more moisturizing but really
once I get it all blended out they feel
about the same in terms of the amount of
moisture they're giving my skin but
coverage is what's really different
about this I can tell just four minor
flaws in the skin it can really even it
out more you know if you're going to
want to use a concealer on the under eye
area you're probably still going to want
to do that but in terms of covering up a
little redness or a little bit of
unevenness it does this very well so
again right after application I can see
I've got fuller coverage on the it
cosmetics side the Neutrogena side did
definitely do some things in terms of
coverage but it's not as full-on it's
just more lightweight now I've been
wearing these half and half on my face
for several days actually
and you know initially when you apply
them this feels thicker it feels more
rich and moisturizing but then like you
give it a minute and they actually don't
feel that different I mean I feel like
they're both actually offering me a very
similar level of moisture and in
addition to these products what I have
on my skin now I did under-eye concealer
and I said it and I have on some blush
and bronzer but I didn't like purposely
go setting my whole skin with any powder
and they end up just having a very
similar feel it's like these products
kind of set but not in a real dry cakey
way the skin feels soft it's kind of
just like a velvety type look to the
skin but another difference I have
noticed definitely is staying power I
know they're not really starting on the
same playing field in terms of coverage
but this does break down even faster I
won't say it totally disappeared on my
skin but well I feel like I can see a
certain amount of like little you know
freckles and that's a good gauge for me
you know like redness around my nose I
can see some of those things at the
onset but later in the day I feel like I
can see those things even more so and
this one really just holds strong so I
think what this really does come down to
is your priorities in a product like if
we're comparing the Neutrogena not so
much to this but to other drugstore BB
creams tinted moisturizers that kind of
thing this one stacks up really well
because it's got better coverage than
most it doesn't stay feeling tacky on
the skin that was kind of a misleading
claim because it says gives your skin a
natural dewy finish I don't feel like it
appears dewy at all I think you blend it
in and it almost feels like velvety soft
it has kind of like a natural yet still
a little bit matte finish on the skin
you know both of these overall are matte
and I like that about this product I
think it enhanced the coverage or the
appearance of coverage that gave even
more because it wasn't too shiny on my
skin and I felt like it kind of sets
somewhat plus this does contain retinol
so if you're looking for a product that
contains some anti-aging benefits it's
in there and it's the kind of thing that
I will continue to use but if you find
yourself generally speaking having a
major need for concealer on your skin be
it the under eye acne scars redness
things like that you're still going to
feel the need for that with this product
with the it cosmetics it's closer to
being a one and done
application like if you just wanted to
throw one thing on your skin and it
would double as your moisturizer and you
just wanted to really quickly even some
things out and really feel like you did
have coverage this is better coverage
and better staying power this is a lower
price tag though so it's kind of about
what your priorities are with products
like this I do think both can
effectively double as a moisturizer and
coverage product in one coverage and
staying power tend to be two things that
are pretty important to me with the
product so I mean it cosmetics this is
still my favorite so one of those
situations where no we definitely don't
have a dupe for the cosmetics but I
don't think we have a total dud either
because in the drugstore landscape of
products I think this is a pretty great
product so thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
