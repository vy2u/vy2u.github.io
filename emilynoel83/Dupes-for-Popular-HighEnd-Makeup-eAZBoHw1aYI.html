little mini series here of videos
talking about some favorite products and
in this video it's gonna focus on
high-end products that I kind of think
are overrated and that I believe have a
low cost alternative that's really like
a dupe for that product or maybe even
better than the high cost product so I
feel really excited when I uncover
something like that because I'm like I
can't wait to tell people other video is
going to be high-end products that I
really feel are worth the money so it's
I'm just focusing on makeup not really
skincare or anything else so I hope you
enjoy these videos and you find them
informative stay tuned I've got a lot of
products to talk about let's start off
talking about primer Smashbox
photo-finish is super popular this is
the original there's also a light
formula and I feel like I've found a
product that's really like kind of a
combination of the two you know the
really silky feel of the original and
yet the the lightness of the photo
finish light and that is hard candy
sheer envy primer I know I've talked
about this before and I really recommend
shaking this up before you use it
because sometimes depending on how you
store it the more liquidy portion of
this product can settle a bit but it
looks you know kind of white like that
but it definitely goes on totally clear
you know I've got tons of swatches on
maintenance right now but it really just
you know goes away to nothingness but
just gives you a really silky feel
my primers are such a hot topic I feel
like and I know lots of people love
Urban Decay primer potion and Too Faced
shadow insurance and I also think
they're great but there is something
that if you're trying to save money and
still get a great eye primer you've got
to look to a brand called Palladio it's
available at Sally Beauty Supply I've
also seen it at Ulta and they have their
herbal eyeshadow primer which performs
very much the same as those other two it
has a similar look similar feel and
similar you know actually action of what
it does to help your eyeshadow last and
not get Creasy and all that kind of
things so I would definitely suggest
checking this out for just a fraction of
the cost of the high-end versions
for blushes I know that Mac has some
gorgeous blushes and they actually have
some mineralized blushes that are really
awesome as well in fact this one is
called giggly and it has a little heart
in it and it's really pretty they're not
totally just a solid color they give you
that glow on top of it and Milani has
come out with quite a few blushes that
do the very same thing and there are
they're baked blushes and they look like
this and they've kind of got you know
sort of that swirled look to them this
one happens to be called Dulce pink
there are several shades that I love
coralina is a great Coralie shade so
Rose de Oro and even more deeper
pigmented shades for darker skin tones
but it gives off a really similar look
if you're looking for a blush it's going
to give you some color and some
pigmentation but also a little bit of
glow and shimmer check out the Milani
baked blush another face product the
make up forevers professional HD powder
so this would be you know it looks it
looks like a white powder but it really
doesn't show up with any sort of color
on your skin but you can just brush this
on is like a finishing step to your
makeup to get kind of a flawless overall
appearance to your skin I'm even prefer
elf High Definition powder and it's so
much cheaper and basically you know I
use it the very same way I feel like it
works just as well it blends over the
skin flawlessly don't waste your money
on makeup forever
I recently tried out an art liner from
Lancome and the shade is sparkling noir
so kind of like a black shimmery shade
and I found this to be so watery very
watered-down and not a shade that I've
reached for very often in my collection
at all
however Revlon Colorstay has a shade
called black shimmer and it is very deep
and rich and I find that Revlon color
stays liquid liners from the blackest
black through to some of the other
shades are really great right here is
the Lancome shade which it almost just
looks like a grey and that's the Revlon
the Revlon does have just that little
bit of sparkly shimmer like the name
implies but I mean it just shows up so
much better and seems much less watery
than the Lanco also for cream eyeliners
I know lots of people love Mac fluidline
I have one of those as well that I got
as part of like a sort of a set around
Christmas time and it works great I like
it very smooth goes on very nicely but I
found something that tops it with
staying power and it's the wet and wild
cream eyeliner now you're not gonna have
as much variety when it comes to shades
I just have this one in black but if
you're looking for a great black long
wearing cream liner that really is not
gonna budge you can feel confident
putting this on your lower lash line as
well go for the wet and wild it's
amazing how well it works and I like to
use a small brush any brush that you
have I don't have it handy right now but
a brush with a pointed tip I find works
really well with the wet and wild I
don't so much like to use an angled
brush with that
I know I've spoken about Lancome Hypnose
and how much I enjoy this mascara and I
do think it's really good it's got a
nice brush when you apply it like really
slowly and kind of carefully to the
lashes you can get really nice big
lashes but there is a drugstore product
that is pretty darn close when it comes
to the performance of that mascara and
it's the voluminous carbon black and
voluminous carbon black is among some of
my favorite mascaras as well and it's
just very similar to Lancome I feel like
the formula is kind of the same it's got
a brush that's not too terribly
different but ultimately when it gets on
your lashes there are a lot of like I
think lip liners or something you can
find cheap and you do not need to go
high-end with this because the color
selection is out there just depends on
the brand you're looking at and so you
know a lot of people might like Mac I
have one pencil here the shade is called
whirl
there's nothing exceptional about the
way it goes on I feel I mean it's just
you know it's a lip pencil you know but
um NYX I find that they go on even a
little bit smoother they still have good
staying power and there is a large color
selection so I'm not really claiming
that these two shades are dupes of one
another but I was just kind of feeling
as I talked you know how the texture is
so similar and NYX even goes on a little
bit better
I know the Stila lip laces that come out
in these little tubes where you click
and it comes up through the brush are
pretty popular with some people I happen
to think they're a little bit on the
sticky side and I have kind of a
tolerance for sticky lip glosses but
yeah it's kind of sticky and really
pricey and I think that if you check out
elf this is like the ultimate contrast
here but elf is only a dollar for the
hyper shine lip glosses they still have
a lot of shades and one that I love
actually is called fairy and it's kind
of like an iridescent pink it looks
great on top of like all different lip
looks but it's got the same brush tip
applicator so if you enjoy that you can
have that and you could try a bunch of
different shades for what it would cost
to get one from Stila so that wraps up
my video talking about all of the
high-end products that I think a lot of
people rave about but really do you
really have to spend all your money on
those things because if you boil it down
you can get a lot of these drugstore
products for the price of just one of
those high-end items and stay tuned for
part two again that's going to be the
high end products that I think are worth
your money so thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
