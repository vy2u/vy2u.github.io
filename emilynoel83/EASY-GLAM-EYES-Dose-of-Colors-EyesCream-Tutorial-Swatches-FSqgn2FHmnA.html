be kind of a quick one I've done a lot
of full-on reviews lately but I thought
it might be fun just to do a quick I
look as I am experimenting with a new
palette it's from dose of colors and
it's their limited edition ice cream
palette and that's so cute I am all
about that kind of a theme says the
pregnant lady this palette I think it's
been around for a little chunk of time
here because I know I've seen it a lot
on my Instagram feed this is the first
purchase I've ever made from dose of
colors I believe they kind of got going
and got known for certain shades of
their liquid lipsticks and liquid
lipsticks are kind of a thing that I
don't get necessarily too super excited
about in the makeup world so when this
palette came along and I kept seeing a
look after look on my Instagram feed of
gorgeous eye looks using this palette I
thought I'm going to need to try this
out it does cost $50 it is limited
edition
I know products from this brand are made
in the USA and they are cruelty free
they're also gluten free paraben free
talc free and phthalate free if you're
interested in that so this is what the
palette looks like it's got all of these
pretty shades in here this would be an
example of a palette that excites me
it's got a few like unexpected pops some
really interesting like pastel things
happening in here if you cover up some
of those and you've got like a very you
know neutrally easy to wear any time
type palette you know you've got a
pretty coppery color up here some great
mattes to work with there's a gold the
lighter shades make for a really fun way
to switch up the look so this is only
like my second time using this palette I
loved the way these colors swatched so I
thought I would show you that and just
give you a bit of a disclaimer this is
more of a tutorial less of a full-on
review and you probably could tell from
the swatch pictures but your mats are
this matte cream up here called berries
and cream you've got cone and hot fudge
over here that are matte blueberry swirl
awesome love that deep kind of berry mat
and then lavender honey just blew me
away
seeing how strongly that one swatch the
rest have shimmer some seeming a little
more metallic than others mint chip
seemed really really shiny to me just
putting it out there to you that if
you're looking for
something maybe a little bit different a
little bit off the beaten path as far as
holiday pallets go I don't know this is
necessarily being marketed as a holiday
palette but it's so far really is
impressing me quality wise the look that
I'm going to do I got this little card
when I got the palette and I thought oh
my gosh I love that look basically it
was kind of neutral on top with a pop of
that lavender honey shade on the lower
lash line and I really might not have
thought to do that because a lot of
shades that are matte soft purples I
would think is that going to even pop
enough on the lower lash line but I
think getting a close look at it you can
tell it really holds its own so I'm just
going to walk you through what I did
first off I applied a primer I used a
Smashbox eye primer 24-hour photo finish
shadow primer just to see how that would
do it's done OK for me on a couple of
occasions then all throughout my crease
I use this pretty shade called Cohn it's
kind of a light rosy brown and then I
built up the outer part of the crease
just a little bit more again with my e25
brush with blueberry swirl so that just
deepened the tone a bit then I decided
to use berries and cream adds a nice
matte highlight under the brow bone and
I also padded that with a flat brush
right around my inner corner and then I
decided to make sure but my like all
over the lid color I love the kind of
coppery rose gold vibe coming out of
this and so just patted that packed it
on all over the lid and then I further
deepened up that outer corner kind of
keeping along the lines of what I saw in
the picture I was following I used the
matte Brown called hot fudge love
there's a deep dark matte Brown in this
palette and with my Sonia Kashuk small
shadow brush I just patted that on the
outer part of the lid up into the outer
part of my crease and before moving on
to the lower lash line I use black
liquid liner this is my TARDIS to the
double-ended liner use the liquid side
across my upper lash line gave it a
little bit of a wing and then I used a
nude liner on my lower inner rim that's
the Rimmel scandaleyes in nude and now
that I played with the shadow a bit I'm
kind of realizing this step may not have
been totally necessary but I had this
aqua excel pencil from makeup forever
it's in the shade m92 and I sort of
prepped my lower lashline with that and
then I used an angled brush with
lavender
to kind of stamp that shade right across
my lower lashline giving it a really
pretty vibrant unexpected pop I think
and I use just a little bit of double
scoop on the outer outer part of my
lower lash line just to sort of blend
that purpley shade in just a bit lastly
I decided to pop on at some demi
whispies false lashes and my finished
look I love it you know it's got that
fun little rose gold pop on the lids and
then that lower lash line I just can't
wrap my head around how much that shade
surprised me you know being light purple
Purple's seem to be a hard shade for a
lot of brands to nail anyway but take it
to a pastel place and make it matte and
make it not be chalky but actually
really rich and pigmented I love that
and I've said this before but I think
lower lash line any kind of a purpley
pop on the lower lash line really add
some brightness and life to brown eyes
other things that I'm wearing I am
wearing the smashbox la lights palette
this is one of their holiday things I
used rich bronze and then I used true
flush as my blush in a combo of
highlight berry and highlight gold as my
highlights on the cheeks my lip color
this light pink is one of the revlon
matte lipsticks in the shade called pink
pout so kind of a cool soft pink I do
have a nice balm underneath this my
almay lip balm that i love so much and
so that's kind of helping this matte
shade feel really extra nice and smooth
but I hope just seeing this palette in
action gave you a little bit more
information on it you guys know this
about me but I just really think it's
fun when you branch out you try
something new as an unknown brand to me
at the time and now I'm really really
pleasantly surprised with how great the
quality was let me know if you guys have
tried this palette what are some of your
favorite shades and I will talk to you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
