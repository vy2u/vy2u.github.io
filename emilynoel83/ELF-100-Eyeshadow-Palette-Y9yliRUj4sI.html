me for this video still kind of in my
dressed up mode right now I got my suit
on just got off work but I really wanted
to pass along this review to you on the
new elf 100 eyes shadow palette so what
you're getting here
excuse my chipped off nails but you're
getting 100 different colors basically
in one palette the palette has like you
could see you know this kind of clear
see-through top and you get a mirror in
the top that is actually kind of nice
kind of decent-sized and you also get a
couple of sponge tip applicator x' with
it I just kind of took them out because
I wasn't sure how well they would stay
and I didn't want them falling down into
the into the shadows but this is an
interesting palette and I realized it
right off the bat once I took it out of
the packaging and I looked at it and I
said they're not all one finish there's
some matte there's some like kind of
satiny like kind of you know just a tiny
bit of Sheen but not much shimmer there
are some really pearly shimmery shades
and there are some shades that are just
definitely metallic and there are some
that have a little bit of glitter in
them too so there's a nice big variety
that you're getting in one palette and
I'm trying to show you here I'm just
trying to give you that sense of how
they are as you look at this palette
you're getting some that are you know
real bright and really shimmery and some
that art and you've got kind of a
neutral side to it as well and you get
the same variations there you know some
with sparkle some with shimmer some that
are matched or anything about like the
88 palettes you know you got the 88
matte the 88 shimmer and when you open
them up you get all one kind so this is
very convenient and that you're getting
a hundred shades and they are varying
finishes so that definitely was like a
thumbs-up from me on that and I think
you saw the swatch on that thumb with
the matte colors there are not a lot of
really colorful matte shades but for
example there were a lot of like lighter
mattes and so
Brown maths but there were fewer
colourful matte shades and I kind of
felt like the pigmentation on them was
not that great they're still usable and
there still are some good ones I'll show
you a picture here I mean there's a
really actually a really nice red shade
here the black however was just kind of
average I wouldn't really rely on that
as you know my only black in my
collection I was able to use it for
example in the look today to get some
nice contrast but for like a rich carbon
black smokey eye I don't know that that
would work for you moving on to the
shimmery shades there are some really
pretty light shimmery shades in this
palette um kind of looking over here you
can get a sense of some of those and
then over on the other side here kind of
in the neutral zone there are some
really nice ones there's actually a
really surprising color that's it looks
it looks yellow and then you get a
little swatch of it and it's like kind
of a golden eye cream it's just so
unusual and interesting so I love
palettes that have those few surprising
shades here in there that light gold is
really great there's a light pink that
is gorgeous and I think you'll tend to
gravitate toward that quite a bit but it
is kind of powdery like your brush will
hit it and you know how it's kind of
like it wasn't packed in very much like
you're getting a lot of kind of almost a
little bit of a chalky powder not that
it's anything you can't work with and
nothing that doesn't look pretty once
you get it on and apply the way you want
it but I mean that's just a tendency a
few of these shades had for me grand
blue shimmers there are some nice like
pretty much metallic shades like really
really shimmery to the point where it
just looks like the light just really
bounces off of it like it's a metal and
those are really great there are some
brighter shades with sort of a satiny
finish there's that really bright blue
in here and it's actually a blue that I
have on a little bit in this look today
but that's right here and it's like it's
not out-and-out sparkly but it just has
that
hint of Sheen and I mean sometimes that
shade is not going to necessarily come
off quite as well so the it's like you
get out there with these real shimmery
shades and they seem to be kind of
creamy and nice and then some shades to
just have a little shimmer that aren't
quite as good same holds true for the
pinks and purples there are some great
light and me and highly shimmery shades
that are just beautiful rosy shades pink
shades purples they're really nice the
medium shimmer kind of wants again a
little bit chalky there's a really
pretty cranberry shade in this that I
like a lot and then I will probably kind
of gravitate toward quite a bit then in
with the dark the darker shimmer shades
and into the smoky shades take a look at
this side of this palette right here
when you're looking at this far side
from about there on over I almost feel
like I'm looking at a little
cross-section of like the 88 warm
palette there I mean there are some nice
shades and this was the one category
when I kind of broke it up where I was
really satisfied with a lot of the
deeper shimmery shades the topes the
Browns that I mean there are some
actually really well done pretty shades
that you know your brush doesn't hit
them and then they fly everywhere I mean
they're just well formulated and go on
really nicely there are shades that just
almost feel just a little bit creamy and
I love that in terms of getting a smoky
eye out of that last column where you've
got um wipe to gray to charcoal to black
I like pretty much all those shades but
once you start getting down into those
blacks you've got a matte black and a
black with sparkle and I mean they will
give you some darkness that will give
you some contrast but I mean I would
take this palette and then have one good
black that you can use with it so you
can get ultra rich dark black contrast
with some of these lighter shades that
are really great so like a matte carbon
or you know any other black that you
really like NYX has some good ones too
you know just something that you can
kind of supplement this palette with and
really pull off some good contrast with
the look hopefully now you have a better
idea of what this palette is all about
again it's not all one finish you get a
nice variety and my glad I bought this
absolutely I am because I'm going to
experiment with this actually for the
entire week I'm gonna put the look I
have on today on my daily booth page
along with a new look every day is my
goal this week I say that cuz I'm like I
hope I can pull that off but um a
different look every day using this
palette just to show the versatility
because I'm excited to have this even
though you know do I love every shade in
this and are you going to love every
shade in this palette probably not you
know you're gonna run into those hit and
miss shades but are there some fantastic
ones and do I love being able to have
them all together one palette mess
shimmers the whole bit I think that's
really nice - overall it's fun and for
ten dollars you're getting a hundred
different shades and I mean think about
it this way are you in kind of a makeup
rut I mean are you sort of like reaching
for the same palette all the time are
you reaching for the same colors all the
time this is a good way to experiment
and I mean I did the other day I did a
pink and purple eye and I just really
was you know kind of amazed at how good
it was I need a target you can find it
online at eyes lips face comm there's
also a smaller version of this if you
think 100 is going to overwhelm me I
want something a little less you know
you can do that too but I'm very pleased
with this I'm very impressed with elf
for coming out with something like thank
you so much for tuning in for this video
I hope you are able to kind of piece
together what I said and sort of form an
opinion for yourselves possibly on that
I mean it's not the dream palette it's I
can't say I love everything in it but I
do love most of it and I'm definitely
going to have fun experimenting so
thanks a lot for watching guys and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
