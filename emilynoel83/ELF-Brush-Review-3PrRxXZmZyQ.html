great day today I just wanted to give
you a quick review on some products from
ELF
that stands for eyes lips and face and
every product in that line is a dollar
and the first thing I mean I know this
is something that kind of interests a
lot of people because they want to know
well is it even worth it for me to spend
a dollar if they're charging a dollar
maybe it's lower quality but there are
some things that are pretty good and I'm
going to probably be reviewing a lot of
the things that I've tried now you can
get them online I've gotten some of my
items online you can also get them from
like Target Kmart certain drugstores but
I want to start out with Russia's eye
they're kind of fundamental thing that
everybody needs to have in their makeup
collection and I have a few of them from
ELF just different types that I want to
tell you a little bit about and which
ones I go with buying it which ones
maybe not so the first one is their
total face brush so as you can see this
is a pretty good sized brush it's pretty
fluffy it's pretty soft as well and it
feels pretty good on your face it also
has a nice taper to the bristles by
taper I kind of mean that when you're
looking at it the bristles aren't just
like flat across there's sort of a
gentle curve you know arch to the brush
I think things are much easier to blend
when your brush is like that and this
has a little bit of that it's good for a
loose powder a bronze or maybe I really
like this brush the one thing that kind
of tipped me off about it though what's
that it is a little bit loop actually I
think I pressed it in there really well
but it was a little loose between here
and here like it's a little wobbly but I
really pressed it on really hard one day
and it's working a little bit better but
a good brush for travel edit that's only
a dollar you can't really go wrong with
that so the other brush I have is the
bronzing brush if you can see that I
want to give you a little comparison
just for size this is much smaller than
the bandhas brush here it's mint foot
bronzing like I said I would use
probably a fluffier brush for bronzing
but this one's a little bit smaller and
it'll do its good for making
Conte or maybe to your face it's just a
touch small really for blush and things
like that but you can make it work you
know specialty things maybe you want
like some sort of light and excuse me
some sort of light and shadow under your
eye I don't know I usually tend to find
uses for things but I don't um have
already have a brush that has this
little angle to it so I like that I'm
going to try to work with this and
figure out what it's really good for
coming up but it's not a bad brush other
one is the blending eye brush this is
otherwise probably known to most people
as a contour brush it's pretty fluffy
it's kind of big actually I think for
contour brush if you look at it next to
my eye because I mean it's a little bit
bigger than the other brushes I have for
that purpose and I think because it's
bigger it gives me a little less control
and I'll probably want to have and also
if you're using this I've used this with
a pretty dark dark grey wax or a shadow
and you have to kind of worried about
the fallout under here okay so a little
less control is going to diffuse your
shadow more so use it for a light
lighter color sort of a more natural
look this can work for you it's not the
greatest eye shadow brush in the world
but it's certainly worth at least a
dollar I think so you might want to pick
this up as well now here's the thing
that I really liked it elf has been such
a simple concept is a smudge eye sponge
have you ever gotten one of those
eyeliners from covergirl and it's got
that little leather tip at the end of it
well this is like having that only it
comes to a little point what you
probably will be able to see but comes a
little bitty point at the end and it's
just so terrific Kripal anything right
in here under the eye blending in your
eyeshadow with your liner things like
that love it for that purpose um it's
just great it's like I said it's such a
simple little concept it's really you
know no big deal it came with the I'm
not sure if this one comes individually
or not because it for me it came as a
part of the smokey eye kit so but I like
that a lot my
do I pick out of all of them but like I
said they're decent brushes they're
really pretty good for the price I mean
I've paid more for some drugstore
brushes that aren't even as good as this
so some brushes from ELF worth looking
into only a dollar apiece thanks for
