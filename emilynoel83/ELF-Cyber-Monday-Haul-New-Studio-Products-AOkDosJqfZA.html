the elf cyber monday oh it was such a
good deal half off the entire site free
shipping so yeah I took advantage of
that I went to the little new tab on the
website and got a lot of things that
I've been eyeing for a while it's not an
expensive brand at all but if you're
trying a lot of stuff half off
everything really helps a lot I got my
order in yesterday so this morning I
played around with a lot of these
products and explained it more when I've
at least had a chance to use it so first
thing that I got is the elf BB cream yes
elf has an SPF 20 BB cream it's in like
a squeezy tube and then it has a pump on
the other end and this smells a lot like
sunscreen I have it in the shade buff
and I must say it's a very good match
for my skin I put this on this morning
and the first thing I noticed was the
coverage a pretty impressive coverage
kind of reminds me of the Rimmel BB
cream maybe a little bit more liquidy
than that but it blended in very easily
I did use this as my moisturizer because
there's a lot of BB creams claim this
will moisturize perfect protect blah
blah blah
vitamin E jojoba aloe cucumber are in
here to hydrate and nourish this I
really can't say much about the staying
power of this yet but I can tell you
that buff was definitely the right color
match I really like the way it blended
in and it had much better coverage than
I expected I mean we're not talking
Estee Lauder Double Wear coverage here
but a little more coverage than even
some sheer foundations I've tried like
the Maybelline fit me other face thing
that I got is the mattifying cream
foundation it says oil free I have this
in the shade sand and so that came in a
little box like this says high
definition oil-free lightweight
foundation is perfect for normal to oily
skin type it claims to be one of those
cream to powder formulas that gives you
a matte finish the compact is like this
it's got a mirror oops a mirror the
product a sponge underneath and again
this was a good shade match for me I've
never had this much success finding the
right shade on elfs website but
I kinda see what they're saying about
the cream to powder thing it really
feels very creamy and kind of thin a lot
thinner probably than most of the cream
foundations that you've tried and then
when you blend it in I don't really feel
it going to like a super powdery state
but it does set to kind of a matte look
I could have just stuck with the BB
cream as my base type product but I
really really wanted to try this so I
put a little bit of this on as well I
did use the sponge to apply it kind of
hard for me to talk about how well this
covered because the BB cream did have
some coverage of its own thing I really
liked about it was the natural look that
it had on my skin and it seems super
thick I'll be very interested to see how
this holds up around my t-zone
this is just a haul not a review but in
order to give you a good review in the
future I'll have to use these
individually to see how they last and
stuff like that little things here that
have been around for a little while that
I just hadn't tried well I do have one
elf baked blush but it really performs a
lot like a highlight so I got another
one in the shade rich rose and what's
rose about this it looks like a bronzer
with coral swirled in it and so I did
apply this like my blush today I'm not a
big fan of this I mean as I swatch it
really get a lot on my finger here I
don't even feel like tons of color shows
up it just looks like a light bronzer to
me and then I got the baked highlight
and this is in the shade blush gems so
it looked like a pretty typical
highlight looks like it could be really
shiny but it's actually very sheer like
I don't know if you can tell there but
there's not a lot of thickness with this
product like you really kind of got a
rub on it to get some on and I don't
really mind a highlight being sheer
because I don't like thick thick shimmer
on my face I did use a little bit of
this on top of my cheeks but there's
actually another product that I used
more in a highlighting sense and it is
where did it go oh the shimmer sheets I
thought these would be so fun der if you
I love picking out those things that
just strike me as something odd in an
unusual format you know of makeup you've
got a little folder here kind of like
oil blotting sheets
and these came in different shades so I
got the pink ones and then you've got
another little folder that contains it's
got like a little piece of paper on each
side and then the sheets are in the
middle and this is what it looks like
one side is just paper one side is the
shimmer and there's a lot of shimmer in
this and it's pretty colorful and pink I
mean that looks like a blush to me where
I sort of dad some of this on the apples
of my cheeks and then blended it out
with a brush and I got kind of a glowy
blush look that was just just swiping
this on your cheeks like thinking you're
gonna be real quick and go Boop and be
done I don't think that's gonna be
enough blending wise you kind of need a
brush mess around with that some more
it's kind of fun another new face
product I got is the HD lifting
concealer and I have it in the shade
light and this shade is pretty much like
a skin tone match so I don't necessarily
see this as something that's gonna like
super bright in my under eye area but it
did cover some places pretty well for me
I thought it had good coverage on
redness around my nose just spots here
and there as infused with vitamin C
green tea and mulberry for lifting and
soothing benefit it says to apply to
areas with fine lines that need a little
lift so I did put this on my under eye
area but then like I said because I want
more of a brightening effect there I
added a little bit of my Maybelline age
rewind on top of it my first thought on
this is that it actually has a really
nice kind of thin lightweight texture
but yet it seems to have really nice
coverage so I'm totally gonna be using
this some more really focusing in on it
and seeing what I think as far as any
areas on my face that I need to cover
and really just want to disappear into
my skin tone and this worked pretty well
product has been around for a while and
I just hadn't tried it it's the eyebrow
treat and tame and I don't know what I
was thinking this side was but this is
actually like a little brush tip here
that you're supposed to put on your
brows it's a regrowth vitamin-infused
gel formula I never really used that
side much yet but this other end um
hello that was not supposed to but the
other end is like a dented
brow gel and I can see that it's got
lots of little like microfibers in there
so I was I got this because I wanted to
compare it to the benefit gimme brow
this is definitely a much larger brush
so it's hard to control exactly where
it's going you're not gonna get this
into really precise area it really did
the bulk of my filling in with my it
cosmetics your brows but better skinny
pencil and then just went over them with
this a little bit as my gel I could kind
of tell that using this alone wasn't
really gonna be enough and not real
pleased that it came undone from the gap
there but that is the eyebrow treat and
tame and that's from the studio line and
I have that in clear / dark just a few
more things here there's a new kind of
eye shadow from ELF
it's called prism eyeshadow and I got it
in the shade
sunset and it really does seem like you
know pretty sunset colors right it's got
a nice mirror here there are six shades
on the inside what makes these special
it says these ultra silky and lustrous
eyeshadows look like a powder but feel
like a cream I think they look like a
cream and feel like a powder don't they
look like maybe they could be a creamy
texture but they really they feel like a
powder eyeshadow there are all shimmery
as you can probably see so if that's not
your game then you may want to steer
clear this one but they are pretty
nicely pigmented so I'm gonna swatch
those for you here they're a very
metallic finish very shiny the thing I
don't really like about this and I
should have seen this coming when I
ordered it is that there's not a really
dark shade in this palette to tone
things down a little bit and create some
contrast so I use these on my eyes I use
the purple quite a bit on my lid I used
a little bit of this shade on the inner
part of my lid as well blended out just
up above the crease with this pinky
color used a little bit of this as my
highlight just very lightly and on my
lower lash line I used some purple and
actually a little bit of the gold there
on the inner part I don't think it's
showing much so it's a pretty palette
nothing that's really like driving me
crazy with oh this is so so good oh
we've got a dog walker oh he's being on
the mailbox thank you oh the dog was
peeing on the mailbox not the dog walker
but anyway both in another eyeshadow
that I got to add a little bit of depth
I didn't want to change this look too
much but I added just a little bit of
this gray in the outer corner and this
is the elf pressed mineral eye shadows
has anybody tried these oh my gosh
really really impressed by this Jade is
called forest frolic I think I thought
it was gonna be a dark green but it's a
really dark charcoal gray so there's
that one I got wine tour which is this
shimmery lilac see how it's like a lilac
but with golden sparkles and this one's
called what's your name and it looks
just like a matte - okay there's the
matte taupe the one called what's your
name
it's it's matte it's nice I think it
could be a good blend e-type color it's
not super pigmented but these other two
Wow really liking this one that's got
the kind of dusty lilac shade a little
bit of gold that's awesome
the rock star is this dark shade I mean
not only does it look deep and dark and
that swatch but actually so like almost
creamy feeling a really nice rich
texture like we could do a blind swatch
test or something and I think this was
maybe lorac or something like that I
just think it's really impressed last
but not least I got the moisturizing
lipsticks I chose two of them I have
Rosie go round and pink makes new
lipstick from the studio line it's got
kind of a metal like you can see on the
inside maybe metal feeling container
there and I have pink minks on I wanted
to tone down the pink just a little bit
so I put on this golden e-type gloss
from NYX on top just cuz I had you know
the sweater or the purple on the eyes
and this is called VIP glam gloss aqua
looks from NYX but anyway back to the
lipstick it's creamy
there's no shimmer in it
it feels to me a lot like the elf
mineral lipsticks which I think are very
good quality it's got some creamy shine
you know but not crazy shine not shine
that's coming from any shimmer that's
for sure
so there's that really nice classic pink
shade and then rosy go around I've not
yet used this will be the first swatch
oh yeah my kind of shade a little bit
deeper a little more of a purpley
fuchsia type tone in this that's nice
it's creamy not shimmery can't really
talk about staying power much with these
yet but really impressed with the color
payoff so that's my elf all my friends
