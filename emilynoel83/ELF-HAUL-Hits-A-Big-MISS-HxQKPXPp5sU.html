haul to share with you today it was one
of those situations where I was browsing
elfs website and like one thing really
appealed to me Emily I've got to try
this and then a bunch of other new
things started coming out of the
woodwork and I realized just how many
new things are on the site right now I
hadn't been playing around with all of
these things for the last few days some
of them you know would definitely
require some more testing before I did a
full review but I just wanted to show
you what's new actually I think I'll
begin with the thing that I know is not
new but it was just something that I
wanted to try because I hadn't tried it
yet it's the elf hydrating face primer
so they've got these primers in all
different versions they've been a little
hit and miss for me I think there's a
poreless face primer that I really liked
it was kind of a pinkish color but in my
travel makeup bag I had a little size of
the Smashbox hydrating primer and while
I was gone I realized I kind of liked
the feel of that primer I did feel like
it was offering something a little extra
to my skin so I thought I wonder if the
elf version is a dupe for that so I got
this and it says fills in fine lines and
moisturizes with vitamins A C and E and
the first probably two times two or
three times that I use this I felt like
it was coming out very runny from the
pump
it just seemed way way too thin like
something was maybe a little wrong and
then I went to use it today and it was
like maybe I had worked through a little
something in the tube and it seemed to
be just the right consistency just a
little bit thicker but still kind of
slippery smoothed out on the skin very
easily and by the time I had it all
worked in on top of my moisturizer I
felt like yeah there's a little
something extra there but yet my skin
still feels kind of smooth so I really
like the effect that I got from it today
and I predict that that will be the way
it continues to go but if you're really
wanting a moisturizing primer I actually
feel like this has a little more
hydration than the Smashbox one has
so these elf primers with the pump like
I said it's not the first kind of
strange initial experience I've had with
one of these those pumps can be a little
squirrely sometimes but right now you
know it seems to have worked its way out
and one more thing that I know has been
in the line for a while but I just
wanted to try as one of their $1 eye
brushes this is called the blending eye
brush
pretty sure I tried something like this
like right one elf launched years and
years ago and I didn't have it in my
collection any longer so I thought let's
try this out and honestly it doesn't
seem like you know quite the fluffy
blender that I was hoping it's pretty
dense with bristles and there's not much
of a taper going on either I can't say
that it's a fully blunt cut but it is
kind of close to that so I'm not sure
how I'm going to use this if maybe I
would stamp a little product you know
like in my outer corner but then
ultimately blend it out with something
else or I'm just not sure I haven't
quite found a use for this yet in my
collection now the brand new stuff
couple of new cheek products here they
are called matte blush duos and I know
they do have the matte blush bronzer I
think it's in the shade called Fiji it's
a really great product very pigmented
but these specifically say matte blush
duos so they are natural types of colors
in here I got I think both of the shades
that were available soft and subtle is
this one and rosy flush is the other and
I feel like you know I'm getting a very
wearable vibe out of both of these and I
have worn them both on the cheeks and I
think they're absolutely great I'm glad
elf is expanding like their matte cheek
products because they do have a nice
formula going if you enjoyed the formula
of their matte blush bronzer I think
you're going to really like this and I
am wearing the soft and subtle shade
today so this color is what's happening
right in here and then this peach is
extremely soft like this is not the kind
of shade I would wear alone and really
feel like I was getting much out of it
but after I applied this color which
really even though that looks like a
soft shade it's plenty pigmented it's
plenty of color on the cheeks I had
blended that out and then I took the
lighter peach and just kind of went over
the top and somehow it kind of smoothed
out the whole blend so I don't know in
both of these I almost look at the
lighter shade as sort of a corrective
type smooth it out brighten it up type
color and then the rosy flush this shade
is just gorgeous this is a fantastic
blush color really nice pigmentation
there 100
percent Matt and the light shade here
also seems kind of peachy but yet it's
even lighter than the one in the other
compact and again I kind of use it in
the same way sort of airbrushing over
the blush that I've applied but I don't
see this as a standalone blush I think
these are a really nice texture and
maybe my favorite thing from the whole
haul one of my favorite things the other
thing that I really really enjoyed were
these high shine liquid lipsticks funny
that they name them that because Malley
has a product named exactly the same
thing I just got a couple of these to
kind of get a feel for the formula and
one of them I'm wearing right now this
is called bitten pink and it's really
shiny these are very opaque like glossy
finish full color lip products the way
the applicator is it's kind of like a
furry doe foot like there's a lot of I
don't know there's a lot of a that's
coming off that thing
and a little bit of a scoop in there so
it really does hold some product and
it's easy to apply it's not so big as
you can see you can really nicely get to
the outer edges of your lips get a neat
application there they smell a little
bit also the first thing that comes to
mind is the scent you get when you open
a packet of instant cocoa like the
little cocoa mix packets that's kind of
what it makes me think of but the
formula is really like thick enough to
hang around a decent amount of time
yesterday I noticed I put it on in the
morning and it was still wearing through
lunch so I'd eaten something for lunch I
can't remember what I had anyway I ate I
drank and this was actually still
hanging around not to its fullest extent
but it was still definitely there on my
lips so it's not uncomfortably sticky
it's not the kind of thing you're going
to put on your lips and be continually
thinking about or something goopy on my
lips it's just a nice kind of glossy
formula but pigmented enough to actually
have some color and a beautiful shine as
well and this color this bitten pink I
think is very everyday very much like a
workplace type color for anybody who
tries to stick in more of a conservative
color range the other shade that I got
is crushed berries I wouldn't call it a
pure red but it's kind of a cool berry
red
and I love the color but I do think it
can be a little bit risky wearing those
bright shades in a lip gloss type
formula because while these do have
decent staying power they can definitely
move outside the lips more easily than
say a matte lipstick in this color wood
so pretty colors on both but I think if
I get any more of these I'm probably
going to go a little bit more toward the
lighter spectrum just because I'm more
comfortable wearing that type of color
in this consistency but this is still
gorgeous and if you're interested in it
you know you may want to check it out
would you like to hear about the biggest
fail of this whole it was the ultra
control ink liner so elf has a liner pen
do you see how there's like a little
bowl right at the end there I think we
focused yeah it's got that little ball
and check it out yeah you're seeing that
right folks there is no color oh oh wait
we got a little streak more more I swear
I played with this thing for so long
I've stored at different ways to try to
get something out of it and it's dry as
a bone I mean I could barely get one
light stream there on the ball of my
hand I don't know what's going on with
this I clearly got a dud if you've
bought this tried it had any success
with it please let me know I can't think
that they would put out a product and
actually put it through testing and they
all turned out to be that way I just
can't picture a meeting of people
sitting down and trying this out seeing
no color being like yep that's the one
that's the winner I just think I got a
flawed product here but something to be
aware of if you're thinking about
getting that you might be taking a bit
of a risk they've also got what they're
calling glide on gel liners so these are
retractable pencils and they had a nude
shade available so that was my first
like I got to try the nude I got it
rather nude than that lower inner rims
and then the next one is called bronzed
Brown and I don't think there's any
shimmer in that Brown I was kind of
thinking maybe there would be but it's
more like just a true medium brown they
go on pretty easily they seem like they
might be kind of a soft eyeliner formula
but the issue here is that they don't
actually set and that's a real
disappointment for me when you look at a
new eyeliner hitting the market I don't
care what the price range is there are
so many drugstore liners now
that they're making that can go on
smoothly and you know give them a little
bit of time and they will actually dry
down and not move and these really don't
get to that point so that frustrates me
also the nude in the lower inner rim I
am wearing that in my lower inner rim
and I gotta tell you I had to work
pretty hard I had to go back forth back
forth really lay it on thick to feel
like I was getting it in there and
already I can see a little bit of wear
down like in my outer quarter and I've
only been wearing this not even half an
hour definitely not the kind of thing I
would go back and buy more of so I just
wanted you to know that something I did
leave out of my first few items that
were older have been on the site for a
while that one-dollar tweezers love
these tweezers got an extra pair because
they have become my favorite tweezers
that I use and I travel with my tweezer
men's in my little bag and I'm like gosh
I missed the elf's so these are only a
dollar it's the slant tip tweezer
they've got other tweezers that they're
trying to sell for like a higher price
but you want these little silver one
dollar ones they're the best last make
up item before we get into a few new
skincare things I got this finishing
powder it's from their beautifully bare
line so it's completely mirrored and
completely smudged over and I got the
fair to light shade I think the next
shade up is probably my ideal color for
all over the face but that was sold out
so I got the fair to light and for me it
seems to be a very very mattifying
powder like I was kind of surprised
actually because coming from this
beautifully bare line I thought maybe
they would put out something that had I
don't know a bit more of a natural
finish on the skin but it's very
straight up mattifying
and I feel like the only place I can get
by with using this is kind of dabbed on
the under eye for the lightness that it
has because it's so so Matt why I put it
all over the skin it just looks powdery
on me and it does have a nice like kind
of creamy texture as far as powders go
you know it's better than a lot of cheap
powders might be but even on my under
eye area setting concealer I've got to
be very very careful with it because I
just feel like for as matte as it is it
does have that potential to show up
quite a bit so you got to be careful
about it now
I am on such a sheet mess kick these
days one of the things I was most
excited about trying from this hull is
the hydrating water sheet mask yes
Elle pads a sheet mask they're charging
I believe it's $3.00 for it let me
double check yep three dollars
oh and as I open it up here on my phone
I see they've now got a makeup brush
cleaning glove hmm see you just can't
keep up with new elf stuff in the couple
days before you shoot a video they've
put something else out but this says
with purified water and aloe no parabens
no sulfates no phthalates and it's just
one of those you know single-use sheet
masks you put it on I think I wore it
for 20 minutes 10 to 15 minutes it's
just the mask in here and it's
completely saturated as sheet masks tend
to be with their skincare kind of serum
a type of liquid so I used this last
night I really enjoyed it I thought it
was very soothing very cooling feeling
on the skin the size of the mask
definitely wasn't you know too awkward
on my face some of them you know are
like way way big but there was no
stinging there was definitely no
sensitivity and then I took it off and
just kind of rubbed in whatever
additional goo was still hanging around
on there and I brought it down my neck
and you know I'll just slather that
stuff anywhere really you want to take
advantage I think of everything that's
in the pouch but my skin felt really
hydrated really nice and soft after it
was all said and done I didn't feel that
kind of odd residue that some sheet
masks leave behind like I didn't feel
sticky
I just felt nicely hydrated and I
thought it was a nice mask it was very
similar to the effect of the mask I just
talked about my best in beauty video
sorry no sneeze nope it's not happening
it's not coming out of the mists spa I
think was the brand it was the mask from
Walmart now it's going to run you like
two dollars this one is one dollar more
maybe if you're doing an online elf hall
anyway you might pick one of these up
but it really is a very similar effect
to the one that I mentioned before from
Walmart which is just a little cheaper
then I also got elfs moisturizing
sleeping masks so this is in a pump
style container here it says clearly
Vaughn mask delivers hydration
overnight so you awake to soft skin that
looks refreshed and nourished my skin
looked decent this morning I wouldn't
say I don't know it didn't look that
different from any other morning infused
with purified water a low vitamin E and
po Koba and apply a thin layer all over
the face neck and chest leave on
overnight rinse off in the morning this
is one of those products you know when
we're talking skincare I don't think you
can ever just use something once and
really have a great feel for how it's
going to go you've got to kind of give
it a little time but putting this on
last night I thought wow that's a very
thin some of these sleeping masks that
I've tried tend to be a pretty thick
formula like just as rich as what you're
envisioning to be a really rich night
cream but maybe even thicker than that
and this texture seemed very comparable
to a lightweight moisturizer but at the
same time it isn't one of those one
hundred percent like absorbed and gone
type of lightweight moisturizers you
know what I mean there's definitely some
extra hanging around on your skin you
can feel it but we're the overnight like
waking up to this effects really that
great or that different my skin really
didn't feel super hydrated when I woke
up this morning I've got to give this
some more tries but if you're looking
for a lighter weight sleeping mask aka
glorified night cream maybe you want to
test this out or me it seeming kind of
middle-of-the-road borderline not enough
moisture and then the last thing I want
to tell you about is this micellar
cleansing water from ELF and I have been
using this over the last few days and I
just told you about my Garnier micellar
water that I really love been using that
for months as kind of the start of my
day basically I sit down here and get
some of that on a cotton pad and that is
my makeup or my face cleansing step at
the start of the day so I use this kind
of the same way I haven't tried this
from a makeup removal standpoint yet
which is what many of these micellar
waters claim to be able to do just a
couple observations from the way I've
been using it this definitely has like a
scent that stands out to me it's not a
bad scent but it's kind of like a makes
me think of like any deodorant that
might be labeled fresh something
I don't know it's definitely got a smell
to it and I can assure you that it did
not irritate my eyes whatsoever but a
fragrance and a product like this they
kind of worried me a little bit but I
was able to go all over my skin I felt a
little bit more of a residue type feel
than I do with the Garnier after I use
that I feel like my skin just feels like
clean skin and these micellar waters are
not supposed to be over drying so I get
that none of these waters have left my
skin with that you know tight feel that
you sometimes get after you wash your
face with certain cleansers but at the
same time I do want my skin to have a
clean feel before I start my makeup and
this was just I don't know a little step
down from that maybe I'll have to try it
just on some makeup removal just to see
how strong it really is in that respect
but I just wanted to let you know that's
out there so that's all I have for this
whole thank you guys so much for
watching again I would say so my top
picks would be the matte blush duos I
really like both of these that I had and
definitely the high shine liquid
lipstick in the bitten pink shade that
I've been wearing love this color really
nice formula so those really surprised
me hope you guys are having a great day
and I will see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
