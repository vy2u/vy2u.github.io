this video I'm so glad you tuned in
because this has been a review that has
been highly anticipated on my channel
ever since I I mentioned that I was
testing out this particular product I've
been getting asked what you think about
it you know how did how did it work and
it's the elf High Definition powder this
is a studio line product available on
eyes lips face comm and it's been a
challenging product to review I must
admit because I it's not necessarily one
of the most obvious makeup products
you'll try things that are easy for me
to review are things like lip gloss eyes
shadow eyeliner stuff like that harder
things to reviewer like say primers and
certain kinds of foundation and stuff
like this and it doesn't necessarily
have the largest impact when you put it
on your face it's something that you
really have to kind of take time to
figure out if you like it and so I took
a good you know two weeks of really
consistently testing this product out
and I'm sorry if that felt like I was
taking a long time to some of you but I
feel like I owe it to you to really know
what I'm talking about when I'm
reviewing something and to really
thoroughly try it out as opposed to just
kind of you know watching it on my
finger and then making a video so anyway
now let's get on with the review and
I'll tell you what I think about it this
is the elf High Definition powder I'll
read to you on the Box some what it's
all about this is I believe a six dollar
product on ice lips face calm I will put
that information in the sidebar though
just in case I was wrong on that and
this is the high definition loose powder
to create a soft focus on the skin it
claims to mask fine lines and
imperfections for a radiant complexion
the incredibly soft and invisible powder
is great for on-screen and everyday wear
so as you know this was of interest to
me being on the news and the directions
say to apply it all over the face broke
for a professional and youthful look of
perfection perfection that's a tough
word to throw around it in makeup the
main ingredients are dimethicone and
silica if you're familiar with that I've
read up a little bit on silica and
and um from what I understand it is a
safe product to use in the cosmetic
sense um I really there's more that I
need to learn about products and I
really am trying to research not
products ingredients I'm trying to
research that more in my book um don't
take don't go to the cosmetics counter
without me the book that really focuses
a lot on cosmetics and how items are
formulated and things like that so I'm
learning more on that you'll see more on
that type of information in future
reviews but basically I'm going to tell
you how this product worked and if it
lived up to my expectations this is the
packaging it's in kind of a matte black
um little box here
there's no shade selection this is going
to come in one shade and it's kind of a
square shape this twists off and you've
got a little puff here and this is kind
of like a just a really really soft puff
it's not like foam or spongy I mean it's
good it's an it's really really nice and
soft and then you've got this little
kind of right there but you got your
little sifter and it's a very very fine
silky smooth powder if I were to get
some of this on my finger it's like to
rub it between your fingers it's like
it's like really slit like like I don't
know silky smooth is just what comes to
mind because this powder is so so fine
if you've looked on any other loose
powders I mean there are a lot of
mineral powders especially those that
provide more coverage like think
everyday minerals intensive where it's
like um you look at the powder and it's
just you can obviously see the particles
and that's a good thing for that for
what that products supposed to do you
know it kind of they cling together a
little more they're a little more creamy
when you swirl them on your under your
face this is a very very lightweight
product it's not intended to apply color
to your face you put it on as like a
finishing powder basically that's the
way at least I believe it's intended to
be used and that's the way I've been
using it that is on top of I mean you
know I put my foundation on my bronzer
my blush and then I'm going to sweep on
the that set HD powder and um when I
first put it on um I don't know if it
was just that it was so early in the
morning that I was doing it
you know I just swept it on pretty
quickly and I really was like we know
okay what am I waiting for here you know
like I was looking in the mirror
thinking okay how do I look different
you know and that was a little initially
disappointing to me I don't know what I
was expecting you know some sort of you
know miracle like is glowing like
someone's just shining a beautiful soft
light on me the whole time but but I
just didn't see a lot of difference and
then again I did apply it quickly I
wasn't really paying that much attention
I do apply this with a fluffy kabuki
brush actually I kind of this this
little thing is nice but I really like
to keep the powder just very you know
the light layer that I believe this
product is intended to be and so I feel
like it's kind of easy to use that with
a brush like this you just don't want to
get too violent with your swishing it
around in there else this product will
go everywhere if you were to sneeze near
it and any of that was loose so anyway I
put it on the first time didn't notice a
whole lot of change continue to use it
and I used it in sort of the sense of
like I will apply it to half of my face
and then really kind of look for what
the comparison and contrast is you know
and immediately after I applied it and I
really took a look at it I could tell
that um my face had sort of a um I'm
going to call it a natural matte finish
you know there are some products like
say you've just finished your makeup and
nothing can shimmer in it nothing you
know there was just it was just 100%
matte and maybe kind of cakey and it's
just like an unnatural matte finish the
skin naturally should have a little bit
of a glow to it this product does not
have shimmer in it I want to be clear
this is not a shimmery shiny product
however the finish it leaves on your
face is like a soft focus glow almost
this is a very kind of hard thing to
wrap my head around it's taken me a
while to kind of decide that this was
what it was but it's like a natural soft
finish I put this on I've worn this face
of makeup all day for all day at work
and I just swept some more of the
product on
and so I don't feel like I want to
really necessarily represent this is
what's on my face is you know just how
this product works because I think it's
best used after you've put down your
initial makeup application and you just
get this kind of soft focus look I've
heard a lot of people report that their
pores were somewhat minimized um with
this and I felt like I couldn't see the
pores on my nose as much when I
initially use this either
so pore minimizing and overall kind of
like shine reducing is a great thing
with this very happy with how it sort of
completed that task but I guess one of
the one of the issues with this is I
don't feel like this necessarily has a
really long enduring quality to it you
may not go through an eight-hour workday
and feel like you still notice the
effects of this on your face if you know
what I mean when I I would work at a TV
station I'm not on an HD we're not HD
yet but I do what I did watch back the
newscast and looked at how my face
looked after applying this before I went
on and I was pretty happy with the way
it looked and I could tell a difference
from from you know the day to day I
could tell that everything just looked
extremely blended and just very smooth
and not too - that completely like a
natural matte it's a natural matte and I
think it's that's the best kind of matte
finish that this gives if you have a
photo shoot a big event any special
occasion
this is going to hold up best after you
initially apply it after your first you
know you've just put on your makeup you
put this on you go out the door you do
what you need to do your face is going
to be fresh for what you do for that it
may not necessarily hold up to the end
of the day and look that same way but it
does have pore minimizing effects I feel
and it does cut down on any kind of
shininess gives you an even sort of soft
focus look I like this better than other
products I've tried as finishing powders
because so many of them have some sort
of shimmer to them people have this
cept in the makeup world that like you
know you put your makeup on put your
makeup on and then you want your whole
face to have this like gleam all over it
at the end and you know highlighter is
nice but highlighter isn't all over you
know lighter it's like you want it here
you know you want to hear maybe here but
select places I don't want shine all
over my face so that's why I enjoy this
it's not loaded down with glitter I felt
like it's composed compared to like
mineral veil from bare minerals that had
a lot of I don't know necessarily a lot
of but um I felt like there was some
glow to that that I didn't necessarily
like and this works really well some
people would ask me to compare this to
makeup Forever's HD powder and I assume
this is very similar but that would be
purely an assumption because I have not
tried that particular product but just
comparing it to other loose powders and
other finishing powders I like using
this as a finishing touch for my makeup
this would very likely be something I
would repurchase for the fact that I
feel like I can tell a difference when I
look at my face on TV um hi and it
doesn't take a lot you know to get the
job done you know you like to use like I
said this fluffy brush this is kind of a
big wide opening so the fluffy brush
works nice kind of shake it up and then
just blend it all over your face and I
mean I just feel like it does work quite
well and I'll continue to use it so
thank you guys for tuning in for this
video I hope I didn't make this more
complicated than it really is but it was
just a very hard product to initially
see like an instant result from it's so
lightweight you might not see it in your
own mirror but you may be more likely to
see it if you took a picture of yourself
or saw yourself on video after you used
it so thanks for tuning in guys thanks
for hanging around and watching the
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
