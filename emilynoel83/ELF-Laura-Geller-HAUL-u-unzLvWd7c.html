this is going to be a haul and I'm going
to be talking about kind of two
different hauls that I had one is from
Laura Geller I got it off qvc.com and
the other is a bunch of stuff from ELF
I'm going to start out by talking about
Laura Geller I'm not sure how familiar
with that brand you are I've tried a
handful of different things from the
brand that I've really really liked and
it was once sold I'm not sure if it's
still sold at Sephora but it is now the
phone line is available at QVC comm and
so the other day I was actually sitting
here early in the morning I was doing my
makeup and they had that I had QVC on
because they were doing makeup and so it
was a Laura Geller show so it's so fun
when you're sitting here doing your
makeup they're talking about makeup on
TV it's just fun and the today's special
value on that particular day was the
laura geller baked vanilla nudes so that
kind of means it's their special deal of
the shop the packaging is adorable this
is a neat little tin container I did use
all of these products on my face today
and now I've put them back in here just
so you could see the presentation of
everything get one two three four five
six different products you should be
aware that these are just like my
initial first impressions and if you
want more information actually there is
a laura geller YouTube channel that I'll
link to below and it was so cool I
started watching it yesterday and this
was before I used any of the products
but they actually have one of the laura
geller makeup artists and he is like
training the other makeup artists about
each of the products and this kit so it
was so cool to see like every little
trick that went into using each of these
and you know exactly how to use it so I
found that super informative so if you
really want to learn a lot about this
kit watch go to that channel and watch
the videos on the baked vanilla new
these products are designed to give you
a natural look
without any real like one particular
color standing out it's just kind of
like someone would look at you and think
ooh you look good but I can't really
pick out exactly what you've done there
you know I'll just kind of take you
through the products real quick the
balance
brighten my shade is regular and these
are powders that actually they start as
a cream and then they are baked and you
can see that there's like multiple
shades swirled into one so there's not a
whole lot of shades to choose from I
think there are four different ones so
it is kind of forgiving I feel like I
put it on it really just kind of meshes
with my face this has really good
coverage I put this on I put on my
regular liquid foundation and put this
on on top of it but on a date and
obviously I did the news today so I
really wanted the coverage but on an
average day this can you know be your
foundation if you want it didn't they
have this awesome Neapolitan face powder
so it makes you think of the ice cream
they showed on the on the YouTube
channel just kind of swirling your brush
over all of this for just kind of that
nice warm face powder or you can use
these individually the brush is actually
designed to be narrow enough to fit in
each of these swaths of color and this
isn't a big brush but I did find that I
mean it's it's a lot smaller than I'm
used to for blush but for the purpose of
being able to access each of those
shades and then put it on them like you
know this can work this side is actually
like a huge sponge tip applicator and
they recommended using that for your
highlight which was interesting I
actually kind of just prefer using the
brush and you know use go down use the
pink and then use that as your blush and
then they have this shade that can be
like your contour shade if you want it
to be and I find that this brush seems
to work fine for that and then I just
you go ahead and use the brush as well
for the highlight also get a mascara in
this kit and this was kind of like the
one thing that I was a little
disappointed with and frankly I don't
like a lot of mascaras right off the bat
so take it with a grain of salt but it's
called at long lash mascara and this is
a waterproof conditioning high gloss
mascara and I love the thought behind
this brush which is it's going to be a
little bit bent and a little bit smaller
at the tip making it really easy to
access those smaller lashes right in the
in the corner however and hopefully the
HD of this camera will be able to show
this to you if you look at that narrower
tip okay right in here look at all of
the excess product you can see the light
kind of picking up the shine this this
particular tube I don't think is quite
able to clean all that product off so
when you're dealing with your smallest
finest lashes with this narrower tip
you're getting actually a lot of mascara
product a lot of the formula coming out
there so it doesn't clean it off quite
well enough and I felt like I was
getting goopy their lashes were dark and
it's nice to have waterproof but I went
ahead and put on actually a set of false
lashes on the outer half just one of
those half strips for a little thickness
there but I don't know like I said I
can't quite give a true verdict on the
mascara until I've used it a little bit
more but right now it's very wet and it
too much is coming off on that one tip I
also tried the eye rims this is the
baked marble eyeshadow / i rims in
vanilla toffee is this shade and black
cherry how gorgeous are those now if you
watch on the youtube channel they'll
show you how to use these wet and it's
very cool how they come off but I just
use them dry and the thought is that
this one you can definitely wet that
that makes a really nice liner this is
what they look like just kind of
swatched on my fingers very just creamy
texture to these I mean I really like
how they work
I went kind of all over my lid area with
the lighter of the two I went in the
crease and all out here with this one so
I didn't use any other eyeshadows today
it's just one or the other of those two
and then I used the darker to go and
smudge it under my lash line as well and
the final component of this kit is the
lipstick and it is looks like this and
the shade is called berry banana and
this is a new thing with the lipsticks
actually there's a certain
for the lipstick oh how cute is a little
little flyer the little handout that
comes with this with all the desserts I
love this is called the Italian marble
lipstick and you'll see why here because
basically what you've got is a berry
shade with a nude color swirled
throughout and so this is what I have on
right now and it feels like a lip balm
they were talking about it on the video
like this it's meant to feel like a
really moisturizing lip balm it totally
does
you're getting kind of that nude color I
think this is going to vary at times
with the different concentrations of the
nudes or the reddish shade that you're
getting in here but it's really pretty
very moisturizing gives you a subtle
shine if you want it more defined you
could use a lip liner but that is the
laura geller kit now real quickly I want
to take you through what I got from ELF
I got another one of the high definition
powders I've already had this I know I
love it it is just a nice nice finishing
powder to use in place of something more
expensive like Make Up For Ever HD so I
was running out of my other ones so I
got another one of that I'm also trying
out the complete coverage concealer this
is a studio product as well my shade
that I got it in is light and you can
see you're getting four different shades
here I haven't used this on my face yet
and a lot of the self stuff I haven't
used just to touch this the texture
feels pretty good I'm interested to see
how that how that does coverage wise
especially on the under eye area I also
wanted to try on the stick concealer
that they had in the studio line because
I wanted to compare it to a Revlon
Photoready concealer so it looks like
this and I hate how flimsy this cap I
mean I feel like that cap could pop off
in a makeup bag at any moment but anyway
it's a little bit skinnier you're not
getting as much product as you do with
the Revlon Photoready
but it does feel creamy it has a pretty
similar feel so I'm gonna have to try
that out get
on my face and see how it works tons of
questions about the elf tinted
moisturizer people wanting to know how
well this works
so it says SPF 20 with aloe cucumber and
vitamins A C and E the shade I got was
nude did I say the shade in the
concealer a moment ago concealer I got
in beige all these shades kind of appear
to be okay for me at least at this point
but yeah this isn't nude haven't even
tested out the texture on this but this
is something that I'm hoping will be a
good blend between moisturizer and a
little bit of coverage one of the cream
blushes look at this monster look at
that monster of a blush and see you've
always got a look at the bottom okay
you're getting this much blush there's
this much excess packaging here so this
is going to be a kind of a pain in the
rear to store but my shade is seductress
and this is going to be just dropped up
and as you see kind of pinky bright
coral a blush I think and it's
interesting it's a definite cross
between a mousse and a cream as it
appears and just just watched on my hand
kind of a softy soft pink sort of shade
there along the same packaging lines
there was the blush and then here's the
little sister
the conditioning lip balm once again the
packaging is so excessive around this
these are not going to be fun to store
but I got romantic Rouge which is on
these these aren't very easy to twist
off either romantic Rouge is going to be
your reddish berry shade in the
conditioning lip balm SPF 15 by the way
and then I got mellow melon and this is
gonna be your light kind of pinky more
natural shade for eye products I didn't
get much but I did try some of these
eyes shadow duo's that were one dollar
and what's so funny is they made these
exact color combos in cream shadows and
I have all the creams and then I thought
maybe the powders are good so I got the
powder duo in
mocha swirl which is going to be a nice
neutral you know kind of taupe and a
light sort of creamy color there I also
got butter pecan which I really liked
the cream version of these shades there
you're getting more of a brownish shade
and then kind of a creamy peachy color
there they both have a little bit of a
pearly finish I think and then I got
berry mix which is your lilac and plum
so those three different duo's just a
dollar I'm like I'm gonna try a few of
them the one dollar lipsticks first time
trying this I got the one in voodoo and
these you know little silver tube kind
of nicely packaged for a dollar haven't
used it yet
but it looks like a beautiful beautiful
deep kind of very red also got a light
shade from the mineral line these are
like five bucks but I love the mineral
lip sticks and I got one in runway pink
so that's what that looks like nice and
creamy light pink shade I have more in
this one and I think it's beautiful and
then I got one of the therapeutic
conditioning bombs in black berry smell
is is lovely I used this and I feel like
it has almost a slightly greasy feel but
I'm gonna use that a little bit more and
keep you posted on what I think about
that so thank you so much for watching
this haul video I am so pumped to try my
new makeup that I've got here if you're
interested in the laura geller stuff
again that's qvc.com
and then with the elf anything I got
there is stuff I believe I haven't been
able to find in Target so I ordered all
of that off of eyes lips face comm at
the time I got it they were having a
free shipping deal and a buy one get one
half off or buy one get one free
something like that deal going on so it
was awesome it was like a President's
Day thing but elf usually has some
coupon codes out there so just kind of
do your research and sniff around for
what's going on and you'll probably get
a deal so thanks again for watching have
a great day and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
