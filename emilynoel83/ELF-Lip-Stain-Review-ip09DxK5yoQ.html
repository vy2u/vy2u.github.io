time I'm reviewing the elf lip stain and
the shade I have here is called a
fashionista really like the color it's a
nice light pink very wearable it's not
kind of like a light and bright pink
it's just kind of light well I think
look nice with a lot of skin tones and
it's just not too out there in terms of
shades but basically how you use this
product and how you used a lot of stains
is you would apply the color to your
lips let that color dry and then put on
this clear coat that gives it a nice
gloss I got some problems with this
product I'm sorry to say because I
really hoped I would like it because I
loved the concept of lip stains
I like how you know it's just a sheer
wash of color on your lips and it kind
of is very long wearing and it doesn't
even look like you got a lot of lipstick
on there I've really liked the concept
smashbox has had a really nice lip stain
that i liked and a few other brands have
as well but this one just did not meet
my expectations especially in terms of
application on my lips right now i feel
like it looks good
i like the appearance of it but it's not
doing what a lip stain really says it
should do in terms of this first
application here this coat the first
thing i noticed was how instead of this
being gel like like a lot of stains are
or not really gel like but just like a
clear kind of liquidy thin you know
layer on your lips
this is creamy it reminds me more of
like a long wearing lip color like from
like covergirl or something like that
when you put it on your lips it doesn't
feel as thick as that or it's kind of
dry but it's still it's like a creamy
lip color not really the appearance of a
thin wash of of color like you get with
the covergirl lip pins you know what i'm
saying it's like a practically a liquid
stain exactly what you would think of
when you think stained this feels like a
lip color um but anyway you put it on in
something and whatever you know maybe
this the periods
we'll change as it stays on I don't know
you're supposed to wait till it gets dry
before you put the other coat on let me
grab my little box here just to make
sure I'm telling you that right
directions apply the stain to bear lips
and allow to dry for a matte finish this
does not get dry you put it on your lips
I waited five minutes it was still not
dry I waited ten minutes it was still
not totally dry and you want it to be
dry because you don't want pink to come
off on this applicator you know you
don't you want that to be like you're
putting it on over something and
nothing's gonna transfer over to your
other applicator so I thought if it's
not dry in ten minutes this is just not
a user-friendly product you know for
what it claims to be anyway still looks
nice on my lips but it wasn't doing what
it said it was going to do no I don't
like putting another layer on top of the
lip stuff that's still not dry yet
because then you transfer it onto the
applicator you can see with the gloss
don't know if my lighting will even show
it but the tip is pink on this because
when I put the gloss on I had to like
dab it so I wouldn't totally like turn
this thing completely pink but still
kind of pink and yeah the gloss the
thing about this is you put the gloss on
I like the way it looks and the gloss
seems to sing on therefore it's fairly
long wearing as for far as that goes and
I like the feel of it it's not too
sticky it's it seems kind of
moisturizing actually I like that but
this overall will wipe off I will take
my finger like that my finger is pink it
has the pink gloss the gloss and the
pink color that's on there it's in my
book lip stain shouldn't just rub right
off your lips like that and part of the
problem I think with this product is
that it never got dry and I don't think
it was ever going to truly dry on my
lips it's a it's a it's a flaw with the
formulation so like I said enjoy the
appearance like the color like the feel
of the gloss on my lips but does it stay
as long as the stain should and does it
apply like a real stain should
I don't really think so it doesn't have
that appearance like my lips have just
like I've just eaten a popsicle and my
lips are just you know red or pink from
that color what else it says about this
it says enjoy silky matte color or layer
on the moisturizing clear gloss for a
shiny look so like you have the option
with key vitamins a any your lips taste
smooth all day long the blot the gloss
really does feel nice but it's not that
long wearing so then again this doesn't
say oh yes it does achieve full coverage
that lasts for hours with this long wear
formula it doesn't last for hours
especially if you have to eat something
or you're talking a lot I talk for a
living in my job with anchoring and
stuff and I can tell you unfortunately
as much as I enjoy this color I would
like for it to last all day but it just
doesn't so I'm sorry to give that
negative review but you guys need to
know these things I know you're
interested in all the new elf Studio
products so I want to keep you posted
let you know how it works
if long-wearing doesn't matter that much
to you and the fact that this doesn't
get totally dry before you're supposed
to put this on that doesn't matter to
you too much you might still want to go
for this also if your idea of a stain
doesn't necessarily have to be that
sheer wash of almost semi-transparent
color just kind of like that that bitten
look on your lips you know if that
doesn't matter to you then you may still
like this but I've as far as I'm
concerned there's other products that
can do this that are a little bit more
user friendly so thank you guys so much
for tuning in for this video have a
fantastic day and I will talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
