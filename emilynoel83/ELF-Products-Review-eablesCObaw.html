collection and a review of some of the
products elf makeup and tools are only a
dollar apiece but the mineral makeup is
slightly more expensive you can find it
at ice lips face calm and it's also sold
at some Kmart and Target stores as well
as some dollar stores I find it at my
local Big Lots store as well just so you
know some items are marked by color in
this video I was marked with a green dot
or great products yellow means average
don't expect a lot with those products
but then the red items are items that
just really didn't work for me they
might work for you but I wasn't a big
fan of them so moving on these are the
brushes that I have
it's the smudge brush eyeliner eye
shadow contour Foundation bronzing brush
and allover face brush the reason why
that big brush is marked with red is
because the actual brush and the silver
part actually would not stay on the
handle for me so that's why it didn't
get a very high rating on the other
tools that I have I am a huge fan of the
eyelash curler those shine eraser
blotting sheets are great and the travel
mirror is cool too because it's got a
magnified side and just a regular mirror
side these elf eye makeup remover pads
didn't like them they just dried out way
too quickly eyelashes the single eye
lashes are alright they wouldn't stay on
very well for me which might have been
my glues fault but I really do like
their strip lashes they have them in
dramatic and natural which I didn't show
here but I really like those now face
products they've got a mineral concealer
that I have also the all-over cover
stick tone correcting concealer that
little tube that's laying kind of
horizontally is their shielding hydro
tent and then clarifying pressed powder
the powder does not go on very evenly
with the puff they give its only average
really if you use a big brush I'm just
not a big fan of that powder
the other products love the cover stick
and love that shielding hide wrote in
other face stuff the healthy glow
bronzer in warm tan is just to loosely
milled for me it's like you stick a
brush on it and it's going everywhere
and it's just a little too dark love
that brought the blush and flushed it's
actually a little bit deeper shade than
what you even see they're very unique
sort of plum tone the other blush in
innocence is just very very light only
average for me here's the all-over cover
stick in lilac petal and pink lemonade
and then below that is the shimmering
facial whip in persimmon and pink
lemonade lovely color sticks they're
great as an eyeshadow base or as a blush
the the other little facial whip things
just don't go on really evenly they
don't spread quite as nicely as the
sticks do these are three different elf
elements customizable compacts that I
have this is an overall rating on the
compacts themselves I give them a eight
plus I love the fact that they have a
nice big mirror and they hold four
different items they're just great
quality compacts now individually this
one I filled with the eyeshadows so it's
ivory moon dust dusk and mocha that dust
color the reason why I've rated that
lower is because I thought it was going
to be black it shows up as black on the
website but it's actually Navy and the
lip products overall not the greatest I
really like that red crimson shade but
the others are not quite as creamy they
are a little bit dry actually that's the
reason why braided up kind of average
now here's a third compact that I filled
with a variety love the face products
that are over on the right side there's
a blush and a bronzer for some reason
this sponsor I liked a lot better than
the individual full-size bronzer you can
buy their two different products I feel
so I like that one now two eyeshadows
I'm going across the top is silver
lining butternut and Nouveau neutrals
and bottom is drama luxe and ivy overall
great products I really love that color
in the top left the that kind of purply
shade in there definitely worth trying
that gray and black tone kit drama is
really nice for a smokey eye as well
moving on to some other eye shadows they
have cream eyeshadows that are
definitely worth a shot I have butter
pecan and olive the olive I got free I'm
not usually a huge green eyeshadow fan
but this actually is quite a nice
eyeshadow kit really like the pairings
that they choose in those the eyeliners
not good ratings the eyeliners and lip
liners the pencils the tops just will
not stay on if you flip one of those
upside down the top would fall right off
I don't know if it's just the ones I got
but consistently the cap just does don't
stay on as for the product there's
nothing that great about those liners
either liquid liners however another
story I love that plum color especially
the blue here as the picture I took of
it is not really that blue for some
reason the flash just really caught that
one and brightened it up but these are
great they stay on they are waterproof
love those eyeliners another eye product
here the wet gloss lash and brow
clear mascara in the waterproof and
regular mascara duo I really like the
regular end of that mascara duo the
reason why I rated the clear stuff and
average is just because it doesn't have
quite enough hold if you wanted to groom
your eyebrows it just doesn't do enough
maybe there needs to be a little more
gel in it or something now on to lips
stuff this is hyper shine gloss and
flirt and joy they only got an average
rating from me because they just don't
put out a lot of color you actually
wouldn't see much differentiation
between I don't know if that's a word
either but they both look about the same
even though you can clearly see they're
different colors moisture care lip color
I like most of these more color shows up
these are more creamy I like all of
these shades pretty much especially the
one on the top there that's in like a
ruby slippers shade I believe
and then we've got some other lip stuff
that is the plumping lip glaze and ruby
kiss oasis and champagne that's really a
gorgeous color there in the middle it
comes off a little more golden e than
what you're looking at right there
but the bottom end is just a clear glaze
that you put on before the color and
that's sort of a plumping agent in this
I do notice some plumping with this lip
gloss moving on these are the super
glossy lip shines these are great I
really just I mean this is probably one
of my favorite lip products from elf
this is my pick if you are going to try
something out from the lip glosses they
have try one of these these are great
they also have an SPF 15 in them another
great thing are the candy shop lip tins
these are so cute they slide open and
the best part about them is these aren't
just clear they go on with even more
color than the hyper shine lip glosses
do so if you see a bronzy or a red or a
peachy color that color is actually what
they go on with now this is a set called
soothing lip gloss set I've marked all
the shades on here for you overall it's
great I'm just judging like I like the
texture of the gloss and everything and
the minty feel I'm just gauging these on
the color shapes so if they got a green
or a yellow those are just basically my
preference of shades they're on these
different kinds so that pretty much
wraps it up that's my whole elf
collection and remember all my opinions
are based on how the products work for
me they very well could work differently
for you but please ask me any questions
so I can fill you in further on some of
these products I know I didn't get too
specific here but I'd love to know what
you think and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
