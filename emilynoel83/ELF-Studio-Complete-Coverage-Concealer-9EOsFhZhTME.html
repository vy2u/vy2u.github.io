review on a product from ELF it's called
the complete coverage concealer and this
is part of the studio line it's
relatively new to that line my shade is
light so that's what you're looking at
here in this product you're getting four
different shades of concealer you're
also getting a small applicator that
almost looks like an eyeliner for three
dollars at ice lips face.com
comes in light medium and dark shade
website says it meets the needs of
changing skin tones so they think giving
you four different shades is going to
help you as you change seasons and your
skin tone changes a bit they say it's
highly pigmented and they claim it will
disguise blemishes dark circles redness
and uneven skin tone first want to give
you a little frame of reference sort of
like for what the texture this product
is a while back I talked about this
palette from hard candy it's called the
nobody's perfect concealer palette
really didn't like this product because
I felt like the concealers we're kind of
just giving you like you can maybe even
see as the light catches that the
concealers have just a real kind of
greasy feel to them you know not a lot
of coverage is coming off there it's
just like you touch it and it's just got
moisture in it and it's kind of greasy
and just doesn't tend to cover a lot
definitely a fine line magnet there for
that one and then on the totally
opposite end of the spectrum of that
we've got super super creamy concealers
like those from Bobbi Brown really
really rich and also benefit has erase
paste and that's another product that
has a lot of thickness to the concealer
little bit goes a long way with products
like that and then somewhere in the
middle of being thin and greasy and rich
and thick you have the elf complete
coverage concealer what I noticed shade
wise in terms of these I think these
first two are a little bit lighter the
second two are a bit darker the first
and second the first and third shades
seem to have more of a slightly pinky
undertone and then the second and fourth
shades
seem a little more of a yellow undertone
and like I said first to overall are
lighter second to are a little bit
deeper texture wise they all seem about
the same I mean I don't feel like one
appears to be a lot thinner or one
appears to be much thicker but they are
somewhere between you know the rich
creaminess and both and the thinness of
the other so I mean as I touch it get
you a swatch of that you know I'm not
gonna be able to like dig my finger down
into it and get a creaminess out of it
like I would the erase paste but I am
able to kind of swirl my finger there
and get a decent amount on my finger and
it's kind of just got this sort of
creamy feel to it if you've tried a
really really rich and creamy concealer
like Bobbi Brown like benefit erased
paste and you thought that stuff was
just too thick I do not want anything
that thick on my skin I didn't like the
way it worked with any fine lines I had
all right you know I had issues with it
under my eye area or elsewhere on my
face it was too thick if you're thinking
that this might be just right for you
however for those who have a super dark
circle to conceal if you have some very
dark circles with that bluish undertone
this may not be quite enough color for
you to cover that might not quite enough
pigmentation not quite enough thickness
to the concealer to do a really good job
of covering the deepest darkest circles
Bobby Brown has a corrector called
biscuits a perfect salmony color that
can counteract those circles here what
you're getting are four shades that are
basically like you know neutral a skin
tones you're getting a little bit of a
yellow undertone that I think is coming
through on a couple of those but you
know it's nothing that's like oh wow
there's that salmon color corrector that
I've really wanted so you're getting
four shades as is it that big of a
benefit to have these different shapes I
think I do kind of like being able to go
between them a little bit I like having
this one here that I think shows up as
being kind of yellowy and then having
something that you can blend over it
it's maybe a little closer to your skin
tone it was checking the elf website and
they have some neat ways of giving like
statistics on their reviews for each
product there were 49 reviews at the
time I checked and it got an average of
4 out of 5 stars
some of the high points people said were
that it was easy to apply and good value
and the low points were that it wears
off easily I didn't notice a whole lot
of problem with staying power but
generally speaking when I put a
concealer on I top it off with a very
light dusting of some sort of powder
maybe a translucent powder or whatever
but it is easy to apply you can put this
on with your fingers and a bit of a
blemish that I was dealing with and it
was on my nose it was kind of like right
over here and for that that was where I
had more of a staying power concern
there because I get more oily on my nose
than I do under my eye area I understand
by the fact that a couple of really
really great concealers are erase paste
by benefit and Bobby Brown's concealers
and correctors are really good and also
Revlon Photoready a concealer that I
reviewed not too long ago that one has
maybe not quite as moist of a feel as
this little palette does but that was a
pretty good stick concealer as well I
think it might have had just a little
more coverage than this another good one
for good coverage and brightening under
the eye area is Mally cancellation
concealer really good brightening
under-eye concealer but hopefully this
helps you figure out what the complete
coverage concealer from elf is all about
I don't think it's very great coverage
but I think it may work for some people
who have some minor imperfections so
thanks for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
