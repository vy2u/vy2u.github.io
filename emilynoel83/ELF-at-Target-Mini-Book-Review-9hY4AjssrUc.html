this video this is probably not going to
be a huge news flash to a lot of you
because actually some of you guys were
the people who first informed me that
elf is now available at target what you
may not know if you haven't gone to your
local target store yet is just the
extent of what is available and so I
just wanted to run through what some of
the products are there to bear i bought
a few kind of examples things i wanted
to try but i had the expectation and
going into this that target was going to
be carrying perhaps the entire elf line
like everything you find online like the
mineral line and the studio line and all
those other things and i was really
excited but you know and then i had
heard from some other people know it's
just going to be the dollar stuff but i
was still like cool you know that's
that's fine i would just eat no matter
in whatever capacity i'd like to see it
at a store that i can just go to instead
of always having the order online came
there to find that it's really a lot of
specially packaged items say like gift
items for christmas and that type of
thing like little stocking stuffer ideas
and they're in increments of 1 dollar
three dollar and five dollar items so
the the one dollar is usually like it
looked like just single items the three
dollars like a small little pack of
three things and then the five dollar
was a bigger package if maybe five
different items don't like five lip
glosses or some different elf items that
would come together to create one look
some of the things are different like
the the way they had some of the
eyeshadows on there it was like duo
eyeshadows that were a little different
from what I was used to seeing and they
had some liquid eye shadows just some
different products than what I have been
running across on their website now if
your target does carry some different
things than what I'm describing here
feel free to comment below and let me
know like how it's different I just kind
of assumed that mine was going to be
basically a representation of what
everyone's is like but feel free to
correct me on that if he were is selling
more more items or less items but they
had basically just to run you through it
they had some
individual lip glosses some end of
individual brushes and tools and stuff
like that like the eyelash curler some
tweezers random little things like that
for a dollar then they had three packs
of lip gloss and um I think some three
like Oh some I shadows and little lip
gloss slide open tins and basically
smaller items just several packaged in
there usually sets of three and that was
your three dollar chunk the five dollar
chunk had some different full face looks
that you could achieve with all the
products that would give you just to
show you a few examples of what I got um
this is kind of the way they're packaged
they have these little oh great my
chipped off nail here this is the little
label that is on all of them they have
like a little gift package and it says
these are 13 or five dollars that's what
leads me to believe this is kind of a
promotional thing for the Christmas
season and also this is like a limited
edition yeah it's new special edition
lip gloss this is in Los Angeles it's
one of the super glossy lip shines its
kind of sparkly so it's it's not like
anyone that I've seen on the website so
far so some different shades in some
cases different products entirely and
they also had this is for the three
dollar thing they have these travel
brushes which gives you a face brush and
eye shadow applicator and a nice little
brow brush and I actually kind of needed
this this brush here and I thought maybe
the face brush might be nice as well
this was a three dollar thing and this
would be maybe a nice little gift to
toss in you know as a stocking stuffer
for somebody I know it's kind of early
for a lot of us to start thinking about
this this brush really isn't bad it's
the elf it says elf face brush but it's
little travel-size for me it wouldn't
probably be great for all over the face
but as a blush brush it wouldn't be half
bad and you get the little kind of brush
guard type thing like the Sigma brushes
come in and it protects the brushes
there but kind of wanted to keep it in
the packaging so you'd be able to
identify that
your store if you want to check it out
but yeah that's a three dollar item and
the last thing i got was a three dollar
kit of the hyper shine lip glosses and
sort of their neutral and nude shades
there this one looks like fairy to me
and then a couple of these other shades
I didn't already have so I'm not totally
sure what those are but like I said some
shades are definitely consistent with
what's sold on the website and there are
some new shades as well but um yeah it's
it's in any event you know I'm glad to
know that elf is being sold in target it
wasn't totally what i was expecting
because i was hoping there would be more
more like permanent items in the in the
line um i think it will be interesting
to see what happens after the holidays
are done and it stops being so much of a
gift idea like with the little gift tags
there you know will they bring in more
items like you see sold on the website i
don't know if anybody does know please
let me know but like i said no matter
what I think L had some great products i
am going to be reviewing some new elf
studio products i got so that includes
the new HD powder and just some other
various little things that you can look
for upcoming reviews on another thing i
got while i was out that day i went to
my local Waldenbooks and i got this book
this is more than a thousand pages and
it's called don't go to the cosmetics
counter without me seventh edition it's
by a woman named paula be gown or vegan
BG oun and she calls herself the
cosmetics cough and what this is is a
very in-depth book reviewing items from
all different makeup lines whether
they're drugstore high-end you name it
she goes into skin care as well and it's
just like a nice little reference book
basically you could look up like if
somebody asked me you know how was the
you know the Estee Lauder face cream
blah blah blah you know I could look it
up in here and get a really educated
opinion and they'll say you know show
reference whether it was high priced or
not and this is very much based on
ingredients I've gone through and read I
won't say quite a few relative to the
size of this
but I've read several of her reviews and
they're very concise they're not long
and is she she really touches on very
factual information like I said the
ingredients what they're designed to do
and whether or not the claims that the
product makes whether or not the product
lives up to those claims basically so
I'm finding this super interesting so
far and at the end of the book i'm
trying not to look at it yet until i
just go ahead and read some more but she
does i think rank you know what some of
the best items and if for different
products are like best blushes best
powders i believe things like that so
I'm really excited to read through it
and just inform myself and like I said
kind of use it as a reference guide that
I can maybe help you if you ask me about
a product I've never tried before so she
also has a website and that website is
called she has a couple of sites beauty
pedia calm and I think if you go there
you can actually subscribe I think you
have to pay to subscribe but you can
access her reviews and I think she said
they're updated on like a weekly basis
so as we know more new products come out
all the time and you know this book
can't continually be updated so she
updates that website which I might I
might look into you know subscribing to
that but I'll see how I like this book
so far I think she has some really great
advice in here about different products
and I just wanted to give you guys a
heads up that i'm reading this if i read
it quite a bit more of this i will post
her a full review about what I think but
just wanted to give you the heads up
thank you guys so much for tuning in and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
