this video I am just so excited right
now you may have heard I posted on my
Facebook page in my Twitter page the
other day but I'm in the november two
thousand nine issue of elle magazine and
it's just a huge exciting honor and
accomplishment for me i was actually
contacted about this a while back but i
didn't I really kind of wanted to not
say too much about it just in case for
some reason it didn't happen but it was
one of my celebrity inspired looks my
freida pinto look one of the stars of
Slumdog Millionaire i did a look based
on her a while ago you might remember it
and that was just one that they wanted
to feature along with several others
there on this portion of the magazine so
it's the november two thousand nine
issue which may not be out in stores yet
um for the most part I think the reason
why I know about like I would be totally
showing it to you right now but um I
don't have it yet because it hasn't I
haven't been able to find it in stores
and one of my subscribers it was hip cat
she let me know that she got hers in the
mail and it was in there so people who
subscribe may get this before the rest
of us do but anyway I was just so I so
elated it's got a picture of me with no
makeup on and then a picture of me
looking like I mean I don't feel like I
look like Frieda Pinto but it's a freida
Pinto inspired look and then a picture
of her and it wasn't really the one that
I went off of to create that look they
used a different one but for the most
part you kind of get the idea of what I
was going for but no matter what I was
just completely shocked when I was first
approached about it definitely wanted to
tell you all but it's more exciting to
tell you now that it's actually happened
but I really wanted to put this out
there on my youtube channel mostly as a
thank-you because I mean we've gotten
now to more than like 30 2000
subscribers here on this channel and so
many views per video I mean the channel
itself my main page is het is getting
close to a million views that I don't
even know how many views the individual
videos have gotten
so I mean it's just an amazing thing but
I feel like I wouldn't be doing it if it
weren't for you guys that kind of keep
me wanting to do more you know giving me
your requests giving me your what i
would call success stories i mean the
message from the woman who says she's a
cancer patient and this is the you know
watching these videos brightens up her
day a little bitter gives her something
else to think about the single mom who
is looking for some way to kind of
revamp her lifestyle a little but give
her a little more confidence and i'm not
saying that makeup you know is i'm not
trying to put too deep a meaning on what
i'm doing here but i can tell that it's
chains change some lives out there and
at least given confidence and when a
person has confidence i feel like they
can go on and do bigger and better
things and so if this is one little
avenue for that confidence to to reach
someone's life then I am so happy that
I'm doing this and thank you so much for
your feedback I feel like it's really a
family here on YouTube with the people
who watch these videos people who read
my blog as well it's just it's really
been incredible and I owe so much of any
recognition that I get right back to you
guys so thank you so very much now I
want to talk a little bit about what i'm
doing this video for which is I'm
getting more wide awake looking eyes
this is a daily challenge for me because
I wake up so early to do a morning
newscast and I'm just always trying to
not make it appear that I'm as tired as
I actually am so I wanted to just pass
along a few tips because this is a
question that I get a lot you know how
can I make myself look a little more
awake and it really does come down to
the eyes so the first thing that you
need to think about is concealer around
your eyes and we all have at some point
you know like a bluish tone kind of
circle that is going sort of right in
here by our nose around our eye and also
maybe some discoloration at the outer
corner so concealer is going to be your
friend in terms
getting rid of that I would normally put
on some foundation first and they'll go
to some concealer for the under eye area
my one of my absolute favorites as you
know is Bobby Brown's creamy concealer
kit she has the creamy concealer kit
which is I have it in natural and it
basically comes with the concealer on
top a creamy concealer and then like a
powder on the bottom but what I've been
using more lately is my corrector which
is sort of the same same type of product
only the shade I have it in its called
bisque and it's a little more peachy
does a great job of really getting rid
of the discoloration around my eye area
Bobby Brown is expensive I will say I
mean I don't splurge on a lot of my
makeup but concealer is one thing that I
do sometimes spend a little more on but
I really really do like the product and
she's got a great thing going on there
it's so creamy even a little bit
moisturizing and you top that off with
the powder that's the key having it
doesn't have to be this kind of powder
but whatever concealer you you know you
can seal and then you want to take a
little brush or whatever you used to
apply your powder and get some of that
right in on top of that concealer just
at least a little bit to kind of set it
and it's going to brighten the area even
more make sure your concealer is also
basically matching your skin tone it
shouldn't be that much lighter at all I
mean I know that's the the thought is
that okay I want this air hit this dark
area to be light so I'm using a light
color but you need to really try to
focus on matching so you don't look like
you've got two tons of skin here another
one that I like that's also more of a
high-end brand is the kat von d tattoo
concealer this is also designed to be
used all over the face it's I have it in
light I've used this a lot as well it's
a little bit lighter feeling than the
Bobby Brown but it's still grew up you
know really really effective with its
coverage in terms of less expensive
options one of the closest things that
I've found to the bobby brown stuff is
from nicks or nyx this is available at
cherry culture calm for a pretty low
price if you don't have this in your
drugstore but it's called concealer in a
jar I have it in line
so this is another one of those more
creamy texture concealers it really does
remind me quite a bit of Bobby Brown's
product and it was what I used before i
got the bobby brown stuff and they're
pretty similar if you really really want
something super lightweight and you
don't maybe have that circles you don't
have a lot to cover up but you just kind
of want to get keep that area smooth and
maybe just take care of any minor
discoloration the maybelline mineral
power concealer i have it in sand it's
medium 0 / 1 that's pretty good for a
light coverage concealer I would really
really recommend this for blemishes
though because it's so gentle next thing
is your eyeshadow makes a big difference
in how a wake you look and if I'm if the
awake look is what i'm going for usually
what I'm doing for news I'm going to
take a light shade and put it all over
my eyelid so by light I mean like a
creamy sort of shade like this might
have a little shimmer in it doesn't have
to this shade is Naked Lunch from Mac
but my goodness there are so many just
general light shades and i just go all
over my eyelid with that so take a
little brush take your elf eyeshadow
brush or whatever whatever you like to
use a sponge tip applicator get that all
over your lid inner corner to outer
corner then take a smaller brush if you
have it I have that small little detail
brush it's like this big or a q-tip or
something and get that color right in
here okay see how this area is
highlighted here that's bringing a lot
of life to the head area and it's a
subtle subtle move but it really is
brightening things up you can go about
your liner however you want to I'm just
giving you soon I mean I feel like you
know some people if you have very very
small eyes you may not want a line drive
glitter here sparkly object anyway if
you have very small eyes you may not
want to line all the way around
that's I'll leave that up to your
personal preference but another
eyeshadow tip is with your contour color
and think about making sure that is kind
of lifted up toward the outside when
you're doing that because that's going
to give you this look of things being a
little more lift in a little less down
like that like for example today I use
this L'Oreal hip duo in cheeky I use
this deep plum shade got my fine crease
brush here from essence of beauty and I
just kind of worked out in circular
motions it's kind of like that outer V
you know that's basically what I'm
talking about here I'm just working it
up almost as if I were going to connect
it to the outer end of my eyebrow so
you're just building it up and that's
giving your eyes sort of an uplifted
look so excuse me another eyeshadow tip
to keep in mind there um and one thing
to think about regardless of how you do
your liner keeping a light liner a white
liner in your waterline I actually have
that right now I have a light white
eyeliner that I went down and I put
right here and that is when you think
about what that's doing that's almost
extending the whites of your eyes making
your eyes look bigger and a little bit
more wide open if you look at yourself
really really close you might freak
yourself out of it but if you're at a
difficult distance away from anyone I
mean it's really going to make your eyes
look more awake so anything will work I
mean just make sure it's soft enough a
lot of brands do sell a white eyeliner
so just really whatever you use there is
going to be fine um with your eyelashes
make sure your curling them curling them
is the biggest thing you can do but if
you want to go one step further I guess
the absolute biggest thing you can do is
put on some false eyelashes I have some
on now and my goodness these can do this
can just really make you look so much
more alive and awake and especially in
those early morning hours from doing the
news and I mean these
can just kind of take care of a lot of
issues that I feel like so what I have
on I I cannot remember what number of
these are but they're very very close I
know to these number 53 salon perfect
lashes these are available at Walmart
very inexpensive they're very natural if
you've never tried false lashes these
are pretty natural false eyelashes the
key to really making them get you allow
your eyes to look more awake is as the
glue dries that you put on there and I
have a false eyelash tutorial that will
walk you through this more in depth but
as they dry make sure your kind of
holding your finger if this was drying I
would hold my finger so it's tipping
them up a little bit and that's helping
them to dry in an upward fashion and
therefore they're lifted they're not
getting down in you're either more up
out of your eyes so there's a big eye
opening tip there no pun intended and
another thing is for your eyebrows make
sure those are groomed use an eyebrow
gel this one from Rimmel is style and
shine you know whatever you can find
they're really they all work the same
basically but get that on your eyebrows
make sure they're groomed and and you
know not hanging down your that's more
of a guy problem than a girl problem i
think but um anyway those are my my I
tips my memory cards about out at this
moment so it's flashing at me but yeah
just just think about those things to
the next time you get ready and you know
you're tired and you know you don't want
to look tired to everybody else so
thanks so much guys for watching this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
