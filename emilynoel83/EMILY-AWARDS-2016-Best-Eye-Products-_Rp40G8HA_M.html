be Emily Ward's back here in luxurious
Studio B again she's all worried about
not being able to pull together the
Emily awards this year you know super
pregnant
two-year-old to take care of Christmas
right around the corner I get that
we all get that right in fact tonight
she was really busy I was just upstairs
and she said she was taking preventative
measures against stretch marks and not
long after that she assumed her usual
post on the couch dipping Doritos and
sour cream and reading the latest issue
of fit pregnancy so I'm here to handle
all the logistics behind the Emily
Awards for eyes it's the top ten eye
products of the year hopefully she's had
enough down time to pull this one off hi
everybody
what up it is the Emily awards for eyes
I have such a phenomenal top ten to
share with you today I've got a lot of
newcomers on my list I also have do I
have any ties I do have one tie on the
list and you might gotta wonder like why
how does a top ten work out with a tie
in it and typically when there are ties
it's like it's kind of comparing and
apples to apples type of situation where
there are two very similar products
maybe similar price range and it was
just like one couldn't edge out the
other so they kind of take over the same
slot and it's kind of my way of sneaking
in one extra product at the top but this
is fun I love this we have had a lot of
fun with this aleck award season so far
so I'm going to jump into number 10 and
as with the last one we work up to the
number one top product of the year so
number ten is a newcomer on the list and
it is the Maybelline master precise
skinny eyeliner this has been such a
handy liner for me when I want to line
my lower waterline or if you want to get
your upper waterline you know get that
tight line area it's a super skinny
pencil it's basically the size of like
the Anastasia brow Wiz and all those
really skinny brow pencils so this is an
eye
in that very format and I think there
might be only a few shades that it comes
in I have it in the black and I think
it's just so great for staying power in
the lower inner rim and a little trick
if you're wanting the best staying power
once you go over that area like before
you're actually finished with your
makeup go back in there and overlap what
you've done in the waterline one more
time for whatever reason it's like
having that first coat sort of dry in
that area and then going back over it
again then you have some really locked
in staying power there and I'm not
saying you couldn't go across your upper
lashline with this kind of an eyeliner I
mean it could totally work that way as
well but for me it's got a very specific
function I just love putting it there in
the lower inner rim it's easy to get in
there it's a mechanical pencil so I'm
not worrying about the need to sharpen
it it's just a really good one to have
at number-9 I've got another new product
on my list although it's probably not
new to you guys in terms of hearing me
talk about it but it's the Rimmel
scandaleyes in nude it's this pencil
liner that I think is so good again in
the lower inner rim I got my waterline
workhorse products here at the tail end
of the top ten but still fantastic
products I love the way this brightens
up that area and it's funny because I
was really in the swing of using the
Milani shadow eyes and almond cream
there for a long time and then I kind of
decided you know nobody's able to go out
and find that product it's really hard
to get your hands on so I sort of
switched over to this and with it not
being as chubby of a stick as the Milani
one is it really is a lot easier to just
you know sweep it right in there in the
lower inner rim again if you do that
sort of to coat process it does last a
lot longer if you're not familiar with
this concept of wearing a nude liner
right there in your waterline basically
the point is that it opens up the eyes
it brightens everything up when I'm not
doing like a dark smoky look like this
where I've got a black or a different
color in there I really like to use a
nude as opposed to letting that area go
totally bare because many of us have a
little bit of pinkness to that waterline
area and that can always make us look a
bit more tired so I just find that using
a nude tends to extend the whites of the
a little bit it makes you look more wide
awake it makes your eyes look larger
it's a little less stark than using a
full-on white although you could totally
do that as well but this is definitely a
favorite number eight I have a product
that was on the list last year and it
has worked its way up one spot and it's
a brow product from Maybelline and it is
the define and fill duo I have
experimented with so many brow products
brands have been come out with new brow
stuff left and right I've been playing
the field and I still think that this is
one of the best items out there for
brows it's a two-in-one product so
you've got a retractable brow pencil
that's not one of those really thick
wide ones it's probably not as skinny as
a brow Wiz or one of the finest ones
either so it's a nice middle ground
don't have to sharpen it I believe I
wear this in the deep brown color by the
way it's a really nice cool brown I've
got it in my brows right now consistency
of the pencil is not too dry it's also
not too creamy I never liked a brow
pencil to be too creamy and transfer too
much into these already thick brows so
this works well but then what you've
also got on the other end you just twist
this here and you've got kind of this
spring loaded a little plunger type
product it goes in to a little bit of
powder that's sitting down there and the
springiness of this means that as you
use product up it will always be able to
come in contact with some powder that's
sitting right down here in the bottom of
the cap and it's such a nice little
finishing touch on the brow it's the
perfect marriage of brow pencil and brow
powder but you've got them in a really
easy portable stick and this little
applicator is just kind of like a little
sponge tip and I find that you know when
I get those specific areas filled in
with the pencil then I just go over the
entire thing with the little sponge I
have a hair on my nose don't I let's get
that off of there go over the whole
thing with the powder side and it's just
such a perfected look so I would really
recommend that kind of a product if
you're looking for just the ease of two
steps in one number seven we have a
mascara a favorite drugstore mascara and
it has dropped back six spots from last
year and that
it mean that it's gotten any less good
it just really means in the scope of
this list that maybe other products have
been a little bit more outstanding and
caught my attention a little bit more
this year still anything on this list I
think is some of the best of the best
makeup that I have come across and I'm
talking about covergirl super sizer
mascara really love this stuff it's an
interesting wand that I may not have
even thought I would have liked I mean
just to look at it it's not one of those
fully loaded with bristles looking
brushes you know there's just some very
short bristles on two sides and then the
other two sides are essentially bare and
so you're able to load up the lashes
with some product and then kind of turn
the brush and sweep through as you use
the wand so in kind of an unexpected way
for me this builds a lot of length it
definitely holds my curl it does not
flake off and smudge I talked about it
so much I feel like I've just you know
I've got all the talking points down on
this covergirl super sizer I know what I
like about it it just works really
really well for me and it is definitely
it's like my number two mascara right
now you will see something is edged it
out and if you've already watched my
mascara video you know what that is
there's no mercy here with these Emily
awards if something's better yeah I'll
tell you so we'll be getting to that in
a moment but number six and eyeshadows
I'm talking about the Kat Von D
eyeshadows I think this brand makes
fantastic shadows and I mentioned them
last year they're actually up to and
specifically what I want to note this
year are Kat Von D's mattes if you were
lucky enough to get your hands on that
metal matte palette that was out for the
holidays that has a fantastic selection
of mattes that really give you some
interesting colors to play with also the
standard shade + light eye palette I
mean it looks so freakin basic but these
shadows are just top of the line in
terms of being mats that are so strong
across the board the dark shades are as
dark and rich as you could possibly
imagine the light shades pack a punch as
well so as you're blending over
something I've said this before but as
you're kind of trying to create a
finished look and sort of buff out the
edge of something and you take a little
bit of one of these light shades it
really does
have enough pigmentation to layer over
something deeper and actually show up so
I think this is a phenomenal palette of
basics
I think Kat Von D's matte formula is
just second to none and then over the
past year something I really like was
the fact that they released quads that
are a little bit more color focused like
there's this shade light matte quad
that's all plums and that's gorgeous
that rosy shade there oh and then I also
love on this one this is called rust
isn't that gorgeous there's a smoky one
there's an olive one there's just a
special thing happening there with that
matte formula when you get into dark
matte colors a lot of times with certain
brands they can be tough to blend out
because they're just not soft enough
it's like there's a hardness and
stiffness to those colors that just does
not translate onto the eyes these are so
like soft and creamy yet manageable on
the eyes easy to work with I love them
now at number five I've got some shimmer
shadows that I want to give a special
mention to and these are from visored
and I know this brand is very expensive
at the absolute beauty and beautiful
texture of their shimmery shades in
particular just blows me away so that is
the specific thing that I'm mentioning
here and this was actually down a couple
of points two points from last year is
still amazing stuff worth mentioning I
love this sultry music this is a palette
full of shimmers slash satin finishes
and the colors in here just mmm they are
just as intense as you could possibly
want but I also love that everything's
kind of rooted in sort of a neutral
place here with this palette as well so
it's wearable at the intensity and shine
especially if certain colors in that
palette is just awesome and I really
liked actually this little palette that
I got which is one of their theory
palettes and this is the one in minks
gorgeous shimmers in here as well I also
do like these mats that they've given
you you know it's a great combo this is
a nice way to sample a little bit more
of their line because so many palettes
are just one way or the other either
they're matte or they're shimmery and I
have other mats that I like from this
brand but I got to say there's something
really just outstanding about the glow
in these shimmery colors from Weiser so
had to mention
at number four a newcomer to the list
and this would be like my top favorite
mascara and it is the it cosmetics
superhero I'm working through a second
sample size of this again before I buy
my full-size of it but it's just a great
great mascara for I think dramatic
thickness length it does a lot of the
things that I loved out of super sizer
but it really builds up quickly on my
eyes you'll have to check out the video
where I was talking about my favorite
mascaras I applied this and I think the
proof is in the pudding I mean I don't
have outstanding lashes as is their
straight they want to point down there's
not a lot of them but I put this on and
it's kind of this instantaneous like
lash makeover and also this does not
smudge or smear off on me it doesn't
flake off I can wear this on my lower
lashes with no fear so it's just a great
like thickening lengthening big look
mascara you know I don't want to buy
mascaras that just give me like a light
coating of darkness on my lashes and
leave it at that I want them to look
thick and beautiful and hold that dang
curl because that's what allows you to
actually see the lashes so love
superhero for that number three a
product that was in the top 10 last year
and has moved up one spot it's my
Jordana color and V liquid liner you
gotta have a good black liquid liner
that you can trust that it's going to be
waterproof and stay in place and not be
affected by any kind of tearing up or
watery eyes in the inner corner when you
go to the trouble to do a fantastic
winged liner that that's going to be
able to last even if moisture comes in
contact with it this can do it all the
price tag is it's just a few dollars I
buy them on Jordana cosmetics website I
will get like three or four at a time
and it's a very traditional you know
no-frills type of liner it's just a
small brush tip I find that the hairs on
the brush never like start going in
every direction it hangs together really
nicely and you know it's just classic
black eyeliner as good as it gets dries
to a matte finish which is also very
important to me so the shade you're
wanting is black
viii by the way in that lineup there are
some other colors in this line that are
good they're pretty but they don't have
the waterproof wear that for whatever
reason the black envy shade does have so
your matte black essential liquid liner
this is what you want at number two I've
got some awesome eyes shadows coming up
toward the top of my list this year both
of them are newcomers to the Emily
Awards and both of them are drugstore I
actually felt like I had a lot of really
good drugstore type eyes shadows that I
was considering talking about this year
and I went back and forth quite a bit
but I think I've got two really really
great candidates things worth checking
out and trying the first one is makeup
revolution now makeup revolution is kind
of the king I feel like of putting out
these affordable palette a lot of times
you can try something that's maybe a lot
like a Naked palette or a lot like a Too
Faced palette or whatever it may be but
they really do execute well there are
nice textures in these palettes I've
been really impressed with the
pigmentation how well they apply I have
a whole video on a bunch of makeup
revolution palettes by the way it'll
give you even more in-depth info on the
specific ones but just for example here
a couple of eye palettes that I love
like if I had to name a couple of
favorites and the neutrals versus
neutrals palette love this this is so
pretty
you've got so many fun options here to
take you just a little bit outside of
the classic neutral zone or if you just
want to stick with browns and topes you
know that's all there but I love the
peaches there are some very very
comparable things happening in this
palette to the Too Faced sweet peach
palette but nice textures really
pigmented it's allowing you to try a
bunch of shadows at one time but usually
at around at ten to fifteen dollar price
tag and more recently one that I've been
using and loving is this fortune favors
the brave this palette is absolutely
stunning I mean you see the Blues the
olive greens I was wearing an olive look
with this yesterday just loved it
beautiful plums and burgandy's so many
different finishes too you'll notice
there are some that are kind of like
Marbley and really really shiny
Marie you've got plenty of mats there's
so much balance in this palette it's
just wonderful and they give you a good
little brush in there too so for me over
the past year makeup revolution was
really one of the most outstanding and
sort of discoveries I'm not saying
they're brand new but they really came
on the scene hard when they come into an
Ulta and then suddenly everybody has
access to all this stuff and then tied
with that is another drugstore a more
compact palette that I've been really
impressed with and it's the everyday
eyes shadow collections from Milani
I think these are so well done really
well put together
shadow combos maybe you're not into
having a huge palette you just want some
basics that work together these are so
nice because they've really balanced it
out well they've given you light shades
they giving you nice like matte mid-tone
transition crease colors you've got
darker shades that can give you some
nice definition I've got three of them
and I really like them all so I'll just
show you one of them that I'm wearing
today is this one called must-have
neutrals and you know for the taupe easy
easy smokey eye this is so classic so
wonderful but they execute the shimmers
well and the mattes are great too also
earthy elements for all of y'all who
love and can't get enough of the oranges
and the warm colors this is so beautiful
there are some shimmers in here that
just not my socks off I think those are
great and then wow the smoky essentials
palette gives you a little pop of blue
you know but you've also got your rich
dark black I love you know these blend
it out kind of medium tones that work so
effectively they're so soft and nice
seriously there is no reason why you
can't find great quality drugstore
eyeshadow out there these days because I
could have gone on and on I mean I could
have gone into some stuff from wet and
wild that I love covergirl is putting
out some great eyeshadow palettes too so
there's just a lot out there right now
but at number one this is an extremely
basic product a lot of you will say this
is a very unexcited product but I tell
you it makes a difference in every
single shadow whether it's buys art or
whether it's makeup revolution it makes
a difference in the way
every powder shadow specifically powders
apply and the way they cling and lasts
throughout the day and it's the Milani
eyeshadow primer if you can believe this
this was not even on my top 10 last year
I don't know where my head was at but
this is amazing this is my favorite eye
primer it takes just a tiny bit allow me
to show you just how little I use
between both eyes folks that's all I'm
working with you get it on one finger
you kind of distribute it between the
two of them and then just dab it first
all over your lid and then kind of
continue dabbing whatever little bit of
moisture might be left up through the
crease and all the way to the brow and
it is just the perfect base for any kind
of shadow I feel like my staying power
with shadow it's really never much of a
concern for me at all because this
allows stuff to cling and it also makes
your cheaper shadows shadows that you
didn't think we're very pigmented but
you still want to go ahead and get use
out of it it makes them stand out and
pop so much more like really if you're
looking at the stuff I've mentioned here
and you're making kind of a shopping
list of some things that you might want
to try if you are putting the shadow on
the list and let's say you've never
tried an eye primer and you're not
thinking about getting that eye primer
like you absolutely have to have the eye
primer eye primers just make every
shadow work better and they're a good
high-end ones too I've had my ups and
downs with like two faced shadow
insurance for a long time it works well
then I started getting tubes where
everything was getting separated I have
never had that weird like separation
issue in my tube of Milani eyeshadow
primer it stays one nice creamy
consistency not too tacky but not too
like smooth and dry either so it's
really just the bee's knees it is the
best and that my friends is my top ten
for eyes this year I feel just so
strongly about all these products I mean
so many fantastic things out there there
was loads of drugstore stuff on this
list as well which is really exciting
too so thank you guys so much for
spending time with me today I really
appreciate it and I am so pumped to
bring you my top 10 for lips as well
because my goodness do we have some
great things to talk about there also
I'll see you then
bye guys she's not she so I'm here to
handle all of them to handle all of the
logistics all of the logistics here
just working for you great you're in
I feel slightly violated yes mainly it's
the creepy camper slight sour cream but
