everyone I'm Tyler I'm hanging out here
in beauty broadcast Studio B not your
usual backdrop but I think it has its
charm
anyway Emma's been really concerned that
people are going to think she's just
going to fold it in this year given that
she's nine months pregnant and just
weeks away from giving birth to that I
say I got this
I said hon I'll take care of the witty
intros you just focus on the products
and let's face it there are plenty of
ways a third trimester pregnant lady
needs to spend her time tonight for
example
she's busy comparing brands of mint
chocolate chip ice cream while binging
on Hallmark Channel Christmas movies
rather falling asleep during the movie
no judgement here so like I've said
we're not phoning it in this year I mean
we're in my favorite room this is the
great backdrop I made this sign myself
and I took care of the lighting and
everything now it's time for him to take
over and do her thing up in in the main
studio hi everybody
kicking off the Emily Awards for 2016
for the first time ever in December I
can't believe it I can't believe it's
happening this way actually when I first
heard of our baby's due date and I heard
that it was in mid-january I thought
something's gonna have to change about
the similar orbits that was one of the
first thoughts seriously love doing this
sort of end-of-the-year wrap up on
products what are the top products
really breaking it down into face eyes
and lips last year for the first time
ever I chose to do it top ten style
which I really enjoy because I felt like
sometimes when you've got all these
nitty-gritty categories you can come up
with some sort of obligatory favorites
when you kind of force yourself to look
at an overall top ten in this case four
face products it really causes you to
give all of the things that you've been
using a really hard look and say you
know what was the best of the best
regardless of whether it was drugstore
high end a foundation
blush what we're really the most
impressive products so that is the way
I'm choosing to do it this year there
will be three parts face eyes and lips I
am truly just weeks away from giving
birth at this point still giving these
videos everything I've got while still
not you know completely driving myself
crazy I normally do a finale video and I
strategically have done recent videos on
tools and skincare which are a couple of
the main things that get mentioned in my
Emily awards finale so you might check
back on those videos if you're
interested in some of those products
that aren't you know technically like a
makeup product so without any more
babbling on let's get into the top ten
face products of the year one kind of
cool thing because this is the second
year I've done a top ten I will be
noting weather products are new to the
top ten this year or if they were on the
top 10 last year I'll mention whether
they moved up or down the list because I
think that's kind of interesting to have
a little frame of reference that will be
going ten to one leading up to you know
the ultimate best product or products
it's tricky this year number ten a
definite newcomer to my list and it is
the essence pure nude highlighter
absolutely love this highlight and I
think it's one of those products that I
could universally recommend across the
board to anyone because it's a soft
highlight it does not have the obvious
look of you know product on the skin I'm
wearing it today I feel like the glow is
soft it looks like something your skin
could actually produce and I'm
fascinated by highlighters that do that
because so many don't this nice little
highlight here just gives the perfect
amount of kind of like transparent glow
across the skin a thick finger swatch
really is a silly thing to do with this
because you're not going to wear it that
way it's going to be like this light
little glaze on top of the skin and I
love how undetectable it is
I love how even when it gets up in areas
where I'm like that could be a little
fine line danger zone I don't want to
get too much product up in that area it
still doesn't make me look Haggard or
make all the bad stuff stand out so the
affordability of this is tremendous it
says number 10 be my highlight I think
it's just the one shade that it comes in
as far as I know but a truly fantastic
like worth checking out at number nine
I've got another newcomer to my list
this year and it's the makeup revolution
blush palettes and my favorite one I
would say is hot spice but they also
have one called sugar and spice it's a
little cooler more pinky I'm holding hot
spice right now I love the quality in
these palettes nicely pigmented blushes
but they're not so like over-the-top
knock you over intense that you don't
feel like you can actually realistically
use them on a day-to-day basis you know
what I'm saying they're going to show up
they're going to show up true to color
but at the same time I think they're
user friendly and not hard to use so I
love for example in this one a really
nice range that you get today I'm
wearing this blush I went a little lower
on the cheek with that shade and then a
little pop of that coral right on the
apple of the cheek so radiant and fresh
and then you also get a couple of really
cool highlighting options that can
coordinate with these blushes or add
that little bit of extra glow on top you
can look really closely and see a little
bit of maybe a fine sparkle in a couple
of these shades I don't really notice
that translating to the cheeks I feel
like it's an overall matte selection of
color and you'll notice that when you
apply them and then you've got this
glowy stuff here where you can customize
how much shine you have on your cheeks
super great to work with low price tag
love the staying power as well at number
eight we've got a product that has
dropped back seven it was actually the
tip top product of the year last year
and it's still a tremendous product
anything getting mentioned in this top
ten is definitely a two thumbs up type
item but as I personally give my
recommendations here I think perhaps
I've become a bit more no-nonsense just
in terms of the amount of steps that I
want to take to apply something and the
amount of stuff that I want one product
to do this product is something that
really has to be like a partner to
something else it has to be mixed in
with something else I'm talking about
the cover FX custom cover drops I still
think they're a brilliant product they
come in a super wide shade range I wear
n35 it's a great way to amp up the
coverage of anything that you're using
whether that be a tinted moisturizer
just a standard
datian a regular just clear moisturizer
that you want to turn into a foundation
or something like that this is one of
those things that can really take you to
a very full coverage place and I like
the way they the finish on the skin the
way they come off but it's just by
nature of the way this is it's going to
be a mixer product you do have to take
that extra step to you know blend it in
make your little foundation cocktail so
I would say that's my small
justification for why this drop back
just a little bit but as I said I still
think it's a brilliant product to have
and it's really nice just to kind of
keep in your hip pocket keep in your
foundation drawer and use it when a
certain foundation doesn't meet your
expectations it's a great thing to have
not necessarily something I'm reaching
for every single day at number seven
I've got a product that dropped back 5
on my list still an exceptional product
but as you will see the things that are
higher up on my list I've just I've got
a reason why those are there as well but
I'm talking about the elf contour
palette amazing product I'm wearing this
today I wear this a lot and it doesn't
always get a mention doesn't always get
as much love as it should but if you are
wanting an affordable way to contour
this palette is totally it I love these
powders up top there's a teeny bit of
glow in this one this one's kind of like
just a matte sort of buttery creamy
powder a great cool contour and then a
little bit warmer shade that you can
bronze up the skin with these are creamy
rich nice feeling powders very pigmented
you do not have to scrub your brush into
these to get product off if you've got
this complex in your head the elf stuff
is cheap therefore it is not good
quality just throw that out the window
right now give this a try thank me later
it's a great way to contour at number
six I've got another newcomer to my list
I would say it edged out the elf palette
by just a little bit due to its
versatility but it's kind of a similar
idea it's the it cosmetics genocide qua
palette here and this is just such a
cool idea for having so many face powder
products all in one the blush the
translucent type of powder that could
just set your overall face set the under
eye whatever you need that's called
bye-bye pores sunshine in a calm
bronzor and then also the perfect
lighting Luminizer in the shade genocide
quoi seriously I throw this in my bag
and all face powder components are taken
care of that excites me so much I love
space-saving I really love multitasking
I love a lot of practical things that
certain products can do and so the fact
that this is one compact not for
different compacts and on top of it I
love the quality of each and everything
in there I mean that bye-bye pours
pressed powder is so cool that's a
really great feature I'm so glad they
put something like that in there because
that's super rare most of the time like
it's not unheard of to see a palette
that has blush bronzer and highlight all
together in one but to have that
additional powder that can be used sort
of in an all-purpose mattifying pore
reducing type of way I think that's huge
coming in at number five we've got a
product that has moved up one spot but
and this has been if you look back in my
employer Ward's archives this has been
part of the Emily awards for years and
it is the Rimmel lasting finish
foundation well the repackaging job they
did on this is not my favorite it's
still an outstanding product it is the
kind of foundation that is just about as
universal as it gets I think really good
coverage not the fullest fullest
coverage but I mean it really can even
out some issues on your skin the staying
power is phenomenal I feel like it's a
relatively thin liquidy foundation I
mean it's pretty traditional you know in
terms of the consistency but it neither
drives me out nor does it feel too heavy
either it's just like a perfect middle
ground classic liquid foundation that's
going to give you a buildable medium
coverage now number four gosh we're
really getting to the top of the list
here and this is a newcomer and it is
also a foundation but it's something
that gives what I would call dramatic
results on the skin coverage wise and
it's the urban decay all nighter
foundation this stuff whoo it is so so
good I will definitely be linking below
to the video where I went very in-depth
reviewing this product I wear it in the
shade 4.5 does
a pump coverage products are really
taking over the top of the Emily Awards
for face this year I mean there are just
some exceptional things out there and
for me personally I have been one who is
needed good coverage over time I have
had severe discoloration on the top of
my cheeks that's known as melasma mask
of pregnancy I tend to get that as a
result of I think the pregnancy hormones
and also sun exposure you pair those two
things together it's like the perfect
internal cocktail to produce that on my
skin there's been a long time where that
Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum cover
has worked really well to cover that up
in sort of a one-step way and I still
love that product I think this product
manages to do what that one does
coverage wise well-being not quite as
heavy that being said this is a heavier
foundation than the Rimmel that I just
mentioned but I can without a doubt say
it is full coverage without hesitation
this is just a completely like dramatic
result type of foundation if you really
have some discoloration problem areas to
cover you may want to look into that I
feel like we're just kind of walking up
the ladder of foundation e products here
at the top of the Emily Awards number
three is the it cosmetics CC cream and
this is up 5 from last year and I have
used this so much over the past year I
have recommended it so much I actually
do get a pro shroom time to time by
people in person and one of the main
questions that I will tend to get asked
just on the spot is about foundation and
for a lot of people this tends to be the
thing that really works well this has
really good coverage it also combines
moisturization SPF 50 it goes on the
skin in a very no-brainer type way you
can use your fingers you can use a brush
but it is a product with that CC cream
label on it that actually can deliver
coverage wise better coverage than any
other BB CC thing out there I've got
loads of respect for the fact that this
is multitasking and actually doing it
well it was really close between the
Rimmel the urban decay and this but for
all the things that this can do that's
why this is coming out
even above those I'm wearing this today
I'm never disappointed by the coverage
it gives me I love the little pomp style
here because I can always manage to use
the same amount every time always has
really good staying power it's just a
really exceptional product that I can
wholeheartedly recommend to people and
number two we've got an outstanding
coverage product that's a newcomer to my
list this year and it is the Tarte
shaped ape concealer I wear this in
light/medium I know this has received a
lot of hype and I do think it's pretty
deserving of it honestly I reviewed this
in the same video where I talked about
my Urban Decay all nighter foundation
and this is just one of those sort of
mind-boggling concealers that can cover
really really well but it's in this
liquidy state you know like I don't
think we always look at concealers or at
least I don't
I rarely look at concealers in this
format and expect them to give me the
best coverage but this really can go
there and also not look too heavy or dry
on my skin either I can wear it you know
in my under eye area and be very
satisfied with the way that looks and
the way it wears throughout the day I'm
not saying I would recommend this
concealer to every single person on the
planet because the more texture in terms
of like fine lines and stuff around the
eye area that you have this is not
giving back a ton of moisture to that
area that's the tiny red flag on this
one to be aware of but in general it
seems to be the kind of concealer that I
can reach for for most any need and
quickly take care of it now
number one we're at a tie here because
two different brands have put out a
product that I think is nearly identical
and formula but one brand is putting out
the peachy corrector shades and the
other brand has all the skin tone colors
so for me they're kind of coming out as
a tie it's like the same kind of product
you're just going to have to look to one
brand or the other depending on what
your specific need is so benefit erase
paste old favorite on the MLA awards
list this is up three for this year
because as I said I feel like I'm
valuing coverage above all else like
even if I didn't have foundation if I
had concealer I could make do you know
so concealer is reigning supreme this
year
and I love erased paste I wear it in the
shade medium which is going to give you
a really nice peachy tone to correct the
under-eye circles and I don't always
need to use it every day but when I need
it I definitely do need it I take
advantage of it right in here
this is also a really great product for
those of you who are dealing with dark
spots age spots any kind of darkened
discoloration on the skin this is really
great for not just covering it up but
absolutely camouflaging it like
canceling it out plus there's so much
moisture in this product so if you have
any amount of dryness which I'm starting
to get more and more of you know right
around that eye area I feel like this
replenishes the skin slightly I'm not
saying it claims to be any sort of
moisturizer or eye cream or anything of
that nature but it's much creamier and
more emollient than say a tart shape
tape is and then tied with that is the
anastacio concealer a great line of
cream concealers that feels just like
this texture wise but here you're going
to be getting all like skintone shades
so I have 2.5 just to hold him side by
shot side by side and show you the
difference in tone see how much more
rich and peachy the array space to get
and then these stay more on a skin tone
color level sometimes I'll use them in
combination with one another that's what
I did today I have a race based in my
deepest darkest parts and then I put
this stuff elsewhere on the skin if
you're the least bit dry I think you're
going to love what this does for your
skin because it gives you that coverage
but it does not zap your skin of the
moisture by day's end in my eyes these
are both concealers that I would want to
set at least lightly with a little bit
of powder but depending on your dryness
level you may have a different take on
that and by the way the tart shaped tape
I think is a total like setting powder
optional type thing I don't think you
really need it for that but I think both
of these concealers are just so valuable
they both have their place it's funny
how similar they are in feel but I
really kind of have to look to each
brand if I want you know either the
color correction or just the straight-up
traditional concealer type tones and
they are definitely at a tie at the top
of my list
concealer is just you know everything
remedy these days so thank you guys so
much for watching this top 10 I hope it
was informative I hope it really laid
out for you what some products are that
I think are just the best of the best in
terms of face I told myself before I
started I wasn't going to ramble on too
long about any one thing but that's darn
near impossible when you love the stuff
