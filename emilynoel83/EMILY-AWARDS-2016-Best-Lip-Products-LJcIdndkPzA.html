accommodations here at Beauty broadcast
Studio B I'm Tyler Emily's husband and
right-hand man for this year's Emily
Awards as I've said we're clearly not
cutting any corners this year I mean not
that anyone would think that I've got a
haircut I've got a totally different
shirt on and I've trimmed my beard as
far as Emily goes
I mean she's nine months pregnant no
shame in calling in the big guns the
truth is we've poked fun at all the easy
pregnancy targets watching movies eating
ice cream well just eating in general
m's actually been working her ass off
this entire pregnancy and it's only
gotten harder what's she really doing
working on potty training our
two-year-old editing and uploading
videos wrapping Christmas presents
struggling to find the proper technique
to pick things up off the ground so hats
off to everyone out there working hard
during the holidays during pregnancy or
just during life in general but here we
are for the third and final installment
of the Emily awards focusing on a
category near and dear to a Mart lip
products I mean the amount of lip
product she has in her possession is
downright scary so who better to give an
ultimate top ten ranking of the best of
the year am take it away hey everybody
it's time for Emily awards for lips I am
just so enthusiastic about the things
that I have compiled into this top ten
truly ten of the most spectacular lip
products I love lip products it's
probably the thing in makeup that just
gets me most excited and this year's top
ten is kind of interesting because I
feel like I've got newcomers at both the
very top and the bottom of the list and
then I've got some things that kind of
moved around shuffled around a little
bit since last year that are following
sort of somewhere in the middle but
everything I mean everything in this top
ten I really do feel like there's
something for everyone something I did
notice though is that it's really the
year of the lipstick for me I've got
like a couple you know non technically
lipstick products that made it onto the
list but that's real
what I have been using the most of this
year it's sorted the category of lip
products where I've discovered the most
awesome stuff still I feel like it's an
epic lip top-10 so if you love your lip
products cozying up with some snacks and
some coffee or whatever because this is
going to be this is going to be fun
number ten is I think the best liquid
lipstick out there I'm not a huge liquid
lipstick fan takes a lot to impress me
because I feel like when you start to
feel the discomfort on your lips the
dryness that those products create odds
are your lips also aren't looking that
great either okay and I love
practicality I love staying power but if
it's coming at the expense of the way it
actually looks on your lips and the way
it feels then if it can't be the whole
package I'm not interested so there is
one that I found that I think works
really really well and it's the bare
minerals Gen nude line of liquid
lipsticks the matte liquid lipsticks and
my favorite shade that I've used is
actually the color called boss and I
think it's a really pretty kind of dusty
rose neutral really pretty shade I've
tried several other nudes from a small
kit as well and I like those too but
these feel super light going on your
lips and they do get to that totally
matte place you know they're not kidding
about them being met but yet they always
maintain a comfortable feel and that's
really hard for a lot of products to do
application wise I enjoy it as well
because instead of being a standard doe
foot applicator it is sort of that flat
applicator that comes out very clean on
the sides and I think when you've got
cleaned off edges that's what helps you
get right out to the outer edge of your
lips without gooping it up with too much
product so I think it's a good design I
think it's a really good quality product
they don't last as long as some of those
matte liquid lipsticks that just
completely like 100% set these you can
pull a little product off of them but as
you wear them they do wear a decently
long time and they wear evenly and
that's really important to me too so I
think the bare minerals Jen you
definitely most comfortable best liquid
lipstick number nine it's hard for me to
believe that this is a newcomer to my
list it really is
that I've loved it just hasn't gotten a
lot of love in the Emily Awards for
whatever reason but it's Revlon Super
Lustrous lipsticks it does not get more
classic and old-school than these I
think there are shades in this line that
have been around forever and to this day
I think they keep a really nice shade
range available and it's not just colors
but also finishes it's a nice formula it
just feels really creamy and if you're
willing to take a little extra time and
you know apply some do a blot apply a
little more blot it off again you know
that technique can really help the
staying power of some of these bold
creamy shades so a few that I just
wanted to mention and highlight here I
know I've talked about black cherry
before but if you like a really vampy
rich lip color this can go to that
deepest darkest place but if you want to
wear it in a more sheared out way apply
it lightly with a lip brush and it will
look like the most beautiful berry color
so this color in particular is a lot of
bang for your buck also this time of
year you know cherries in the snow it's
a fun a little bit different like
alternative to a classic red I feel like
it's a very reddish pink and so that's a
gorgeous one very iconic color in the
line and then one that I thought I had
lost but I found it in my purse recently
it's called berry Haute and it is just a
great little like lilac II sort of lilac
II it's a very purpley berry but it's a
lot of fun I think with the kind of
simple eye nude you know colors on the
eyes and this lip so so pretty so if
you've never explored the Super Lustrous
lipsticks you know they are nothing new
to the drugstore so it's not going to be
the kind of thing that's constantly
getting hyped up left and right but
start looking through some of these
shades find a couple that you think
might interest you and I think you'll be
really impressed with the formula as
well as the color intensity and number
eight something new this year is the
Rimmel Kate Moss nude line I just
thought this was a fantastic release
really well done they put out a whole
like a spectrum of nude lipsticks and I
have my best luck finding this at
Walgreens by the way I had purchased
several I think the lasting finish
formula is really good very comfortable
these all seem to be creams that don't
have shimmer in them
rimmel has really done some great lip
products over time I enjoy their matte
formula as well the Kate Moss mats that
are in the red tubes but most recently I
mean if you're a nude lip lover these
are such pretty tones really and I have
a lighter one in number 45 and this one
has like the littlest bit of pink it's a
really gorgeous dusty pink nude I love
that color it was kind of unexpected for
me and then number 47 is one of their
definitely deeper colors here and it's
kind of like a little bit caramel a
brownish nude I can reach for this in so
many circumstances this is lived in my
purse quite a bit the formula does
remind me a lot of the Revlon Super
Lustrous so there's kind of a reason why
I'm gravitating toward these but if you
like nudes that are all the way to the
lightest end or if you're wanting
something that's more just a deep
neutral that line really has you covered
at number seven yet another newcomer to
my list but something that I very
recently have decided I just enjoy the
heck out of and it's the Clinique chubby
stick intense
I love these lip products so much they
are an intense dose of color they're
that easy kind of approachable crayon
type format I've got a couple of the
ultra little bitty minis here that came
in that tiny temptation set normally
they would be you know maybe double this
length and I realize my tiny temptations
hook together like that isn't that cool
but they're smooth they're creamy
they're not loaded with shine there's a
little bit of thickness to these that's
not at all like an uncomfortable
thickness but they're different they're
totally different formula from a regular
chubby stick and they have put out some
gorgeous shades I like how with just a
little bit of wear you know when there's
hardly any shine to begin with and then
you just wear them for a little while
they have this pretty like just sort of
matte appearance on the lips and some of
the deeper more rich shades do wear a
surprisingly long time and your lips
never feel parched like it's still a
creaminess that you feel but everyone
else to look at your lips might think
it's like a pretty matte color that
she's got going on there you know every
person that you approach is just
analyzing the lip code
right like I was saying I got to sample
a lot of these in the set that I got
recently and so a couple that I loved on
the curviest caramel shade I thought
that was so nice and wearable for kind
of a little bit peachy nude not a super
light nude but just very wearable for
many occasions and then for something
with a little more impact roundest
raspberry I thought was gorgeous because
it had just this littlest bit of like
purple splash in this very color you
know I really like my berry shades so
for this to kind of set itself apart as
something slightly different you know
it's really a standout color now number
six I've got something that's very very
comparable I think to the Clinique
chubby stick intense but in terms of
being practically like a lip treatment
and something that is just the most
deeply nourishing and hydrating lip
product that I will have in this top 10
you know for that reason it's edging out
the Clinique chubby sticks just a little
bit and it's something I've loved for
years it's dropping back three spots
this year and it's the Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks if you've
been with my channel for a while now and
you haven't tried these yet where you
been you know what do you think about
these are great great lip products they
put out an initial launch and everything
in the line had just a little bit of
like I don't want to say frost or
shimmer but there was just a hint of
satiny finish sheen to all those shades
and then more recently I would say
within the past year and a half they put
out some new colors some bolder shades
some nudes as well and everything was
creamy without any sort of shimmer so
now I think they've got a pretty
well-rounded selection of colors let's
say that I'd probably use the most this
rich raisin kind of dusty deep red you
know it's not a pure red at all but it's
a little bit deeper than that yeah it's
so wearable I always go back to this
story but I wore these in North Dakota
when I endured the coldest cold I'd ever
experienced one winter when we were up
visiting Simon Tyler's family there and
my lips never got chapped in the wind in
the sub-zero temperatures there is just
a special thickness in these products
that goes a little bit thicker than the
Clinique chubby stick intense and a
little bit creamier and you can grab for
just about any color and I assure you
you're getting the color but you're
getting like a lip balm type treatment
all in one another one of the new
shades that I've really liked is this
cherry pink and this kind of reminds me
a little bit of Revlon cherries in the
snow but it's just one example of kind
of the way they've given that line of
lip colors a bit of a makeover with some
new shade
definitely worth looking into for anyone
and especially those who have a dry lip
problem they're great and number five
I've got something that was pushed down
a few slots in my top ten here mainly
just because some other like really
amazing things sort of worked it down
the list of it but I still think it's an
awesome product and definitely my top
lip liner and it is the NYX slide on
liners so these were on the list last
year and I think these are so good such
a low price tag for a lip liner that can
really wear a long long time it could be
a great long wearing base for so many
products I think one of the most
valuable shades for me over the past
year has really been the nude and this
color is called nude suede shoes and
it's exactly what I want my nude lip
liner to be you know I want it to have
just a little bit of depth so a lot of
times right after I apply a nude
lipstick I can go around and give my
lips just a little extra definition not
in that major contrast like your lip
liner is one color the lipstick is
another type of way but just something
that's going to mesh with so many light
to neutral lip shades or like I said
fill in your entire lips with this these
are really smooth and capable of doing
that but then they set and so I've just
been so happy with that and it's really
nice to have a good red lip liner and
the one in this line is called red tape
and I think that's just a gorgeous
option as well they have sort of a more
orange e reddish shade they have a
deeper red this would be like the most
classic red I see it working with most
like middle-of-the-road red lipsticks
but those are just a couple to look into
it's a great line of products number
four we've got bite bites amuse-bouche
lipsticks which this was a change from
last year last year at the time that I
did the Emily Awards it was the luminous
cream lipsticks and then they kind of
revamped the formula /name and it's now
amuse-bouche and I still think they're
fantastic I honestly don't feel like
they put some major change on the
formula from years
it's still a very like luxurious creamy
feeling lip product and there seem to be
a lot of bright colors in the line but
truly you cannot go wrong with byte
lipsticks if you like that creamy
formula I mean it's not totally matte
it's not loaded with a greasy feeling
shine either but it's a little bit
thicker and richer I would say on the
lips then say a Revlon Super Lustrous
lipstick it feels like a bit more
product as depositing on your lips as
you go across the smoothness and
application is outstanding the
comfortableness the comfort is just
spectacular and a couple of shades you
know I've been trying that little set
which i think was an outstanding value
the $25 holiday said that they put out
very recently and fig is a shade that
they have definitely held over from when
they made the luminous cream formula and
it's a really nice pink not too pink you
know it's very wearable it's just enough
like pretty pop to the lips and then
I've really enjoyed pepper as well which
is a much more muted dusty pink these
two combined make it really pretty combo
if you got that set you know it's really
fun to sort of mix and match some of
these shades but I just think it's it's
an amazing formula it really is at
number three I have a tie and they are
both probably my favorite like drugstore
lip product find over the past year it's
a combination of beautiful colors and
extremely luxurious buttery rich feeling
formula and also just a format of
product that I really enjoy and I'm
talking about the new Revlon Ultra HD s
that have been given a makeover and then
also the flower beauty hydra silk lip
colors these are very similar in the way
they apply on the lips we're talking
creamy rich free from shimmer I would
say both formulas give a lot of shine to
the lips the flower beauty hydra silks
have just a little bit more
I was recently comparing in a favorites
video the fact that I have a shade
called HD desert from Revlon and I've
got the flower beauty hydra silk in rose
petal and these two shades are darn near
identical the hydrosoul just has a
little bit more
there's probably the best color range
available with the Revlon's I also love
my HD Vineyard shade which is a bit more
of a rich berry color but these feel and
remind me so much of Revlon lip butters
you know they do have the intensity of
colors Revlon lip butters always had
pretty intense shades but they're easy
to wear they feel so smooth gliding on I
think they call these a gel lip color
and they are truly even creamier than
just a classic lipstick and the flower
beauty hydro soaps are awesome as well
for many of the same reasons you know
nourishing to the lips they don't dry
you out I love the skinny format of both
of these because it gives you just that
little bit more precision than a
lipstick does rose petal again the most
basic of basic colors like any person
could wear this to the workplace and be
totally appropriate look really nice and
finished it is one of those
quintessential neutral pinks and I just
think you can't go wrong experimenting
with either of these lines you're going
to find something you like at number two
a very interesting product I'm not even
quite sure how to classify this thing
because I wouldn't call it a liquid
lipstick I can't call it a lipstick
either or a lip gloss but it's the NARS
Velvet lip light it's kind of made its
own little category I guess for what it
is it's a liquefied product that you're
going to apply with a wand but it does
not have any of the dryness associated
with a liquid lipstick but yet it gives
you really nice color intensity and the
way these go on they have a lightness
that's sort of surprising because you
might think like okay what kind of thick
color am i gooping on my lips but no
it's a light very very smooth feeling
velvet lip light it does feel velvety
going on that's a great name for these
I've done a whole video by the way on
every shade in this line so please check
that out for much more detailed info but
you have so much control with this wand
again it's one of those flattened out
dough foots that gives you some not so
loaded down areas on the side so you can
really get out to the edges of your lips
have all the definition you could want
that you instantly feel moisture and
that moisture does hang around and then
the way it wears it's almost like these
cut
stained your lips a little bit and the
long wear that these have on your lips
I'm not even putting these in the same
conversation with a lot of the liquid
lipsticks that kind of state their own
layer you know what I mean like on your
lips and then they start to flake off in
their own little patches throughout the
day this is a product that's going to
nourish the lips it'll feel practically
like it is one with your lips and as it
wears down it does so completely evenly
I have done wear tests with so many
different shades from the lighter ones
to the deeper ones and it never looks
patchy or bad or on your lips and that's
because it's not drying out your lips as
you wear them so they're a very special
like liquefied lip product that just
goes above and beyond for beautiful
color an actual nice feel and still some
impressive wear although they're not
claiming to be a long wear lip product
that's the thing like they didn't even
have that in their PR materials that
these were going to be a really long
wear product but they just do happen to
have a little like stain ability on your
lips to throw the bare minerals Jen nude
into this conversation you know these
are creamier than that you're going to
be able to like press your lips together
and really sort of push some product
around so to speak and you'll notice a
little bit of shine when these are newly
applied but then as you wear them just a
little bit you know you'll lose some of
that they're not like a high gloss
finish by any means anyway the couple of
shades I've been gesturing with I love
bound because I think bound is one of
those colors that so many people could
sort of become attached to find easy to
wear get tons of use out of I know that
you know the cost for one of these is
obviously more pricey than some of the
drugstore things I've mentioned so you
tend to want to get shapes that you'll
wear a lot of so bound I think is a very
wearable pink you as you can see it's a
little bit more of a mafia pink a really
spectacular read in this line that I
love the most that I think is the most
wearable and the most like kind of
classic red in the whole line they do
have several but l'p Alice is probably
my favorite one spectacular intensity
just a beautiful look on the lips but
they've really come up with a unique
feeling lip product as well so I'm very
happy with those and given all the
praise that
in those velvet lip lights you're
probably wondering what's going to top
that what's going to come above that on
the list and I can tell you it's another
new find this year another newcomer to
my list and talking about Besame Besame
lipsticks have rocked my world from the
moment I first applied them it's a
combination of loving the product loving
what the brand stands for and is trying
to accomplish and just the beauty that I
feel when I'm wearing them I'm not
saying like oh I'm wearing a Besame
lipstick today look how pretty I am no
that's not it it's just like you feel
glamorous you can't apply one of these
and not feel like okay I've taken myself
up a notch right now you know they have
so many cool colors each and every one
of their lipsticks has been inspired
specifically by a certain year a certain
product that the owner has gone back and
researched and found like a vintage
lipstick that she wants to recreate she
swatched it out she's looked at the
pigments and has come up with a formula
to become an exact replica of those
colors and that fascinates me the brand
does have a ton of Reds like this would
be a go to red lipstick brand I think
for anybody but as you do a little
digging and what they have to offer you
know there are some orange shades I have
a gorgeous pink that I'm going to
mention here I have like a brownish
neutral that's so so pretty I first
tried these through this little sampler
kit and now I am so completely hooked
something I realized in the sampler set
was that like almost all of the shades
have the same formula except there was
one the one cherry red shade kind of had
a little bit more of a matte look on the
lips but I would just you know read the
descriptions of each color go actually
to the Besame cosmetics website and
there are great descriptions for each
and every shade there's a really
beautiful and so natural seeming and
Lights vanilla sweetness in the scent of
all of these and the product feels so
great on the lips it's a cream formula
with a lot of cling and a lot of
intensity like these Reds it's funny
because there are so many Reds in the
collection
they are also pigmented that you will
notice I think the distinct difference
is between different Reds if you try
several you know the way to apply these
is absolutely put them on and I've kind
of started liking to put them on with a
lip brush first so that gives you sort
of a stain level type of color blot that
off
apply some more either with your lip
brush or straight from the tube and then
blot it one more time and after you do
that you have such locked in staying
power that method works well for a lot
of different cream lipsticks it works
really well for these because like I
said there they're creamy but they're
not the least bit greasy there's just a
little bit more maybe stiffness to these
than like a bite amuse-bouche lipstick
and that's okay for me because so many
of the colors are so so intense and they
really do stay in place so the color
I've been wearing all video long is
actually called blood red I think it's
an awesome wintery and deeper take on
red I also like a very pure red from
this line called red hot red and this is
like the Marilyn Monroe signature red I
wore this in my old Hollywood get ready
with me video ad just spectacular color
coming out of that one and then a couple
of shades like from my sampler set which
these are available in full sizes I
think red velvet and the 1946 replica
color is one of the most popular shades
in their line it's not quite as bright
as red hot red but also not as deep as
the blood red that I'm wearing right now
very very classic easy red I've got this
color called chocolate kiss that is the
1970 replica shade and this one is much
more neutral has a lot of brown in it
and that's a gorgeous color too where
was my pink okay I promise I'll stop
after this one but this color called
portrait pink stunning stunning pink
color you've got to try these you guys
get get yourself one make it be like
your most fantastic little beauty treat
I mean you will love it and just the
feel of these going on the lips it's
just an experience it's a really cool
line with a very specific like niche a
very specific purpose and they execute
on that so well and they've got blushes
in this
line they've got like old-school cake
mascaras in this line I really want to
try that - every last detail from the
product to the gorgeous packaging I mean
it's just a 1 absolutely great and that
is all for the Emily awards for lips I
feel like I'm just looking at these
products thinking yes
