joining me for day 3 of the Emily Awards
we're kicking things off dark and early
outside and I've got so many categories
to cover here we have 8 different
categories for bronzer blush and
highlight yes when you really start
thinking about these different products
there are so many different formats so
many different needs so as with all of
these videos I hope to make the buying
process the product selecting process
just maybe a little less confusing I
hope you guys have been enjoying
everything so far as I'm sitting here
shooting this I haven't posted any of
the other videos I'm trying to get out
ahead of it some if you want links as
far as where to buy these products or
any links to prior reviews or other
videos with more information on any of
the things that I might be mentioning I
will have all of that stuff included in
the little info box down here below the
video you know you're listening to an
old-school youtuber when they still call
it the info box it's no longer like a
box it's a drop-down you know fancy
thing now so my first category here is
bronzer and for high-end we're going
kind of old-school with this pick but
having used it quite a bit recently I'm
just getting so reminded of why I love
this product and it's the laura geller
bronzed and brighten and I believe this
is available now in two shades this is
regular or medium I'm not sure exactly
how they refer to it but then there's a
lighter option as well and what we have
here with this product is a swirl of so
many different shades you've got
out-and-out Brown you got tans beige a
little bit of pink and even white
swirled in here but the end result is I
think a very very workable bronzer and I
even use this like but I'm in a hurry
and I've got this within other palettes
too
but if I'm kind of rushing it I'll use
this for the light bronze dusting all
over my skin and then concentrated in
certain areas just as a contour laura
geller baked products lasts forever
they're kind of domed up here you'll use
it and use it and you'll feel like
where's the product going but this can
be dark okay that's a really
concentrated swatch of it we're that
same products watched from a different
part of the pan can look quite a bit
lighter
see that there so I just use kind of a
fluffy brush like an elf complexion
brush and sort of dab various places
across the palate and I'm always happy
with the results I would overall
classify this as a matte bronzer
although it just it looks very natural
on the skin there's some that might be a
little drier chalky looking I think this
looks very natural my drugstore pick for
best bronzer is the elf bronzer or are
the elf bronzer palettes because there
are two options they have a lighter and
a deeper I'm holding the deeper one here
I think it's awesome that they have that
option and adds this whole elf system
goes if you're not familiar these pans
pop out so let's say you picked up a
blush palette or even a highlight
palette of this type you could kind of
mix it up and put the different pants
together and create your own palette but
again just for an example here this is
the one called deep bronzer and I am
wearing this shade it just kind of all
over my skin as a contour today this one
has a nice cool really deep shade here a
little more warmth in your top two
shades awesome pigmentation easy to
blend across the skin great staying
power I think elf just all-in-all has a
good thing going with this style of
palette because they put some real
quality products in there for best
contour product I have a couple of
palettes to mention and for high-end I
have used this so much throughout this
year it's the lorac pro contour palette
this is one of those products that
didn't grab me immediately when I first
bought it and the more I've just gone
for it over this year the more I've
loved it and yeah it doesn't look like
I've used a lot of it and this is the
same way it goes with my lorac powder
eyeshadow palettes because you'll love
certain shades you go back use them and
use them and use them certain ones only
look slightly worn down because it
doesn't take a lot if you like the color
payoff that you get from lorac
eyeshadows you may really enjoy this
they have a very deep shade here I go
somewhere usually between the light and
the medium contour like I'll sometimes
dab into both but another thing I really
love is that they've got this matte
beige highlight which is so intense and
it can be really nice as an under eye
setting powder obviously used a little
lighter not so full-on as I showed there
in the swatch and then they've got a
gorgeous shimmer highlight as well
light pearly could work for any skin
tone you've got a little bit more yellow
total powder here as well as with most
any contour palette these can work great
as eyeshadows but I just think the
quality here is so good and it's such
an unsung hero type of product in terms
of the makeup landscape these days and
then a drugstore option did I mention
how I like these elf pallets elf makes a
fantastic contour palette you've heard
this mentioned in at least the last
couple of years of the Emily Awards but
I think they do a really nice job with a
condensed easy to use just the
necessities type of contour palette now
the lorac is gonna give you more of a
shade option because it goes darker and
it goes lighter so it might be a little
easier to hone in on exactly the shades
you want in the lorac but as far as elfs
little palette here goes you've got your
kind of cool tone contour shade also
kind of this warm it up a bronzer type
color which they're great kind of mixed
you know bounce your brush back and
forth use some hand-in-hand with one
another this is a beige matte powder
that you can use in any number of ways
and then this light shade here just has
a subtle bit of glow so I would call
this one from elf a very beginner
friendly contour palette I've loved it
for years and even still comparing it
across so many different contouring
palettes that I've tried recently this
one is still really fantastic talking
about powder blush I've got a high-end
and a drugstore favorite my high-end
favorite while it is a line of blushes
that I really like I have one
specifically that I really want to point
you in the direction of it's from Marc
Jacobs and it's the err blush in flesh
and fantasy this is an interesting thing
here yeah I'm showing this to you and
you might be thinking hmm is that really
a gorgeous blush well I'm wearing it
today am I going crazy or is this not
like perfect here this blush shade
perfect for like anything I mean Here I
am wearing this orchid colored top and I
feel like this works this color is like
dusty rose and you see how they've like
overlapped and kind of layered in this
highlighter color which is so beautiful
and I love the fact that you can wear
the blush and you can wear the highlight
as two separate products or you can kind
of bounce your brush within it all and
create your own kind of custom shade and
not every blush in this line is exactly
this way some of them are more like
overlapping blush shades so one has more
like a pinky blush and a berry plummy
color and they're kind of coming
together so it's an interesting line to
look into but this shade I think is just
so perfect I like
popping it just a little lower on the
cheeks and then just slightly bringing
it up so I'm wearing this mostly
concentrated on this in today and a
different highlight so I could show you
another product I just think this is a
really special blush I love it so much
and then my drugstore pick for best
blush I believe this one last year as
well um is from makeup revolution they
do some really nice blush palettes a
nice highlight palettes too but one of
my favorites is this blush palette in
hot spice they also have a cooler more
pinky one but this one like these are my
shades
see how it's the earthy kind of dusty
peach colors that I think ours is so
flattering on so many skin tones and you
got like more of a pure peach down here
they throw in a couple of different
toned highlighting options one more
pinky one a little bit more warm peach
the pigmentation on these blushes is
great it's the kind of blush that you
would swatch and be like oh yeah that's
pigmented but they're realistic shades
so you don't feel scared about applying
them to your skin you know what I'm
saying because there are some blushes
that are so pigmented and you get that
initial thrill of like wow I've got a
great quality blush here but then you
actually move on to the act of putting
it on the skin and it's like did I need
that much you know color payoff this is
just the perfect sweet spot for blush
and more recently I've tried an
individual blush from makeup revolution
this is called fusion and it says just
the matte blush powder and this one's
really pretty as well and this is that
kind of color that I like I would call
it dusty peach super flattering looks
nice with everything from a red lip to a
nude lip cream and liquid blush I have a
new find for this year for my high end I
guess it's technically a liquid blush
favorite here and it's from NARS their
product is literally just called liquid
blush and I think this is such a cool
thing this is a potent product okay so
you pump out a little bit of this on
your hand and apply it to the skin and
it just takes the tiniest like drop of
this stuff I love the shade Dolce Vita
because to me that shade is the epitome
of in from the cold rosy cheeks and I
love that kind of look and I've often
times advised using an elf small stipple
brush to apply a creamy product to the
skin but one thing I have learned is
that I like to use a more densely packed
bristle brush to put this on
synthetic bristles but something that
looks more like a classic blush brush
and then I'll put it on this way and
blend it in because guys when I say this
is a liquid blush it is a true liquid
and I think sometimes the spread-out
bristles of a stippling brush can almost
make the application a bit more streaky
nothing can't eventually get to where
you want to be with it but it can just
take more work when you use the
densely-packed brush I like to again
squeeze just the minimal amount onto my
hand get it onto the brush and then
blend it right onto the skin like you
would a powder and it's gorgeous if
you've gotten bored with blush if you
just need something new to experience I
would look into that now a drugstore I
don't have a favorite here no let me
rephrase that
I have many favorites but everything's
getting discontinued what's happening to
the Maybelline master glaze blush sticks
nowhere to be found online anymore also
the Maybelline Dream bouncy blushes you
look those up on altas website not
seeing them I've got blush sticks from
like two other brands that I really
liked and everything is getting phased
out are we gonna get into some cream
blush drugstore Renaissance here in the
coming year or is the stuff just not
selling and people are totally over it I
don't know for powder highlight here
very excited about this because I have
two separate categories one is subtle
one is intense because it's an apples
and oranges kind of thing as I've
mentioned in past videos sometimes with
these products a beautiful intense
highlight can be great for some people
but for other people if I'm leaving the
subtle highlight out of the conversation
you know it becomes kind of an issue and
when you're doing seven days of Emily
awards you can afford to cater to all
the crowds that are out there watching
so that's what I'm doing that's subtle
highlight high-end no doubt about it
laura geller baked french vanilla
special product here um this is the kind
of thing where I maybe have found some
clothes things that sort of resemble
this from other brands but nobody's
quite nailed it super dead-on this is
verging guys on a matte highlight with
just a hint of pearlescent Sheen to it
this is for the people looking to
actually brighten the skin without a lot
of shimmer maybe you know you've got a
lot of texture issues you really don't
want to draw attention to it so you just
want something to bring some light to
the area you'll also find that the
texture
this product is so pleasing it's so not
cakey not dry even though it's a powder
it doesn't go across the skin looking
dry so I would highly recommend this
I've used this product for years I mean
the review that I'll link to below is
going back to the old house doing a
beauty broadcast Express review on this
product my subtle highlight from the
drugstore that I really love and I think
this is the last elf palette that I'm
mentioning today but it's the elf
illuminating palette what they've done
here is put in four I think very subtle
easy natural highlight shades nothing in
this palette is over-the-top if you're a
fan of subtle highlights you're not
gonna get this and feel like you have to
leave out any one of these shades
because they're all super natural but
all kind of follow their own special
tones so you've got something really
warm and sunny down here this one is so
interesting here because doesn't it
almost look like a beige color I don't
know but it's got the slightest hint of
glow going on yep this one up here it's
a little bit pearly and one that has a
slight pink tone you have room to
experiment but you have four different
tones and they're all just super like
soft lighting kinds of shades is how I'd
put it
now for my highlighting of fanatics out
here my intense highlighting category I
would say my favorite high-end formula
is the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
and specifically the one I've been
loving really recently is the prismatic
amethyst and by the way the packaging on
this is so beautiful and that's the
product on the inside we're talking kind
of a lilac e pink shift to this shade
and I've got it on very very lightly
here I think I'm gonna reapply a little
bit but a cool thing to know about this
shade is that they are putting out a
highlighting trio palette that contains
this and moonstone and one other shade I
can't remember it right now but that
might be an even better value than that
just this if you want a sample but it
gives this gorgeous really different
looking glow I was surprised that I like
this one as much as I do because
generally speaking I don't love a super
pink highlight but it's not super pink
it's just brightening and when you're in
the light just a certain way you see
just a little bit of lilac and it's so
fun but whether you pick this shade
whether you go with opal moonstone
the champagne pop I think Becca does an
intense highlight really well because
even though it's intense on the skin
you're not seeing chunks of glitter I
really don't think I've ever been
unhappy with any of the shades that I've
tried so definitely recommend Becca but
for a drugstore option if you want a
nice intense highlight I would say the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips are a
nice way to go these not only can be
your highlight but I've used these so
many times in a multitasking way as
eyeshadows just using the different
strips but these can be really intense
for sure and this one that I'm holding
is the Vegas strip shade and a little
tip here if you're wanting to get this
champagne pop effect this shade when you
kind of mix the upper and lower parts of
it you end up with a color that's very
very similar to the shade and finish of
Becca's champagne pop category number
seven is for cream and liquid highlight
and for high-end this is a multi year
award winner here this formula I don't
want to say I like it better than the
powder but I think it's even more unique
and special I guess in the spectrum of
highlights and it's the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter liquid this is what a
full size looks like although I've been
living off of minis for the longest time
and around the holidays you'll find they
put out a lot of sets that might have a
mini one with like a wand applicator and
then like a little powder or something
definitely something you want to look
into because these highlights and this
one is in the champagne pop shade it
doesn't get more naturally radiant than
this and you could mix this in with a
moisturizer with a foundation or just
take it across the tops of your cheeks
with a brush and it's like you can't put
your finger on the fact that there's
makeup on your skin it just looks
radiant it's truly like the glow is
coming from within this adds no
additional powdery texture obviously to
your skin and you don't have to worry
about chunky glittery particles they
just Becca's doing it right with the
highlights that's all I can say and then
a drugstore favorite and for a liquid
cream highlight is the Wet n Wild mega
cushion this is in the shade
who's that pearl and I think this might
be the only shade that they have and I'm
not like super gaga for the whole
cushion idea I don't think that's an
essential part of what makes this good
but just the product itself
it's a really pretty highlight and I'm
only using like my little camera this
works better pull the mirror up I'm just
dabbing a little bit of that on there
it's just really super brightening I
think the very fair-skinned could wear
this and get a good impact I know I've
heard from a lot of you who say you have
really light skin and you struggle to
make certain highlights show up
something about that just the overall
brightness and the little bit of pink in
this color I think it'll really pop and
absolutely as light as air no added
weight to this product on the skin my
last category here is a face multi
palette and I really couldn't find a
drugstore option that I was getting
super excited about one thing I would
mention though all the great elf stuff
like what I've talked about in this
video the bronzers the contour the
highlighters they even make great little
blush palettes as well you could put
together a multi palette from ELF stuff
just combining different ones that you
have so there's that option but this has
been such a huge favorite of mine here
in the last part of the year and it's
the hourglass ambient lighting edit
volume 3 beautiful rose gold packaging
but what's inside is so just the
necessities it's really really good I
love the two tones of blush and the
bronzer I bought the one that they put
out the year prior and that bronzer was
okay but it was quite a bit lighter and
this one I find works so well is just a
natural like warm up the skin step they
give you the ambient powders in diffused
light and dim light and I kind of like
to bring diffused light right in this
area here I think it brings some light
and some life to that zone although it's
not like a really shimmery powder it's
very hard to put your finger on that and
then dim light is kind of fun to mix in
with the blushes and you can get a super
customized like you want that color but
you don't want it as dark you want that
color but you don't want it as bright
you kind of bring in a little bit of dim
light or at least that's the way I
bounce around with it and then this
highlight is so stunning too it's right
smack dab in the middle of the bouncing
off your skin highlight and the really
subtle it's like you mix that all
together and you get this beautiful look
but I use this all the time and I
haven't gotten tired of it and almost
every time I use it I use every shade
except maybe sometimes I'll use one or
the other in terms of the blushes but I
get constant use out of it all and just
think that's a fantastic idea
there and I would like to see more of
that kind of thing pulled off
effectively from a drugstore brand that
you know that's what my channel is for
to be around all year and bring you new
finds as they come I hope this was fun
and helpful for those of you blush
bronzer and highlight lovers out there
and I will see you next time with my
first eye related videos so get excited
it's coming tomorrow see you guys soon
