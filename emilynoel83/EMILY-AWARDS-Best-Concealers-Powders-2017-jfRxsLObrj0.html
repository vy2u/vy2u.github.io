true love gave to me two hands
approaching a baby bump my dream hey
everybody welcome to day two of the
Emily awards I'm so glad to have you
here this is where I round up my
favorites both high-end and drugstore
for all different categories of makeup
everything I could think of and so for
this particular video the focus is going
to be concealers and powders I kind of
feel like concealers and powders go
hand-in-hand because once you finish the
conversation about concealer it's like
then what are you gonna set it with her
are you gonna bake and blah blah blah so
I think it all works together we're have
a total of seven categories in this
video so I'm gonna try to bust through
it fairly quickly and I will definitely
link below to any additional information
or videos that I've done and perhaps
applying or reviewing these products so
if you want more in a lot of cases
you'll be able to find more so category
number one this category is correctors
and for me I'm focusing specifically on
the peachy tone correctors that can be a
great helper for dark under-eye circles
or dark spots discoloration melasma any
type of dark discoloration on the face
the peachy tone corrector is what you
want to go toward and I know there may
be other good correctors that are
lavender or green or whatever but I just
don't have a lot of experience with
those this is the type of corrector that
has been such an essential for me so my
high-end favorite my number one for sure
favorite here is the benefit buying
brightening concealer if you've missed
out on some videos here
this is a race paste erase paste got
renamed boying brightening concealer and
I wear it in the shade too it's a really
fantastic peachy tone I did do a whole
video kind of comparing this to the
original version and even though they
went and gave it a new name as far as
it's the actual product I think it
performs really effectively and it gives
me the same results as originally raised
space so if I have any kind of melasma
peeking through on the tops of my cheeks
I will put this kind of thing on it or
you know the dark caverns on the inner
part of the eye where you can just look
down right like ashy blueish grey like
put some of this on there it can be a
great pairing with other concealers that
you might want to put over
your patches of the skin but this is
going to correct the darkness a
corrector is very important because if
you are just tackling the darkness with
any sort of just plain old skin tone
concealer a lot of times you will
lighten that darkness but you won't
completely camouflage it so that's where
the PG tone corrector works it's magic
so my high end favorite and I think the
best texture out there that's very non
drying super creamy is the Boyne
brightening concealer shade two for me
and then a slightly lower cost
alternative would be the pixie
correction concentrate and brightening
peach you can find this at Target this
is also a wonderful shade to use it's a
little less amoliant compared to the
benefit but it still works really really
well and if you're just you know wanting
it in some really pinpointed areas this
is a great option too so definitely a
couple of really strong recommendations
there category number two I want to talk
about liquid concealers see why I wanted
to do like all these videos and really
hash out these topics because comparing
a liquid concealer to a corrector or
even a creamy concealer like they're all
different things lumping them all into
one category and just picking one or two
favorite concealers may not like do the
job so I think it's really great to have
these different categories but my
favorite high-end liquid concealer is
the Tarte shaped tape I think this works
wonderfully way that it's most effective
for me is used sparingly because it is
such a potent concealer it's a very very
full coverage and while it sets as in
it's not staying tacky and dewy and
really like sticky on the skin or
anything it sets but yet I find it
looking so completely fresh as the day
goes on and I'm not without little fine
lines and texture on the under eye area
either but a couple of things to really
keep in the forefront of your mind that
can affect your results with shape tape
would be number one prepping the skin
well making sure you're using some sort
of an eye cream or a really good
moisturizer right up in this area
because I think you want to be well
hydrated going in with this and number
two don't use too much you will often
times see people demo this product with
copious amounts of concealer all over
you only need a little bit of this
product and the coverage is phenomenal
and light/medium is a perfect shade for
me now my drugstore favorite it is a
would concealer you know it's coming out
with the doe foot applicator and whatnot
but it is a different animal in terms of
coverage this is a lighter coverage
concealer but it pairs so well with I
think lighter foundations and BB creams
and stuff like that it's a L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow and it's not like
glowy as in it's got pearlescent shimmer
or anything in it but it's just a really
lightweight concealer say you think okay
I want a real low-maintenance face day
I'm gonna just put on my tinted
moisturizer slap on a little concealer
if you wouldn't necessarily want to put
on your tarte shake tape with a super
light coverage face product because then
they may not wear down evenly think
about putting similar textures together
and then they we're more in harmony with
one another and maybe you don't need the
fullest of the full coverage this would
be a great one to grab and I also have
noticed recently I love pairing this Pro
go with the pro matte foundation for
whatever reason those two just look
really nice together on the skin so
we've talked correctors we've talked
liquid concealers now I want to move
into creamy concealers the kind you
might find in a little pot or whatever
and I really have become attached to the
honest Stassi of creamy concealers I
think that's a fantastic product but
it's getting phased out like you can't
really find it anywhere don't know
what's going on maybe they're
repackaging maybe they are changing the
formula somewhat and might bring it back
maybe it's gone for good I don't know
but that was a really good concealer so
in recent months I've been kind of on
the hunt within my collection for
something that can perform kind of like
that and something that I do think is
very similar just in the coverage level
the effect on the skin just the
creaminess that it has is the Becca
ultimate coverage concealing cream I'm
holding to here because like for example
today I'm wearing the banana which is a
pretty light shade and it definitely
adds a lot of brightness if my skin is a
little darker or if I'm just looking for
a skin tone match in certain areas
macadamia can work too this can work on
the under-eye also they're not a super
far cry from one another shade wise but
it's turned out to be a really fantastic
non-drying concealer very nice coverage
if you've tried a erase paste or the
blowing brightening concealer and you
like the feel of that this is really
similar to that like I said a lot like
the anastacio if you've bought that on
my recommendation and you liked it this
is kind of
along those lines and this sort of
concealer this creamy concealer category
that I'm talking about if if tart shaped
tape if you've tried that you just could
not make that work and you feel like you
need more moisture in this area these
are the types of products you want to be
looking to from the drugstore huge
rediscovered favorite here but I'm just
I'm a such a believer in this it's the
Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda concealer
palette this is so good I love they give
you the three shades here ones kind of a
neutralizer this would be good to use
maybe on some redness but then you get a
couple of skin tone shades this is light
by the way and then they put in a really
fantastic powder like it's creamy
feeling there's definitely some coverage
in that you put these concealers on and
you know they have a little moisture to
them and then you go setting them with
this powder it's like Zook flawless I
would highly recommend that and then I
would still most definitely call this a
creamy concealer but it's in a stick
form but the Neutrogena hydro boost I
have to give this a mention because I
think this is really good I've played
around with this so much it's got a
little core if I don't know if that's
vitamin E or some extra hydrating layer
of product but I wear this in light it
does contain hyaluronic acid and it
smoothes on the under eyes super easily
I always like to have a good go-to stick
concealer because I think it's one of
the quickest easiest most
low-maintenance things you can use you
just swipe it on blend it with the
finger tip very very creamy not the dry
stick concealer from olden times so if
you just like that format there's one to
check out too I think I'm becoming a
little more long-winded in this video
than I wanted to be but the next
category is loose powder and I would
consider both of these good loose
powders that can work for baking if you
want to or you know you can use them to
set your look you can use them very
lightly as an under eye setting powder
with you know just a real soft brush you
decide how you want to use these but I'm
just telling you now they are great for
baking or whatever other purposes you
want to do i high-end favorite and yes
I've been trying some other things up
against this but this is definitely the
favorite my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder not sure what it is about
this product and I feel like I have a
heavy full container here but I've used
this a lot and if you want to bake your
under-eye as in
really apply a heavy amount of powder
let it sit there for a short period of
time then dust it away and see what you
got like this works well as far as I'm
concerned any of the concealers that
mentioned here are bakeable you may or
may not see the need to do that with
them but you could in this powder even
though it's called translucent I've
mentioned this before but there's I
don't want to use the word magical but
there's a little element to this that
just adds a little bit of coverage I
think it's how it mattifies but doesn't
give you like an over dried crusty look
and the way it wears throughout the day
that's where you want to really ring the
bell and say hey everybody come look at
this because so many things can look
good right off the bat but this really
just wears flawlessly adds that little
hint of coverage definitely smooths the
area out I'm referring to under-eye a
lot here but you can wear this all over
your face or a beautiful just finishing
powder effect now I've been on the hunt
for a good drugstore product that can
hang with that if not be better than
that you know that's always a goal for
me and I found something that I've got
to be completely honest with you I don't
think it's better than the Laura Mercier
but I think it's really close
it gives me just the slightest bit drier
look if I bake with this on the under
eye but used in a lighter way it can be
almost identical like if I just wanted
to take a light brush let's say an elf
small tapered brush and just kind of
lightly dab the powder in there it can
be kind of like ooh I don't know which
is which it's the Maybelline fit me and
I have it in fair so they have a range
of shades and the fair seems to perform
most closely to this Laura Mercier
translucent which I know does come in a
deeper shade as well so it says loose
finishing powder I baked with it today
I'm looking very smooth I'm feeling
super smooth like I said it can just
take on the sly spit drier appearance
when it's very close to the Laura
Mercier and I would have to say it's my
drugstore favorite in terms of loose
powders for powder foundations so this
may be for the people who want to just
dab on a little concealer and then go
all over their face for coverage with
the powder or you want to top off your
foundation with even more coverage these
two products would be great options one
of them is the hello flawless from
Benefit and this is kind of knocking off
the it cosmetics celebration
illumination foundation that I know at
about before and I like it but for some
reason maybe it's more visible lines or
texture on my face I don't know what it
is but I feel like this hello flawless
just looks more flawless on my skin it's
matte and beautiful and it's got a
supremely nice texture feel this if
you're in like an Ulta or Sephora and
you want to just you know test the
texture it feels really nice I've got it
here in petal but it's matte without
looking too dry and chalky so that's a
great powder foundation option also this
one just recently like kind of jumped on
to the list for me and it's the LA
Colors mineral pressed powder this isn't
necessarily being marketed as a powder
foundation but the texture tells me you
know it absolutely could be used that
way I have it in fair this line runs a
little bit dark but it feels so so good
it is right up there with that hello
flawless what tells me something about
the coverage of pressed powder has is
when you feel it and it just feels
almost creamy like a real rich
smoothness and when you lift your finger
up you've got like a full-on amount of
coverage there that's what tells me like
putting a brush into this or putting a
sponge into this you're gonna pick up a
decent amount of product to create
coverage on the skin and I love the
finish of this it is very matte and
that's just a great bargain product
there now I do have a category here for
just pressed powder and as far as I'm
concerned the two powders that I just
mentioned are phenomenal pressed powders
I think they could be used in a powder
foundation capacity but you know there's
your good pressed powders I do have one
here only a drugstore one and it's kind
of universal it could work for everyone
and kind of like a setting powder you
could use it right after foundation you
could do it at the end of your look but
it's the Milani prep set and glow so
they make this in the prep set and go
which is straight-up white looking but
this has just the finest bit of
luminosity to it just a hair like I
think anyone of any age could use this
and look really fresh and natural but I
love the stuff so much it's totally
all-purpose if you sent this out in the
store grab it you want to have that and
then lastly my final category here is
for a coverage palette a palette that
actually contains maybe some concealers
powders definitely a new category for me
to cover in the Emily awards but I had
two things that were too
you know right at the top of my mind
when I thought about doing this category
the first one is the Urban Decay Naked
Skin shapeshifter so this is a really
cool palette a very well-thought-out
palette packaging wise where you've
essentially got two and one you've got
one side here that contains peachy
correctors concealers this also comes in
two shades so you're seeing the lighter
of the two here you've got like an
illuminator here that's cream two shades
of corrector a light I don't know you if
you want to call this concealer or cream
matte highlighter and then a cream
contour over on the other side you've
got all your powders so as shimmery
highlight just a light matte highlight
or multi-purpose powder and a couple of
contour slash bronzer shades so this is
like a handy dandy little on-the-go
everything you need coverage palette and
then from the drugstore makeup
revolution has an awesome thing going on
here this is the protection palette in
light/medium this is good this is a
hidden gem for sure this is like in the
depths of ulties website like you go
back and makeup revolution stuff they've
got concealers over here that are a
really nice texture and I like how the
one down here is just a little bit
peachy a beautifully textured powder
right here and then contour blush and
highlight this highlight has a nice
amount of shimmer here I'm wearing the
contour blush and highlight from this
palette today it's a great all-in-one a
lot of nice formulas all in one yeah you
might get a little bit troubled by the
fact that it screams right next to
powders but I mean they haven't dried
out on me the texture hasn't drastically
changed on me just as a result of using
all these products side by side so I
think it's a really great Buy
so that's it everybody thank you so much

on concealers and powders I hope this
sorted out the sometimes confusing world
of these products and gave you some
great recommendations to try I hope

highlight so many things to talk about
