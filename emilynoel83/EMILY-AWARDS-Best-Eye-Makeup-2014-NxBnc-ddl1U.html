are supposed to say when they start
videos cupcake here
you saw me join forces with the low poop
machine to take over the Emily Awards
for face with our cute faces step to
take over the Emily Awards for eyes
we've got eyes and you can bet we know
how to use them in fact Belle used her
eyes and got sidetracked the other day
when mommy took her to the dark side I
reminded her that if we're going to make
this cuteness broadcast not beauty
broadcast I want those eyes to be used
for things like slow blinks or anything
cute that might help us take over the
big ones Instagram now that you've
learned more about our mission here are
the Emily Awards fern eyes hi everybody
welcome to the Emily awards for eyes I
wish I could say I was being trendy with
this super sleek ponytail but I really
just need to wash my hair I've got a lot
of new favorites and just some products
that I am super super passionate about
so just to jump right in and to
eyeprimer
I don't think I've really had a high end
eye primer that I've become super
attached to throughout the whole year I
mean I've tried plenty of good ones but
you know ever since two faced shadow
insurance started to get kind of watery
on me even new tubes of it we're getting
all separated and kind of weird
I just haven't liked that as much and
what I've been using non-stop is you've
probably seen in tutorials is the Milani
eyeshadow primer and it would look like
I should be finished with this but
there's still a lot left and I'm happy
to say it has never changed in
consistency maintained a really great
creaminess it's like not too thick not
too thin when I put eyeshadow powder
shadows on top of it it really clings I
think helps them stand out more but
really I find I've gotten great staying
power throughout the whole day when I
use this so that's why I've used this so
much the best cream shadow I'm a huge
fan of the stick formula so both
high-end and drugstore are stick type
cream shadows and for high-end even
though I have tried some really really
amazing high-end cream shadow sticks
this past year the winner again has
repeated so many years and it is the
Mallee ever color shadow sticks and this
year in particular they really
solidified themselves as a favorite in
my mind because Malley came out with a
couple of matte ones a matte brown and a
matte black and let me tell you this
stuff wears incredibly in the water line
if you
want to put it there it smudges out
great but once you've smudged it and
allowed it to set it really doesn't move
at all and the same goes for the really
beautiful shimmery shades and just
packaging wise I love that they're
retractable they're not huge in terms of
circumference so like if you do want to
use these on the lower lash line
you know it's not massive it's still
something you can really control
drugstore cream shadow I was kind of
struggling on what to choose here
because I've got a lot of things I've
really been enjoying but then I just
thought you know if you could recommend
one thing to people what would it be and
it truly is instead of just recommending
a whole line of products there is one
thing that I really think you should
have and it is the Milani shadow eyes
stick and almond cream and I know
Jordana makes something similar so if
you find jordanna's matte creamy shadow
stick that it's pretty much the same
thing but this is the one I happen to be
reaching for a lot and I love this so
much because nothing wears as well in
terms of a nude liner in the waterline
and I know what you might think well
it's big it's kind of clunky to get in
there and you know you do have to be a
little bit careful but it lasts so well
as that brightening inner rim lower
liner where the jumbo size is really
handy is if you want to use this as that
creamy nude base all over the lids so I
have to high-end winners for best small
palette I really this year it for the
Emilie Awards I've really tried to pare
it down and not have as many times as I
normally have but here I just couldn't
choose I slept on it for like three
straight nights and still couldn't
choose and so first one that I want to
mention is the Clinique black honey a
fair palette well I love this particular
palette this is also a statement about
just the quality of Clinique's
eyeshadows I think they're great they've
got more of these little palettes that
are laid out like this and I would
encourage you to try them out I plan to
try more but on this particular one I do
love the purples that are in here it's
really fun to pop a purple in with these
neutrals this is the black honey shade
right here that's fabulous worn really
packed on or sheared out they wear a
really long time has anyone else found
that with Clinique shadows I mean are
these kind of an unsung hero in the
makeup world because I think the texture
is so smooth
creamy but even just swatch them on your
hand it's like wow that really locked in
there it stayed a long time I love the
compactness of this little pallet this
was one of the things that I took in my
bag
during our Christmas travels and just
used it all the time because it was so
quick and basic the other favorite from
this year is from benefit and well it
has been a new product to me in the past
year it's not a new product in their
line but it's called the big beautiful
eyes eye contour kit these shades are
gorgeous I mean it is a beautiful
palette it comes with a concealer
actually here which you could use as an
eye base or whatever but as far as the
shadows go they look so simple but this
is kind of like a beautiful rosy taupe
type shape that I love working with it's
the kind of look that leaves you
thinking wow my eyes look great it's not
really all about the eye shadows but
just the finished look I really love
this for drugstores I look back on past
winners for small palates and I mean
there are so many drugstore quads and
stuff like that out there to choose from
and for several years now wet and wild
silent treatment trio has one and I
still think that's great but this past
year particularly the end of the year I
have been looking for quick solutions
like something that can come together
and give me a quick look that's finished
but something that I don't have to be as
careful with and again it's wet and wild
but it's the walking on eggshells trio
that really has stood out to me this
year I love just taking this kind of
pearly pinky shade on the lid this in
the crease this is the highlight it's so
no brainer but yet these shades are very
pigmented there are many great options
for eyeshadows from this line but this
one for me just especially over the past
few months when you need something quick
this is a great one to reach for it okay
best large palette high-end this is
always really hard because so many
high-end brands come out with amazing
palettes and again this has been like a
three-time winner and for very good
reason it's the lorac Pro Old Faithful
the number one someone's asking me for
just one palette suggestion for high-end
this is the most basic this is the thing
that you need that can be an accessory
to all other palettes because it's basic
mattes basic shimmers but
still some really fun shapes this gold
is amazing this garnet shade beautiful
textures are fabulous they're really
pigmented easy to blend you know even
though it's a new year I can't look past
this palette and not see the value in it
I think it's just a great great product
but tied with that I've got to mention
the Smashbox masterclass 3 palette this
thing is a chunk it is gonna take a lot
of damage to actually break this thing
but I so love this shadow formula
Smashbox photo op eyeshadows are just
the bomb got your classic neutrals still
with some fun shimmery pops in there and
then you've got all these colors to play
with three blushes plus this is the
Smashbox step-by-step contour kit that I
raved about in part one of the Emily
awards I just love working with this you
just pop up these clear covers which i
think are super handy I mean if you're a
makeup artist and you're working on
people imagine just laying this out on
your table and they're you've got like
so many great shadows at your disposal I
use these for my look today actually I
use this gold all over the lid I used
what bronzy shade here this shade called
Sienna in the crease a little bit of the
brown in the crease as well and then
lower lash line is a mix of lilac and
violet is that right yeah these two
purpley shades just on the lower lash
line and I was just really happy with
the way it came out oh and I put papaya
this correlation just kind of right on
the border of the eye look as well so
there's just so many fun unexpected
little things you can do when you've got
this open just sitting in your lap and
it's just like eyeshadow playtime for a
drugstore best large palette it's not
something you're gonna walk into a
drugstore and find but going by price I
think this qualifies and it is the
Coastal Scents revealed 2 palette really
really loved the release of this palette
I think the revealed one is great that's
filled with Urban Decay Naked 1 &amp;amp; 2
dupes I've laid out tons of those on my
blog but the particulars shades that are
in here are like my shades I love these
are yummy yummy I love these matte berry
colors here tons of beautiful like rosy
gold shimmers and even
if you eliminate some of the rosy and
berry tones you're still loaded with
beautiful just in basic neutrals there's
a great black in here these kind of like
coppery warm colors are awesome so
there's just so much to be discovered in
this palette if you haven't tried
anything from Coastal Scents yet I would
say give this palette a try and you will
see what I've been raving about for
years in terms of the quality of their
shadows it's really great
I still like to give an award for the
best overall just shadow formula you
know like not looking at just one
particular item but overall the kind of
shadows that the brand puts out and for
high-end I've got to give it to the
Smashbox photo op formula and this has
one before a couple years back and has
definitely made its way back to my
attention this year with the release of
some great palettes especially over the
holidays and the small and large on the
rocks palettes this masterclass 3
palette I mean this photo op eyeshadow
formula that's what you want to be
looking for it's the same as the formula
and their little trios as well it's
creamy it's easy to work with its soft
and that's are every bit as good as the
shimmery shades they have put out some
palettes like full exposure double
exposure I recently got double exposure
it's not the same these shadows if you
swatch these in at an Ulta or a Sephora
these are not the photo op formula that
I'm talking about that is found in the
master class palettes the on the rocks
palettes that many of you may have
gotten for Christmas these are kind of
touted as a wearing wet or dry kind of
thing I'm not saying some people
wouldn't enjoy this palette it's not
like it's that bad but the photo op
formula is what is the amazing stuff in
my opinion and for best drugstore
eyeshadow a multi multi year award
winner wet and wild I mean what has been
better in the drugstore than wet and
wild these are so great I mean I've seen
other brands improve but nothing's
really as pigmented as wet and wild
nothing has been the bang for the buck
that wet and wild has been and so I
think I make this request every year but
wet and wild please just make more make
more that's regular stuff in your line
not just the limited edition that
everybody has to go chasing after all
the time are you with me on that people
let's get more regular line wet and wild
products like comfort zone like petal
pusher like walking on eggshells more of
those that we can find in our direct
stores at all times for best high-end
eye pencil a brand new thing that I have
been
oh happy with it it was a gift from
Kristen came in a little set actually
these Marc Jacobs eyeliners these
pencils are freaking awesome I mean I
have never tried an eyeliner pencil that
I can like stipple on my hand like
there's there's that dot where I just
put that I applied hardly any pressure
and then I I mean you can actually dot
this stuff on from the stick eyeliner
pencil is not always my chosen form of
eyeliner for the reason that you've got
to sometimes press too hard and it's
just not silky smooth enough this is
like silk it goes on so easily upper
lash line inner rib
don't get me started Kristin said it and
I tried it myself and I can confirm this
lasts so well in the waterline and it
still looks really black that's the
thing it's not just like okay it started
black and then by the end of the day it
was still there but it faded no this
looks so full color on me all day a
black shade is called blacker kind of
spelled like lacquer and I'm this is the
most outstanding one to me I feel like
this is even creamier than some of the
other colors that I've tried that have
like a little bit of shimmer to them
those are still gorgeous and still a
great formula but if you need a great
amazing black eyeliner this is awesome
for best liquid liner I do not have a
high end favorite but my drugstore
favorite is freaking fantastic and it's
from Jordana it's the color Envy liquid
liner I have become so attached to this
brush tip and this has lasted me so long
by the way I'm going to have to order
more from Jordana's website that's the
one downside at least other people's
Walgreens maybe a little better stock
than mine
but I first found these at my Walgreens
is that was when they were first
released and then never to be seen again
so I don't know if they'll ever come
back but they are on jordanna's website
but this fine brush tip is so quick it's
probably some of the quickest liquid
liner that I've had to work with and I
love Milan ease what's it called ultra
fine liner in black vinyl that stuff
wears like iron and I
love it but it's like a little felt-tip
and I feel like I've just become so
comfortable with the brush tip now then
I can just get it on my lash line much
more quickly for cream and gel liner
again I don't have a high-end favorite
but my drugstore favorite is dominating
and it's the essence gel liner in
Midnight in Paris I have had this for a
good couple years now
nothing is dry in there I've used a lot
of it I've opened and closed this
container many times but you're not
gonna see those little fault line cracks
in here I mean it's just so super rich
and creamy still it is my favorite cream
and gel liner to work with I love it
with the Real Techniques fine liner
brush those that Plus this is an
unbeatable team
all right mascaras high-end mascara
tried many high-end mascaras that have
been great this year but the winner this
here is the Estee Lauder little black
primer because this is the amazing
accessory to any mascara and if you
haven't seen my Express review on this
if you're considering trying this please
watch my review over on the Express
channel where I demonstrate it going on
and how it can be layered with other
mascaras it it's really been awesome for
me the main point that I should get
across is that it can hold curl and I
think I have tucked down my own lashes
for years thinking they're not long
enough they're not thick enough really
the main issue is that they won't hold
the curl so you can see them they just
want to point downward this I can put on
and it actually keeps the lashes
upturned no matter what I put on top of
it for drugstore mascara I was going
through my drawer looking at all kinds
of things that I've used and loved this
year and not loved as well but really
the thing that I've repurchased more
than any I product I've probably
mentioned here in this video covergirl
clump crusher water-resistant my
must-have for the lower lash line and
that's important you've got to be able
to trust whatever you're putting on
there to not transfer down below the eye
and this has just been great for that
the brush is really I think easy to
maneuver it's got a gentle gentle curve
to it but I find myself putting it on
and continually flipping it around I
like I can get in there pretty easily
with it short bristles a lot of them
kind of closely packed that's I think
what keeps the lashes from clumping
together or developing any clumps of
product on them and even though it's
water-resistant it's not the huge pain
in the butt to remove that a lot of
other water-resistant mascaras are this
is fine if you want to put this on upper
lashes - I mean if it's a really
important situation and crying is a
possibility this is what I'll put on
both upper and lower but on a daily
basis lower lashes can't miss with this
I still love Maybelline lash discovery
but I think this is even more hardcore
staying power favorite false lashes this
is a two-time winner and it's my red
cherry number 43 s that I've got on
right now they're long they're wispy
they're flirty they're big beautiful
special occasion type lashes I mean if
you're just wanting everyday type lashes
go with some demi wispies go with
someone tens or fifty threes or
something like that from the salon
perfect line at Walmart but if you want
kapow lashes that can also be reused so
many times the lashes themselves only
cost like $2.99 I think on the lady Maas
website by yourself bundles of these
they're beautiful for my favorite brow
product at the tail end of the year I
started testing out two-faced
bulletproof brows and I actually like
the the dryness in the consistency I
think it works well in brows it might
right now actually be bordering on a
little too dry so I think my favorite is
still the two-faced brow Envy kit I love
this so much I've used up a lot of this
blonde shade I used the blonde and the
brunette the wax that I put on my brows
first is kind of what allows the powders
to cling to your brows and that's just I
think my preferred way to fill in my
brows because I don't need a ton of fill
in but this just kind of helps even them
out and then I love this highlight shade
too here it's kind of a creamy pink
highlight and this is really great up
under the brow to make everything look a
little more finished you got a few tools
in there as well I use the angled brush
and the little spoolie a lot not so much
the tweezers but this kit is a winner
and if you see this in the old packaging
maybe discounted at t.j.maxx snatch it
up because it's basically the same
and I do have a favorite for a drugstore
brow product and it is the NYX control
freak eyebrow gel there's not a lot that
needs to be said about this other than
the strongest hold of any eyebrow gel
I've tried and when you pull the brush
out it's not too goopy it doesn't over
goop the brows with gel I mean it just
you don't have to even mess with it you
can take this right through your brows
you don't need to dab off any excess
it's just perfect
and that it's the my awards for eyes
thank you guys so much for tuning in
this year and this has been a lot of fun
a great roundup of products next up is
gonna be lips so don't miss it thank you
guys so much for watching I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
