hey everybody back again for day four of
the Emily Awards this one's going to be
on eyes shadow and eyeliner and I've
kind of split up the eye overall eye
category between a couple of videos so
shadow and liner today and then we'll do
brows and lashes in the next video and
eyes are always a very popular part of
the Emily Awards so I am so excited to
share my favorites with you as always
this takes a lot of work to go through
everything I love and whittle it down to
a favorite in every category or high-end
and a drugstore favorite that is really
tough with certain categories and
certain products there is just that
clear winning thing that jumps right to
my mind but then some categories I've
got like five or six things that could
be very close so just because I declare
something an Emily award winner doesn't
mean that's the only good thing out
there it's just I'm really trying to be
choosy and ask myself that question in a
certain price range if I could only pick
one what would it be
that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying
to do this without a lot of ties this
year I'm gonna kick things off with my
first category which is eyeshadow primer
and I feel funny even like talking about
this you guys know what the answer is it
is Milani eyeshadow primer I go through
these not really that fast I mean it
takes me a long time to drain one I feel
like this one has almost bit the dust it
says lightweight invisible finish works
on all skin tones it really is in my
mind the ideal eyeshadow primer and I
have played around with a few different
ones here recently especially different
ones from Urban Decay and you put them
on and they can effectively act as an
eyeshadow primer I think they help
shadows cling I think they can extend
the wear time that you get but some of
those end up being like so thick and
there's so much pigment and color to
them you really got to work with them
it's like it's created another
application step in itself with this
I've become so conditioned for exactly
what I need to do you know a tiny bit
between two fingers just DAP it on it
blends in so quickly and easily and it
helps every shadow from the cheapest of
the cheap to the more expensive
Kling better wear longer I think
everybody needs to be using an eyeshadow
primer with their looks and this is an
affordable go-to so this is the only one
that I'm naming in this category because
I just I haven't tried anything high-end
that I think is as good as this my next
category is for cream and liquid shadows
and my high-end winner is a newcomer
this year it's Laura Mercier and it's
their caviar sticks and specifically
what's really impressed me are the matte
ones that have come out and I think
these blend so beautifully they can
either act as like this really nice
canvas on your eyes to do other stuff on
top or just use them on their own as a
long wearing Lockton shadow look a
couple that I think are beautiful are
blossom which has this soft kind of
pinky tone the other day I was wearing
that paired with unnatural which adds
just this slight shadow to my skin tone
just the lightest Brown and those two
together I thought is so beautiful like
I was kind of taken aback by how pretty
that was again what I love about these
is they can be your finished look
because they set or they can be your
starting point and you can kind of use
them as a base and put other stuff on
top the other caviar sticks with the
shimmer I think are gorgeous as well and
another thing that I was toying with I
wasn't sure which should win in this
category were the Mallee shadows Stix
because I think she does some of the
most beautiful like a range of shimmery
nude neutral colors say set to a long
wearing state as well but for just
overall range I think the Laura Mercier
caviar sticks are really doing it best
because they've got the beautiful
shimmers but they've got this huge range
of mattes as well they complement the
shimmers so nicely or just a standalone
thing it can be a gorgeous look my
favourite cream or liquid shadows from
the drugstore definitely without a doubt
the L'Oreal infallible paints these are
so much fun if you haven't seen my full
video where i swatched everything out
and do two look with them and all that
stuff you've got to see it because these
are so impressive they have a really
great shade range some very colorful
things but some gorgeous neutrals as
well you kind of have to look at them
closely but some are matte some are
shimmer this little duo here I love it's
called Navy Yard and both of these
shades have a little bit of like a
satiny finish this navy blue and then
the peach gorgeous together but they're
so easy to apply and blend across the
skin you
use your fingers or I like synthetic
brushes like Real Techniques brushes are
great with these it can be really fun
liner pops they've got gorgeous like
jade green colors in this line Purple's
the warm kind of peachy shades as well
there's so much to look into so I would
definitely check those out if your
morning kind of a new eyeshadow
experience as I was mapping out the
Emily Awards this year I decided I
wanted a category for single shadows
because I think the singles need to be
making a comeback I want to make this
declaration right now that I want to
start using the singles that I have more
and a high-end favorite that I want to
share with you that I think is just an
outstanding shadow formula for shimmer
specifically is the Kat Von D metal
crush now I have a couple of these and
in these two shades that I'm pointing
out here I think are probably some of
the prettiest shadows I own one is
called Iggy and this one is raw power
rusty kind of little bit murky red
cranberry color is so beautiful
especially this time of year and hey
here's your green - he's have such a
beautiful pigmented Sheen to them there
are other great colors in this lineup as
well so if you are in a situation where
you don't need a full palette and you
just want to pick and choose and you
want something really shiny and pretty
on the lids I think this formula is
awesome and then my drugstore favorite
happens to be matte and it's the l'oreal
color riche singles specifically the
maths that's a very important
distinction to make here because the
shimmers in this line have been hit and
miss for me but the mattes have been
just glorious day oh glorious these here
I mean I did a whole video on these soil
links to that where I did a look with
them on this color here is called a crow
matte and then we have Madison Avenue
here and this one's kind of like a
plummy dark brown this has all that
terracotta warmth to it on this other
shade and the pigmentation is gonna blow
your mind they really have great staying
power they're the kind of shadows that
actually seem to have some sort of
staining ability because you swatch them
on your skin and they are there they're
not the kind of thing where you swatch
them and then you can just dust them
away these can really lock in for
fantastic staying power and you know
they would pair nicely with one of the
Kat Von D singles one thing you might
notice here as far as a category that I
don't have in the Emily Awards that I
used to have years back is like just
overall best shadow for
and I didn't feel that that was
necessary because I think anything that
I'm getting a shout out to here in terms
of talents or singles anything that I'm
talking about is a really good formula
like it wouldn't be getting a mention in
this video if I didn't think the formula
was some of the best I've ever tried
next category number four is gonna be
small palates my high-end favorites I do
have two number one my visi art theory
palettes I really love visi art shadows
just across the board I think they might
be one of my top top favorite shadow
formulas they do they're matte palettes
so great they're shimmery palettes I've
just over the past year I've developed
such an appreciation for this brand and
I feel like I've learned more about the
brand and I just love what's going on
but one of the things that I think
they've done best are the theory
palettes and if you're not familiar
these are a little bit smaller and with
the exception of the nuance palette they
are half man/half shimmer and I think
that's a great way to get to sample what
the brand can do and just create some
really well-balanced looks so I love the
one in amethyst this is the best purple
eyeshadow palette period gorgeous
shimmers here the mats are great this
dark matte plum is everything this can
look a whole range of ways depending on
how much you shear it out or how much
you pack it on so I love amethyst and I
also love minks so if you're looking for
a place to start from busy art I would
say look to the theory palettes first
because the formulas are amazing and you
get to try both matte and shimmer now my
co-winner that I just at first I just
had the visi art and then I kept
sampling these palettes from Marc Jacobs
and I couldn't look away like it was on
my conscience that these palettes and
these formulas are so good I'm talking
about the iconic palettes the ones
packaged like this now I feel like this
is kind of a made over range because I
remember when I had one of these years
ago probably when the beauty brand
launched and it I think was called
Lolita or something is a really neutral
one and it was fine you know it was okay
but this iconic selection of palettes
that they've come out with are really
like wow awesome formula really fun
pairing of different textures within the
palettes and I'm just going to name a
few of my favorites this one's
scandalous this one I knew at a glance
that these were my kind of shades
then I did a look with it and I'm like
oh yes I absolutely adore that I also
really love editorial that's right it's
not editorial its editorial the dark
greens the really deep matte forest
green here so stunning and then today
I'm wearing the one called smart Oriole
and this one I didn't think was gonna be
one of my favorites but I am loving the
blue like it's amazing these are so
pigmented
I love the mattes there are shimmery
like metallic shades there are shades
with just a little bit of Sheen going on
in here it's such a nice variety of
finishes and so so high quality once I
really started playing with those I
could not like turn my back on them they
had to be included here
my favorite small palette from the
drugstore definitely the Milani everyday
eyes collection what a great like a
small selection of shades to be able to
grab for and create the full look and I
really appreciate the way these are put
together because it's a very small
number of shades but in all of these
palettes they've given you everything
you need you know you have the mid-tone
mattes you have a little shimmer to play
with you've got your highlight shades
and they're also excellent quality too
so I love this one with the warm shades
here this is called earthy elements and
then a lovely subscribers sent me a
couple that she knew I didn't have so
there's plum basics and then that really
colorful one too I'm very grateful for
that because where I live I feel like
the selection of these little palettes
gets very picked over and they don't
always even carry all the different ones
in store and I have recently gotten a
lot of questions about wet and wilds new
packaging and formula and everything and
I haven't been able to get my hands on
those yet so that's something that
definitely hasn't been up for
consideration in the Emily Awards this
year but I'll be looking into it you
know after these videos my large palette
favorite here no real surprise lorac
mega Pro 4 I think this is just one of
the gems of my collection I love what's
in here I've sung its praises before if
you've been keeping up with my videos
you probably don't even want to hear it
again but a unique fun selection of
shades yet every essential shade that I
would want as well from warm to cool two
rows of matte two rows of shimmer I'll
link below to the full review if you're
interested but I have known
this markdown constantly on ulties
website it's my top mega Pro palette
they've ever put together and it's just
like it prompts the unexpected and then
my drugstore favorite for large palette
and these were you know right up there
very high on my list last year when I
was doing my top 10 style videos and
it's makeup revolution I mean they have
come out with some really impressive
stuff they seem to crank it out very
quickly and not only do they have a lot
of variety in their line but I think
they've got a lot of quality in their
line one that I was in particular very
happy with within the past year that
I've tried is their ultra eye contour
light and shade palette very very nice
quality here it says on the sticker new
formula talc free and they are very
smooth very easy to work with I know it
looks like the Kat Von D shade + light
but it's giving you that kind of effect
another here that I have gotten so much
use out of is my neutrals versus
neutrals palette it's got the plums the
peaches I love that color scheme for
best eyeliner pencil I'm gonna go with
from a high-end favorite the Makeup
Forever aqua XL line I don't find myself
using eyeliner pencils so much as like
my primary eyeliner like going across my
upper lash line a lot of times if I do
eyeliner I want to go for liquid there
just because I find there's so much ease
in that and so much great staying power
but when I do reach for a pencil I like
using them in my lower inner rim or on
my lower lash line maybe for a pop of
color here there and I do that so much
with this range for makeup forever
because they last really well they're
very smooth and creamy but they got a
fantastic shade range so whatever look
I'm going for I feel like I can grab for
one of these and have kind of just the
right color to throw into the mix so
they've got a great basic Brown m60 I've
used this quite a bit in my lower inner
rim and then I love this blue as well
and 22 use that alongside brown eyes and
I feel like for whatever reason they
look extra brown and extra rich my
drugstore pencil I've got a couple here
because one I think is specifically good
in the waterline and then the other I
like to use as again the pop of color
the master precise skinny which has
gotten shoutouts before and the Emily
awards I think this is so so easy to
just target that lower inner rim or if
you want to smudge it just a little bit
between the lashes amazing staying power
I think there's just a few shades that
this is available in but I
like it in the defining black and it is
just SuperDuper skinny we're talking the
skinniness of like an Anastasia brow Wiz
just in a retractable eyeliner and then
the L'Oreal SIL kissimmee range these
are not the longest wearing eyeliners in
the world but if you're using them for
the purpose of like a lower lash line
pop they are so pretty and what I will
do you know is take for example this
purple shade and I might put it on my
lower lash line and then top it off with
a coordinating shadow and then that
fusion of different textures does create
a long wearing look but they really have
some beautiful shades in this line from
the purple there's a gorgeous turquoise
they've got more basic shades also they
go on with very little pressure applied
and I think that's very important
because you have to be gentle with the
eye area I only have one favorite in the
category of cream and gel liner because
I just I haven't used a lot of this kind
of thing this year I probably should
have made a point to test more and maybe
give this front-runner a little more
competition but it's very unique and I
haven't seen anything quite like it
I loved this one last year as well but
it's the tardis clay paint liner and
this is just a mini size that I have
here but the delivery method on here
just the way they do this is so cool
because it's like you've got a squeezy
tube but at the top of the squeeze tube
is its own little palette so you can
totally squeeze up some liner and then
take your brush and make sure you've got
like just the right amount on your brush
and it gives you this perfect little
area to clear off the excess and then
you go at your lash line without over
grouping yourself and the texture of
this is a lot lot creamier than what you
find in the little pots of cream and gel
liner it's kind of the perfect middle
ground between liquid and cream is what
you've got in here and then my last
category for this video is liquid liner
and I haven't tried a high-end liquid
liner that I thought really measured up
to what I was loving from the drugstore
I have quite a few but just nothing is
impressing me quite so much so I do have
two different drugstore favorites here
the one is my Jordana color envy
waterproof even late in the year here as
I have bounced around and tried some
different things
this one reigns supreme it says it's
waterproof
it truly is waterproof it's totally
black it's matte
there's nothing funky about the brush
it's just a very classic fine brush tip
you can get right in there to your inner
corner and get just as precise as you
need to be you can do a beautiful wing
with this as well I find this on short
Anna's website and I'll order like four
at a time because I don't see him in any
drugstores around me but if you prefer
the pen style a pen style liner that
I've just been loving here lately is the
infallible super slim from L'Oreal had
this in black and a lot of people find
this to be a very easy way to apply
eyeliner with the pen what makes this
special is all the tip that they're
giving you here it's a rather long tip
with a very gentle taper so when they do
that you can almost feel like you can
stamp this across your lash line and not
always have to drag it straight off the
tip it's juicy it's black it seems to go
on very full color even when you're
going on top of super shimmery
eyeshadows so I love that one whew that
was a big video big category there for
the eyeshadows and liners thank you guys
so much for tuning in I hope you're
enjoying the Emily awards so far and in
my next video we'll be getting into brow
products mascara products things for
lashes so I hope you'll be back for that
one and I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
