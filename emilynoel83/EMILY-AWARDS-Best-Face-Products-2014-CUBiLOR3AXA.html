year we moved had a baby things might
get a little disorganized maybe a little
bit messy I'm just gonna come on and say
it the cat got into the editing software
tried to pull a few tricks you know
can't say we're surprised but here's
what happened four short years ago I was
the baby of the house the cutest the
cuddliest the furriest well now I'm
still the furriest but this one came
along what were these two thinking she
doesn't have paws or a tail but I guess
she is pretty cute and she might be my
ticket to doing what I've been trying to
do all along take this beauty broadcast
thing and turn it into the chillness
broadcast step one take over the Emily
Awards your face see we've got faces
cute ones
we use them to get things like food
cuddles have playtime we don't need
makeup but for you people like mommy who
do need a little assistance with your
cuteness here are the Emily awards for
face hi everyone thank you so much for
joining me for the seventh year of the
Emily Awards can you believe it's been
going on this long I really can't and
that was really holding my breath this
year with you know Belle our new baby
who came along in September and just
trying to get this all pulled together
this year has been quite a task because
this truly is the most time-consuming
thought consuming part of my makeup year
as far as my YouTube channel is
concerned got a whole little laptop it's
actually devoted to the Emily Awards in
a little database here where I actually
keep track year to hear what the
favorites were I take those into
consideration new products that I've
tried lots of product testing that goes
on I'm happy to do it I love doing these
so thank you guys so much for tuning in
every year asking about them every time
January rolls around I really really
appreciate it and as always there may be
some categories where there isn't a
clear favorite and if there's not
nothing will be mentioned because I
don't want to just name things for the
sake of having a favorite and also all
the award winners will be laid out on my
blog that's beauty broadcast net just so
you know if you watch this video and
then a few days from now maybe you're
browsing the make a pile and you want
just a quick way to reference
the favorites that's very easy to pull
up like on your phone for example much
easier than trying to track down a
certain part of a video for the category
of best primer I actually have a new
high end winner this year is the
Clinique super primer so so happy with
the texture just the consistency of this
product and I just love how light it
feels I really feel like when I'm using
a primer I don't want to add any
additional weight to my skin you know
I've already moisturized I'm gonna have
a foundation on I don't want the primer
to be something really heavy and this is
super lightweight but yet I think it
really evens out the texture of my skin
and makes it very easy to put a
foundation on top of that and it is a
creamy white product to look at it but
as you blend it into the skin it just
it's a really soft consistency
definitely gives my skin a very very
softened feel a new winner for drugstore
as well it's the Garnier 5 second blur I
have loved this product so much over the
past year even if I don't use this all
over my face it's a great t-zone product
particularly if you're oily this is very
very similar to the consistency the
texture of the Mallee perfect prep
poreless primer that's kind of a light
almost mousse-like texture but really
makes the skin feel silky soft I really
have noticed this improving the wear of
my foundation in areas where I get oily
so a great drugstore primer for the
category of light foundation for high
end it's got to be the it cosmetics your
skin but better CC cream for me I have
used this so much I really really love
this product it has a surprising amount
of coverage for a CC BB type product
looks really fresh on the skin a great
alternative if you've been using
especially during the warmer months
using your foundations that maybe cater
to oil control and perhaps during that
time of year your skin can really handle
it but now it's time to shift to
something that's a little more
nourishing I find this look so fresh and
natural on my skin but it actually does
really help to cover up some flaws not
to the point where I wouldn't need to
use some concealer on certain areas but
I truly truly love this product it's got
an amazing SPF 50 and then from the
drugstore my favorite light foundation
and this is a I believe two-time winner
and this is the Rimmel BB cream and
has an SPF 25 I wear it in the shade
light I'm actually wearing that today as
well I think of this kind of as a
foundation and with like an extra drink
of moisture in it you may still want to
wear a moisturizer underneath as I
sometimes do with the it cosmetics also
or if your skin is more oily you may not
feel the need for that but I find this
to be the best and actually one of the
cheapest BB creams in the drugstore for
best full coverage foundation high-end
Estee Lauder Double Wear has been on a
bit of a streak in the Emily Awards and
I still think that that traditional
format is just an amazing foundation but
this past year something else has come
in that just completely changed the game
for me when I was dealing with my
melasma and needed something totally
full full coverage to help me cover that
up during my pregnancy was when it
really flared up and now it's calmed
down totally a hormonal thing I've got a
whole video on it but the Double Wear
maximum cover has really been the
fullest of full coverage for me nothing
is compared to this this can eliminate
the need for a concealer if people out
there are dealing with major skin
discoloration that can be you know a
really difficult thing to deal with but
this is kind of a one-step easy solution
for that I've heard so much so much
great feedback from people who have
tried this you know it hadn't dealt with
melasma like I had and then found this
to be the answer from the drugstore of
my favorite full coverage foundation
this is so funny because this was an
Emily award winner like way back at the
beginning beginning and I retried it
recently it's been repackaged and it's
Rimmel lasting finish now it's in this
glass jar with the red coloring on it
but it used to be in a squeeze tube
which I did kind of prefer far as the
formulation of the foundation itself
I haven't noticed much change from the
original it's beautiful on the skin I've
totally been reminded of how much I love
this today I mentioned I used the BB
cream all over my skin but then I just
brought a little bit of this in like on
the under eye area so happy with the way
this looks and this is a foundation that
my mother who is in her 60s uses and
enjoys and then I in my 30s early 30s
now that feels weird to say
I love this too I can see this is a very
universal foundation that would work
well for all skin types does not look
too heavy or unnatural but actually
packs in some really really good
coverage not as much as that Estee
Lauder maximum cover which is just an
animal all its own weally skin I think
can wear this lightly set it with a
little powder and would probably be very
satisfied with the way this comes off
and dry skin to I think would enjoy this
very much best concealer is something
that has won years ago kind of lurked
under the radar but I'd still been using
it and now it's really come back as a
favorite and I think part of that is
that it was something I reached for a
lot when I was dealing with the biggest
discoloration that I ever have on my
face I mentioned it before the melasma
its benefit erase paste I wear this in
number two medium it is the perfect
peachy tone concealer it's got a lot of
moisture in it and as I am getting a
little older I am noticing you know more
dryness around my under eye area and it
really calls for a concealer that does
have that really kind of amoliant
quality to it recently repurchased and
retried my Bobbi Brown corrector and
bisque I love that product too the thing
about it is though this is a much much
better value you get so much more in
this little container it's a combination
of being a fantastic coverage but also
looking good on the skin and not making
the skin look too dry and if you use
enough of that by the way you may want
to set that lightly with a little bit of
powder my drugstore favorite concealer
is a new winner this year it is my Sonia
Kashuk all covered up concealer go
figure it's something that very closely
mimics the texture of that erase paste
but is available in more I think normal
skin tone shades not so much the
corrector peachy shades now I do have
the shade called ivory the kind of
concealer you know I can really use it
all over my skin for whatever problems I
might have great for not looking to dry
well I didn't really feel like I had a
loose powder favorite this year that I
had used a whole lot of I do have a
drugstore favorite and it is a two-time
winner the elf mineral booster in sheer
as I talked about setting concealers
this is a great product to have to
lightly dust over your concealers
because it has kind of a similar finish
and texture to like
bare minerals mineral veil type product
and I really do kind of like this every
bit as much and I use this today just
all over my face is kind of a setting
powder loose powder like I said even
lightly lightly on the under eye area
this can be a great little setting
product
her best friend like I have tried a lot
of high-end powder foundations but not
really anything that's just technically
a pressed powder that I've really loved
or thought was above and beyond but the
thing that I do want to mention is my
drugstore winner which has been a winner
for many years now and it is the L'Oreal
True Match this product really flies
under the radar for me doesn't get
mentioned a lot because it really lives
in my purse my bags a lot of the time
but for a powder this has some nice
coverage to it a really nice smooth
texture and also this particular line I
think L'Oreal True Match has a great
shade range and for a lot of drugstore
powders no seem to really minimize their
amount of different shades they come out
you know they might have more shades and
foundation but a very minimal amount of
shades and powders so this might be
something to look into to really get
that great shade match a couple of new
wares for my powder foundations this
year for high end it's definitely the
celebration illumination foundation I
wear this in light the name is just
crazy to many words but I really do like
this product so much I've become so
fascinated by powders that can go on and
not really look powdery you know and
this is one of those things where I mean
the illumination word might even be kind
of a stretch because I don't feel like
this looks too dewy or too shiny or
shimmery on the skin but it just does
look very fresh so if you like using
powder foundations and maybe you like a
BB cream type thing and then you just
want to finish off your look with a
powder that might pack in a little more
coverage I think this is great for that
so I love the illumination version of
this product and then for drugstore it's
got to be the ELF pressed mineral
foundation I have been so impressed with
elf's pressed mineral line and this is
another one of those phenomenon powders
that really goes on looking fresh even
your skin just kind of a velvety
perfected type look I just love the
texture very creamy and the more I've
used this late in the past year the more
I've noticed it really compares if not
exceeds the
quality of look the type of look I get
with the mix stay matte but not flat
powder foundation I still really like
that one it was really close but I do
think this one is my new favorite or
favorite bronzer I have a new high-end
favorite this year and this is something
that technically contains a bronzer okay
but it is kind of a contour product as
well and it's the smashbox contour
palette definitely snuck in at the tail
end of the year I so so love this
product and would totally recommend this
to you guys I mean it's got your three
shades going on here first off this is
not about highlight this category but
this is an amazing highlight totally
reminds me of the Laura Geller baked
french vanilla that I love so much so
that's in their added bonus but you've
got these two products here that are
basically this is labeled as bronzed
this is contour but depending on your
preferences you can kind of mix and use
varying amounts of each of these to
really get the perfect contour shade for
you they just give such a great
dimension to the face and I'm not really
surprised that I love this because this
shade is a total dupe like equivalent to
two faced chocolate soleil for a
drugstore my best bronzer this year is
the color wheel mosaic face powder and
the shade is all over bronze glow don't
be swayed by the word glow because this
is a matte product I love this bronzer
if you find yourself going through
bronzer quickly if you're like me and
you not only will use it on your face
but down here on the decollete area as
well anywhere where skin is showing this
is a great product because it's so
inexpensive if you go through a lot of
it it's not really a big deal while I
love NYC sunny this is deeper than that
it is a little bit on the warm side but
I still think it's great for contouring
I have a full review on this and I do
have full reviews on a lot of products
that I've mentioned over on the Express
channel I'll link to anything related
down below but this is a great drugstore
bronzer and definitely a hidden gem type
product there for best high-end blush
we've got a repeat winner and it's the
balm in stain blushes love these blushes
for pigmentation staying power I mean
the packaging is adorable and I have
rediscovered one of them that I hadn't
used much when I first got these but I'm
loving
now and it's the one called pinstripe
it's a beautiful plum II blush sheers
out so so wonderfully on the cheeks
great wintertime blush and for the
drugstore I've got a new winner there
also and it's sleek and I know sleek is
not readily available in the u.s.
drugstores but it's definitely something
worth checking out on lines are some of
the most pigmented blushes I've tried
but I also really appreciate how they
keep the packaging so compact you know
this is a single blush that I have in
flamingo this is what I'm wearing today
it's beautiful but I also really love
their blush by threes those little
palettes are so handy and you get
multiple tones of blush in some cases
like a cream and a couple of powders
might be in there or just three powder
blushes or cream blush one that really
stuck out to me this year is benefit
majorette and yeah there was a full
review on this not too long ago but this
is a great texture for a cream product
because it almost goes kind of cream to
powder and this particular shade is
absolutely stunning on the cheeks I love
how I when I open that up I get such a
great scent out of this it's kind of
fruity and this is just the perfect
corally peachy tone on the cheeks
doesn't have shimmer just a really great
blush for a favorite drugstore cream
blush it's a two-time winner and it's
the Maybelline master glaze blush sticks
these are really really easy to blend
out a lot of cream blushes will be too
dewy too sticky and tacky on the cheeks
that makes them hard to blend in not
necessarily have the best staying power
and just you know tricky to work with on
top of foundations and other stuff
you're wearing these are some of the
smoothest cream blushes you will try and
they just go to a really easy to work
with texture use the elf small stipple
brush with these if you want to or you
can use your fingers it's up to you but
I love these I love this pink shape
particularly it's called pink fever and
I think it looks really healthy and
fresh best highlight this year is most
definitely the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector I got a three pack in the
spotlite version before the holidays and
I just fell in love with these I'm
pretty sure the full-size of these come
are much larger and come with a pump but
this is the pearl one that I have here I
feel like the beautiful look that you
get when you put these right on the top
of your cheeks cheekbone area is
just unmatched I got one of the powder
ones in opal too compared to this and I
really just think that the liquidy
version something about that is just
perfect because you could look up really
closely at your skin and not necessarily
pick out what is making your skin glow
but it just looks beautiful so I really
love the shimmering skin perfectors I do
have a category for mattifier slash
touch-up product and one favorite has
really dominated this category for
several years now and it is my Mally
poreless face defender it's been so
interesting because so many drugstore
brands other brands have come out with
things that should be similar to this or
all the claims are pretty much the same
as what this claims to do and other
things I've tried could be workable if
you're really really careful with them
but the mistake I think that's being
made with those is that the consistency
is so creamy with the Mallee poreless
face defender if you're not familiar
with this product you use a sponge kind
of get some of this on here and then you
can dab it over your skin to kind of
mattify and perfect I like to use it as
a touch-up like later on in the day keep
this in my purse quite often but this is
such a solid here you know you could rub
your finger on it and you can tell
you're picking some up but it's very
very solid for the most part yes you
know I can go swirling my finger on this
for a minute and not really have picked
up visible product but other ones that
have come out are just so creamy and
kind of goopy and that's not the kind of
thing I want to go blotting on my face
you know after I get a little shiny
midday so this is the kind of thing that
I really really love and hopefully maybe
someday you know a drugstore brand will
really master this kind of formula I do
have a category for setting spray I have
been experimenting lately with several
different high-end options but so far
nothing has really knocked my socks off
like the NYX dewy finish setting spray
this I mean don't think of it like one
or two spritzes it's going to really
make your skin look tacky and dewy but
I've got some of it on now and I think
it just takes away the powdery finish of
your skin a couple spritzes of these
after you do your makeup or if you find
your makeup starts to look more apparent
on your skin as the day goes on a little
bit of this on top would be great I've
said this to my mom I think she's going
to get tons of good
out of it as well if you like to have a
powder on your skin but you just don't
want everybody to know that you've got
powder on your skin this is a great
thing to use I thing and I've got some
new setting sprays like I said I'm
trying one from Smashbox I'm trying one
from L'Oreal I've been using them on and
off but I haven't noticed much of a
difference between those and this one
which is cheaper and I think does a
great job so thank you guys so much for
