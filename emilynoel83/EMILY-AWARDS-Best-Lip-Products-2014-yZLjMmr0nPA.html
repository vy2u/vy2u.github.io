are you still watching these long
drawn-out makeup videos as you saw from
parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 Belle and I are plotting a
takeover of beauty broadcast
step 3 take over the Emily awards for
lips the area where the kid can either
help me or hurt me you see as a cat I am
the brains of the operation but she's
got to be my communicator I told her if
we're going to turn this into cuteness
broadcast
I need the lips to be doing less of this
more of this and if she can start doing
this we're in business
hey everybody I have so been looking
forward to shooting this part of the
Emily Awards I love talking about lip
products and this year I just feel like
I've got so many new winners and it's
been a big year of lipstick for me to
know I do love wearing lip glosses as
well but I just think over the past year
I've just been trying more and more just
great full colored lipsticks and it did
make my job pretty difficult for this
particular award video but let's jump in
first category is best lip balm and for
high-end I do have a two-time winner and
it's the fresh sugar lip balm I love the
slightly lemony scent that this stuff
has and it's just got a really rich
texture I'm you know how some lip balms
just seems so thin and slippery it makes
you wonder how it's ever going to last
on your lips and a lot of them don't but
the thicker texture it's kind of like
putting a thicker coat of moisture on
your lips it really lasts a while and so
I think if you wanted to splurge on lip
balm this would be a great option and
then my drugstore favorites have also
one for two years straight and they are
the Nivea stick lip balms there was one
called kiss of smoothness that kind of
brought me into this line of products
and now it seems like there are so many
varieties that are really great and I
love the kiss of olive oil and lemon
also on this kiss of berry swirl while
this isn't very flavored like you know
to taste it on your lips the scent out
of the stick is just an amazing
raspberry scent if you love raspberries
I think you'll really like the way this
one smells but I do feel like these are
some of the best lip products to reach
for if your lips really are in need of
some healing I do have the tie for best
tinted lip balm high-end the first one
that I really want to mention is the
benebalm from benefit
and I have tried several of their tents
that are sold like this they stick form
tents kind of inspired by their various
stains their lip and cheek stains and I
think they've all got a nice texture
going on but the color of this one is
just amazing if you like those soft kind
of rosy red lips Plus this smells like
roses it's just it's an experience when
you open this up you give it a whiff and
then you put it on your lips and it's
like this really soft reddish look that
you can actually you know easily
maintain just a really easy way to
achieve red lips and this is really
really moisturizing also a new thing to
me that I just couldn't leave out and I
tried this in the big Sephora favorites
give me more lip collection and it's the
fresh sugar lip balm in berry this is so
like pillowy soft beautiful on the lips
sheer in comparison to like some full
colored lipsticks but yet it really does
give you some color I mean it's kind of
hard to explain but I love that texture
just like I explained with the
traditional fresh sugar lip balm you
know there's a thickness to it it really
locks in some moisture if a returning
favorite for best drugstore tinted lip
balm and it is maybelline baby lip it's
kind of in this past year I've noticed
I've been using these so much and just
toting them around with me everywhere I
go I've talked about the one and cherry
me a lot this is kind of a pinky red
it's really buttery smooth texture on
the lips very lightweight but yet these
tinted ones seem to give off quite a bit
of color and then a new shade that I've
kind of discovered more recently as the
one called grapevine the scent on this
it's like grape candy and to look at it
you know that color might look a little
scary it actually comes off like a
really soft plum on the lips I think
it's beautiful
didn't have to think long about best lip
pencils this year for high-end it's
definitely the Estee Lauder Double Wear
lip pencils these where such a amazing
ly long time so they're a great base to
other lip products but the color alone
that these give off I think is really
impressive and if you want to wear them
on their own you know just slap a lip
balm on quickly and then put these on
they will appear matte you know if you
want to wear these on their own but
the couple that I want to recommend one
is brick and this is great for that
marsala color of the Year trend it's
just that perfect kind of earthy reddish
tone and then for more of a berry
reddish look apple cordial is a great
one but these also come with the little
brushes on the opposite end which can
help you spread them out and that's
particularly useful if you do want to
wear these on their own probably the
best quality and best color range of lip
liners in the drugstore are these Milani
color statement lip liners if you need a
good like nude or neutral lip liner
they've got a nice actual range of
shades that would you know kind of fit
that description and then some bright
ones as well so true red is one I
definitely want to mention because I
think red lip liners are really
important when you're going for that
precise red look not the low maintenance
red lip that I mentioned earlier and
then spice I think is a great neutral I
love to use spice to help define my lips
with anything from a more brownish rosy
nude all the way to a really light nude
it blends in really well for best jumbo
lip pencils I have a new high-end
favorite this year and it's the byte
high pigment lip pencils and I have the
small size that I've gotten in there
little you know collection here that's
sold in the tin and I love these so much
I've worn pomegranate a lot it's just
like their luminous cream lipstick kind
of packed into a lip pencil format and I
love how you know you don't have to
sharpen these rhubarb is another great
option if you kind of want to go berry
pinkish mauve tone but not too deep and
dark I mean these just go on so velvety
smooth I have a full review on them as
they do have a lot of these things so
I'll make sure to link to those on my
blog post thread store it seems like
there are so many jumbo lip pencils
coming out so of course I'm judging
those against past winners and this year
I've got one returning favorite in this
category one new favorite the returning
favorite that just cannot get knocked
off it's three years running here is the
Neutrogena moisture smooth color sticks
if you have not yet tried these I have
referred to these in the past and
sweatpants of lip products they aren't
so comfortable but they probably look
better than sweat mitts on this is the
raisin shade rich raisin while these
have that gorgeous appearance on the
lips they're total workhorse type lip
product
because my lips do not get chapped when
I'm wearing these and it's because
they're giving you that nice thick layer
of moisture on your lips it's not
stickiness nothing I've mentioned where
I've referenced thickness is a sticky
thing it's just like a thicker layer of
product going on your lips that's gonna
last longer and just give you an
extended period of moisture and I love
that whole line if the Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks by the way
but I really wanted to also mention the
l'oreal glossy booms and these are
really for two shades in particular that
i want you to know about one is the
lovely mocha shade this is great for
that neutral kind of slightly rosy
neutral lip very on-trend for this year
and these do have a glossy finish on the
lips a little bit thinner than the
Neutrogena while these feel good on the
lips it's not something I would use to
say treat chapped lips but I love love
these shades and this is the petite plum
one right here a great deep plum II lip
color but it still got like a hint of
Sheerness it's very light on the lips I
haven't tried tons of lip plumpers this
year but for high-end a multi year award
winner is the buxom lip gloss
particularly I love the cream formula
this is white Russian and it's a great
nude lip gloss in its own right but I
personally really like the minty tingle
that the buxom products have I tend to
buy little sets of them pretty much
every holiday season when they come out
and they last a really long time there's
some thickness and a little bit of
stickiness to the gloss which I think a
lot of glosses need that stickiness to
actually hang around on the lips
an extra-special gift for best lips
stained I do have a new high-end winner
and it is the Becca Beach tint and this
is actually a stain for cheeks and lips
so you can use it as a blush but it's
also a really really beautiful lip color
I have it in raspberry and for this
shade alone I would say this is a
winning product for this category but it
really makes me want to try more colors
that are out there but this is a
beautiful like kind of deep berry tone
and it comes off more sheer on the lips
but I really like wearing it cheeks and
lips together from a more practical
standpoint this lasts a really long time
on me as well and the color is so soft
you can kind of spread it out on your
lips just with your finger or if you
wanted that you know more precise look
you could use a lip brush also best
drugstore lip stain it's funny because
this is a product that you might think
could have won in another category for
its actual function of what it truly
does it's much more of a stain than it
is a plumping product and it's the heart
candy plumping serum lipstick I don't
notice any plumping from this so that
claim kind of goes out the window for me
but it does stain my lips beautifully it
has a fabulous just really comfortable
smooth texture so if you haven't checked
these out in Walmart yet I highly
suggest you do so this shade called
infamous and is a beautiful classic pink
this was actually what I happen to have
on my lips when I went into the hospital
to have Belle and even at the end of
going through childbirth I still could
see this on my lips not like it was
freshly applied lipstick but the stain
of this was still hanging around now for
Best lipstick this is a tough tough
category like I said it's been the year
of the lipsticks for me I've tried great
high-end lipsticks I mean I could have
probably three or four close runners-up
to this but my favorite again this is a
two-year winner is bite lipsticks the
luminous cream lipsticks I'm holding one
of my little double-ended ones here
because I wanted to reference a shade
called violet that I think
it's just gorgeous when I think about
these lipsticks so many gorgeous
statement type lip colors come to mind
I love scarlet Palomino pomegranate
mulberry is a beautiful berry shade that
might get mentioned in a little bit here
you could judge them by the colors and
just be like oh yeah that's a great
color I want that but once you actually
apply then there's just a smoothness
that I can't even explain it it's not a
smoothness by way of being you know
really really shiny and glass like on
the lips
it's just smoothness because that
texture of the lipstick is so so rich
and there is a hint of shine that might
come off of these but all the shades I
have they're not frosty lipsticks
they're just pure color and they're
amazing they're a great great lipstick
splurge and then from drugstore I had a
really hard time picking out a favorite
lipstick as well they're just so many
good ones but the Rimmel Kate Moss matte
collection and these red tubes are just
stunning I'm holding 105 here it's
really nice to get you on board with
that rosy neutral lip trend that's
happening now but I mean these are matte
lipsticks if you apply a lot of it you
know you might pick up on a hint of
shine coming off of your lips but really
as you continue to wear them they do
come off matte but they are the most
comfortable matte lipstick shade
selection that's available seems to very
store to store that in my area I find
the best selection at my Walgreens but
there's like a more limited selection at
Ulta or say Walmart if there are some
great shades I have tried to get almost
every shade that's available in this
line for best high-end lip gloss it's
the Mallee high shine liquid lip color
this is a two-time winner this is a
full-size of one of these and they are a
click up lip product they're a really
comfortable full colored gloss and
another reason why I think this is
worthy of being an award winner is just
the amount of great shades that she has
in this collection especially if you
love soft pinks nudes there's a lot to
choose from
blossom is one of my all-time favorite
shades from this line but what I wanted
to talk about here is orchid it's a
really soft berry just a hint of purple
kind of a unique shade I don't think I
have any glosses exactly like this in my
collection so I thought that one was
worth
here four best drugstore lipgloss again
kind of a hard to classify product here
because I feel like this is something
that can stain this is something that
has the fullness of color of a lipstick
but ultimately I think the consistency
of it I would call it a gloss and it's
the LA girl glazed lip paints and I just
think these are amazing I'm holding the
one here in koi this one is bombshell I
have more to mention when we get into
shade favorites what I'm wearing in this
video is a shade called pinup it's a
beautiful red and these are really like
a drugstore equivalent to the OCC lip
tars they're a thin consistency product
but very very colorful and the staying
power is great on your lips even once
the shine wears off one thing you should
know is that you really want a lip brush
to apply these that will give you the
most precision because some of these
shades are like really really vibrant
like the three humming up right here
that these have just been an amazing
find over the past year I bought mine on
the lady Maas website where you can get
like a multi pack of all the shades and
I think that's really worth doing
because this is a fun formula and you
can also kind of mix the colors just
like you would with the lip tars so this
last part of the lip rewards it's all
about shade favorites so I've got a
favorite lipstick and lip gloss to share
in the various color family so pink
berry red and nude slash neutrals so I'm
gonna go through these pretty quick best
pink lipstick is the Estee Lauder pure
color Envy lipstick in a shade called
impulsive this is a wonderful lipstick
formula that was definitely a runner up
to the bite lipstick this year but this
particular pink shade it's just a
beautiful soft gorgeous pink for best
lip gloss but as I said this could kind
of be seen as a stain or just a liquid
lipstick type product but it's the LA
girl glazed lip paint and blushing I
think this is a beautiful kind of more
mauve pink there's a little hint of a
purpley tone in this but I think it's
still overall pink color family as far
as the way I've got all these split up
for Best berry lipstick I actually have
a 2-time winner here and it is mulberry
from bite I have some deeper darker
berries but I think for an all-purpose
berry the berry that I liked wearing the
most most of the time it would have to
be this one I think it's got the best
balance of like reddish tones and plum
tones as well my best berry lip gloss
and this definitely does go a little bit
more toward the purpley side I mentioned
it earlier but it is my Mally - liquid
lip color in orchid just a beautiful
creamy shade no shimmer in this but
still very full color not a deep dark
vampy berry but just very wearable for
best red lipstick it is the NARS
audacious lipstick in Carmen I love this
shade I get a lot of great feedback when
I wear this one it's so bold this is a
stunning classic pinup-girl red I mean
it's just outstanding
this red gloss mentioned this earlier
but the LA girl glaze lip paint in pinna
another characteristic about this that I
don't know if I mentioned is that these
can also be kind of built up I'm wearing
it a little more sheer right now but you
can kind of go multiple coats of a
product like this and get even more
intense color which is kind of cool and
then let's all do love products best
nude lipstick this is a two-time winner
love this so much it's a great peachy
nude lipstick and it's my Sonia Kashuk
shine luxe sheer in sheer pink lust
perfect perfect shiny nude lipstick love
the texture of these lip products they
go on looking very glossy but there's a
lot of color to them as well and there
are other really beautiful shades in
that line if you're interested and then
my favorite nude lip gloss is the NYX
butter gloss in creme brulee there have
been a lot of occasions where I've put
on a nude lipstick wanted just a little
extra shine but didn't want to alter the
color too much and this is a great way
to top off a nude lipstick or a nude lip
liner and that wraps up my Emily awards
