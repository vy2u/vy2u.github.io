Awards this year more categories more
details more videos how many videos I'm
thinking 7 days of videos my true love
gave to me hey everybody welcome to the
Emily awards for 2017 I am so so excited
I don't think I've ever been this
excited for the Emily Awards because I
kind of rethought the process this year
and I decided I really wanted it to go
super in-depth a lot of info lots of
videos just kind of breaking it up a
little bit more as we go along into
seven different categories of videos I
really did have fun with the top ten
concept the last couple of years and I
did think it was a nice way to sort of
sum up some of the top products of the
year in a very you know neat and easy
way but this has kind of left me craving
the old way that I used to do it which
was a high-end and a drugstore favorite
for every category and then I thought
well if I want to do this in the way
that I feel is exactly the way it needs
to be done there needs to be a lot more
categories for example when I think
about naming a best foundation you got
sticks you've got full coverage you got
lighter coverage they could all be great
but it's apples and oranges you know
what I mean they're so different and I
think that needs to be addressed in its
own category so as I found myself making
this big long list of every single
category that I found necessary I
thought I'm gonna need to break this up
into more than just three or four videos
so we're doing Emily Awards notes this
year you're gonna do seven days of it
and my hope is that these won't be too
like long and drawn-out but just kind of
to the point the info you want you can
find exactly what you want very easily
if you're looking for a primer you know
you can click this video if you're
looking for the best eyeliner you know
you'll know what video to go to for that
and it'll just be very easy and very
user friendly for everyone who's just
one the info
you could probably hear it in my voice
but I am kind of sick today I've got a
cold so I'm thankful for something like
this this project that gets me up and
excited and so like raring to go
this video specifically we're going to
be talking about primers and foundations
and I've got 6 different categories that
we'll be going through in this video
alone and so the first one is just for
primers and I'll go through my high end
favorites first in the drugstore for
high end it's the Smashbox photo-finish
pore-minimizing I think there are a lot
of primers on the market that claim a
pore minimizing effect and a lot of them
tend to be kind of dry chunky like maybe
yeah eventually they smooth into your
skin but this one like right out of the
gate right out of the tube it feels
really nice and smooth I love using this
around my nose anywhere I might have
some fine lines I feel like it creates a
really nice canvas if you've got texture
issues on your skin my drugstore
favorite really snuck in here very
recently and I've just decided I think
this as a fantastic primer and this
one's more on the hydrating in so if
you're a dry skin person maybe you're
someone who feels like as the day goes
along your foundations start to look
drier and more cakey this will be a nice
step to pair with really I think any
foundation it's a Maybelline master
prime hydrate and smooth this is a new
release in their line and I tell you the
texture on this is fabulous it feels
kind of like you've double moisturized
but yet you've also really smoothed out
and kind of evened out the texture of
your skin and that's a huge thing with
primers next category BB cream CC creams
tinted moisturizers my high-end favorite
probably no surprise here you've heard
this mentioned in Emily awards videos in
the past but it's the it cosmetics CC
cream this one this wasn't up gone love
this product so much it's a fantastic
multitasker it does the CC cream thing
so well it's got an SPF 50 in it the
coverage is just so foundation like you
know but yet this can lump together your
steps of coverage product moisturizer
sunscreen you know you're getting it all
in one my mom is a huge fan of this
product even my dad will put this on
sometimes I mean it's just so good I
love the pump because I can consistently
get the same amount that I think I need
every time I wear medium in this most of
the year although right about now this
time of year not out in the Sun quite so
much and I'm probably more toward light
I've just had really good luck with this
product I think it looks beautiful on
the skin if you like more of a glow you
might check out the illumination version
of this product but it is a fantastic CC
cream for my drugstore favorite I'm
going to go again with the Rimmel BB
cream so this has been mentioned in the
past also in Emily awards videos I have
this in light/medium this has an SPF of
15 it says up to 24-hour hydration evens
out skin tone you know this is not as
full coverage as the cosmetics but I
think it's one of the better coverage BB
CC options in the drugstore another one
that I've been playing around with
recently kind of revisiting because I
reviewed it quite some time ago is the
matte BB cream from covergirl and I do
really like the way that looks on my
skin also but it doesn't have any SPF in
it and so I think for it to be a
successful BB cream or CC cream product
it has to combine the moisturization the
coverage and the SPF this definitely
does that if you're looking for that
light coverage step to your make up a
time in my life that I think this would
have been so appropriate was when I was
just starting out with makeup right and
you don't really want to bounce right
into full coverage foundations and all
that kind of thing but just something
really light easy to blend across the
skin either with your fingers or a brush
this is great next category is light to
medium coverage foundations I was so
glad to really be able to break up the
foundation categories here because it is
as I said apples and oranges there can
be great light medium coverage
foundations there can be great full
coverage ones and when you start
choosing one over the other it becomes
less of a you know I'm gonna just put
out some recommendations and more of my
personal preference which you may or may
not care about that much my favorite
high-end light to medium coverage
foundation is no doubt about it this
just hopped right onto the list
immediately the estee lauder double wear
nude water fresh makeup and I wear this
in 2n1
desert beige my friend David recommended
this to me and I was definitely
skeptical when something with the double
wear name is also being called water
fresh I'm thinking I want my coverage I
want my staying power but this
amazingly for its liquidy as this
product is it's so liquidy like you hear
it's shaking it's SuperDuper thin guys
yet it does maintain some coverage and
just the freshest most beautiful finish
on the skin and it lasts I have been so
let down the main way I think I've been
let down by these really really thin
lightweight foundations is the staying
power
they just can't hang on the skin this
one can't I would encourage you to check
out my full video that I did on this
product that's with all the rest of this
stuff I will link below if I have more
information but this is really fantastic
now I struggled a little bit more with
my drugstore winner in this category
because I just feel like there are so
many drugstore foundations that fall
into the light/medium coverage zone
right and there have been some good ones
that I've tried in these past few weeks
especially as I've been honing in on the
Emily Awards I've been revisiting
different foundations and I've settled
in on one that I surprisingly
really really liked and it's the
infallible Pro matte I think when I
first got this I probably got the wrong
shade because I do have two of them
floating around in my drawer but this
golden beige is what I'm wearing right
now and I think this is a really
beautiful looking foundation on the skin
some people might think this is full
coverage to me it's not it's definitely
in a different conversation from the
things that I'll be mentioning in a
second here in my full coverage category
and L'Oreal does make a full coverage
foundation by the way that infallible in
the little bit skinnier tube than this
and it's a very potent foundation takes
a little work blending it into the skin
this is thinner this is a pretty liquidy
consistency and it is described as a
demi matte finish so it's nice about
looking kind of natural on the skin no
super radiant shine coming from it but
what I use just the right amount not
overusing the product it's such a
beautiful look on the skin if you don't
need the fullest of the full coverage
this would be a great thing to go for
and I've actually enjoyed pairing it so
much with the pro glow concealer more on
concealers in the next video but that is
what I'm wearing today I've got this
foundation on I've got the pro glow
concealer on it's just the finishes of
both mesh so well and I know the
category is light to medium coverage
this is definitely medium it's a very
strong medium coverage foundation let's
talk full coverage foundations in
this category what I identify as
full-coverage is something that brings
you close to if not totally to the place
of having concealer optional skin like
it's totally going to even out the
freckles the discoloration dark spots
it's gonna even do some things on your
under eye just the fullest coverage and
I mentioned that L'Oreal and their
infallible line they have a really full
coverage one and I have liked that and I
think it can be worked with its great
applied with a Beauty Blender because it
needs some working into the skin it
needs some TLC as you apply it but
something that I think is a bit more of
a no-brainer easy to just pick up and
use for anybody type classic liquid
foundation that is so full coverage is
what Maybelline has just put out and
it's the super stay full coverage I have
this right now in warm nude it's on the
verge of being a little dark for me so I
think I'm going to in the very near
future pick up a lighter shade but the
coverage with this is spectacular and it
really doesn't require any specific
method of application if you want to use
your fingers you could use your fingers
still get full coverage use a brush
you'll still get full coverage use a
Beauty Blender you will still achieve
full coverage with this product I don't
feel like there's one rule or one you
got to do it this way type strategy to
making this work it's pretty user
friendly it's a highly accessible
drugstore product and it will cover your
stuff okay now the high-end product that
I have to give major props to here
because it's got the coverage and just
like the other one it's got the great
staying power too it's the Urban Decay
all nighter I'm putting this right up
there in the same conversation as my
Estee Lauder the fullest coverage the
total cover that could even cover my
melasma this will do that it's very
matte it's just the fullest coverage
stuff I've had really good results with
the staying power on this while I
consider both of these most definitely
full coverage this one might just go a
little bit further
again if I've got any video with a full
review or an application of these
products it will be linked below so you
can check out more info category number
five in this video is stick foundations
and I do not have a drugstore favorite
that I'm going to put in here because my
real drugstore favorite is not available
like I checked elfs website recently
they have a great stick foundation
formula it's fantastic that you go on
their website it's like completely sold
out I don't know if they're on the verge
of bringing it back
repackaging it reformulating it somehow
I don't know what the plan is but they
had a really phenomenal stick foundation
but I'm not gonna include it in the
video because it's not something anybody
as far as I know can get their hands on
right now unless you already just got it
in your drawers
but among high-end brands it seems like
stick foundations have been a huge thing
over the past year I've seen so many new
ones get released I've tried them all
several have worked really well I think
a stick foundation is handy it's easy
its quick you can kind of just put the
coverage where you want it and just go
with it but I found one that I think has
the most flawless staying power coverage
I'll call it medium to full coverage
depending on how you want to build it up
and just this kind of velvety pretty
look on the skin and it's the hourglass
vanish stick I have this in nude right
now this is another thing that might
suit me a little bit better in the
summertime shade wise and I could go for
something a bit lighter right now but
it's so gorgeous across the skin
sometimes the issue with stick
foundations is that they work really
nicely on one part of your skin but not
there's like it might be fine spread all
over my face but then once it gets up
around my eye area it's clinging and not
looking so good this looks good
everywhere on my skin and it's had some
competition I mean I'm thinking of the
sticks from Besame and Tarte ten NARS
actually has a foundation stick that is
probably closest to this in terms of
being a favorite but this is definitely
a clear winner for me in the stick
foundation category and the last thing
in this video that I'm going to talk
about is setting spray I wasn't really
sure where to toss this category so here
it is I've got a drugstore Ana high-end
favorite high-end
gonna go with the Urban Decay all
nighter for staying power sake if you're
really just looking for something that
locks in the look this does a really
good job so does D slick too if you're
super oily think about D slick but just
for the masses I think Urban Decay all
nighter is a great one to try I think if
you get on Sephora and you just wanted
to try this in a smaller size I believe
they do sell it in something smaller
than this big ol four ouncer here but
it's proven itself time after time is a
really good setting spray now my
drugstore favorite kind of has a little
different function for me I'm not saying
it doesn't help the staying power but it
gives me this look of real radiance
right after I put it on I feel like I
reach for this when I just want the look
of powder to disappear from the skin
and I just want to look huh like super
glowy and nice and you know I love my
hard candy sheer envy primer mist I
really think that's a quality product
you've heard me talk about it in
countless favorites videos and stuff but
what's winning me over truly this year
is the Mario Badescu the facial spray
with aloe cucumber and green tea it
performs basically the same way on my
skin as the hard candy but I can't get
over the scent with this I love the way
this smells it's kind of like this
spa-like mmm just nice experience I'm
all stopped up in my nose like sinuses
but I can still smell this it's so fresh
it's a great way to revive your look
maybe throughout the day and they make a
great rose mist as well but I just
something about this scent you all know
if you've tried this like it's so
refreshing I absolutely love it I think
it's a great thing and I don't know if
people widely consider Mario Badescu
slime to be drugstore but this is $7 so
I think it's well within the scope of
being a drugstore price range product
and that my friends wraps up day one of
the Emily awards primers and foundations
I hope you got some info you were
looking for in this video and I'm
excited to bring you day to tomorrow and
that is going to be concealer and powder
lots to talk about there lots of great
favorites thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you soon bye my true love
