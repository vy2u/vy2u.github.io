true love gave to me seven cups of
coffee six maracas shaking pita racing
Prieto one sees two hits at Brushy and a
baby pulling stuff up my tree hi guys we
made it to the finale whoo this was like
my personal reward to myself was getting
to wear a robe for the finale it's like
I said I'm gonna do seven days of videos
but if the last one I'm wearing a robe
guys I'm going crazy at the time I'm
shooting this
I am so like knee-deep in editing this
is so much worse there's so many videos
so much in each video like help factor
in to kids and Christmas stuff and just
all the other life things like this is a
lot so I would like to propose a toast
specifically to everybody else who is
wearing a bathrobe right now on this
Saturday morning holding their coffee
mug thank you for watching the Emily
awards thank you for all the kind words
and encouragement cheers to another year
of great product finds friendships made
and being a small part of the happy
wonderful drama-free corner of the
YouTube beauty community I love you guys
cheers to that
now let's finale got some MVPs in this
video as I like to do every year I
choose some MVPs most valuable products
those will be addressed here and I've
just got some various categories to
start things off with that I think tie
up a lot of loose ends some questions
you might still be having even after the
8 million categories have already
covered number one best brushes
alright the award this year is going to
the most underappreciated yet most used
biggest workhorse type product in my
collection and it's my Sigma I brushes I
mean I use these all the time these
three specifically at my e60 my e25 my
e-40 for blending and a couple of these
are part of like the original Sigma when
they were numbered SS 252 like Sigma
started during some of my earliest days
on YouTube and I have some of the
original brushes and they still work
amazing
well like this is the stuff I use for my
eye looks every day and when I stumble
across like a new foundation II brush
whether it's Sigma or any brand like I
seem to talk about that a little bit
more if it pertains to some other
interesting technique on the face but
the eye brushes get no love I'll
seriously say sometimes like okay I'm
gonna use my you 25 blah blah blah but
they get no appreciation it's like
there's such a constant they just sort
of float around in the background and
they need to be seen and heard now so my
Sigma eye brushes I'm gonna say those
are my MVP brushes and in addition to
like these three I've got my e 21 smudge
brush I've got the e 36 which I have
nicknamed wispy white and that's like
the really fine one that's really good
around the borders they've just got so
many fantastic go to brushes that I
seriously use every single day this year
I decided to create an award for best
sponge and that is going to this sponge
from NYX I think this is the best of all
worlds combined into a sponge here and I
will link to the video where I expanded
on this even more this is its
pre-moistened size so this is as small
as it gets and then once you saturate it
with water you know under the sink and
then you bring it out it gets a little
bigger but the reason why I love this so
much is it does have the flat edge which
I kind of like flat edges for baking
perhaps or maybe you just like that to
do the blending on your foundation but
then you've got the rounded bottom that
a Beauty Blender would give you so if
you enjoy bouncing the product in you
can do that right it's sort of like a
fusion of a Real Techniques sponge and a
Beauty Blender and I love the shape it
comes to right here if you will put your
finger on the flat part and then use
that little rounded area to get around
the inner part of your eye it's so
perfect so it's a great low cost sponge
you'll love the texture and the softness
like it's awesome but it contains
elements of a couple great sponges and
puts them all in one I feel like I'm
gonna sneeze here and I have a category
for must-have tool is my hair bothering
you guys as much as it's bothering me
don't answer that question I tried to do
a cute bun on top of my head and it just
wasn't working so we're gonna have to
just deal it must have tool without a
doubt my tweezer man Pro curl lash
curler once you try this odds are you're
gonna realize just how bad life was with
the old lash curler that you were once
using and I've
some great lash curlers over time but
this is all about shape and if you have
kind of a round eye this is gonna really
really suit you
and basically it grabs every lash it's
as close as I think I would ever come to
a custom fitted lash curler do they even
make those anywhere like if they did
that would be kind of cool but this
really fits the I it comes in contact
very closely with my lash line it's got
enough squash see the squish level there
an eyelash curler has to have a little
squish that's how the curl gets really
set in there and you guys know about my
lashes they don't really like to curl so
I need a good flash curler it's gonna
whip them into shape and so this is
really good and it's rose gold so
there's that I am just living it up in
this video don't mind me category number
four best dual purpose item never had
this category really in the Emily Awards
before but basically it's like a product
that I don't use for its intended
function and it's become this must-have
in my collection even though I don't use
it for you know what it was mapped out
to be so can anybody think of what this
might be it is the wet and wild ultimate
brow highlighter and I use this in my
lower inner rim and if you don't think
that small detail of doing makeup
doesn't transform a look like you're
nuts because you got to put this in
there and it totally takes the white of
your eye and it makes your eyes look
bigger brighter more wide awake it's a
perfect tone it's not stark white it's
just got that little bit of peachy
pinkness in there it transfers in so
easily like I was needing something that
would basically take the place of my
Milani shadow eyes because those sticks
they're not really selling them anymore
and this is nice and soft and you can
absolutely use this up under the brow
and highlight that area there's no
shimmer in it it just glides on the
lower inner rim and it really less so
that's awesome the ultimate sum up for a
product and the Emily Awards that's
awesome now we're gonna get into some
MVPs and I'm gonna name an MVP for nails
and much of the year my nails went like
untouched bad condition just because
there is no time like I can't afford the
dry time when you got a baby less than a
year old you got a three year old who's
wanting to do all kinds of stuff it's
like nails are not top priority for me
they're just not my friend Anna became a
stylist for a brand called color street
I don't know if you've ever
heard of this but these are 100% real
nail polish strips I am NOT a nail
person I am very much into makeup but
I'm very much not into nails so this is
what the non nail person kind of needs
these are strips you peel them off I've
done jamberry before and while I really
love some of the looks that I got with
those they were kind of a pain to put on
this is actually a strip of nail polish
and you lay it on there and you very
easily like tear off the excess and it's
a simple process I've got them on now in
this style that I've gotten here this
glittery bronze the glitters are my
favorites and this these are kind of on
their way out I'm about ready to do a
fresh manicure but it is zero dry time
because it's just the strip but it still
is actual nail polish they remove with
nail polish remover and something that I
think is really cool as they sell just
solid colors they sell patterns like
this I'm excited to wear that for
Christmas this kind of red and black
checkered and then I have a gold glitter
here too the glitters just look so
flawless on the nails like if you've got
any amount of rippling or texture on
your nail itself you put those glitters
on they look so super smooth but it is
without a doubt the easiest nail related
thing I've ever done Plus no drying time
to worry about I've found these to last
I would say solidly between one and two
weeks sometimes I just noticed a little
wear around the tips but my nails grow
pretty fast and the main reason why I
would redo them is just having that
little bit of growth around the cuticle
made in the USA you can buy them online
so I'll link to Anna's info below but
that is a that's a really cool find this
year I have two MVPs for body here one
is incredibly luxurious and decadent and
the other is just like basic necessities
so I'll talk about the luxurious one
first it's the best smelling body butter
of your life it's this pistach skin care
pistachio body butter this randomly came
into my Pio box and I could not uh I
could not believe the scent the scent is
so freakin good it's so good like a
Tyler could not believe how good this
smelt I couldn't believe it
it's it's sweet I mean they definitely
got that pistachio thing working they're
made with pistachio oil you could put
this on you could eat some pistachio ice
cream or pistachio pudding and just be
living the life like I love this and
here's a big thing about this sometimes
I can't wear like the super fragranced
lotions for example certain ones from
Bath and Body Works I put them on my
legs if I've just shaved it's a real
situation there I get a lot of
irritation this well it's a I think
strongly scented and very like it's just
so strong this product scent wise but I
can put it on my legs zero irritation it
says made with natural and organic
ingredients and it just fills me with
joy like putting this on it's an
experience it's such a good texture
thick but not so thick that you spend
forever blending over it if you're
familiar with the body shop body butters
it's a little more soft and silky than
those but I love that stuff that's worth
looking into for sure and then my basic
necessity that has been just the best do
door is the Dove dry spray invisible
this one has the blue cap I think I
prefer the scent that has the like light
pink cap but you want the kind that says
no white marks on 100 colors and I sweat
I get hot best deodorant I mean I
thought the Oprah's life class secret
clinical was the best deodorant I've
ever tried but this is seriously light
as air but it works gotta give credit
where credit is due I think I initially
discovered this from makeup by Tiffany D
and yeah definitely what you want pretty
sky alert back here over my shoulder my
MVP for hair got to give this up to the
candy johnson sparkling cider shampoo
that is a collaboration with OGX eggs
this brand used to go by organics the
conditioner for that matter is great
from this line and if you tried any
other scents like I think they have a
sugar cookie scent and some different
ones which I have not tried but the
sparkling cider is blowing my mind I
love the smell it's kind of cinnamon tea
and warm it really sets us up nicely in
my hair my hair has a tendency to want
to be borderline oily well not always
but it just it kind of tends to get that
way quickly and I think this helps it
maybe be a little more volume eyes and a
little
less oily it kind of stinks that it's
limited-edition and I think they're
crazy if they don't like adopt this
scent into their line but it's so
wonderful and I look forward to
showering because of that my skincare
MVP or Co MVPs definitely my argan oil
skin care regimen I use the Josie Maran
pure argon milk the intensive hydrating
treatment and then a little bit of the
oil on top of that at nighttime and it's
so good I think it's been great for my
skin really great this time of years
you're drying out more I have a full
video where I talked about these and a
few other things that I got in a QVC
today's special value but the milk is
mostly what I use and then I target a
few zones with the oil like my driest
areas or the places on my skin where I'm
feeling like I'm most wrinkle prone and
they just work really nice like put
these on at night time with your Lana's
lips sleeping mask and you're gonna just
wake up to dewy wonderfulness in the
morning but not dewy in a bad way just
hydrated you know now my last three
categories here I've got an MVP for face
eyes and lips so this is where I kind of
look back on all those categories that I
had in the Emily awards and I think like
what was the most game-changing find in
face for example and this year for me I
think it's definitely the Laura Mercier
translucent loose setting powder when I
think about a product I wouldn't want to
be without when I think about a product
that I can pair with a lot of different
things but this sort of remains the
constant that keeps the look looking
good I can put this on top of a variety
of foundations or concealers and really
be happy with not only the way it looks
initially but the way it wears
throughout the day I think I can get
away with using less of this powder
compared to other powders you might bake
with wearing it today just kind of
lightly and I think it's a gorgeous
finish on the skin so yeah that's a
product I would not want to be without
my MVP for eyes is what I am wearing
today on my eyes as eyeshadow does
anybody know what it is it's my visi art
theory palette in amethyst and really
just the visi art Theory palettes in
general this stuff is truly just some of
the best eyeshadow available if you want
to experience that I would say get a
theory palette because as I've said
before it's the half man/half shimmer I
kind of loved the small simplicity of
these palettes it was close because I
love my lorac mega pro 4 I mean you
guys know I've got a real attachment to
that pallet but there's also something
specifically to be said for this pallet
and how good these Purple's are because
Purple's seem to be a thing that like
you got a pallet full of shades whatever
given brand it might be might not be
doing the purples very well like it's a
harder shade to just get right it seems
like and everything in here is so strong
and so beautiful shimmers in here are
just as good as the mattes and busy art
needs to be just applauded for how well
they executed this and also the pans do
come out like they're magnetic in there
so if you've got multiple theory
palettes you can definitely customize it
and take shades from one and put them in
another so that's really cool too and my
MVP for lips I kind of think of it as
the surprising find of the year like
it's a drugstore item I so love the
colors the finish on the lips the feel
on the lips and it's the l'oreal
infallible Pro matte gloss and I'm
wearing one of my minis here this berry
shade I'll have to put in the infobox
below exactly what shade that is because
honestly the print is so small I can't
even see it but this is what the full
sizes look like if you missed the lips
video I talked about these of course
already what the heck is a matte gloss
this is a matte gloss like it's creamy
it feels nice and creamy but yet it's
still matte you might notice that teeny
hint of shine when you freshly applied
one of these but they're comfortable on
the lips
and I think these are shouting at the
world you can have matte lips but not be
uncomfortable really nice staying power
too they wear very evenly they're not a
patchy flake off your lips type of thing
they offer some moisture to your lips
and that's what keeps them wearing
evenly I think I hope when I warned you
guys and I told y'all that you got to
get that set that Ulta had I hope you
got it because that's no longer
available as far as I know but they did
a fantastic little set of minis and it
was just you know great way to sample at
all so everybody that's the only awards
for this year that's 7 videos worth of
allowance I can't believe it um thank
you guys for watching thank you for all
your time your wonderful feedback I wish
I could just hug you right now I'm so so
grateful for the time that you spend
with me watching these videos and
chatting with me in the comments it
really means the world to me and I
cannot say thank you enough I appreciate
you and I love you so much bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
