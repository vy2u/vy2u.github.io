tuning in for this edition of I remember
in this video I'm going to be featuring
my lorac Pro one palette here so this I
think is such a basic and essential
palette it's probably one of if not the
most recommended palette on my channel
and does it not stand the test of time
like if you haven't pulled this out in a
while and you're just now laying eyes on
this for the first time and quite some
time we can all recognize how these are
some essential shades right I mean we've
got a variety of tones we've got the row
of mattes the row of shimmers so I'm
gonna put that palette back in action
today and I'm doing a look that actually
incorporates a double wing I saw my
friend David he sent me a picture of
some looks that he did during Fashion
Week and one of them was a double wing
and I immediately thought I want to try
that on my eyes so I'm gonna do that
today the shadow look is really fairly
basic but the wing takes a little I
don't know doing but it's not that hard
and you know what I was thinking as I
was creating the look I was thinking how
like if you want a Halloween look but
you don't want to do like Halloween
makeup but you want something like a
little more fun for that night and a
little more vampy and glam this could be
that look okay so anyway hopefully the
steps that I put this into make it a
little bit easy and let me know also
what forgotten or older palettes you
would like to see in this series I have
already done the naked 1 palette in
general I feel like I've had a lot of
requests for like the first edition of
some of these series so naked one lorac
pro this one also the first chocolate
bar palette but I've done a lot of Too
Faced lately so I will do that one
eventually because I've had tons of
requests for chocolate bar but I'm open
to doing drugstore wants - I already
have done and the wet and wild comfort
zone palettes so let me know if there's
any iconic drugstore palettes that you
can think of that maybe haven't gotten a
real good look lately also guys did you
see in the background I got a little boo
pumpkin it's black and white and I got
it from Target and then I got a candle
thing and I think there's some glare
coming off of it from the window but
I've got a little flameless candle back
there and that the holder for it I got
it on clearance for like 6 bucks in the
outdoor section of Target so yes anyway
let's move it along here's the tutorial
so I've put on my Milani eyeshadow
primer all over the eye and then I'm
gonna sort of give myself a little bit
of a base I'm gonna use this color
called cream a matte shade and just
gonna go over the whole surface of the
eye I do want the shadow that's
happening up here to end up kind of soft
looking actually so you can take one of
those you know creamy neutral mattes and
just set the tone here and then I'm
gonna go into taupe
hello taupe and we're gonna pop this in
the crease just to very lightly get some
color going here it helps the deeper
shades blend a little bit when you don't
go in like super full force with your
darkest shade all at once right at the
beginning and then I'm going to use a
little bit of sable and sable is a
really warm brown actually a memory card
just cut out on me so I'm not sure if
you got all that but I was saying that
sable is a very warm brown and when I
incorporate it into a look and I shear
it out it almost seems like some
different shade between like taupe and
sable you know like it's just this
really soft warm brown when you do a
sheer
and then I'm going to go back with a
little more taupe and just work this in
kind of around the edge of what I've
done here I went back and did that at
the tail end of this look so I'm just
going to go ahead and for simplicity
sake do that now
then I love how brightening the light
pink pillar is here and the fun thing
about lorac Pro is that you know they
named the shades exactly what they are
this shade is light pink thank you
I guess not every one of their palettes
is that way but you know in some
palettes they're gonna start naming that
like sundae macaroon or something so
then a little more sable and I'm just
gonna put this on the outer half of my
lid ultra basics so far right you could
certainly make this stage of the game a
little more flashy there's just a lot of
like intricate liner happening in this
look and I kind of want that to shine
that simple easy man and then I'm gonna
take a really fine tip liner pin I'm
using this because it's new I just sort
of wanted to test it out it's the super
slim from L'Oreal in the shape called
black and I am actually gonna start on
my innermost corner and I'm gonna go a
little bit beyond my tear duct to see
how this one is like pointing down just
a little bit so I'm gonna do that it's
like just continue your line is if you
were just passing by the tear duct you
screw this up the first time on the
other eye because I like never do this
kind of like that see um but I had to go
back and erase them and put it back on
but then from there I'm just going to
continue all the way across like normal
eyeliner
this liner is actually pretty easy to
use and it does dry down to like a nice
matte black now that we're getting to
the end of the eye I'm gonna do a wing
and I like to do my winged liner sort of
keeping in mind where my brows are at
okay so I like to do my general standard
wing just doing a normal wing here and
we're going to point it kind of off
toward the tip of our eyebrow and I like
to swoop it up in that manner then go
from the actual corner of my eye and
come out to meet it then we've got this
little empty triangle and it's just a
matter of filling that in I may have
really oversimplified that just then but
that is sort of the the quick thought
process that goes through my mind
whenever I do it and sometimes I come in
and I also fill in that little gap so
there's not quite so much of a you know
dip to my wing but it's more of it
coming right at your wing sound effects
help me okay
so I think that top line is about what I
did over on the other side now we're
gonna put that one down for a second I'm
gonna go ahead and line my lower inner
rim with a black liner this is the NYX
trays Yoli and the shade is pitch black
any black that you like to use in your
waterline will do and I'm gonna take it
all the way to like meet my you know
tearduct action that's happening here
take it all the way in there and then
all the way back across the waterline
some people can do their waterline
without like pulling down at all and I
don't know how those people avoid
drawing on their eyeball but somehow it
works for them but I have to pull down a
little bit to ensure that I'm not lining
my eyeball
I think I just did draw in my eyeball
inevitably I'm gonna take the liquid
liner again and I'm gonna use this to
create sort of a guideline I'm gonna
play off of this line a lot with shadow
but I want the line to be there with
liquid first so I'm going to try to
think about making a little parallel
line underneath the first wing and it's
gonna kind of go out like this and just
be this little line did anybody catch
that was it so fine it didn't even show
up on the camera gosh I hope it did bub
it's like literally tiptoeing into the
room at the most intricate part of the
look okay just think about keeping it
perhaps if you can a little bit finer
than the top line and we're going to
like I said accentuate this with shadow
first up I'm taking just a regular
angled liner brush and I'm gonna go into
black in this palette this is where a
real solid black can be so beneficial
and I'm kind of going on if not slightly
underneath the line and just using a
little shadow there and then kind of
pulling it in here and see how that's
starting to now at the lower lash line a
bit more so we're softening softening
there then I'm going to take a little
bit of sable our good friend sable and
I'm just gonna use that as well a little
bit there again we're softening the look
and then something I really liked about
the other is I won't keep consistent on
the sides i use garnet this is in the
spirit of fall everybody I'm gonna take
garnet and that's gonna be like
following the entire lower lash line I
went it way way in here with it and I'm
gonna continue it all the way up under
the wing and what we end up kind of
getting a look of here is one really
tight solid liquid wing with it paired
with another texture of wing that seems
a little bit softer because we're
letting the powder come up
under it and just give it this nice like
kind of almost feathery look I don't
know texture that's what we're playing
with hair texture and then I did one
more thing on the other eye and I don't
really know how I feel about this like
it's okay it's not really as pronounced
just because it is such a subtle little
thing but I took gold eyeshadow and I
went right between the wings and I used
a very fine brush if you're wondering
it's the winged liner
yo six it's like a teeny fine angled
liner brush and I use gold from the
palette and I just stuck it there in
between and created like one more fall
splash doesn't have to be done I think
it looks fine and if not a bit cleaner
when you don't do this hard to stop
yourself sometimes I gotta fill that gap
with something I think you can make that
really pronounced if you had a gold
cream liner or a gold eye liner even
heck a gold liquid liner that was really
filed looking and you wanted to like put
it there in between the wings but I'm
just using the shadow but see how we're
dark we're smoky we're intense but we're
a hint of fall because we use garnet and
gold next up I am going to curl my
eyelashes here
I'm using this essence lash princess
sculpted Volume Mascara which is pretty
good I don't like it as well as lash
paradise but I've got a tube open so I'm
really trying to discipline myself
mascara isin use some of these tubes
that I got open and I think this is a
look where you could you could skip the
false lashes and you would have a ton of
impact sheerly from what you've done
with your eyeliner I kind of like the
glam that the lashes throw on it you
know I'm doing a little bit of lower
last year too with the covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant and the lash I'm
using is a current favorite it's the
Koko lashes in the style called Misha
it's like a real fluffy just full
fluttery lash so I'm going to pop that
on you know I gotta wait a little bit
let the glue get tacky and whatnot and
I'll put that on and I'll join you with
the finished look and let you know a few
more details about what else is on my
face so there's the finished look I'm so
happy with it I think this was really
fun I mean I'm not really the pro of all
like crazy liner looks but I was
inspired and I think it kind of paid off
it's a fun way to add interest to your
look without like screaming at your
friends like hey I'm doing something
different with my eyeshadow and I really
love this palette like it's the mother
of all basic you know all the must-haves
type of palettes it's so good and what
else I used on my face here this is my
blush this is from the brand called
found and I found it at Walmart and the
shade is called rose glow it's kind of
an illuminating glowy blush and also in
the spirit of lorac I used my lorac Pro
contour palette so I've got like a
little bit of that highlight on here and
definitely the contour shades as well I
mostly use the light contour and a
little bit of the medium and on my lips
I am wearing my Charlotte Tilbury Bond
girl there's a shop your stash moment I
thought I want something kind of fall
but not too terribly dark I'm paired
with this eye so I think this is just
about perfect so thank you guys so much

fun
