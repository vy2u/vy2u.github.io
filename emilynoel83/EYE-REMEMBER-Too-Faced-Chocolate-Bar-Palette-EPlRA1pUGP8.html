tuning in in this video we're putting
the spotlight back on the original Too
Faced chocolate bar palette I've been
meaning to do this for a while in this I
remember series what I like to do is
pull out a palette that's maybe been
forgotten perhaps a little bit neglected
in my collection and I do a look with it
and this series is very much driven by
your requests so let me know in the
comments section what palettes what even
little smaller drugstore quads or you
know whatever what things do you feel
have fallen off the radar that we should
bring back into the conversation so a
lotta you wanted to see this guy used
really the head honcho of the whole
chocolate bar line and the look I came
out with I think is a little neutral but
still a little fun so I'll take you
through it okay chocolate bar here we go
I'm looking at this palette doesn't it
seem so like I don't know neutral
neutral
instead of like warm neutral it's kind
of a different vibe from a lot of all
the super warm things that have come out
lately but I'm using this shade right
here and this palette I think more
recently released ones have the names
printed on the palette itself but this
one does not I mean they were probably
on a clear sheet at one time but you
know me and clear sheets they don't
always survive in this makeup room so
I've just been working with that one
shade to get it built up how I want it
in the crease excuse me I think I'm
gonna do kind of a dramatic look here
but I'm gonna like ease my way into it
you know as I do I'm a very build it up
slowly type person on the eyes but I'm
gonna go over to this shade over here
that has a little shimmer it's kind of
like a plummy Brown and I'm gonna add
that to my crease and just get it a
little deeper on the outside I forgot
how much I enjoyed this palette like I
love this series so much because you
just fall in love with things that you
sort of I wouldn't say I totally forgot
about it but it just kind of gets pushed
to the back you know unfairly it's
worthy of use but so many things are you
know it's like I wish I had a few extra
sets of eyeballs that I could just do in
the mornings if I had time okay now I'm
going to buff that out a little bit
kind of want to throw a highlight on
there so I'm gonna use this matte cream
shade for that and I'm gonna add a
little glow on top of it as well oh man
I'm just getting reminded I feel like I
used this glowy shadow that's a
highlight on my face back in the day I'm
gonna try that again why not right yeah
oh pretty it's very cool very
brightening cuz it's got a little bit of
pink tone in that shade I think I'm
gonna do like a real high contrast thing
here on the lid so I'm gonna go very
light toward the inside and super dark
toward the outside and develop kind of a
wing there so I'm gonna start with the
lighter shade and I'm gonna go over to
this color it's kind of like a peachy
champagne so soft so nice to work with
just lay that down on like the inner
half of your lid I'm curious you guys
how do you follow tutorials do you
actively like have them on while you're
doing your makeup and go step by step
and like pause it if you need to and
really work with it that way or do you
just kind of watch and file away some
ideas and then do your look later I'd
like to know I'm gonna do a little bit
of this light shade right here for
brightening and I want to add a little
bit to make this even lighter
now I'm kind of cleaning my brush off a
bit and I'm going to go to this darkest
Matt Brown right here and I'm going to
use the flat brush first just because I
definitely want some of this on at least
half the lid so a flat brush is great
for getting it placed there in a very
concentrated way
pat pat do a little wedging the old
patent wedge pat it on the lid wedge it
in the crease does anybody else watch
Curb Your Enthusiasm it came to my mind
because I just said Pat and wedge and it
seems like he always gets little like
phrases it is it's like what was the one
the other night when he was trying to
tip the guy and he talked about like you
can't flip the tube you just got a watch
Larry David to understand Larry David
that's that's all I could say now I want
to kind of bring that darkness even
further out with that same shadow here
the matte Brown which is really
pigmented and very nice to work with
here I'm gonna pull it up kind of in the
direction of my outer tip of my eyebrow
we're gonna do a fun lower lash line so
if you're sitting there thinking Emily I
don't know about all this Brown this
happening I got you
okay it's looking very like sculpted
right now it needs a little softening up
so I'm taking a bear brush and I'm just
kind of running it along the edge I'm
not really sweeping it into my look a
lot because I don't want to you know
really mess with the look all that much
I just want to soften the edges I'll
probably have some winged liner involved
so that kind of helps
I don't know frame the look a bit as
well and I want kind of a little little
bit of a transition so I'm going to go
back to this shade that we first used in
the crease and I find myself doing this
a lot with looks like once I've really
gotten it as dark as I want it then I go
back in with that sort of mid-tone shade
and it helps everything kind of blend
out well not really blend out but just
you know transition
extra DAB
okay now I'm going to go ahead and do my
upper liner because the lower liner is
gonna be a whole process in itself so
I'm using my infallible super slim this
is the one I talked about in my video
where I was mentioning products that I
took with me on our little Thanksgiving
break reviewed a lot of products in one
video and this is one of those things
that I just really came away liking so
here I'm going to basically just follow
that shape that I created with the
eyeshadow and eyeliner is just going to
roll with that
okay so I've got my wings I'm somewhat
satisfied with them I guess
and then I'm gonna do kind of a bluish a
lavender sort of a pump on the lower
lash line I'm gonna work with this shade
right here yep that little wildcard that
was thrown into the chocolate bar I'm
gonna use some different liners to help
this situation work out so I'm gonna use
my makeup Forever aqua XL and s 20 how
do we describe this dusty teal it's sort
of a medium teal color I'm going to get
that in my lower inner rim so the bluest
part of this look is going to be closest
to the eyeball and then it's going to
fade outward into more of a dusty
shimmery whatever you want to call that
shade in the chocolate bar palette and
work a little bit of this color just
into the lashline especially on the
outside
then I'm going to take this new
Maybelline lasting drama light liner and
this is the color what was this called
moonlight purple I did use this in
another video recently too but I just
thought it would be perfect with this
particular shadow in this palette and
I'm just gonna cover the entire rest of
the lower lash line and also pull this
color out underneath the wing and this
this is a nice long wearing liner by the
way this wore really well when I wore it
in that other video and it just it's
really good about not smudging off
flaking off so I've got that everywhere
and boom I say and then in so many
videos that like as if you guys haven't
noticed when I'm doing tutorials and I'm
editing I introduce every step with and
then I'm gonna go into this shade which
is perhaps been my least use shade in
this whole palette so it's fun to kind
of re approach a palette with the
thought that I'm gonna use you
differently this time you know I'm just
overlapping where I put that Maybelline
eye liner and it's kind of making this
particular shadow I think a little
brighter like it's just given a little
something to cling to
I'm gonna take just a bit of the mat
super dark brown and use that a little
bit here under the wing part to just
make it all blend a little better see
what I'm doing I'm just putting it
directly under the wing and that
darkness is kind of helping the blue
blend in so it doesn't look so out of
place I guess then what I feel like man
I'm gonna go back sorry this is all over
the place yeah just a little more of
that so we can really see some shine on
the inner part
so now I'm gonna spare you the
tediousness of this I'm gonna curl my
lashes I'm gonna do some of the smart
Jeb's mascara and maybe a little bit of
the Maybelline total temptation on the
lower lashes because this makes it thick
lower lash but this did not smudge or
flake on me anytime I've put it there so
I'm gonna do that and I'll be right back
so see how it looks out the window this
morning see that warmth kind of along
the horizon and then a little bit blue
that's kind of the look that we've
achieved here with the eyes without even
really trying sorry I got a hair stuck
to my lip we've got a little bit of
warmth some contrast there on the lid
and then I love how this lower lash line
turned out and yes I did add some false
lashes on top they were some really
inexpensive ones that I got for my Kate
house I'll have to look up the style
because I did not put those back in
their box where they go but I really
feel like this is one of the best looks
that I've done with this chocolate bar
palette I'm really liking it it
definitely sort of reinvigorated my love
for this palette and what else am I
wearing I decided to go with kind of a
warm pumpkiny lip so I'm wearing rebirth
from makeup revolution I really wanted
to show you guys this because I had
mentioned this and swatch this in my
last video but it's a great color and
then I put a little bit of awaken which
is another one of those lipsticks from
that line I kind of put that a little in
the center of the lower lip love mix in
a couple good lipsticks and then I have
a little bit of the covergirl peach
perfection instant cheekbones on the
cheeks and I think that plays well with
a little bit of warmth that's visible
from this eye look and the lip as well
so please let me know what palette you
would like to see featured in an I
remember video they can even be smaller
like drugstore things if there's
something you heard me talking about way
back when and you'd like to see it
brought back to the forefront let me
know thank you so much for watching and
I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
