this is the second video I've done in my
I remember series where we're talking
about some talents that were really much
talked about maybe just a few years back
but they've kind of dropped off the
YouTube radar a little bit lately and
one of my biggest requests left on the
last video I did using wet and wild
comfort zone was for the naked palette
the original naked one and this
definitely is my favorite of the Naked
palette I really like Naked 3 also but
there's just something about the variety
that you get out of this palette and
these shades have become just so classic
to me and kind of the standard by which
you compare so many nude eyeshadow
palettes so what I really wanted this
series to be and what was requested that
this series be was you know just a bunch
of everyday I look things that people
can realistically put together and feel
comfortable wearing out of the house and
aren't too too big of a deal difficulty
wise so that's kind of what I did today
so I hope you like the look okay regular
old Naked palette here we go I think I'm
gonna get things started with why have I
been so clumsy lately I mean really I
feel like I dropped something at least
once in every video these days and as I
would say I'm going to start off with
the shade naked so that would be your
lightest like matte crease type color
and I'm just going to get that going
here in my crease and I'm thinking about
exactly where I want to go with this
palette today and I'm also thinking back
to the first video I ever remember doing
with the Naked palette and I think I was
reviewing it but doing it in a
comparison with the Too Faced natural
eye palette because they kind of were
out around the same time and so I
remember getting both of those and
talking about them in a video and I
really do think both are really good
palettes they both definitely have their
strong points to face natural eye has of
course undergone a bit of a makeover
with a few of its shades in the past few
years but they're both great palettes
okay so that's a little bit of naked in
the crease and then I'm going to use
some books right there so that is your
slightly deeper
Matt Brown crease color it's not like a
dark brown but it's a little darker than
naked of course I'm just going to put
that right here in my outer corner yeah
where have all the naked tutorials gone
you know there's just been so many
things come out since that time and
people kind of get up and move on but
yet I don't hear about people saying
like I'm totally abandoning The Naked
palette people still seem to have like a
deep love for this palette it just
doesn't get a lot of air time on YouTube
these days alrighty so I've kind of
built up some base color there the
actual request was to do everyday
wearable looks with palettes so I'm not
going to go too over the top of this but
it'll get a little smoky perhaps if I'm
honest with myself I'm gonna go in with
sin here and a flat brush I always
forget the exact number name of the flat
brush but I put it in the info box below
from Sigma and I'm just dabbing that
right now around my tear duct area my
tear duct yep
I love welcome morning so we're looking
at a new car of something bigger than
what we already have considering the two
car seat situation that we're in right
now and we'll probably be in for a while
we want something a little bit roomier
hmm then I can't decide where to go for
like the shimmery pop that I want to do
on the lid do I want to do sidecar and
keep it topi do I want to do half-baked
and do it real golden or maybe toasted I
kind of miss toasted this kind of Mavi
shimmery shade this color I feel like so
many naked dupe palettes try to
replicate this toasted shade and just
can't get quite on point with what Urban
Decay has done here because sometimes I
feel like this comes off a little bit
like a rose gold but yet it's got that
depth I don't know it's so pretty I love
this color and I'm just as you can see
keeping that kind of on the middle part
of my lid
and then from there I'm going to go to
creep which is this darkest color I'm
going to Pat that here on my outer
corner and I'm going to wedge that into
the crease
I may play that up a little bit more
with just a small brush here in a second
okay so I've got this little 310 I think
is the number brush from MU a
professional it's a small crease brush
and I got it CBS and I use it all the
time this is my essence of beauty sign
crease brush duo I know that that's like
that goes way way back like if I were
truly doing a full-on throwback video
here I would use those but I just know
that those are hard if not impossible to
get your hands on these days so this is
definitely a good crease brush if you're
looking for something with a lot of
control like it's smaller than the Sigma
e25 that I often use to just lay down
some matte shadow in the crease at the
start but I don't really have any
product on this brush right now what I'm
doing that darkest shade just really was
so dark and I felt like I put a lot of
product on the outer part of my lid so
I'm just using this little brush to sort
of move that around a little bit and and
really deepen up that outer corner I
just love a good light kind of buffed
out outer V that's not too like V truly
you know what I mean it's just a
softened outer V that's kind of my my
game these days okay two things I want
to do I want to take toasted and
reinforce that shade right here on my
lid again it's like this God neutrally
little mix of a hint of Plum rose gold
and taupe all rolled into one shade I'm
going to use just a hair more of that
naked color and just kind of whisk that
around my outer border to help make sure
everything is looking nice and blended
and then to make sure we leave no stone
unturned I'm going to blend with the
brush that i always use bear in the
Sigma e-40 nice fluffy blender here I
think I'll give myself a little pop of
virgin right under the highest point of
my brow now for eyeliner this probably
isn't going to show up like a super
intense color wise but I just want to
try it out it's this wild green liner
from the L'Oreal infallible paints line
I just want to see how this goes on
these liners if you saw my infallible
paints video I believe that one's going
on before this they have this line of
pins and I mentioned how the ones that I
had tried the black and the white seem
to skip and like kind of pull going on
top of those paints cream shadows
because once they set they get almost
just a teeny bit hard on the eyelid and
here I'm going across powder shadow and
this seems to have no problem going
across the powder so that's kind of cool
I think I'll wing it out too
but yeah it's a felt-tip pen and I do
really like how taper down it is it's a
very gradual taper so you feel like and
kind of lay it on its side and you know
take full advantage of that shape talk
about a subtle pop of color though I
mean this green is definitely deep green
but it's so dark that it's not very loud
at all
let me go with the nude lower inner rim
as my Rimmel scandaleyes in nude
and then I'm going to take my little
smudgy brush use a little bit of hustle
right down here on my lower lash line
the outer part for now
and then I think I'll do a little more
toasted for the rest of the lashline
next up I will just curl the lashes
using some of this makeup forever
excessive lash I actually and in love
with this brush look how little is like
just doesn't have tons of super long spy
Keys everywhere I find that I'm just
trying to get my mascara on a lot faster
these days so I'm in some ways a bit
more careless with it so if it can just
be a smaller brush and not get in my way
that's great
so this one it builds a lot of nice
length I'm actually liking it better now
I'm into about like week 2 with this so
that's the sweet spot for a lot of
mascaras for me you know you use up a
little bit of the product you can really
see like how well it builds we just got
our pool open back up yesterday and you
kind of hold your breath like is
everything going to you know keep
working and how it should and sure
enough we needed a new part for
something for the little like vacuum
that runs around the pool so ordered
that and I'm hoping by like this weekend
we can get that installed and everything
will be all systems go right I am doing
a little bit of my covergirl clump
crusher water resistant on the lower
lashes just because I I don't think I've
used the excessive lash on my lowers yet
and I don't really want to risk with
smudges today this is another one of
those mascaras though with a really
nicely sized brush so you can kind of be
quick with it knock on wood and not
worry too much about knocking yourself
on the face you know what I mean it's
just easy to control and I think this is
going to be yet another false lash free
look today because number one I like the
way my lashes look with that make up
forever mascara on them and number two
I've got that green eyeliner that I
don't necessarily want to cover up with
the lash band you know what I'm saying
and also we kind of claimed that this
was going to be an everyday eyes type
series so I'm going to go with that I'm
going to do nude star from the
infallible paints line so allow me to
just slap that on
I don't know if I address this in the
review I can't remember but these kind
of smell like you just open a packet of
kool-aid a little bit too quick with
don't notice it beyond the application
but just taking it out of the tube when
it's right here under my nose that's
what I smell so this is just a little
bit deeper and rosier than that other
color I really like from this line
called spicy blush like this you know it
truly looks like the outer packaging fat
versus this I like that they were able
to create shades that actually look
pretty dang close to what the outer
packaging is they created
okay so finished eyelook a little Urban
Decay Naked palette a little forest
green eyeliner not bad and as far as my
blush today I am wearing let's see a
little bit of this shade topped with
some of that peach as well so that's
what's giving me mellow pop on the
cheeks but thank you guys so much for
watching thank you for your interest in
this series I just think it's so fun to
dig back into some of those things that
we just don't hear talked about that
often anymore so please leave your
requests for future videos in this
series in the comment section and I will
talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
