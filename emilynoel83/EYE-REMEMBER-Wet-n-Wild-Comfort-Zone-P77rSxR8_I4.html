this new series is kind of based on a
viewer request
I cannot remember for the life of me
where it came from I don't know if it
was YouTube or Twitter but I think it
was one of the two I'm so so sorry but
if you're out there and you're listening
to this you know I'm talking to you
basically what this person wanted to see
was some everyday eye looks using
palettes that I've talked about in the
past and so I thought yeah that's a
great idea it would be a great way to
kind of interject some quick tutorials
here on my channel and it's an
especially nice time to do this because
I've been reorganizing my makeup and
digging through so much stuff that a lot
of this is now like refreshed in my mind
so I wanted to call this I remember the
first product I remember is this guy
from wet and wild it's the comfort zone
palette don't we all have that somewhere
I'm not so sure if what I've done is an
everyday look or maybe a little bit of a
nighttime ish look but here's what I did
so first things first I'm going to apply
some Milani eyeshadow primer love this
stuff somebody tweeted me recently said
why do you love that so much well it
helps my eyeshadow stay a really long
time I feel like I also think that it's
just tacky enough to help the shadows
cling and really be more pronounced when
I apply them but it's not so tacky that
it's going to cause any sort of creasing
you know it's definitely like an anti
creasing thing for me but also it's
affordable this is the palette we're
going to use today it is wet and wild
comfort zone and I'm trying to even
think like what direction do I want to
go with this I think I just need to warm
myself up a little bit and put some of
this crease shade right in my crease
this is that soft brown it kind of has a
satiny finish there's really a lot of
shimmer in this palette these days I
might look at and be like I need some
mattes in there but I remember when this
was brand new to me and it was just fine
I'm not sure if this is my original
comfort zone I actually feel like I had
maybe broken my first one and for just
this one actually not that long
then I'm going to do a little bit of
this shade right here
unlike the inner part of my lid kind of
like a gold any light olive and then I'm
a little more green showing up so I'm
going to do some of that yes comfort
zone coming back then I'm going to use
some of this crazy designer shade down
here that has like that little bit of
brownish yet also blueish look to it it
just depends on how you apply it like
how much you pack on going very little
by little because these these shades
from wet and wild can be very intense
you know I want to kind of overlap that
green a little bit interesting that it
shaved almost looking like a really warm
brown a little blending here
and while I got this brush now I think
I'm going to use this kind of buttery
shade as my highlight just patting on a
bit more of that green I really don't
want to lose it in this look and
sometimes you blend blend blend around
stuff and you start to lose what you
originally laid down so that and then I
think I'm going to do some dark green
let's just put the entire palette like
remember wearing this palette so much is
like a a night out kind of look you know
a smoky eye a little bit olive green
totally my jam for a period of time not
like I don't like it now you know I just
haven't reached for it in a long long
time yeah I forgot how much I loved that
darkest all live shade that's great even
though it's got some shimmer it looks so
good side by side with the lighter green
if you were recreating this look
honestly you could probably skip that
tip where I use this color down here
because I've sort of gone and covered
that up I think that has more intensity
when you're using it just on its own and
less overlapping another shade but you
do your thing
and then I think to finish this top part
of the eye will think what I need is
just a little bit more of this like
caramel a light brown just very softly
around the border
okay next up I'm going to use my Jordana
color Envy liner in black Envy I'm just
going to line the upper lash line I kind
of think this look calls for a wing and
then despite getting a decent amount of
sleep last night I feel like my eyes
just I don't know they feel tired they
probably look a little bit tired too so
I think I want to brighten up my lower
inner rim this is the nude from makeup
geek the full spectrum pencil I had used
this so long ago well not really that
long ago but like months back and I
couldn't really remember what it did
staying power for me so I wanted to pull
this out and try it again and then I
think on the lower lash line I just
wanted to keep it really like I don't
know caramel a brown around this nice
little green we've got on the lid so I'm
going to go into this crease shade again
MVP and we're just going to smudge that
down here yeah it's just kind of kind of
a murky little color
and this is my segment u-21 smudge brush
by the way feel like I've used this
brush for so long in my makeup doing
days it's just a really great little
brush for lower lashline whether you
want it to be a little bit more buffed
out or even more precise josh is the
perfect taper perfect shape then I'm
going to go around the tear just tear
drift and that tear duct
just quickly with this buttery shade
that I used really softly under the brow
as a highlight but see how you can
really lay that down for some brightness
like this palette can actually create
some very bright ins like wide awake
type looks I went you know a little bit
more on the smoky route with it for
right now but you pop either these two
shades on the lid and make that your
crease color you're like good to go for
a natural daytime kind of whatever I
don't know this is kind of my natural
place I'm curling the lashes with my
tweezer Minh lash curler for round eyes
which I absolutely continue to love it
really just gets in touch with the
entire lash line though I don't feel
like any lashes are getting left out of
it and not getting curled and ends up
being a really good curl - and then I'm
going to use some it cosmetics superhero
love this mascara
started watching the Fosters on Netflix
I can't remember who got me onto that
but it's really good really enjoying it
okay guys and this is going to be it
no false lashes today I'm kind of happy
with the lash look I'm using that
superhero mascara and if you're
wondering what's on my lips I started
out going all like sweet and innocent
with this light shade from a makeup
revolution this is in the color called
awakened and I think it's like a
Charlotte Tilbury knockoff type idea
with this rose gold packaging but I've
got that on and then I deepened it up a
little bit on the outside with the total
throwback lip liner NYX mahogany this is
just one of their standard pencils and I
use that on the outer part and then a
little bit of jus a lip topper and
skinny dip right here in the center of
the lower lip funny thing is that this
is a lip liner I probably reach for
quite a bit back in the day with neutral
types nude lip looks but then does
anybody remember the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss in foiled that was my
jam
that you know in that day was like what
this kind of product is today as a total
like light super shimmery lip gloss
always used it on the center of the
lower lip and now like specific products
are being created to do that very test
I wish they'd bring back foil because
that was awesome anyway before my
concept of a short video turns into a
long video I will say goodbye and thank
you guys so much for watching let me
know what rediscovered palate you would
like to see a look for in this series
I'd be happy to do it so thank you guys
