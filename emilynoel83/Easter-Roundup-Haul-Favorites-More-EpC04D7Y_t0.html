this video this is my sister Kelly also
known as pup to me and not mentioned her
numerous times and videos and vlogs and
stuff and we're together for Easter yeah
I noticed that this is an Easter edition
yeah beauty I got these in my Easter
basket so we have at the end of this
video
something very cute to show you it is it
is the classified is what the queue is
this is the cutest thing I've ever baked
so if you want to see that you'll have
to sing around till again and for now um
yes
today pup and I went to a store called
Meyer Meyer a lot of you probably have
these in your in your hometowns but I've
never been to one before and I found
that they had quite an amazing selection
of makeup of my school yes that's my bed
and I got um
nothing too exciting here some hair
color I got some Clairol natural
instincts and nutmeg it's the dark brown
shade I had a few questions about that
that is sort of what color this is but
it's really new Brandy's no well I've
used this before and what it really is
not to confuse anyone but this is the
same color that my hair really is it
makes it a little thicker feeling so
have that I got there was a BOGO going
on nothing confirmed on this yet but a
lot of people think Jane is but Jane the
brand that's in a lot of drugstores may
be going away for good
sure but I do know that it is going on
sale right now at a lot of different
places so sometimes good sometimes
that's a sign it's a very good brand and
they have something new out called agua
suna khals and it is it's supposed to be
like organic makeup not silver but beige
and I have a tinted moisturizer here for
medium warm tones that I'll try and I
have a blush blush stick in a shimmery
peach shape that I'm a I'll definitely
test those out and tell you what I think
and maybe I'll hopefully tell you about
it before the sales are all over and you
can still go out and get them and just a
couple more things to mention here I got
some of these elf elements compacts I
actually got four of them and they hold
shadows of many different brands
actually they will hold max eyeshadows
they will hold Milani elf and of course
the Coastal Scents ones which I have
some they're about that size and this is
magnetized and the shadows the shadows I
have from Coastal Scents are magnetized
as well so I'll be able to make 4
these are only a dollar apiece and you
just stick them right in there and you
can make your own set of colors and they
got a great mirror they're really nice
we'll come back unbeautiful good we get
older yeah and could be a good luck gift
thing you know you could fill these up
with some colors you think someone's
gonna like and we have two cats as our
owner
they're so cute and I believe that is it
oh one last thing that I actually got on
wrecked on tux recommendation
it's the L'Oreal infallible 16 wait what
does it say is it a 16 hour I'm not sure
it doesn't say on this round
it's the lip color compact so basically
what you've got is the color which hat
comes out with a wand applicator and you
just unscrew
put it on I have it on right now and
this shade is amethyst that I have and
then it has kind of a gloss sort of chap
sticky form that you put on over the top
and I have that on now and I like it and
I think the texture is interesting
because it actually mine has a little
bit of shimmer to it it's not like what
a flat color which a lot of those some
of them are gonna have and this will
lead into pups favorites and Ansem not
so favorites yeah yeah the viewers may
not know about well yeah the infallible
I go with seven ten seven ten I might
use this I would say every day for as
long as they've been making it a couple
of years remember like that you've
purchased and repurchase oh yeah I mean
to the point where I don't even look at
the name of the color I just think seven
times you know so yeah it's really
affordable is like eight or nine dollars
lasts a long time and tapas a teacher
I'm a teacher I'm talking all the time
and I can't be you know every hour
checking my lipstick and so this I put
it on at six o'clock in the morning and
by three o'clock it's still hanging in
there you not talking you know snacking
on nuts and it's just really great I
recommend it but I don't use the little
chap sticky thing the white part and I
kind of opted for some kind of lip gloss
I got this a long time ago this is the
Victoria's Secret beauty brush like a
cape let's see it kind of cakey I guess
cotton candy ish Wow yeah sweet very
sweet very sweet and this kind of goes
on and takes whatever flat color is
going on
and just makes it shiny and yeah really
this looks like I mean you can't tell
it's that it's got that court sort of
sometimes cakey finish that some of
those long wearing things have so and
I've always got a kind of a strong lip
color and it's terrible when you're as
pale as me your lips are pale too and
your lipstick starts to wear off kind of
in the middle and then you're sort of
left outlining fast so this stays where
you want it to stay yes okay I want to
know for last month when I got this red
velvet cake by philosophy yes and I just
like this looks like about the kind of
shade I would wear in a lipstick it
would be nice glass like that and red
velvet cake but that smells awesome
because they're scented products they
make Milano you may be familiar with the
like shower gels and slash shampoos and
conditioners that come in the BA the big
bottles and there's like a zillion
different yeah I go for you for PS miss
all the time but so I was like yeah
little something for puff I opened it up
and while I love the shape the scent it
just really isn't that yeah enough my
dear red velvet cake is different from
other people's but that's just no
physical weed yeah no you get the
feeling maybe they were mixing and
mixing trying to come up with the right
thing yeah but the color you like colors
good color but you know if you have like
if lipstick is kind of honking out on
you you're gonna amp it up for a few
hours with this that's my little okay L
Revlon colors today
the the liquid liner yeah
is God's just so tiny how do you read
these sometimes I don't
okay yeah I think this is the shimmery
shimmering black like this is black the
barrel part and then the handle is kind
of metallic and I don't notice any
difference
it just looks black I have both and they
are very very similar there's hardly any
difference you can tell but I love the
quality of that particular liner because
you it really is but it's not gonna go
that way
I've kind of oily skin it doesn't do a
thing and what more could you ask and
that is this most of the Revlon
Colorstay products claim the last for 16
hours and it can be hard with face
makeup and blush to really determine
they're not as still on but when you
look at that eyeliner at the end of the
day it's still there you could pretty
much say for sure that it yeah yeah so I
too am a disciple of nice and then I got
a infallible concealer and I've really
pale skin and this is like the whitest
shade they make pretty much every
foundation thing I get I always have to
go all the way over to like the lightest
part and yeah this works it stays on
forever it doesn't disappear you know
like some of the other ones do and this
is like probably the first thing I put
on my face in the morning and it's
another one of those really long long
wearing - I'm wearing this is like I've
used it down to the nub so then I stink
for bought some again and it's sort of
sold where you see this but hardly can
ever find this they're always selling
this and like that really store is doing
wait so we found it this morning
yeah my spazzed ahead to get it yeah
this is fricos this is my perfume I have
been wearing for like 10 years and smell
so great
it's like gardenia and yeah kind of
chocolatey
what's yours it's an interesting scent
it's not like all of those bold flowery
they yeah for it you know you go in and
smell with everybody's for every other
bodies in Bray music and where could
people get that if they're this I've
only been able to get online through
Sephora and like maybe some of the other
online fragrance areas but like we live
in Champaign Illinois and our mall does
not carry this and I kind of like that
they don't you know that's the upside to
when you know about something that maybe
you don't have to purchase over and over
again aren't really really often yeah
what do you purchase these nobody else
knows I don't know yeah well this is my
last thing I'm going to show the things
I'm most tweezers from Sephora that
light up and when I heard about this I
think I read about it I was before or
something and I thought this is gonna be
you know this will change everything he
is so cute the way they package it is
like almost hard to figure out yeah you
like pull this up okay and it's holding
it there are these users okay and sorry
for Mike being the baby yeah it's like a
little button on here that you press and
it lights up and if you can't even see
that but yeah so like you've got
something that you want to see oh that
really lights up my face is there yeah I
could totally yeah this appears to be a
room that's lit yeah and what well
insanely bright and it really helps you
find what it is you need so is that
weird weird you're going to bring that
right up next to your I know I mean is
that my tracking I've never yeah it's
not like you're looking at a wearable a
that you're really focused on a mirror
probably that right it's not like your
say the eye doctor or their shine that
bright light yeah you can't see this is
just kind of so right now but you
thought it wouldn't you got it with the
expectation this would be kind of a life
changing better than I thought it would
be but one thing and I don't know if
this is true for all tweezers but it
seems like they're really sharp right
and then they're brand new and instead
of pulling out that here it's like they
almost like cut it off yeah I don't know
if I just need to use it more and
learning where down you know gummy or
something yeah yeah just brand new I you
know would try to pull something out and
it would just like snapped it off yeah
you know say those that follow up on
that yeah okay but I think this light is
supposed to last forever like salsa
maybe not forever but there's yeah tons
of life in it and there's also a little
mirror on the inside so yeah okay well
I'm going to grab what his pups cutest
cutest item she's ever baked and we will
be right hey guys we're back and we are
showing the cutest thing it is you can
see that it's a little log which is a
cake yeah okay this past Christmas I
made a Yule Log cake for the first time
which is basically a sponge cake with
frosting that's rolled up like a ho ho
yeah all right painted came it frosted
and kind of decorated to look like a log
and you put powdered sugar over the top
and that's no
this way to confess and I got this
recipe from Nigella Lawson and I
couldn't stop thinking about how good
this cake is it really tastes good and
the frosting is awesome and just wanted
to make it again for like no reason I
you know least a month we don't wanna
remember you a lot yeah I wanted to make
a dessert for poof and mom and dad and
Tyler and Jeff for Easter because
everybody's ever here okay yes and I
couldn't really think of a good Easter
dessert and I thought about nests and
logs one thing led to another and I come
up with I call it my Easter vlog Easter
laughter log I went to Walmart because I
had no other place to go I've got some
like little soap lily of the valley
flowers and some mystery blue flowers
some beautiful little gold finches in
the floral department along with some
fake eggs and I made a little nest with
shredded wheat like many weeks and
chocolate crunch together uh-huh like
melted chocolate that made like this
awesome amassed so cute yes I mean I
don't know how that's gonna ever get
eaten
I know I know what am I going to cut
into it but we're going to have to
because it's really I want the case yeah
it's one of those things where it's not
like it's so it's cute you know more on
the cute side than the tastes good side
it's equal on both both yes it's tasty
I'm really torn guys we're going to
