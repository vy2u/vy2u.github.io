this video this is my sister kelly also
known as you up to me and i've mentioned
her numerous times and videos and blogs
and stuff and we are together for easter
yeah i noticed that this is an Easter
edition yeah beauty brought addition to
work I got lives in my Easter basket so
we have at the end of this video
something very cute to show you it is it
has been classified as what the cutest
this is the cutest thing I've ever baked
so if you want to see that you'll have
to stay around till till en cute this is
insane whoo and for now um yes or today
pup and I went to a store called Annie
Meyer Meyer a lot of you probably have
these in your in your hometowns but I've
never been to one before and I found
that they had quite an amazing selection
of makeup show the man the vestal yes
that's my bed and I got um nothing too
exciting here some hair color I got some
clairol natural instincts in nutmeg it's
the dark brown shade had a few questions
about that that is sort of what color
this is but it's really new brand news
no well I've used this before and what
it really is not to confuse anyone but
this is the same color that my hair
really is that makes it a little thicker
feeling so have that I got there was a
bogo going on nothing confirmed on this
yet but a lot of people think Jane is oh
oh we have fun oh my cat bunny oh you
may injure the pictures bit of a camera
hog but um Jane the brand that's in a
lot of drug stores may be going away for
good i'm not sure but i do know that it
is going on sale right now at a lot of
different places so sometimes good
sometimes that
sign it's a very good Brandon and they
have something new out called agua suta
khals and it is it's supposed to be like
organic makeup you can tell it's our
data cuz it's beige because it's an
exact not silver but beige and I have a
tinted moisturizer here for medium warm
tones that i'll try and i have a blush
blush stick in a shivering peach shake
that i may i'll definitely test those
out and tell you what i think and maybe
i'll hopefully tell you about it before
the sales are all over and you can still
go out and get them um and just a couple
more things to mention here I got some
of these elf elements compacts I
actually got four of them and they hold
shadows of many different brands
actually they will hold max size shadows
they will hold Milani elf and of course
the Coastal Scents ones which I have
some there about that size and this is
magnetized and the shadows the shadows i
have from coastal scents are magnetized
as well so i'll be able to make for
these are only a dollar apiece and you
just stick them right in there and you
can make your own set of colors and they
got a great mirror they're really nice
will combat unbeautiful could be a
taller yeah and could be a good luck
gift thing you know you could fill these
up with some colors you think someone's
gonna like and we have two cats as our
honor that's right they're so cute and i
believe that is it oh one last thing
that i actually got on wrecked on pups
recommendation it's the Loreal
infallible a 16 wait what does it say is
it a 16 hour I'm not sure doesn't say on
this but it wrong it's the lip color
compact so basically what you've got is
the color which hat comes out with a
wand applicator you just unscrew that
put it on I have it on right now and
this shade is amethyst that I have and
then it has kind of a gloss sort of chap
sticky form that you put on over the top
and I have that on now and I like it and
I think the texture is interesting
because it actually mine has a little
bit of shimmer to it it's not like what
a black color which a lot of those some
of them are at it some of them have a
little metallic and this will lead into
pups favorites and an some not so
favorites yeah just something I could
share yes that the viewers might not
know about well yeah the infallible
let's see if we can do it like her I go
with 7 10 7 10 I like Jesus i would say
every day for as long as they've been
making it a couple of years and like
that you've made purchased and
repurchase oh yeah i mean to the point
where i don't even look at the name of
the color i just think 17 you know so
yeah it's really affordable like eight
or nine dollars last a long time and
stuff is a teacher I'm a teacher I'm
talking all the time and I can't be you
know every hour checking my lipstick and
so this I put on at six o'clock in the
morning and by three o'clock it's still
hanging in there I mean you're not
talking about snacking on nuts then and
it this is really great I recommend it
but I don't use the little chap sticky
thing the white part and I kind of opt
for some kind of lip gloss and I got
this a long time ago this little
Victoria Secret beauty rush slices
hasn't believed in what it is that like
a cake sent or oh let's see it kind of
cakey I guess cotton candy ish follow me
Wow yeah sweet very sweet very sweet and
that just kind of goes on and takes
whatever flat color is going on
just makes it shiny and yeah really just
looks like I mean you can't tell it's
that it's got that court sort of
sometimes cakey finish that some of
those long wearing things have so and
I've always got a kind of a strong lip
color and it's terrible when you're as
pale as me your lips are pale too and
your lipstick starts to wear off kinda
in the middle and then you're sort of
leverage outlining fan so this stays
where you want it to stay and I love it
um listen yes okay i went to know you or
something thank you there from the cats
in New York um to sephora last month
when I got this red velvet cake by
philosophy yes and I just like this
looks like about the kind of shade I
would wear in a lipstick it would be
nice gloss like that and red velvet cake
but that smells awesome because they're
scented products they may wanna you may
be familiar with the like shower gels
and / shampoos and conditioners that
come in the bought the big bottles and
there's like a zillion different yeah I
go for you for PS was all the time but
so I was like yeah little something for
pup I am I opened it up and while I love
the shape the scent it just really isn't
that the end of my idea red velvet cake
is different from other peoples but
that's just not as a chemical weed ya
know and that's too bad you get the
feeling maybe they were mixing and
mixing try and come up with the right
thing again yeah but the color you like
colors good color discreet yeah but you
know yeah that's a little bit of a punch
you know if you have like if lipstick is
kind of coming out on you you're gonna
amp it up for a few hours with this
that's my little stratagem this okay
moving on l revlon colors today the the
liquid liner yeah
is guys just so tiny how do you read
these know sometimes I don't open it I
think this is the shimmery shimmering
black like this is black the farewell
pardon and the handle is kind of
metallic and I don't notice any
difference it just looks black I have
both and they are very very similar
there's hardly any difference you can
tell but I love the quality of that
particular liner because you it really
is gonna budge it's not going to go that
way I'm kind of oily skin it doesn't do
a thing and what more could you ask and
that is this most of the Revlon
Colorstay products claim to last for 16
hours and it can be hard with face
makeup and blush to really determine
whether or not is still on but when you
look at that I line at the end of the
day it's still there you could pretty
much say for sure that it anymore yeah
so I too am a disciple of nice Blair hmm
and then I got a infallible a concealer
and I really pale skin and this is like
the lightest shade they make it pretty
much everyday foundation thing I get I
always have to go all the way over to
like the lightest part and yeah this
works it stays on forever it doesn't
disappear you know like some of the
other ones do and this is like probably
the first thing I put on my face in the
morning and it's never one of those
really long long wearing too long
wearing and this is like I've used it
down to the nub so can I stink for and
bought some again and um it's sort of
sold where you see this but hardly can
ever find this they're always selling
this and like every store is selling
like that we found in this morning yeah
and I I'm spazzed out ahead to get it
yeah
this is freakiest this is my perfume I
have been wearing for like ten years and
smell so great it's like gardenia and to
bruise and it just smells war yeah kind
of chocolatey maybe I just wish your
sweater it's an interesting set it's not
like all of those bold flowery they have
for it you know you go in and smell with
everybody's for every other bodies and
Bray music and where could people get
that if they're this I've only been able
to get online through sephora and like
maybe some of the other online fragrant
serious but like we live in champaign
illinois and our mall does not carry
this yeah I kind of like that they don't
be an only woman that I did it is you
know that's the upside to when you know
about some loan thing that maybe don't
have to purchase over and over again
aren't really really often yeah what do
you purchase these like nobody else
that's bad I don't know I told everybody
everything I tell all on this so yeah
yeah well this is my last thing i want
to show okay I'm those tweezers from
Sephora that light up and when I heard
about this I think I read about it
before or something and I thought this
is going to be if this will change
everything it is so cute the way they
package it is like almost hard to figure
out yeah you like pull this up okay and
is holding it in my arms and users okay
and sorry for my pain babe it's like a
little button on here that you press and
it lights up and I don't know if you
can't even see that but yeah they can
kind of see it yeah so like you got
something that you want to see oh that
really lights up my face there yeah I
could totally and it's appears to be a
room that flit yeah and what well but
it's insanely bright and it really helps
you find what it is you need to see
that weird weird you're going to bring
that right up next to your eye no I mean
is that an eye-tracking I've never yeah
it's not like you're looking at it we're
not like that you're really focused on a
mirror probably not right it's not like
you're a say the eye doctor they're
shining that bright light yeah you can't
see this is just kind of so right at
like you thought it when the youth you
got it with the expectation this would
be kind of a life-changing better than I
thought it would be but one thing and I
don't know if this is true for all
tweezers but it seems like they're
really sharp right when they're brand
new and instead of pulling out that here
it's like they almost like cut it off
yeah I don't know if I just need to use
it more and maybe the morning we're down
you know or get kind of gum your son
yeah just brand new I you know would try
to pull something out and it would just
like snapped it off yeah you know say
those that follow up on that yeah okay
but i think this light is supposed to
last forever in that's awesome maybe not
forever but you know there's yeah tons
of life in it and there's also a little
mirror on the inside so you have no
excuse no not you to stream here yeah
okay well I'm going to grab what is pups
cutest cutest item she's ever baked and
we will be right back eyes we're back
and we are showing the cutest thing it
is you can see that it's a little log
which is a cake yeah okay this past
Christmas I made a Yule Log cake for the
first time which is basically a sponge
cake with frosting bets rolled up like a
ho ho yeah all right painted kind of
frosted and kind of decorated to look
like a log you put powdered sugar over
the top and X know
very cute festive and I got this recipe
from Nigella Lawson and I couldn't stop
thinking about how good this cake is it
really tastes good and the frosting is
awesome and just wanted to make it again
for like no reason I you know least I
meant a month we don't want to make a
member you'll live oh yeah I wanted to
make a dessert for poof and mom and dad
and Tyler and Jeff for Easter cuz
everybody's over here for a big fun

of a good easter dessert and I thought
about nests and logs one thing led to
another and i come up with i call it my
easter log easter laughter log i went to
walmart because i had no other place to
go and I've got some like little soap
lily-of-the-valley flowers and some
mystery blue flowers really sure what
they are and some little life some
beautiful little gold finches in the
floral department along with some fake
eggs and I made a little nest with
shredded wheat like many weeks and
chocolate crunch together uh-huh like
melted chocolate that made like this
awesome little nest so cute yes I mean I
don't know how that's gonna ever get
eaten I know I know what am I gonna do

to cuz it's really I want the cake yeah
it's one of those things where it's not
like it's so it's cute you know more on
