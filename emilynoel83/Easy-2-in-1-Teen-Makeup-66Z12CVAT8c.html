me for this video I'm so excited to tell
you about what I did over the weekend
there was a teen seminar in my area and
I got to do a session on teen makeup and
it was super super fun I had my friend
Katie in and she allowed me to kind of
do a little demonstration on her showing
just you know minimal steps for getting
a look that you can just quickly pull
together and run out the door with it's
affordable it's quick it's easy I owned
it all on this handout that I gave my
people in my class and I thought
wouldn't it be nice to just have a video
that they can come back to and look at
and everybody that couldn't come to that
conference could check out and see so
I'm going to show you how to get a
natural look like this well it's just a
few steps that will instantly kick up
your look for a special occasion a dance
a date or whatever you want and remember
even if you're not a teen these steps
will be great for you to have an
affordable look that you can get with
very little effort so to see how it all
comes together keep on watching
so I'm starting out with a clean face
nothing on it at all and I'm gonna take
a tinted moisturizer like covergirl CG
smoothers this has an SPF 15 just for
reference my shade is light to medium
and this blends really easily into the
skin and the benefit of a tinted
moisturizer is that you're getting your
moisturizer step and some light coverage
all in one and so I just use my fingers
to smooth this all over my skin and I
noticed some kind of evening out of my
complexion but this never looks heavy so
this if you have been struggling with
you know of using foundations and
products like that there may be just too
heavy for your skin and you know you
just want something quick and light you
can slather this on very very quickly
now even with a product like a tinted
moisturizer you want to make sure you do
get that blended all the way up into
your hairline and all the way down you
know to your ear behind the jaw area
because it needs to still look blended
these do still have even though it's
light coverage there is still some color
going on your face so you need to be
aware of that next we want to go to our
concealer step I'm using Revlon
Photoready this is so quick and easy
because I can just draw it on where I
need it I've got some under eye areas
some redness around the nose just dot it
on and then you can use your finger to
blend it in the warmth of your finger is
going to help that melt into your skin
you know brushes are great but I don't
prefer to use a brush for this
particular step so just kind of go in
there and basically where your where
your tinted moisturizer didn't cover
your concealer will put on too creamy
products on our face so the next step I
would suggest is a powder that can kind
of help your staying power with
everything so I'm using the elf
translucent mattifying powder this is
really goof proof because there's just
one shade if you want to use the sponge
with it you can or I'm using a fluffy
brush and I'm really going to
concentrate this powder remember it says
mattifying powder so this is going to
help you
stay from getting too oily throughout
the day so I'm putting this on my
forehead really concentrating it on the
t-zone but I also want to set that
concealer that I put on so I'm
definitely going to get this under my
eyes as well as you can see this didn't
add a lot of color to my face but it did
add a little coverage in the sense that
it made my skin more matte and it makes
it look a little more flawless that way
bronzer and blush is a great way to perk
up the skin and make you look a little
more alive a little more awake one
bronzer that I think is a really great
option is from NYC it's called the
smooth skin bronzer in sunny and this is
a matte bronzer and it's very light so
if you don't want to go too overboard
you know this is a great option and use
a fluffy brush you're just going to get
a really light glow all over the face
again no shimmer so it's going to look
really natural and if you have darker
skin you may want to if you still want
to you know do some contours to your
face and stuff like that you can pick up
darker bronzers that are out there the
elf contouring blush and bronzer offers
a really nice option for a deeper
bronzer and light skin can even use that
just used a little lighter you'll notice
I'm going down a little bit on to my
neck and decollete area just so
everything looks even lush is a major
must-have and one that I love is this
one from Physicians Formula it's the
happy booster blush and this shade is
natural and it just gives you a great
rosy glow so I take a brush that's
technically a blush brush it's a little
smaller than the powder brush I was
using smile and we're looking for the
fleshy part of our cheek and just kind
of swirl that on there and then I like
to kind of dust a little bit upward that
way the bulk of the product is getting
here but it kind of you know you can
dust it upward to really enhance the
cheek area circular motions and sweep it
up or eyes if we want our eye makeup to
really last us through the school day or
you know whatever event we're doing I
recommend a primer
Palladio herbal eye shadow primer I feel
works just as good as the Urban Decay
primer potion or the two
shadow insurance I mean it really
smoothes on there has the very same feel
and the very same staying power really a
natural daytime shadow look you can get
away with just using two colors and
you'll have everything you need I'm
going to be using this wet and wild
palette in petal pusher and I'm going to
be using this shade that says brow bone
it's a real light shade and this shade
there's just a little bit deeper and it
says crease on it so with the brow bone
shade using a flat eyeshadow brush and
I'm just going to pick up some of that
product and just Pat that all over my
lid the flat eyeshadow brush is great
for getting the product only where you
want it and it really just keeps it
confined to the eyelid then I'm gonna
grab a larger fluffier brush that has
sort of that domed look to it I'm gonna
go right back to that brow bone shade
and actually this time use it on my brow
bone you don't have to follow all the
rules of this palette but it does give
you some ideas going right under the
eyebrow with that just for a little
highlight it kind of also evens out any
discoloration I had in that area and
then we're gonna use just a slightly
deeper shade just to enhance our crease
a little bit I'm gonna be using this
kind of purpley shade here again you can
go with neutrals you can go with greens
whatever colors you like to use but
what's a good way to apply a product
like this on yourself is to grab a
mirror like this look down into the
mirror now I can see my whole eye you
know I area and just kind of dust back
and forth for a really really natural
contour same thing on the other eye I'm
just looking down into my mirror I can
see exactly where my crease is without
having to you know blink one eye and
once you've kind of got going on there
on the crease then you can just kind of
look into whatever other mirror you're
using in this case I'm using my camera
and you can just kind of go back and
forth and those sort of windshield wiper
motions as they're often called for that
natural daytime look you don't need your
eyeliner to be too heavy or too out
there at all so I'm just going to do a
basic eyeliner with a pencil across the
upper lash line and then smudge it out
so this is very easy I'm using covergirl
perfect point plus
and I'm just gonna get that product
right on the inner part of my upper lash
line and I'm going very very close to my
eyelashes and this is a creamy enough
product that it's not that hard to to
get it on there and get it really really
close to the lash line it's not pulling
and tugging a whole lot and then I'm
just going to carry it out just a bit to
the outside and now some products do
come with a built-in smudger and if you
want the softest eye look possible I
recommend using that smudger and if your
eyeliner doesn't have that then just use
a q-tip and just kind of run over that
liner and it's gonna pick up some of it
some excess product that could cause
smudging throughout the day it's gonna
pick up that it's going to soften it up
a little bit and just make it a little
more wearable for daytime next up I'm
going to curl my eyelashes I like the
elf eyelash curler it's just a dollar
you can find it at Target or eyes lips
face comm that's where all these elf
products I've been talking about are
available a new mascara I'm trying out
is from Maybelline it's the volume
Express one by one so really claims to
accentuate each lash it's a rubber brush
mascara and I'm just kind of trying that
out and I do like it so far so I'm just
putting it on my lashes and then
wiggling it through from basically the
root to the tip if you need to do any
work to your eyebrows this pencil from
Maybelline it's called define a brow
works really well um I don't tend to do
too much filling in on my brows but if
you have any areas that maybe seem a
little uneven from the other side or are
a little sparse and you've over plucked
this is a nice one because it'd be it's
such a fine tip on this this product
that it actually looks kind of like
fibers of you know little strands of
hair actually so it's very very good for
filling in the brows to top off our
daytime look a tinted lip balm is a
great no fuss way to get some color on
your lips but keep them feeling
moisturize
and these are from Sally Beauty Supply
they're from a brand called Palladio
herbal tinted lip balms if you keep up
with my videos you know I've talked
about these before this particular shade
is called golden pink that I'm using and
you'll notice my lips get this great
Sheen and I just put it on like a lip
balm and now I feel a little more
polished and ready to go what if you
want to change that really natural look
up a little bit and do something
different whether it's a night out or a
special occasion or something like that
well first off you can change your hair
a little bit pop on a headband do
something different but my first tip
makeup wise is to do some more
contouring with your eye shadow so
you'll remember we use this palette and
we first use this shade on the lid and
as a highlight and we use this shade in
the crease now for something a little
more dramatic we're going to go over to
this shade right here it's another
crease color but as you can see it's a
it's kind of plummy it's shimmery and it
is a lot darker so I'm gonna take a
smaller brush brush like this kind of
commonly referred to as a pencil brush
and I'm gonna once again open up my
mirror so I can look down into the
mirror as if I were reading a book
and see my whole eye area there exposed
some of that product on my brush and I'm
going for the outer half of my crease
here and I'm just pulling that product
down a little bit and then from the
corner of my eye liner I'm going to go
slightly up so I'm going over with the
product on the outer part of the crease
and then up from the corner of my liner
and it's getting just a little deeper if
you compare it to the other eye you can
clearly see that this side is a little
more dramatic once you've done that step
you may want to take your fluffiest
brush that we first use just for that
light wash of color in the crease and
nothing on it just go over what you just
did and that's gonna blend it out and
make it really look seamless like
basically you know just kind of one
color just sort of transformed as
opposed to you know three separate
colors but that is one way to just make
your look slightly
more dramatic but still appropriate for
a team I just repeated that same step on
this I and my second tip for kicking it
up a notch is to do some sort of like a
little bit smokey liner on the bottom
and using shadow as your liner is a
great way to keep it soft not too harsh
and still get an effect that makes your
eyes pop so we're gonna use that same
shade that said crease there that we put
in our outer corner and I'm going to use
the same brush actually that I just used
and we're just going to utilize the tip
of this brush and use it to smudge under
our eyes so I'm going directly down here
I'll show you into the product like this
just getting a pop of that color on
there and then I'm going to once again
use my mirror and take this just under
my eye area kind of blending it with
that outer corner and you'll notice my
eye is gonna start to have more
definition here the brush really does
all the work for you you just start
where you want the most product which
would be the outside and then any
remaining product gets lighter and
lighter as you go toward the inside my
next tip is to give your face a glow by
using a highlight and you can use your
blush brush that we used before this is
another one of the happy booster
products from Physicians Formula you can
see all the hearts there well what we
use the first time was blush now we're
going to top it off with a highlight and
I'm just gonna pick up some of that
product and go kind of right over my
cheekbones and what this basically does
and you can kind of dust this all over
the face because it's not it doesn't
have glitter in it but it just has kind
of a nice pearl effect and it gives your
face a nice nice glow you don't want to
use too much because we don't want to
look oily but it's gonna give your face
a really nice little pop remember that
what we first put on our lips was a
tinted lip balm great for a natural look
moist arises the lips you feel hydrated
and all that but if you want to amp it
up a little bit for night go with a
gloss over the top a really affordable
one that I love so much is from the
brand called Jordana you'll find it at
Walgreens and this shade is called
lovely it's kind of a neutral with a
little bit of shimmer and you can just
apply this all over your lips for a
great glossy look and that shimmer
it's going to make your lips look even a
little bit fuller and it just brightens
up the face so there you go guys just a
few quick easy steps to take your look
from a daytime school look to a
nighttime look for an event a date or
whatever you want so thank you guys so
much for taking the time to watch this
video I hope this sort of helps you
navigate through a routine that will be
easy for you to complete in the morning
