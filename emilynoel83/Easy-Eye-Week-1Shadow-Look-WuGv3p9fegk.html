wick long series I feel like Oprah here
this is going to be so much fun um basic
eye looks every day of the week we're
gonna build on it every day so day one
is a one shadow look they two two shadow
look any guesses for day three it's a
5:00 shadow about just kidding free
shadow look we're gonna do a for shadow
look on the fourth day on the last day
maybe something a little different
little more glamorous I was kind of
hesitant at first when I was thinking of
this video topic because I'm thinking
like am I really going to devote a full
week to all of these tutorials and then
I thought I want to stay true to the
idea of what I've wanted to do with my
channel from the start do videos that
you yourself would like to watch and I'm
down for a good every day I look anytime
about my high school self she really
needed these past these videos along
share these with people in your life who
are maybe just starting out with makeup
it's going to be ideal for makeup
beginners for anyone who needs quick
go-to looks busy people people who got
to go get stuff done in the world
easy eye looks that will make you look
finished and complete and just give you
some go-to kind of templates for your
everyday eye shadow wearing life in
other words you don't have to have the
exact shades I'm using you won't need
everything to be identical but you can
look in your own collection and say okay
I need something in about this shade
range or you know a couple of shades
look somewhat roughly like this and I
can execute the very same look because
you can this is makeup this is not
rocket science this is just about some
easy everyday techniques so today's
topic is all about the shadow single and
I have done some videos in the past I'll
link to them below where I've talked
about one shadow looks and the best
kinds of shades that really do justice
to the one shadow look and how do you
use that one shadow for the ultimate
simplicity and application but kind of
make it look like more make it do more
for you that is the tutorial in this
video but I want you to keep in mind
it's all about versatility this can be
dressed up very easily you know you
could not wear false lashes you could
put on false lashes you could make it
really smoky it looks great with a nude
lip it looks great with a berry lip
it looks on fire with the red lip it is
an absolute can't miss look so if you
want to see how to do it here you go
okay
step one in a vital step for any of
these tutorials will be to start with an
eyeshadow primer and a really great one
from the drugstore that I love and
really just my favorite all around no
matter the price range is the Milani
eyeshadow primer so you can just squeeze
I don't know smaller than a pea-sized
amount out here and a lot of times I'll
use my finger but I kind of started
enjoying using this little precision
tapered brush from Sigma and I just kind
of like how that hits the crease area
very easily it's a little more gentle
than my finger is sometimes and then
kind of pull upwards cover not only the
lid but the crease brow bone and repeat
over here very easy dab over it with
your fingers just to remove any excess
product you want enough primer but not
too much or the remainder of the look
it's just going to be one shadow and I
am using this shade from Milani called
Bella charcoal and it's a little bit on
the deep end of what I would use for
this kind of video normally I go for a
really solid like mid-tone shade a
little bit of Sheen something that's
going to look one way when it catches
the light in a different way when it's
in a shadowed area like your crease this
is just a little bit darker but it still
has enough Sheen to completely pull off
the technique so don't discount a shade
that you glanced at you think oh that's
too dark for one shadow look this is
actually perfect two essential brushes
for this look would be a flat brush to
apply it to the lid I'm using my Sonia
Kashuk medium shadow brush something to
apply it to the crease and for that I'm
using my Sigma e25 and then something
you might want to have handy is just a
bear brush this is my Sigma e-40
anything fluffy that you want to use to
kind of buff out the edges you may or
may not need that but it's nice to have
so starting out I'm going to pick up
some of the shadow with my flat brush
tap off a little bit of the excess just
so I'm not overwhelmed by product on the
sometimes you get too much on there all
at once and it just kind of flies off
the lid so I am all about the slow build
of the eyeshadow I think I've trained
myself to be that way because I'm one
who likes to do all of my face makeup
first so you kind of learn how to
minimize fallout so as you can see here
I'm just patting that shade all over my
lid and also a little bit of the shadow
from the tip of the brush kind of wedges
itself right up there into the crease so
that's your very simple indication that
you're at your stopping point because
you just want to apply this shade all
over your lid space and then you know
once you're reaching that crease stop I
can already see how the shadow that is
catching the light right here on the lid
looks a little bit different from what's
happening in the crease where it's a bit
more shadowed
but we're going to accentuate that idea
even more here with the e25 brush I'm
going to dip into this product tap off
the excess and take this right into the
crease consider the placement of your
mirror and don't so much have it right
in front of your face but down a little
bit so you are looking down you're not
having to really do the one eye winky
thing I've never really been great at
that but you can look down and you can
expose the lid space up through the
crease and really see everything that
you're working with I'm not really doing
anything fancy with the shape here not
that you couldn't but I'm just kind of
going from the outermost part of my
crease to the innermost part of my
crease
and the same drill on the other side we
all have differing amounts of space
between let's say our crease and our
eyebrows so work the shadow up as far as
you feel comfortable now that step is
complete I do think I will go in with my
bare brush and just run it over the
edges right up here and make sure it's
absolutely as smooth looking as possible
and it doesn't take a lot of time you
know it doesn't take a lot of effort
it's just one more brush to grab and
that my friends is your simple classic
one shadow look and it might give off
the effect that may be more than one
Shadow has been used because a things
look blended be it looks like something
a little
it bright might be happening on top of
the lid and see it looks like something
dark is happening in the crease hikes I
just like head-butted my coffee mugs
Eric ouch I'm going to add a few
elements to this look just to make it
like what I perceive as an everyday look
something you'd wear to work whatever
just make it basic and easy so one more
thing I might do on the lower lash line
I like to apply something kind of
brightening to that lower inner rim so I
am using Milani shadow eyes in the shade
almond cream there are multiple liners
on the market that can give this effect
but basically you're taking away the
look of tiredness and then for the
absolute softest definition on the lower
lash line I'm going to go to guess what
Bella charcoal here from Milani are one
shadow and a pencil brush and I'm just
going to apply a little bit of that
right down here on the outer part of the
lower lash line no big deal
honestly barely looks like anything has
been done there but it does give a
little framework to the eye
then I might typically do a little bit
of liner across the upper lash line this
is my Physicians Formula eye booster pin
it's the black one I think it's very
easy to use because it has a brush tip
but you can hold it just like a pen or
pencil you could wing this out and make
it so dramatic but I'm just going to
stick to my lash line here just to show
you what I think the most basic take on
this look could be
let's do some mascara first off I'm
going to curl my lashes then I'm
currently working through this lights
camera lashes sample from Tarte so
that's the mascara I'm choosing to apply
but you go with what works for you
all around the covergirl super sizer
mascara is my ultimate mascara jam so I
would totally recommend that especially
if you've got lashes that struggle to
hold a curl struggle to have length
struggle to have volume lashes that just
struggle
do a little lower lash mascara the
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
is a good one to put there and just
because you can count on it stays all
day doesn't flake off so thank you guys
so much for watching this tutorial I
hope it was helpful for you if it seemed
easy it should be easy this is the most
basic look in my little series but I
think we need go to looks like this we
need something where yeah I might not
wear my shadow that way every day but
I've got the go-to in my head I've got
that I makeup idea that I can pull out
of my bag of tricks it can work for
multiple mid-tones slightly shimmery
shadows and I think it will change your
life especially when you're in a hurry
join me for the next video it's going to
be on shadow duels bye guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
