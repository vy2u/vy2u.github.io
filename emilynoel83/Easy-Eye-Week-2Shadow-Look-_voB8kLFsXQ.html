brightening because I do think as far as
all of the looks this week this will be
the one that really caters to
brightening and waking up the eyes and
it's very natural look very simple and
we're using a shadow duo and I do think
duo's can be more versatile than you
think I will be using something I've
called over the years the sandwich
method to apply these shadows it's such
a no-brainer technique and I think it
really works best when you've got a duo
where there is a light shade and then a
medium to deep shade I think if you want
to keep it most natural and most
brightening make sure that that a second
shade that you're using that's a little
bit darker is more of like a medium
color
I think the lightness that's both on the
lid and under the brow really helps to
wake up the face so if that's something
you need keep on watching so for
starters today we're going to use a
little Milani eyeshadow primer I'm just
going to squeeze a little bit out on my
hand I'll pick it up with this precision
tapered brush from Sigma and just kind
of take that across my lids paying
special attention to get it into the
crease as well
next up we're going to be using this duo
from Maybelline it's called dusk and it
has kind of satiny finish very light
pink shade and then a taupe in here as
well that also has just a little bit of
shimmer neither of these shades are
super frosty but I do notice just the
slightest bit of Sheen there and as far
as this duo goes I have seen this in
person in stores I'm not finding a lot
of retailers that are selling it online
so hopefully it's not on the way out but
these are fairly common colors so
hopefully this is not too hard to
recreate but I'm using what I like to
call the sandwich method I did a video
on this method a couple years ago and
basically it's making use of duos by
sandwiching the dark shade on your eye
in between the light shade so we're
using this light shade in two different
ways both on the lid and as a highlight
under the brow and this goes in the
crease very simple so I'm going to begin
by picking up this light shade just use
any flat shadow brush you like to use I
kind of alternate between the Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush in the medium
shadow brush but something I like about
these kind of light pinky shades is I
find them to be very very brightening I
think this will be the look from the
week that really caters to tired eyes
because having this light shade on the
lid just really does a lot for you I'm
taking it a little bit around the inner
corner too you may not instantly think
of you know these Maybelline shadows
that have been around for a long time as
being super pigmented or great to work
with but I do find this particular do oh
I mean it works just fine there's no
problem with this and you don't just
have to have a duo you know to pull off
this method if you see a couple shades
like this within a larger palette you
know go for it try this sandwich method
it's very very easy so I'm going to take
my Sigma e25 brush and I'm just going to
work this taupe shade right into the
crease and as is the case with most
crease situations you know you can make
this as dramatic as you want it to be
you can build up the shadow and actually
make it look kind of dark you can also
you know change the shape you could
really pull it outward more if you
wanted to but seeing as we're kind of
sticking to some every
day I loves today I'm just going to stay
with the actual shape of my crease as it
naturally is here and repeat on the
other side I like these shadows because
they're pigmented enough but they don't
overwhelm you and I think they're a nice
kind of beginner texture to work with
because you can see where you're putting
them you know they show up on the eyes
particularly with that primer on there
first that allows them to cling and
standout but they don't just go crazy on
the eye area they're not crazy with fall
out they're not you know just super bold
so I think it's just an appropriate quad
for a lot of people and buy quad I mean
do oh it's early next up I'm just going
to take a bear brush and blend over my
edges I think they were pretty soft to
begin with but I just kind of get in the
habit of having that brush around so I
can go over the edge of my eye look and
then with that same brush I will go into
the lighter shade and this is where we
sandwich we sandwich the darker shade in
the middle so this shade makes a really
great highlight and also a great lid
shade so make use of it in two ways very
easy now I'm really going to focus on
keeping this I look as wide awake as
possible so I'm not going to do anything
additional with the shadow but if you
wanted to I do think this shade makes a
nice kind of smudged under the lower
lash line type of effect but I am going
to use my Milani shadow eyes and almond
cream I'm just going to take that in my
lower inner rim
then I'm going to curl my lashes today
I'm choosing to skip the eyeliner just
kind of want to show you what it looks
like if you don't do that because I
think it can allow the lashes to stand
out even more and I'm going to use my
covergirl super sizer mascara
and I generally like at least a little
bit of lower lash mascara just to
balance things out doesn't have to be
heavy so this is really my easiest
freshest most natural take on this
method using eyeshadow duos and I think
it's great just as is but I do want to
let you know you know a few of those
options ways you can step it up and not
just using your duos one would be adding
a little more depth and building up the
shadow in the outer corner building that
up to more of an outer V that's very
easy to do also you can smudge your
darker shade down below the aisle free
to add liner on top of this look and
here's what it looks like with a set of
false lashes on if when you're using
something this neutral I love popping a
bright lip on with it because I know the
eye really does not interfere with this
lip at all and it could just be loud and
proud and it's a great kind of easy way
to pull your look together it takes no
time at all to pop on a bright lip thank
you guys so much for watching I'm
excited to share part three in this
series with you tomorrow which will be
on trios I'll see you later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
