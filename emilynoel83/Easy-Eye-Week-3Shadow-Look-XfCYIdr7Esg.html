trio or the three shadow look and today
I decided to go with something that was
very warm and I wanted to show you my
whole goal with this video was how to
get the greatest impact out of a shadow
trio just using three shades and really
making the most of it I truly think this
is a shadow formula or shadow template
that you can plug into a lot of the
trios that you might already have and
just really make the most of your look
and make your eyes pop and I want to
thank you guys so much for the really
kind feedback on this series I'm so glad
you're enjoying it sometimes I do feel
like YouTube is very heavy on these
super intricate eye looks and we forget
how important and how essential these
building block type eye looks can be so
I'm glad you're liking it and here's how
to do this look first things first they
can't misstep regardless of what I look
you're doing Milani eyeshadow primer
squeeze a little bit out then just brush
it all over the lids into the crease and
beyond
and for today's look we're going to be
using this simple trio so a lot of times
I shadow is sold in a trio and it really
can create the full look in a lot of
cases because usually not always but
usually you're getting a light medium
and dark shade and I don't want you to
limit yourselves and think the only way
you can use a trio is by this sort of
formula that I'm going to be showing you
in this video but what I want to do
today is show you how to use this trio
for the maximum impact the way to take
the few colors you're given and really
work with them together so everything is
popping a little bit more on the eye and
I don't know if I've said yet this is
from it cosmetics
it's the luxe high-performance hydrating
shadow trio in pretty in amber and I
don't hear a lot of people talking about
these trios but they are fantastic
they have kind of a satiny finish to the
shadows not super shimmery but there is
a little sheen there but I just wanted
to go with something really warm and
just smoldering today on the eyes
because I went with very cool looks for
my first two days this week but in a
nutshell what's going to make this look
work and create a lot of impact is using
our lightest shade and our darkest shade
kind of like side by side using them
very closely a lot of this on the inner
part of the lid fading into this using
the darker shade in our crease and then
using this medium shade more as a
blended out smudge it out type color so
here's what I'm talking about gonna take
my small shadow brush from Sonia Kashuk
dip it into this light color here and
I'm just going to start out by patting
this on about the inner half of my lid
and I'm going to take it right around
the tear duct as well for a little
brightness
step one is done then I'm going to wipe
my brush off and I'm going to go into
this kind of deep reddish coppery rust
type color and this I'm going to use
right beside the lighter shade but I'm
putting it on the outer part of the lid
and something good to keep in mind with
your brushes and your shadow placement
the first place that you put down your
brush is where the most color goes it's
very common sense but I think we forget
that sometimes and then we wonder you
know why is this looking blotchy why is
this not looking seamless and I would
want the darkest part of this look to be
like right here at the outer corner so
that's the first place I'm going to put
my brush with the shadow and then start
to move it inward and overlap and that's
how the blending I think really starts
to take shape there I'm going to get a
little more shadow on my brush I'm going
to flip the brush around and apply it up
here to the crease and what's happening
here is I'm getting a very controlled
application sometimes if you're just
starting out with eyeshadow you feel
like it's just flying everywhere it's
going places you didn't want it to be
when you're using a small brush you can
control it you can put it exactly where
it should go so at first I was patting
it on my lid like this then I took the
brush and turned it around wedged it and
just kind of pull upward a little bit
and I'm putting it in the crease and
just pulling upward I'm going to repeat
this on the other eye again place the
shadow first where you want the most
darkness so for me that's going to be
the outer part of the lid and then start
just blotting it inward you'll notice I
do a lot of padding when I'm putting
shadows on the lid because that really
creates the most impact with the shadows
if you're rubbing back and forth back
and forth chances are you're probably
just dusting a lot of product away then
I've added a little shadow to the brush
flipping it so it's kind of wedged right
there in the crease and just gently pull
upward and there's your shadow
application to the crease
you'll notice that kind of lesson it as
I get in where you can do as much or as
little crease stuff on the inner part of
the eye here as you want now that you've
done that step I think it's a good time
to look at your lighter shade and say
okay could I make that look a little
more blended by taking some of the white
and working it back over in this
direction so the shadows we want them to
combine so this is how blending works
you don't have to feel like oh just
because that was that was step two I
can't go back to step one yes you can if
you if it looks like something else
needs to be done go for it and then I'm
just going to take my bare blending
brush nothing on this just going over
the edges to get them as soft as
possible and I gotta say this is a
little bit more pricey trio uhm as
opposed to a lot of drugstore trios and
I'm sure you could come up with similar
shades in another brand but these do
blend really really nicely next thing I
want to do is work in this kind of
golden color right here and I'm using a
brush from ELF that's called the crease
brush and it's kind of a small crease
brush I mean if I hold it up here next
to my Sigma e-40 you can see it's a
little less fat compared to that and the
bristles aren't super dense so I really
love this as a brush to apply what a lot
of people talk about as being a
transition color something where you're
kind of transitioning from your darkest
shade up into your highlight under the
brow let's say so I'm applying a little
bit of that golden e shade right up
there and this brush can do a really
good job of keeping it sheer it's kind
of a lower-cost alternative to the Sigma
e30 six brush which is that little white
wispy brush that I use a lot and I'm
just going over here on the other side
and I'm using a really light hand I am
barely applying pressure to my eye
whatsoever we're just going over the
border very easy then I'll clean that
brush off here real quick and I'm going
to go into this pearly shade which will
become our highlight under the brow
something nice and light keep things
from getting too muddy getting too close
there to the brow I like to really focus
a highlight mainly under the
highest point in the brow but just
generally speaking it can be a nice
finishing touch and you can use that
shadow to almost blend the border of the
last shade that you put on and then to
finish off this upper lash line I'm
going to apply a liner this is a stomper
from colour-pop and it's a really dark
brown
I really do enjoy these color pop
pencils I feel like they go on very
easily they feel like just gel pencils
and they come in a ton of different
colors this is probably like the least
fun color that comes in but I just want
something basic for this look
all right so we've achieved this soft
warm upper eye area but I want to show
you how to take your lower lash line and
really just make it smoldering with this
liner so we're I'm going to put this is
the inner rim the lower inner rim here
I'm using dark brown because it can be a
little less harsh compared to black but
I've been known to use black quite often
here also and once you put it on that
inner rim take a little bit and put it
just on the skin on the outer part of
your lower lash line there this is
what's going to allow this darkness to
not look just like one dark line there
but to actually blend and you can just
blend over it with your finger a bit see
the difference now between this eye and
this eye yeah this one's coming for you
so repeat right over here and then just
a little bit right there I am feel like
I'm going right in between eyelashes
here that's how close you want to be to
your inner rim then as far as your
shadows go that's what's going to keep
this looking super duper soft and if you
want it to look more natural not quite
so intense you could skip the pencil
liner altogether on there on the lower
lash line and just do the shadow step
I'm going to show you so I'm going to
use the darkest shade with a pencil
brush and get right in there on the
outer part
and then let's take this golden shade
like I said use this middle color for
smudging and smoking out so we're going
to take this all along the lower lash
line
next I'm just going to take my eyelash
curler here and curl my lashes I'll do a
little bit of mascara with my favorite
covergirl super sizer
always get some mascara on my eye look
it seems like
so I really love the way this I look
turned out I love the amount of
brightness we're getting from that light
shade but because we put it beside
something that's so much darker than
that even though it's not a super deep
and dark shade the contrast is really
happening here from the crease to the
lid really nice and warm just above the
crease all the brightness we could want
under the brow and nice and smudgy and
smoky on the lower lash line but truly
this is the kind of shadow formula you
could plug in with almost anything this
is the covergirl shimmering sands trio
I've had shimmering sands for ages and
these shades don't really look like one
really pops from the next you know but
this same kind of shadow placement
whether you've got three distinctly
different shades or three shades that
are all very very monochromatic like
this it can still work and as far as
ways to really do this I look up
different I do kind of feel like we went
for the max with what this trio can do
but I will show you you know what it
looks like if you wanted to pop on a
pair of false lashes these are the Salon
perfect demi whispies a very common
accessible pair of false lashes that
will give you a little added lift to
your eyes because they are flared out at
the ends now with this sort of warm eye
look I think it's a great way to get use
out of some of your more neutral blushes
and neutral or nude lip colors so on my
lips today I'm wearing the elf matte lip
color in praline and my blush is this
covergirl blush and soft make and if I
don't always mention it in these videos
I will have all the products I'm wearing
