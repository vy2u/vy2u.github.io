for yet another part in this easy.i week
series and this is for those of you who
are looking for the Vavoom I the
x-factor the added thing that is just
going to give you those come and get me
eyes you know what I'm saying alright
we're going to be working on the outer V
today that is I think kind of a tricky
aspect of eye makeup trying to shape
your eyeshadow in such a way that you
look lifted but yet everything still
looks blended out and like you were just
made that way and we're going to be
doing it all with just a $1 quad so
that's pretty awesome too so here's how
to get the look all right guys first
step for this look I'm always a little
hoarse when I start out here with these
tutorials because you guys are literally
the first people I am talking to and I
start my day everyone else is asleep
when I get up to do this but a little
Milani eyeshadow primer here going to
pick that up with this Sigma tapered
brush and just swipe it on
shadow quad were using is called lux
it's by elf and it is only one dollar
and the funny thing about these
eyeshadow quads is like you might think
okay we're working in more shadows this
is going to get more advanced or
whatever but not necessarily because
sometimes I feel like with eyeshadow
quads everything is a little more
clear-cut for a basic look every shade
has its purpose not that you couldn't go
outside of that and do your own thing
with it but you know it's there's less
multitasking involved as there might be
with a single a duo or even a trio so
I'm going to dip into this lightest
shake first I'm using my Sonia Kashuk
medium shadow brush and I'm just taking
this right around the innermost part so
kind of surrounding the tear duct and
this is just kind of a creamy matte
color then I'm going to use this kind of
brownish shade it's got a little bit of
Sheen to it kind of a brownish
taupey color and I'm going to Pat that
all over my lid with the same brush
be sure to stick to that patting motion
with your shadows though sweeping back
and forth really won't result in the
maximum color payoff where you want it
anyway you might get more on your cheek
that way next up we're going to go to
this darkest brown shade and for that I
want to deepen my outer corner and I
also want to show you how to form that
outer V which I often reference in
videos but I don't always really show
how to get it so I'm going to dab into
this with my small shadow brush so we're
downsizing the brush a little bit not
only because we're applying it over a
smaller area but I want the color to be
more concentrated so just tapping it
right here on the outer corner first on
the lid
now for the crease I want to bring in a
more precise crease brush I feel like in
the last couple of videos we've worked
in a brush that's about this size for
the crease the Sigma e25 which I still
think is very usable very handy but an
even smaller crease brush like this this
is from makeup revolution it's called
the 315 I got mine from CVS and it's a
really nice small size for placing
shadow exactly where you want it
sometimes the only obstacle standing in
your way
of an eye look that looks defined and
not muddy can be using a brush that's
too big for your eyes so whether you're
a beginner whether you've just got small
eyes I do think this is a really great
brush to have dabbing into that darkest
shade here tapping off a little excess I
am placing my brush first where I want
the most product to go so that's the
outer corner and we're just going to
start kind of going inward first
bringing a little bit of that shadow
into the crease area and then we're
pulling outward and when I'm thinking
about the shape of an outer vite when
I'm pulling the shadow upward in that
manner I'm thinking about where is the
end of my eyebrow and kind of keeping
those two things in line you drop it too
far down you're going to get kind of a
droopy look to the eye we want to create
the look of lift so we're going to point
it up toward the tip of our eyebrow this
is a trick I see a lot of times when I'm
watching the news whether I'm watching
today's show or you name it I can see
that this is a technique with eyeshadow
that kind of fools the eye because you
just quickly glance at that person and
you're like oh their eyes look nice and
wide awake and lifted but their eyes
shadow has been applied in such a way
that it it really changes the shape of
the eye I'm going to do the same thing
on the other eye and with this quad very
important to tap off the excess because
it can generate some fallout but just
start working it in that outer corner
I'm bringing it inward a bit so I can
have a little bit of lightened crease
color right in this zone and then it's
just a matter
you know placing your brush drawing in
basically exactly that little pointed
out shape that you want for the outer
part of your eyeshadow your there's no
guesswork here is where your brush goes
is where the product goes with larger
brushes I think there can be a little
guesswork now we want to bring in our
Bayer blending brush so we can go over
those edges make sure everything is nice
and smooth I'm not really getting into
the crease and blending over I'm
blending over the border because I don't
want to muddy up the look too much
I just want to blend and soften the
edges of it
next up you guys know I'm not skipping
over this red shade right I'm taking my
ELF crease brush I use this the other
day as kind of a transition color type
of brush I'm going to do the same thing
right now I'm looking for the border
even though it's nice and soft right now
I'm looking for kind of an edge to that
dark kind of grayish brown shade and I'm
going to go right on top of that edge
with this pretty warm kind of berry
cranberry looking color a couple of
things to keep in mind when you're doing
this I have very little product on my
brush number one and number two I'm
barely touching my skin keep it that way
and you will get soft application I
think lid is where you tend to want to
pack it on a little bit more you may
want a little bit more of a standout
application for these transition type
colors here's where you want to keep it
soft keep a light hand then I'm going to
wipe off that brush and I'm going to do
my highlight with this kind of buttery
shade right here pick that up right
under the brow I haven't left myself a
lot of space for this but that's okay
it's a little bit more dramatic look and
I know I've said this before but just a
little reminder it's okay to go back to
other steps of your look as you see
people do tutorials myself included I'm
sure we're all kind of thinking like we
want to make it a step-by-step as
possible and make it clear cut and very
easy to follow but like for example here
I'm looking at what I've done because
I've got a lot of darkness kind of
blended up in here I do want to go back
to this light shade now and kind of
reinforce that almost pull it up a
little bit more onto my lid for a little
more contrast there so let's take a look
at the eye shadow look and think about
how do I like how it's coming along what
would I change about it and go for it I
do want to show you how to pull
everything together on the lower lash
line here so I'm going to pull in a
smudge brush I think earlier in the week
I had shown let's see some lower lash
line happening with a pencil brush so I
think it's nice to have two different
brushes to use in this area one's going
to give you a more softened diffused
look one's going to really
place the shadow exactly where you want
it so first off that is what I want with
this darkened shade I want it to really
kind of connect back to what's happening
here with this outer V so I'm going to
put it right on the outer corner
and then for a little softness I'm going
to use this more medium shade you could
use I guess the red or this lightest
Brown for this type of a step and just
take that under the rest of the lower
lash line
and then I will choose to go bright on
my inner rim here so I'm using my Milani
shadow eyes and almond cream which I
think we pulled in earlier in the week
and I just kind of widen out the whites
of my I here this would also be really
pretty if you went dark in the inner rim
and really smudged it below the eye for
a very dramatic look and for me the
finishing touches of this look I'm going
to use my Physicians Formula eye booster
liquid liner pen which I would totally
recommend if you are new to liquid liner
because it's actually a brush tip not a
felt tip so I think it has even more
flexibility and I think that's ideal
when you're trying to get used to going
across your lash line and get really
close to the lashes this definitely
allows you to do that and a lot of times
when I've got my shadow shaped in this
manner I do like to do a bit of a winged
liner because it really follows the
shape and it just I don't know it
creates a nice harmonious look here with
the outer part of the eye so for that I
think about you know this last quarter
of my of my eye if we were dividing it
up into fourths
this last part of it I start to kind of
take off in an upward direction pointing
to the outer part of my eyebrow or the
outer part of where my shadows shaped
too and then I go to the absolute outer
corner of my eye and I connect up to
that and so I've got a small triangle
there that it's just a matter of filling
in
and then if you feel like it you can
take a little bit more of your darkest
shadow and smudge it down just below the
wing that's a trick I often use just to
make everything look a little more
seamless on the outer part of the eye
next I'm just curling my lashes going to
apply some mascara this is Tarte lights
camera lashes but use whatever you
prefer
and a bit of lower lash mascara as well
with my covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant
and not that you'd have to but I'm just
itching to pop on a pair of false lashes
with this look these are the red cherry
number 43 so without you know the look
still has plenty of definition plenty of
lift but I just think this adds kind of
that fun flirty absolutely wide open pop
to the eye so the finished look I am so
happy with it I really love the way this
quad comes together with this kind of
grouping of shades I think they work
really nicely you might look at a quad
and say I just want to use half of that
I just want to use the sandwich method
with those two colors and that's totally
doable as well the overall takeaway on
this I think is that quads can be a
little more clear-cut and easy to use on
the eyes than you might think because I
do feel like each shade is more likely
to have a purpose whereas more
multitasking tends to be necessary if
you were to just use a single or a duo I
think there's just a little more
strategy involved with those and here
it's like okay there's my outer corner
there's my lid there's my highlight
there's my transition and it can just
sometimes at a glance be a little bit
more easily identifiable and so if
you're looking for a good quad that's
going to be well rounded for you or stop
you yourself know whether you prefer
more matte or more shimmer as far as
this quad goes like this
lightest shade was totally met the
others have like a hint of shimmer but
they come off kind of matte on the eyes
but in terms of color scheme I think a
nicely balanced quad that can give you
this kind of look will have one dark
shade a couple of medium shades and a
light color that's light enough to work
as a highlight keep your eye out for
that kind of a pattern in a quad and it
can totally be plugged into this
eyeshadow look as far as the rest of my
face just a couple of things that I
wanted to mention I used my benefit
Dallas blush which is kind of a dusty
neutral soft plum II blush I always like
fall in love with this all over again
when I pull it out because I don't use
that often enough and then for the glow
on top of my cheeks I'm using this Laura
Geller filter finish setting powder in
universal so it's got all those
different colors and it's really really
brightening and then for my lips I was
kind of having one of those days where I
didn't know when to quit so I use this
ombre lip in ginger and nutmeg I used
mostly this lighter side which is kind
of
nude and a little bit of the darker on
the outer corners and then I decided I
wanted some shine because my lips were
looking a little dry so I put on this
butter gloss in creme brulee over the
top so thank you guys so so much for
taking time out of your days to watch
this series I will see you in the fifth
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
