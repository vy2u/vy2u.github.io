this is the last video in this easy.i
week series I I can't thank you enough
for the amazingly supportive sweet
feedback on these videos obviously I put
out videos and I hope people like them
but I had no idea that this group of
videos would be received the way it was
and it seems like from what some of you
have told me it's exactly what you were
needing at this time and it just it
makes me feel so good when I see
comments like that where someone's then
you know I was just hoping for something
like this it's been a really fun week
and to just kind of top off this series
I really feel like with the foreshadow
looked it was kind of a dramatic look it
really incorporated some elements of eye
makeup that I think are a little bit
more toward the advanced side you know a
little bit more challenging things and
so I thought where can I go from there
for the last video and it just seemed
natural to try to take some of your
questions and cover those odds and ends
of eye makeup that maybe I didn't talk
about in any of these other videos so
thank you so much I asked for your
questions on Twitter and Facebook and to
sort of illustrate my answers to some of
these questions I will have a little
demo that I'll cut to a couple times
throughout the video to show you about
this look and I had posted my call for
questions before day 4 video went up so
I saw a lot of people asking about the
outer V and that is definitely covered
in detail in the day 4 video Kristin
says my eye shadow always ends up
looking muddy or even like a 3d you know
black guy I know it sounds weird but
it's true
maybe I'm over blending I do think you
might be doing that and when you're
thinking about blending a chances are
you might be you know just going over
your entire eye look let's say you just
applied something to your crease and
that's the area that you want to be
blended but then when you pull in your
big old blending brush you're going over
the whole eye look and you don't really
need to do that I would really try to
focus the brush just on the edge of what
you want to blend out so if I just apply
to crease shade I will keep that crease
brush right
on the edge without bringing it in on
top of what's on the lid or what's in my
outer corner
Melinda read says I'm a beauty advisor
over a Smashbox counter and have clients
who asked a lot and how to figure out
what colors to put together in a palette
I explained the best I can but I can
tell they still don't understand how
would you go about explaining and
breaking this down for them I think it's
really all about being able to identify
where are the dark medium and light
shades if you think back to some of the
videos I've done whether it be you know
using a duo and using a sandwich method
or a trio or even a quad you know it
really comes down to having maybe a
mid-tone shade or a dark shade or a
light shade that you can call on this is
an example I'm holding up the new
Smashbox matte palette here and I do
think sometimes palettes are very
strategically laid out in a certain way
to help you understand how to use them
here I see two distinct like kind of
color families to work in one on this
side one on the other
not every palettes that way but it's
always something to look for like is is
there perhaps a pairing that is laid out
right in front of my face and if I don't
cover this in depth enough right now I
do think this is going to be a future
video all about palettes and something I
would refer to as training palettes
palettes that do a really good job of
laying out color combos for those who
have a little trouble figuring it out
but looking for the dark medium and
light here's light right in the center
medium shades which can be great for a
soft crease color they can be great on
the lid and then where your darkest
shades here here those are the ones
where if you want the dramatic outer V
use them there you smudge them on the
lower lash line
those are your shades for creating
contrast and not every look has to
incorporate four or five colors
sometimes it could just be one or two
and I can see like the way these are
layered right here you know there's some
easy to identify duos just looking
vertically now not that every client who
comes to your counter has watched my
full you know beginner eye series but
once you are able to identify the darks
mediums and lights I do think if you
plug them into the different formulas
like the sandwich method like the trio
method or
using a quad it really becomes much more
simple to figure out a neutral palette
like that it's very easy to determine
you know where the dart mediums and
lights and then you've got palettes like
this is the vise is the vise for and
it's got all these bright tones and what
do you do with bright colors a lot of
people the only thing they want to do
with the colorful pops and palettes like
this is avoid them there are a couple of
ways a couple of easy ways that I would
challenge you to integrate a bright like
kind of medium shade so I'm talking
about colors like this or this or this
or even this number one try popping it
all over the lid keep your neutral
crease color you know keep your eye look
very neutral otherwise but pop that
bright shade right on the lid it's kind
of a peekaboo effect because when your
eyes are open you don't even necessarily
see it that much and then you look down
it's like oh there's a fun little pop of
color there when it's surrounded safely
by neutrals it can feel easier to pull
that off another place that would
challenge you to try a color is the
lower lash line it's just you know it's
a smaller surface area it's a fun way to
accentuate the look you can keep
everything very neutral up top if you
want to but just use the colorful pop on
the lower lash line and I will explain
that in my little demo coming up the
rest assured more to come on this whole
how to use large palettes concept but
for those of you who are just starting
out and just getting into the world of
using more eyeshadows than just maybe a
quad or a trio and these palettes from
Maybelline while they may not be all
around across-the-board my favorite
quality eyeshadows I do think there are
some hit and miss things happening here
but I'm holding up the nudes and the
blushed nudes these are very good
training type eyes shadow palettes
because they are laid out in such a way
that it's absolutely goof proof what
shades you should wear together because
they are quads here four four four
they're in trios one two three one two
three one two three here and then duos
two here two here two here
see how it's been brilliantly laid out
in that way and there's your reminder of
how that all works they've got little
graphics on the back to show you how the
shades come together
so not every palate is that way
obviously but if you're kind of you know
trying to get a feel for what shades
work well together these palettes have
been laid out specifically to show you
that Carroll says what false eyelashes
run longer than our Dell if any
I tried demi whispies but they didn't
look right going three-quarters of the
way across my lashes and a lot of others
seem about the same so she's talking
about not just length of the lash bit
left to right how far they cover the
lash line I would say look into the eye
lower brand these generally seem to
cover a lot of surface area left to
right I mean for my eyes I pretty much
always have to trim up the eye lower
lashes and places you would find these
Ulta probably has the best selection I
also find summit target I think even my
Walmart store now is carrying I saw a
few of the Vegas nay variety there Rita
or Rica says it would be great if
somebody could recommend single
eyeshadows for a one shadow look I will
link below to a blog post and other
videos I've done about one shadow look
so you can see some of those and I'm
actually considering an updated blog
post with singles duo's trios and quads
that I love a few ideas right now I love
these L'Oreal infallible singles a lot
of these that are kind of a medium tone
and have some shimmer are just ideal for
the one shadow look in fact I will cut
to a quick little demo where I show this
shade called bronze taupe in action I
love this shade this is this has been a
longtime favorite so I'll Pat it all
over my lid after applying a primer of
course and just get it all packed on
there then I use my Sigma e25 brush dip
into the very same shade and buff it up
into the crease and it's just beautiful
how this shape both catches the light
and can look very shadowed in the crease
so beautiful neutral and you can do fun
pops on the lower lash line as I'll show
you coming up another infallible single
that I think is great is amber rush it's
going to be warmer more like a coppery
rose gold type shade from Maybelline
there's this single called cinnamon
spice I think this is
an awesome kind of bronzy brown which
does the one shadow look perfectly this
Milani Bella eyes line I'm really kind
of getting into these the Bella emerald
shade is fun because you know it's a
green it's not too dark it's not too
light and it's just got that little bit
of Sheen happening there so that can be
a great one shadow look the Bella purple
shade can be really beautiful for that
as well think about jewel tones when you
get your mind kind of thinking they're
like these sapphire type colors Ruby
type shapes these those are really ideal
for the one shadow look when the shade
has just a little bit of shine going on
another kind of interesting color that I
want to try for a one shadow look is
this prestige total intensity shadow and
hocus-pocus and it is one of those
shades that looks kind of like a teal
but when it's not catching the light it
almost looks like a reddish brown you
know so I think that would be a really
cool type of shade to try in the crease
and on the lid I have seen so many
questions asking about techniques for
hooded eyes and I actually just recently
watched a video from Malley Ron Cal she
is a celebrity makeup artist I had the
privilege of meeting her several years
back she's awesome and she's got some
great instructional videos on her
YouTube channel and one she did she was
like doing a periscope session and a
YouTube video at the same time it was
kind of cool but the whole focus was
hooded eyes and you know tricks for
really making them pop and you could see
her in action and I could I could see
the transformation taking place as she
was applying these shadows and she was
really like making a point to kind of
create a crease for herself basically
that was probably a little above where
her actual crease was using deeper
shades up there and then she popped a
lot of shimmer on her lid and it really
did help create the illusion of you know
an actual lid space and a crease so I
will link to that video below in the
description box but she's got more just
in-depth tips and just getting a visual
of it seeing her apply it I think will
help you a lot Margaret miner says I'd
like to see a tutorial on how you apply
liner / shadow underneath your eye and
I'm going to show you that method today
I'm just one idea for the way I do it
for a very smoky like smoky pop of
on the lower lashline so here's what I
do I like to get some sort of liner on
the lower inner rim today I'm using
black it's the master precise skinny
from Maybelline and I just apply it to
the inner rim and kind of smudge it a
little bit between the lashes on the
actual lower lash line itself just to
help in the blending process as we move
forward another super easy trick for
applying a color to your lower lash line
is to use a great long wearing cream
shadow stick there so this Maybelline
Color tattoo in the shade lilac lust
it's kind of a dusty purple shade very
soft and you can just swipe this on your
lower lash line and you could leave it
be because this actually does set I find
these to be very long wearing there are
a bunch of shadow sticks similar to this
on the market from Milani Jordana
higher end brands like Malley like Laura
Mercier the balm has some great shadow
sticks now that really lock in and set
and they can give you that look of
beautiful smudgy smoky liner but a fun
way to incorporate a little added pop of
color is to take a powder shadow that
kind of coordinates with that shade and
put it on top with either a pencil brush
or a smudge brush today I'm using the
Milani Bella purple and you know this
didn't go super bright it just looks
like a nice smoky plum on the lower lash
line but it's different from what's
happening on the lid I think it's pretty
this is one of those ways I would
challenge you guys to incorporate color
because it's a very small way to put
color on the eyes but it's really fun
Ivy is asking about the best eye brushes
for small eyes first and foremost most
important the Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush above all else something small for
padding shadow on the lid this brush is
not too big I love the way it picks up
product it's you know surprisingly
tapered down the sides so when you lay
that flat down into a shadow it's going
to be picking up product all along the
side of the brush and you can just Pat
it on the lid it's great for targeting
shadow in the outer corner if you don't
have big eyes like this is a great brush
to have also I think you need a small
crease brush and this was really laid
out
in my day for video on this mua makeup
academy professional 315 brush is a
great small crease brush for getting
shadow exactly where you want it it's
all about placement when you've got
small eyes because if you don't have a
ton of I realist state to work with you
want shadow to go exactly where you
place your brush and this just allows
you to draw in that outer V like nothing
before this brush it was the essence of
beauty fine crease brush duo that I was
talking about from like my first days of
existence on YouTube those I got at CVS
as well I'm not sure if anybody's still
finding those in their stores but and
this is a little bit more current option
and for blending type brushes that are a
little bit smaller and the elf Studio
line has something called the crease
brush which I used in a couple of my
videos this week they also have a
blending brush it's like a slimmed down
version of a sigma e25 and that can be
really nice for targeting the crease and
then this crease brush I like it for you
know maybe applying a transition type
shade or if you just want to blend over
the edge of your look and you feel like
most blending brushes are too fat this
can get a little bit more targeted area
I'm gonna go over to Twitter to get some
questions from there Jocelyn says how to
keep lower eyeliner from smudging and
smearing during the day I've already
tried topping with shadow and powdering
the eye area and well one thing that I
had just mentioned that I really like
doing I love the staying power of a lot
of these smudge proof shadow sticks so
applying those on the lower lash line
can be a nice little technique there but
I would love to know which eyeliners
you've tried on your lower lash line
because increasingly I think brands are
putting out eyeliner pencils that have
better staying power
this master precise skinny is a really
nice one I love this Milani supreme Kohl
Kajal eyeliner color pop has a vast
variety of shades in kind of a gel like
pencil that goes on really smoothly and
does a good job of locking in so I'm not
sure if you've tried any of those brands
but they've been really good for me then
in general as far as just wearing lower
liner I'm not considering like the lower
inner rim
because I will do that quite a bit but
just on the lower lash line itself a lot
of times I'm mainly using powder there
and that is where I think the Jumbo
shadow sticks are nice for providing a
little base for that powder giving it a
little bit better staying power that way
or you know brushing on a little bit of
primer to that area before you apply a
powder it can be a step to try but the
softness of powder on the lower lash
line I think really looks good
Amy black says so there's hooded eye
issues and then there's people like me
with big eyelids I hate my big eyelids
and eyes in general I don't know what to
do either I've got to say Amy anytime
I've done makeup on someone and my
sisters in law they have these big
beautiful blue eyes and there's so much
space on their lids and in their crease
to work with though to me big eyelids
are kind of exciting but one thing that
you might try is thickening up your
eyeliner because I think a lot of people
with small eyes are very little lid
space you know I would encourage those
people to go with a very thin line so
they don't sort of cut that off but if
you've got a lot of lid space you might
try you know going with a really thick
beautiful like cat eye winged liner
across the upper lash line and see what
you think of that method I'm not sure if
you've tried it before but I imagine it
will take up some of your lid space that
way and really give you a lot of good
definition Amy's my Twitter buddy I know
she'll let me know how that worked out
yari says I have a few silver eye
shadows but can't seem to make them
wearable um here's a way I think silver
would be really pretty say you've got a
color or even just a neutral shade all
over your lid try popping the silver and
right on the center of the lid kind of
blending it in you know on the sides -
whatever your topping I mean think of
like a charcoal type color all over the
lid and then that pop of a silvery shade
right on the center of your eyelid that
would be such a pretty take on it Maddie
Miller says anytime I wear false lashes
the inner corner pops up even when I
bend and shape then help okay I've got a
tip and this is a total second hand
stolen tip from Lola Marie seven Jess's
channel I love her I just I just love
listening to her talk about stuff she's
really funny and I just love her
demeanor and
she talked about this using a clear lash
glue with a brush tip I think she had
Ardell I've got salon perfect right here
but she said somebody told her to try
this but you put your lashes on using
whatever blue you typically use like
it's let's say Revlon precision lash
adhesive or some people use the duo glue
and then you take this clear glue with
the brush tip and you use it on the ends
to reinforce the strip of lashes on your
lash line like you just go right over it
and I thought I have never thought to do
that I personally haven't tried this yet
but as soon as I heard that tip I
thought that you know that's a great
idea it would dry obviously with no
color and you could just use it on your
ends so I just thought that was an
awesome tip I do plan to try that out
sometime and go over to her channel and
say thanks if it worked
Holly says I don't typically wear liquid
eyeliner but when I do a straight line
is nearly impossible any tips or tricks
here number one I think it's kind of
about the product I think using a
product that allows oh excuse me using a
product that allows you to hold it more
like a pen or pencil is helpful so this
Physicians Formula I booster pen is
really great because it has a brush tip
- so it's tons of flexibility right
there and it just makes it you can hold
it however you want to and it makes it
really comfortable but as far as
application goes try to divide and
conquer try to think of your eye not as
one continuous space that you need to go
across but mentally divide your eye up
into like thirds and think about okay my
first third I just need to get across
there okay done and lift the brush up
regroup let's go back and pick up where
you left off and focus on just getting
across the center part of your eye stop
take a deep breath and then go across
the end also if there's any where I know
a lot of people do their makeup standing
up and this is a hard thing to do but if
you've got a surface where you can plant
your elbow like a desk and also use your
finger like your pinky right here
there's so much stability there than if
I was just you know free with my elbow
and my
and trying to apply the liner
Alejandra's says I have the baldest
lower lashline on earth so I never put
mascara on there because my lashes are
so thin could I still smoke out the
lower lashline or will that look
unfinished without mascara honestly I
think smoking out the lower lashline
will make it less apparent that you have
thin lashes there because when you think
about it if you do nothing it's going to
look lighter on your lower lashline
creating more of a backdrop for the few
lashes you have to stand out and look
like just a few but if you keep it kind
of smudgy and smoky I think it will all
kind of just mesh into one you know and
you can smoke out the liner go go with
kind of a soft shadow or go with this
sort of a technique right here and it
may surprise you how little it draws
attention to your few lower lashes so
give it a try I think it might work well
my memory cards telling me it's almost
time to go but do you think I got
through honestly most of the questions
that were asked so thank you guys so
much for participating in this little
Q&amp;amp;A I hope some of these tips will be
the answer for you that really end up
helping you out oh I have one more tip
one more tip for those of you who are
like you know I don't know what to do
with my palettes I'm not sure how to
integrate colors and do all this here's
something I would really recommend give
yourself some makeup playtime sit down
to your makeup area when you don't have
any where you need to go because
experimentation is I think a lot less
likely when you know you've got an
important appointment to go to or you've
got to go to work you know you're
probably gonna go with what works so
find a time when you can sit down and
experiment and just try things and
you're like gosh I'm not sure how that
green would look all over my lid just
sit down and try it you know the beauty
of makeup is that it all washes off and
you'll never know how certain things
work on you you know you'll watch other
people try things and maybe you'll be
like oh I like how that tutorial looked
I didn't like how that one looked but
you'll never really know how it works on
you until you go ahead and go for it and
try it so if you're scared about
experimenting pick a day when you don't
have to go anywhere have your makeup
playtime just start trying stuff out and
see what works see what you like but
trying a different brush try
new technique trying a different color
they've never worn before that can
sometimes set off more light bulbs in
your head than anything I might tell you
I know anytime I'm feeling like I'm in a
makeup rut or I'm doing the same thing
over and over again there's nothing like
just giving yourself some time you know
like when I'm not shooting a video when
I don't have anywhere I specifically
have to be I can just sit down and play
and pull out something I've never tried
before and it's so fun so please have a
good time enjoy yourself
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
