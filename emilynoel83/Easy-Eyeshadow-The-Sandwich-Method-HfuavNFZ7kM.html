about the sandwich method and if you
came here through some sort of food
search and you were hoping for some
discussion about turkey lettuce tomato
that's not what this video is about it's
all about eyes shadow and just a very
simplified method of applying it that I
think it's really handy for someone
who's looking for a quick look someone
who just likes simple looks someone
who's a beginner and just really looking
for something that they can easily
duplicate I think about this method a
lot when I'm doing my makeup but I think
I only verbalized it just maybe a couple
weeks ago in my favorites video when I
was talking about some shadows that I
really like to do this with and
basically what it is is you're utilizing
two shadows for a look one shade is
going to go on your lid and under your
brow and the other shade is going to be
sandwiched right in between in your
crease and it's just that easy so a duo
for example could pull off this look so
you're going to be looking for duo's
that have a light shade that's light
enough to perform as your highlight and
then a deeper shade that could be
anywhere from like a mid-tone color all
the way to something really dark if
that's what you another really basic
method for eyeshadow that I like to do
sometimes is my one shadow I'll link
below to the video and tutorial where I
talk about that for this video the
sandwich method I don't intend for this
to be something where you've got to go
out and buy some certain eyeshadow to
make this work I think this is more of a
formula for using shadow a pattern for
applying the shadow that you can apply
to probably lots of different things
that you already own shadows in your
larger palettes your naked palettes
shadows in your duo's and trios and
quads but at the end I will suggest some
different duo's that I think perform
this task really well and might just
give you some visions for where you can
take this look so first off here's the
tutorial I've already applied a primer
to my lids I used bare minerals
primetime I think using an eye primer
just really helps the shadows adhere to
your lids and lasts longer throughout
the day and it also helps them stand out
more and look really intense so the quad
I'm using is from bare minerals and it's
called the promise
going to be going to this sunshiny
buttery shade here it does have some
shimmer in it and I'm picking some of
that up on my Sonia Kashuk small shadow
brush any flat shadow brush that you
like to use would be good for this step
and I'm just going to begin patting that
all over my eyelid a patting motion
packs on the shadow a little bit better
as opposed to you know really like
dusting back and forth and potentially
dusting some of the product away so I'm
patting it on and then you can also go
around your inner corner this is a great
brightening shadow so if you want to
take your brush and just go right around
your tear duct that will make you look
really nice and white away X I'm taking
my e25 brush from Sigma so it's a crease
brush but it's not super huge and
oversized so I feel like I have the
control to get the shadow exactly where
I want it and I'm using this kind of
matte medium taupe cut which really
gives a natural-looking shadow to your
crease so I'm taking this really all the
way in on my crease here and then I'm
going to just continue blending outward
as well I'm not really forming this into
any big shape I'm just following the
natural shape of my crease and if you've
got a lot of space in between your eye
and your eyebrow maybe you even want to
pull this shadow up a little bit and you
can make better use of that space I
suppose next I'm taking an e 40 brush so
a little bit fuller brush than what I
just used and there's nothing on it I'm
just buffing over the edge of my deeper
shade and then we complete the sandwich
here I'm just going to lightly pick up a
little bit of that golden color because
I don't want it to be quite as intense
or packed on as it was when it was on my
lid so I'm just going to apply that
lightly up under my eyebrow and now
you've made use of your light shade in
two ways and you've got your darker
shade to provide the contrast now one
more way you can continue on with this
look and give yourself a little added
definition for your eye is to take the
deeper of your two shades and I'm using
a smudge brush you could use an angled
liner brush or whatever you're
comfortable with and just start to apply
this right here on your lower line
line you don't even have to go all the
way and I sometimes like to just keep it
there
on the outside it just gives the eye a
little more definition but with a shade
this light you can see it's very soft
you can finish the look any way you want
liquid liner cream liner pencil liner
you could line your waterline since I'm
going for kind of like a bright everyday
type Lona look a little more awake after
that daylight savings change I'm going
to use a brightening liner in my inner
rim this is the Rimmel scandaleyes in
nude so I'm just going to apply that to
my inner rim and this is my black
colored clay pencil liner from Tarte and
is going to apply this across my upper
lash line from inner to outer corner i
think pencils are really easy to use one
thing you just want to make sure of is
that you're getting it as close to your
lashes as possible you don't want to
leave any sort of gap there and I'm just
going to curl my lashes and I'm going to
apply a couple coats of my Neutrogena
healthy lengths to my upper lashes and
one coat on the lower lashes okie dokie
so that was easy enough right just a
very easy simplified way to use your
eyeshadow even if you've been using
makeup for years maybe you really like
some very complex looks I still think
there's a lot of beauty and a very
simple look as well it doesn't look
super overdone or like you spend a ton
of time on again you could pull this off
with all sorts of shadows and different
colors that you might already have and I
do just want to give you some additional
suggestions might just get the creative
juices flowing a little bit for some
other shadows that work nicely in this
waist off another duo from bareMinerals
that I like a lot this is called the top
shelf it has like a pretty champagne
kind of pinkish color and then a really
pretty bronzed
I think this bronze is right on the
verge of almost being like walking the
line of maybe too light to go in your
crease but what I do use it and I've had
this on in different videos I get so
many questions about it because it just
is a really nice light soft light makes
a great summery look so I wanted to
mention that one another great little
drugstore option here is from Maybelline
and it's the duo in dusk this has a soft
pink and a taupe I would say both of
these are kind of a satin finish so not
too much shy
going on here but these work together
really nicely to create a look that I
think really complements anything else
you've got going on makeup wise much
like the look I used today I also love
the hard candy baked duo's this is the
one in peace and I think they do a
really good job of putting shadows in
here that can do this method really well
a light shade that can go on your lid
easily work under your brow and then a
deeper shade that's definitely deep
enough to provide some contrast in your
crease
this one's really beautiful just great
if you like the neutral brownish kind of
look and finally just an idea of
something you could use to take this
look a little bit deeper this is the
L'Oreal hip duo it's one of the metallic
shadow duo's in electrified and I love
this one because it's got a pretty taupe
in there and also a deep plum this taupe
can really take on different looks it
will look so different when you've got
it packed on your lid as opposed to if
you use it super lightly with a crease
brush and just dust it under your breath
can look like a really soft highlight
shade so I think that's a great duo to
have especially if you like the plumy
purple type looks so I hope this video
was useful for you if you've got some
beginners in the makeup world in your
life definitely share this video with
them share the one shadow look these are
really easy uncomplicated ways that you
can work with your eyeshadow and of
course you can jazz it up from time to
time but sometimes it's nice to just
have that go-to shadow formula that's
the way I like to think of it so thank
you very much for watching guys I'll see
you later
