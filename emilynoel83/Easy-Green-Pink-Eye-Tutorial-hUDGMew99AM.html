where you're kind of thinking I'd like
to work in a little bit of color to my
eyeshadow but I just don't want it to
look over what I want it to be wearable
something I can even use for work and
that's what I've been able to pull off
with this palette here from LA colors
I've used a few of the shades here to
create a look that you that utilizes
some greens and pinks and some sort of
golden shades so I'd like to show you
how I did it so keep on watching first
step for this I look I'm going to take
my be less sad Oh magnet and light and
I'm just going to use this to prime my
eyelids so just dab your finger in and
just spread that along your eyelid
lightly next I'm going to be using some
colors from my LA colors um five color
metallic eyeshadow palette in tease so
it's got several really bright colors
and the first one we're going to use is
this pretty green shade here on the end
so I'm just going to use my ELF
eyeshadow brush pack up my brush and
apply that all over the lid stove really
pretty kind of kind of makes me think of
a spring green so if you'd like to build
the intensity you can definitely do that
with this shape just like that now we
want to build up a little bit of depth
here in the crease and the reason why
I'm going outside of this palette to do
it is because these are all nice and
Kyle and and you know they're different
from one another they're all nice and
shimmery and vibrant but we do want
something that can be a little bit
deeper and just searched it create some
contrast in the crease so I'm going to
go for a very affordable alternative I'm
going to go for um wet'n'wild the single
is in wicked and so it's a black with
just a little bit of sparkle to it and
that will work fine for what we're going
to do today I'm going to take my Sonia
Kashuk medium eyeshadow brush just dip
it in here it's kind of a flat shader
brush and it'll help us get this darker
look going in our crease
so I'm just going to start by just
placing it right in right under that
that bone right there and kind of
pressing up in towards it and that
should get your shadow placement just
right and you may want to blend this out
because you may have sort of a harsh
more harsh line between the top of your
green and that shade so I'm just going
to go in with my Sephora rounded crease
brush just to kind of blur that line a
little bit and then the next thing I'm
going to do is go back to my LA colors
palette and I'm going to use this really
pretty vibrant pink shade dip into that
with my crease brush tap off the excess
and just go over the border of that
black shade with the pink and you're
going to create kind of that nice little
warm fade going on there I love using
I'm really liking using sort of pinks
and mobs in this way to warm up an eye
look and then for our highlight you'll
notice right here second from the end
you've got kind of a orangie copper
shade and that's going to make for a
really nice warm highlight so just apply
that all over right up to your eyebrow
for eyeliner I'm going to be using my
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black and this is just going to
be a matter of you know one fairly thin
line from the inner corner to outer
corner here and I've been asked you know
after you go over that you know a bright
colored shadow and then you dip back
into the little container that's holding
the liquid liner you know do you lose
intensity or does it dull it dull down
your liner and I can honestly say that
it does not not with this product so
that's I mean I've just I've just
noticed this is this maintains intensity
from you know when you open the product
to
you uh once you're about to run out in
terms of our lower liner I'm just going
to grab my revlon colorstay pencil liner
in black brown you could use it just
straight black or really any shade you
want to and I'm just going to connect up
with the corner there and then draw a
line pretty much three quarters of the
way in kind of thinning it as you go
next grab a liner brush and that wet and
wild shadow we were just using a little
bit ago and we're just going to use that
to kind of um set that liner that we
just drew on there and then once you've
done that we're going to do something a
little bit different on the inner corner
going back to the LA colors palette and
that green shade and we'll just kind of
fill in there on the inner corner with
that just for a little added Sparkle now
I'm going to be curling my eyelashes and
holding it for about 15 seconds then I'm
going to use my L'Oreal hit mascara and
just give myself a co2 that on my upper
lashes this might scare is always good
for some nice quick volume all right
guys that's all for this spring colored
look using some multi colored bright
shades that you can do sort of pastel
like with this or you could put kind of
a brighter base underneath if you wanted
to these shadows can really go a lot of
different ways so you can really just
use your imagination and it's so
affordable it's a nice um nice way to
get some some bright colors all in one
easy a compact package so thank you guys
so much for tuning in for this video
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
