such an easy i look today you're not
going to believe it it only uses two
different eye shadow products and a
course on liner but basically two
eyeshadows that i'm using to get this
look and it's super easy it's just a
matter of blending kind of like a
monochromatic look we're using a light
shimmery sort of pinky shade then we
transition into a burgundy color that's
also sort of metallic and shimmery and
then a plum and it all kind of fuses
together to give you this really pretty
Moff look on your eyes very easy to
duplicate I hope you enjoy this tutorial
and keep on watching I'm just applying a
primer to my lid first what I have on
here now is the new Coastal Scents
shadow works eyeshadow primer this is a
new product i'm going to be reviewing it
shortly but it does have shimmer in it
so keep that in mind next i'm using the
baked eyeshadow duo from hard candy in
secret rendezvous it's kind of a light
shimmery metallic pink and then a
burgundy shade that's also got some
shimmer to it I'm going to use my SS 239
eyeshadow brush from Sigma and just pack
some of that shadow on and get the light
shade all over the inner part of the lid
next flip your shadow brush over go to
the darker shade in the duo get some of
that on your brush and just Pat that on
the outer part of the lid you can see
the to blend really easily I'm just kind
of overlapping that lighter shade just
to blend the two you can kind of flip
your brush over and do what you need to
do to buff those two together and then
kind of start pulling that deeper shade
up into the crease using this shadow
brush sort of like a wedge see I'm kind
of pulling that up into the crease next
you want to grab a brush that you can
really get into your crease with any
small crease brush is fine or out of the
sigma premium kit the SS 226 see how it
kind of comes to a point there that kind
of a brush even though it's a little
larger will be useful as well because it
allows you to get right in the crease so
take a deeper plum shade I'm going to
use a sketch by Mac you
see it's kind of a I believe it's a
satin shade yet or a velvet shade so
it's got a little bit of shimmer to it
but overall kind of a plummy almost
brownish tone plum and get a little bit
of that right on the tip of your brush
and I'm going to look down into a mirror
and just sort of start applying that to
deepen the crease I'm going to go all
throughout the whole crease from right
about in here all the way to the other
side if you want a more dramatic I then
you can take it up just a little bit
instead of concentrating it in the
crease to start to bring it up and kind
of overlap where you put that more
metallic maroon color from hard candy
and you'll get a really really pretty
affect their next take a fluffy brush
I'm going to use my SS 224 you can see
it's not pointed like the other one we
just used was I'm going to use the
deeper shade and my hard candy duo here
and just buff that over the top it's
going to create a really seamless fade
basically of all these shades and then
take the lighter shade with that same
brush going to the lighter color and
take that right under your brow you're
going to get a really pretty warm look
here multiple shades of mom it really
comes together nice next I'm going to
line all across my lash line with my
Maybelline de final line eyeliner I'm
using it in ebony black it's kind of a
softer liner so it's really really
simple to go all the way across your eye
there a lash line here so I'm just going
to go from the very corner and carry it
all the way over now as i get to the
outer edge you can see I'm thickening it
just a little bit and going just
slightly off of my natural lash line and
that's so I can make a good connection
here at the lower liner so just kind of
connect it there and draw just a little
bit of a line on the lower lash line
just go in a little bit and then we are
going to use the Handy smudge tip on the
other end of this and this is really
going to allow
to get a nice kind of somewhat smoky
effect on your liner next take a liner
brush and sketch from Mac again with the
plum shade and we're just going to use
that to top off this liner since it is
cream-based we want to go over this and
make sure it's going to have ultimate
staying power so it's not going to
change really the appearance very much
of this liner but it is going to help
the staying power go underneath as well
and then we're going to take a pencil
type brush like the SS 219 as you can
see very small dip that point down into
the sketch and just kind of go all the
way under the lash line next if you want
you can take your liner and line your
waterline I am going to do that with
this look so just kind of gently gently
pull down and allow that access to your
waterline there and go all the way to
the inner corner and another nice
finishing touch is just taking a light
shimmery shade just like the same light
shade in the hard candy duo with a very
small brush and just kind of doubt that
right here in the corner just to light
your eyes up all right guys here is the
finished look for my mascara I just
applied my almay one coat nourishing
mascara triple effect this is a really
really great mascara but just a tip for
applying it if you look at the brush you
can see that there are like longer
bristles on one end and then super super
short bristles on the other I would
recommend doing the lengthening step
first which is the longer bristles so
like apply that and then just turn the
brush you don't have to go back in for
more product but just turn the brush and
then apply the thickening side and you
get basically all the effects of that
and plus it's kind of like a curling
mascara as well it kind of holds a curl
pretty nicely so I also applied like one
coat of that on the bottom to give sort
of a fringy smokey look that we were
going for but it's a different kind of
like smokey type of I just because we're
incorporating instead of any
acts or Browns we're using sort of plums
and moss which i think is really pretty
um on my lips what I've got there is one
of the Coastal Scents lip liners and
this shade is mauve take the cap off to
show you here yeah basically this is
kind of like a muted pink or neutral
it's like a new to think of a neutral
color just with a little bit of pinky
rose thrown in and that's what you get
with a mob shade so I have swatches of
all these coastal scents liners on my
blog if you're interested in that but
after I put that on and wanting to top
it with a gloss used one of my all-time
favorite favorites which is from Jordana
and it is the pretty shine lip gloss and
lovely as you can see the logo heads
completely worn off on mine but it's
pretty it shimmery goes great with this
mauve liner other stuff on my face today
I use the NYC blush abul cream stick I
use the one in wild berry so it's the
kind of like bright pink I applied it
right here you know on the outer apples
of my cheeks and I topped it off with a
hard candy baked blush in living doll so
that's a really you know shimmery pink
shade so I think it plays off of this
look really well I hope you enjoyed this
guy's this was a really quick and easy
tutorial and something that looks so
great for everyday but can transition
you into a night look very easily as
well so thanks so much for watching and
have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
