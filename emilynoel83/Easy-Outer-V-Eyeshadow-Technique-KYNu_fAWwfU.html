video this is going to be all about a
particular technique that I have used in
a lot of my tutorials but not until
recently have I done it in a certain way
that I believe there's a lot easier and
a lot quicker and as so that is the
outer V and what I'm referring to with
the outer V is basically if you look at
this eyeshadow look you can see sort of
the intensity of the shadow is going
sort of out like this from the eye sort
of in like a sideways V like that and
actually my liner is a little bit winged
out if you look closely you can see that
that is winged out as well and so
basically what this look is it's playing
off of your liner to get that outer V so
in a sense you are doing some of your
shadow you're going ahead and lining and
then you're saving that last dark shadow
step for the end so you can play off
that shape and actually get the perfect
placement of the outer V for your eye so
I'm really excited to show you how that
all works because um it just I feel like
it's really kind of transformed the way
I've done my makeup lately and it's just
really helped me to make sure that I'm
getting it even on both sides and all
that so before I show you that technique
I do want to tell you what I've used on
my eyes so far so you're a fully aware
of what's going on here and I used all
Mac's stuff - as far as the shadow goes
I used satin taupe this kind of neutral
shade all over my lid just to give me
that kind of medium color and a little
bit of Sheen that picks up the light and
I tried to make this really not
complicated at all so I wouldn't have to
describe too much but I went all over my
lid with that and I put a wash of that
in my crease just my natural crease to
just deepen it up a little bit before I
went in with that dark shade after the
liner then I used as a highlight I use
Naked Lunch which is just a nice kind of
shade with a little bit of frost and
shimmer to it went right up under my
eyebrow with that and also kind of
highlighted the inner corner I used the
LA girl fine line kind of a pen liner
that makes it really easy to line all
the way across and then kind of go out
with that slightly winged out effect
at the end and that winged out look is
what is allowing us to get the placement
of the lovely shadow right then on the
lower lash line
I used my Coastal Scents gel liner in
stellar and that's just kind of a
shimmery black charcoal shade I really
concentrated at the corner try to trying
to blend it up with my upper liner and
then just really buffed it out and
topped it with the satin taupe all
towards the inner part so it really is
not too harsh at all so now here's a
look at how to get that out guys before
I take you through the exact technique I
just want you to take a second to see
what it really looks like with an outer
V and without here I do also have some
mascara on here as well but other than
that those are the only differences you
can see that the outer V really kind of
takes the attention not only to your eye
but also around it kind of making your
eyes seem larger as a whole just because
there's more going on around it you know
what I mean so that's kind of the effect
that false eyelashes can have as well
when they're coming up and sort of
making your entire eye area look a
little larger than it actually is
so what we're going to do I'm going to
take a matte black shade I'm going to be
using carbon from Mac really any dark
shade that you want to use can work here
I just recommend it generally being a
dark shade because you don't want to put
something to light over that line or to
I guess wash it out so I'm using my fine
crease brush from essence of Beauty just
going to get some of that dark shade on
there on the brush I'm going to look
down into a mirror and the first thing
I'm going to do is actually darken my
natural crease my natural crease is
running right here
my unnatural crease I guess as you call
it would be out there so I'm just going
to go right in here where my eye
naturally has a crease and just darken
that up a little bit because if that's
not dark this look was really going to
look very put on and very unnatural so I
mean it's not I'm not claiming that this
is the most natural look ever but you're
going to make it make sense I guess if
you darken up your crease so I'm just
putting some of that shade in there
as you can see naturally where my crease
is now we've got this area out here
where the liner has extended and this is
the trick to understand where your outer
V should be go to wherever you wind your
liner out and remember when you do
winged liner you want to keep that in
line with your brow so as you wing that
out it should be pointing out - like if
you continue the line it would hit the
end of your brow so all of this is
keeping in line with the right shape of
the outer V so you're going to go from
that end with your shadow and you're
going to carry that up just on top of
your brow bone you'll recall we put that
dark color just now right in here
now we're going from the outer corner
bringing it right up on top of the brow
bone so some of this color shows you can
see as I sit here that color shows up
above you know your your open eye so
that's what we're doing here you can
extend it out even a little bit further
from you know where your where your line
is but basically you just want to darken
that up right there in the crease and
then kind of carry it out it helps to
kind of put the get the color on there
and then kind of work it out in circular
motions with a smallish brest
brush like this the smaller the brush
you use the more control you'll have I'm
not saying you couldn't do this with a
larger brush but if you really want to
pay attention to shape kind of like we
did over here a smaller brush will give
you that control the area you want to
have the darkest is the area in your
crease and also the area that comes
closest to your liner okay that's where
we get this nice fade here to where the
liner you know if you just glanced at it
the liner is practically unidentifiable
because we've taken such a dark black
shade and gotten so close to the line
here we have not yet done that you can
see the difference and it doesn't look
quite as polished and smooth and in kind
of that continuous just black shade so
you just want to go in and kind of
overlap it a little bit bring that dark
shade on there matte shades are going to
give you more intensity than shimmers
will because shimmers are going to
reflect the light more and the dark
matte shades are going to really get
darkness where you want it
just go on and I mean you can you can do
less intense outer V's you can do more
you know deep deep dark outer V's you
could wet a shadow down and you know do
it that way but basically what we've got
here is intensity built in just the
right area for our eye shape and if you
do this keeping everything in line with
the end of the brow you will be right
for your eye shape as well so I
recommend just taking a fluffy brush and
kind of buffing over the outer edge of
what you've done there and just kind of
keep an eye on what you did on your
other hand keep an eye on what you did
on your other eye and just kind of make
sure it's all sort of matching up as it
should but that is my technique for an
outer V everyone and after this I'm
going to just apply a coat of mascara
I'm using L'Oreal voluminous in this
look and a little bit of Maybelline lash
discovery here on the bottom lashes and
I'll be right back
welcome back guys here is the finished
look and I did add on a little bit of
some false lashes there I used my Revlon
fantasy lengths intensifying false
lashes that actually are the
self-adhesive ones so I just stuck those
on there real quick I kind of like the
look it gives along with that outer V on
my lips I'm wearing Jordana lipliner in
baby berry just filled in my whole lips
with that and then put my NYX girls
lipgloss round lip gloss and soap opera
queen on top of that so that's a nice
shimmery pink and this could be a nice
holiday look really as I think about it
now but I hope this gave you just a new
way to think about doing your outer V it
really all stemmed from a question I got
on Facebook when somebody said you know
I noticed you're doing your outer View a
little differently you know do you think
that would work for me and so I just
really wanted to point out in a specific
video for itself how I do that and if
you have any questions please let me
know thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
