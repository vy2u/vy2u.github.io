me for this video I'm really excited to
pass along this tutorial because it's a
technique I've kind of been working with
for some time now it's sort of trying to
perfect and decide what exactly is the
right way to go about this
but it's a tutorial using only q-tips
it's a q-tip smokey eye so you do not
need a single brush not even a sponge
tip applicator I have done a tutorial in
the past where all I used was sponge tip
applicator 'he's actually works pretty
well so this is just sort of to prove to
you and that you don't necessarily have
to have a big bunch of expensive brushes
to get a smokey eye look I think q-tips
are actually an ideal product to create
a smokey eye and so that's what you're
going to need you're gonna want a few
q-tips for this only a few and q-tips
are very inexpensive so it's really like
no big deal and what I would suggest
though is to use the q-tip brand q-tips
and that is because the cotton that is
wound around the outside of the q-tips
brand q-tip is it's wound a little less
tightly it's not quite packed on there
so much so when we do something where
we're going back and forth back and
forth like this kind of smudging and
smoking it out see how the q-tip sort of
changes shape that's what we want that's
what's gonna allow us to blend in
different ways not only to apply the
product but to blend it out and then the
q-tip becomes sort of the equivalent of
a fluffy shadow brush if you know what I
mean so I know kind of a strange concept
you may have to see it to believe it but
I recommend q-tip brand q-tips for that
reason this is a different brand that
I've had in the past and it just won't
really work the same you may still be
able to get the look we're going for but
you may have to try a little harder to
get it I'm not exactly how how you do it
but like for example my q-tips vanity
packs did a contest for these those kind
of q-tips that come in they're good and
I believe anything that just says you
know q-tip isn't going to work for you
you also want to have a palette for this
tutorial that is kind of like a
monochromatic palette that's gonna give
you at least you know three or four
shades that you can work with
and they're all gonna be sort of in the
same color family ranging from dark to
light so a good dark shade and then up
to a high light shade so the one I'm
going to be using in this tutorial is my
wet and wild color icon palette in lust
which is going to give us a variety of
plum tones so just to show that you know
you don't have to make it a a black and
gray smokey eye you can do whatever you
want other palettes that would be great
for this look would be your cover girl
drama eyes palette because you're
getting a nice black you're getting some
Silver's kind of a range of colors there
from Maybelline the stylish smoke squad
that's giving you again from black
through to some Gray's and then a light
shimmery color and even if you wanted to
go all matte with this you definitely
could a palette that really blends like
a dream is the B luscious naturalist
palette with deep deep Browns and kind
of lighter medium Browns sort of reddish
Browns as well there so just to give you
some ideas that this does not have to be
black smokey eye in my case for this
tutorial it is plum so I hope you enjoy
this tutorial just follow me through the
steps it may seem a little odd
it may seem especially odd the first
time you try it but you really will get
the smudged out kind of imperfecta look
that a smoky eye is intended to have so
if you want to see how I do it keep on
watching my Too Faced shadow insurance
all over my eyelid and now I'm going to
go to my palette here and I'm gonna take
the darkest shade in it so in my wet and
wild
lust palette I'm gonna be using this
matte plum shade so I'm gonna take my
q-tip and basically just kind of get
some of the product on there like that
and then I want to take that all across
my upper lash line and it's gonna make
for kind of a wide line that we're going
to then smudge out so if it helps you
like it helps me kind of look down into
a mirror and again this does not need to
be precise just drag it all the way
across just like that you should wind up
with like I have here a big smokey
nothing well it's not smokey yet but a
big thick line
and then take what's left on there and
take it right underneath so this is
going to give you not quite the
intensity you had on the upper lash line
where that initial application happened
but you can see it there's still quite a
bit there
now take that same applicator that same
q-tip and go up to your upper lash line
and just blend this so you've got shadow
sort of all over your lid but still with
the most intensity right by the lash
line you'll find as you blend with these
regular q-tips brand q-tips that they
kind of transform shape a little bit the
cotton on there is not so tightly wound
as I mentioned that you know it's it's
not going to just remain a tight hard
tip it's actually going to move with you
and that's what really helps the
blending process here so as you can see
now that I've gotten it all over the lid
I'm just taking whatever is left that I
can get out of that and sort of taking
it right to the crease there and that's
kind of what this is all about it's it's
not necessarily working with tons of
product it's getting an initial
application and then just really buffing
it out and you can do that with a q-tip
okay so now that I've got that there I'm
going to take the other end that has not
yet been touched and I'm going to take
basically like one shade up from that
not quite as dark as what we put it's
what we put on the lash line but still
kind of a deep shade in this palette I'm
going to use this shade right here which
is just doesn't really come off quite as
sparkly as it looks but I'm still kind
of a deep burgundy plum tone and once
again just kind of get a little bit on
there sometimes it's nice to just sort
of roll the q-tip back and forth and so
you've got just an application like that
on there and we're gonna take this to
our crease and you'll find that q-tips
at least for me fit really nicely right
in the crease so here we are just
dusting some of that
right here not getting too crazy with it
so we don't wind up with a bunch of
fallout but basically like you're just
placing the shadow where you want it to
go you have a ton of control with a
q-tip okay and now that I've got it on
there you can see I'm kind of going to
the outer border of that if you wanted
to draw on a little bit of an outer V
now's the time to kind of take what
Shadow exists there on your eye and pull
it outward just a little bit whatever
you're comfortable with if this is your
first time trying something like this
with q-tips keep it kind of basic you
know maybe if you don't feel like doing
the outer V just kind of follow your
natural lash line like this for me I'm
going to take a little more same side of
the q-tip and everything and go right to
my outer corner here and I'm just going
to bring it up slightly and then I'm
gonna just blend all that together okay
so now we've kind of got on a little bit
of a rough outer V there but I'm gonna
take here's the side that I used for the
shade I put in the crease I'm gonna flip
it over because I still want that kind
of see how it's kind of fluffed out a
little bit I want it about like that and
I'm going to go to a lighter shade this
one happens to be a little more pink
tone but just a lighter shade of
whatever you just used previously get a
little bit of that color on there and
I'm going to overlap the outer border of
what I just put on and just going to a
lighter shade of what you just use is
going to in itself provide sort of a
blended look because we're just fading
it out from darker to lighter so it's
not going to require necessarily a whole
lot of work to make that look happen
also taking that lighter shade just a
little bit below I'm kind of surrounding
any sort of outer V I just did there and
in turn you are going to get a more
blended outlook there in the outer
corner if you want to sort of clean up
the outside of your look that's
something we traditionally use a q-tip
for and what I would recommend is get
fresh q-tip that has not been sort of
you know undone like these other ones
and just apply quite a bit of pressure
to the added to your eye and you're
going to get more of an edge to your
look that way so that can kind of clean
up you know anything that you've got
around the bottom that's not exactly how
you want it and then if you want to
continue to buff it out and get the
effect of say a more fluffy
you know blending brush just take your
q-tip and do long back-and-forth strokes
and your q-tip is going to end up
loosening a little bit for you and
giving you and give you a more blended
out effect you can see how that is blunt
it's giving me a really nice blend there
on that pinkish purple shade okay and
then next we're gonna do a little
highlight which is very easy I'm gonna
take the opposite side of what I was
just using that for to blend it out I'm
going to go to this light pink shade
right here it's a matte color just
rolling it in there and very easy step
just place it where you want it I'm
going basically directly under my brow
kind of highlighting the shape of the
brow but also giving me a nice contrast
to all the darkness there next I would
say grab either a new q-tip I'm not sure
if you've been switching out q-tips
quite a bit but I'm going to just grab a
fresh one here what nice thing about
q-tips is they're super inexpensive I'm
going to take a light shimmery white
shade that's in this palette just dot it
on there and this is how you can use a
q-tip just for detail-oriented stuff
right around the tear duct area
sometimes I use a little brush for this
step but I almost always say you can use
a q-tip here too and here's how you know
it's just like it's just like your
coloring on a coloring book or something
you put you put the color right where
you want it to go and it's basically
very simple like that then I'm going to
take that q-tip get a little bit of that
light pink shade right on there
and I'm actually going to dot that right
in the center of my lid because I like
to even though this is a dark smoky look
I like to maintain a little bit of
brightness it's gonna help the eye pop a
little bit so just go right to the
center of your lid and then blend right
across it it's not going to be a drastic
thing but it's just going to light up
the eye a little bit now for the first
non shadow non q-tip step I'm just going
to take a black liner and line my
waterline I'm using Milani the Milani
liquify pencil just a really soft black
easy to use liner and just lightly tug
down on your waterline and apply that
just like so I feel like when you do
that you just really get that intense
smoky look because you've got so much
darkness right in next to the the eye
itself so next I'm going to curl my
lashes I'm going to apply the Sephora
lash stretcher mascara this was from my
lash stash kit it has some really long
microfibers so it's going to give us
really nice length on the top and then
I'm going to do a little bit heavier
application than usual of the Maybelline
lash discovery on the bottom and then
I'll join you with the finished look
alright guys this is the finished look
um I've got my mascara on there I
actually ended up topping the lash
stretcher mascara with just some L'Oreal
voluminous to plump them up a little bit
as well they had great length I just
wanted him to be a little thicker and
then you can see how with the lash
discovery I'm just doing a little more
of a heavy application that I usually do
with that really offsets a smoky eye
nicely I really associate the smokiness
the less precise liner with this looked
with lower lashes that are a little bit
more fringed out you know a little bit
more visible I think that looks really
nice what else with my lips
I used the Rimmel lipstick and dusty
rose it's the new moisture a new
lipstick so with that we're looking at
sort of a I don't know it is just a rose
rosy mauve kind of color it's a creamy
lipstick put that all over my lips and
then just for a highlight in the middle
of my lips I use the Jordana pretty
shine lip gloss and cute which is just
your classic light light shimmer perfect
kind of a highlight lip shades so thanks
so much for tuning in for this tutorial
hope you at least got maybe the wheels
turning for how you can try this look at
home and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
