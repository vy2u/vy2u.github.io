I'm bringing you a tutorial today and
it's something I'm very like jacked up
about this morning because I always
think how-to videos are fun and useful
but I feel extra excited about it when I
feel like the tidbit of info I have to
share is so so useful and it's all about
this brush this is the elf blending
brush okay it's three dollars I've had
this in my collection for some time I
remember after I bought it it kind of
just sat around this is like the same
kind of cut as my Sigma e25 but see how
it's like the less fluffy younger sister
you know this one's really like poof out
it takes up a bit more space in the
crease this is a little more targeted
and I'm going to show you in this video
two separate ways to use this that I
think are key for a smoky eye or maybe
not like classic classic smokey eye
where it's like really dark around the
inner part of the eye and fades outward
but I'm thinking more smokey eye in
terms of just a general fade taking your
shadow and diffusing it outward from
your eyes someone this does that well in
a couple different ways both above and
below the eye so I'll be showing that in
this video and this is the spectrum of
shades in the look some of these shades
are so shiny my camera doesn't even want
to focus on but I use let's say
porcelain I use Prosecco olivine penny
forest and a little bit of soft plum and
I'm so happy with it so check it out I'm
gonna take a little eye shadow primer
this is my mini Urban Decay primer
potion I'm just going to dab this all
over the lid I'm first off going into
Prosecco it's a really bright shimmery
shade I'm just going to dab this right
around my inner corner you can see it
really brightens with minimal effort
here then I'm going in to olivine which
is a really interesting shade that I
don't think I gave nearly enough credit
to in my review video it's just this
brilliant like silvery shade with a hint
of olive it's very shiny and metallic so
I'm gonna Pat this all over the lid and
I'm really going to take up the entire
lid space so really get it all the way
up to the crease and I just build it up
little by little you could
quickly just slap a bunch of this on
because it is so pigmented but you know
how I roll
next perk your ears up this is a key
step for the smokey eye and the key
brush that I like to use for it so this
is the elf blending brush from the
studio line three dollar brush see how
it's kind of flat as you turn it
sideways but it definitely has a taper
going all the way down the side so with
our just basic crease shade we're really
going to take advantage of the side of
the brush so I'm tapping into ash and
I'm not really using the tip I'm using
the side of this brush then we're just
gonna work this brush like a wedge right
here in the outer part of the crease and
see how it just kind of perfectly
creates with the taper of the bristles
and where the product has been picked up
it creates this perfect little like a
semicircle on the outer part of the eye
so when you're wanting to do smoky looks
and kind of bring your shadow outward
from the eye you know you're really
paying attention to your own bone
structure here by putting it right here
and then kind of pulling it outward I
just had like a bare minimum on my brush
right there but go back for more
continue building it up as much as you
want take it inward as far as you want
utilize the tip of the brush more as you
go inward so I'm just feeling like it
makes the placement of that shade when
you want to go outward from your eye a
little bit it makes it so much more of a
no-brainer type move and then I'm going
to go back into ash nice ash sorry I had
to for the under eye I'm going to dip
straight in to ash so picking up product
only on the tip of the brush that way
and this brush is giving us a nice
amount of smokiness when we use it that
way again product is only on the tip and
I'm just pulling it from that outer
corner inward and because of another
shade I'm going to incorporate I'm gonna
stop it like right about here and then
I'm going to blend over the outer part
of everything I've got here I'm going to
pull in this dark matte green called
forest with my Sun you Kashuk small
shadow brush this shade I'm just going
to tap on my outer corner and it just
looks so pretty
as
that kind of overlaps that olivine shape
I'm kind of working some of that into
just the crease crease part I'm not
really pulling it outward too much but
just really getting it in there into the
crease then I'm gonna use an olive liner
in my lower inner rim this is Wayne from
the mr. right now line from the balm
then because penny is such a little rock
star in this palette it's gorgeous I'm
picking that up with a smudge brush and
you could definitely take olivine under
the eye but something about this little
bit different tone that you get from
penny I just love it right here under
like the center of the lower lash line
just two more quick things that I want
to do to this look I'm gonna take a
little bit of soft plum with my white
wispy e36 brush and I just want to take
a little bit of that shade kind of as a
transition type color just over Ash this
gives the look a little something extra
not even sure I can put my finger and
then I'm taking this matte shade
porcelain right here with my e-40 and
that is going to be our highlight under
the brow I'm gonna do a little black
liquid liner on the upper lash line this
is my Jordana color Envy in black and V
so just a matte black liquid liner
then I'm gonna give my lashes a curl
using my Maybelline chaotic mascara up
top which when applied in a normal way
isn't all that chaotic as I described in
a review video not that long ago then
I'm going to be popping on some of my
favorite false lashes these are my Koko
lashes number 201 and I will link below
to my full false lash tutorial if you
need some extra tips
this is the elf contouring blush and
bronzer powder I believe the shade of
Saint Lucia and I'm going to go into the
bronzer with my ELF complexion brush
that I use all the time and I'm gonna
give myself a light gentle cheek contour
here I'm feeling a little feisty this
morning because I actually got a full
night's sleep without anyone waking me
up last night
no babies woke me up no snoring men woke
me up guys they feel pretty good about
it and I got myself one of the super
cute Pioneer Woman coffee mug because
last time I was at Walmart so my coffees
tastes an extra good this morning gonna
go around the hairline with this as well
I'm all about the gentle contour these
days I'm just you know keeping it light
keeping it easy I forgot how much I love
this I mean clearly I loved it because I
completely hit pan on this but I'm gonna
be digging into my other shades of this
that I got as well I think and I'm gonna
use the blush in here as well because I
just think it's a perfect kind of
neutral type tone for what I'm going
with today you don't like the soft
Pink's here and my shirt I'm kind of
wanting to pull that out in my blush and
maybe the lip color too this blush is
kind of glowy and I'm gonna just dip
into that with my open up blush brush
and just start applying there on the
outer part of the apple of the cheek
beautiful I just love putting on blush
mmm for the lip color I might do kind of
a mixie thing here I've got my double
ended by lipstick with date and fig as
you can see fig is more pinky I don't
know that I want to go quite that pink
so I'm gonna put date on first and just
go from there this these are the
luminous cream lipsticks I believe they
still sell this duo which is a great duo
to has
dang I mean date just might be the
perfect amount of color actually I don't
know that I want to even go more than
that I really like that now there are
two kinds of buns in my world this kind
of bun which was thrown up with no
effort and then there's the kind where I
really like try to neaten it up so I'm
gonna go neaten it up and I'm gonna come
back let's be real the hair is probably
dirty enough today to stay up in a bun
on its own - clip but guys this is the
finished look I think this is one of my
favorite looks that I've done with this
palette just because I think it utilized
some unique shades I really love penny
as you know even though that didn't
really get a starring role in this look
I mean it's definitely like Supporting
Actress in a comedy for sure and then
olivine I think is just like awesome
love that using that with forest is
definitely a must-try thing but this
brush I mean it made it so easy and I'm
gonna like work this into other looks so
I don't know so you can continue to see
this in action I'll keep using this
because I really love extending my
shadow outward like that but sometimes
you know brushes can just be a little
large for the task so I think this is
really perfect but thank you guys so
much for watching be on the lookout for
lots of new tutorials and reviews coming
soon and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
