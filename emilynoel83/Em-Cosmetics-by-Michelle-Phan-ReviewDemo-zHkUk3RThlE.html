for what has been one of my most
requested videos recently and it's a
review on the products I've tried from M
cosmetics in case you're not familiar
this brand launched fairly recently and
it is by Michelle Phan who is of course
a popular youtuber who has kind of gone
the route of creating her own makeup
line I believe this is under the
umbrella of L'Oreal a judging by the
price points of these products it's
definitely a high-end makeup line I have
products for eyes lips and face as well
as a large palette and the price range
of all those things go from about
sixteen fifty to seventy-five dollars so
in this video I'll be reviewing all the
products I have including the life
palette that's a big one that I've had
questions about lately to have swatches
demos of course my review this is not a
first impressions video I wanted to make
sure I gave you a really thorough
educated review after trying these
products for several weeks so since it
has been a few weeks since these
products have been out a lot of great
questions have been coming my way a
couple of the main things people wanted
me to touch on in this video were the
cost of the products and whether or not
I feel that they are worth that price
and also just lots of questions about
that big life palette so I will
definitely show you that as well I would
just like to say congrats to Michelle
for coming so far I mean starting on
YouTube and accomplishing so many things
creating a makeup line and just having
the courage to put yourself out there
obviously it's one thing to put yourself
out there on YouTube but then to create
a product and really put it out for the
world to see and try I think that takes
a lot of guts so props to you Michelle
for doing this and I was sent these
products for review from the company
however as always that does not affect
my reviews this is going to be the
normal unbiased honest review you've
come to expect from me the first thing
that I kind of worked into my routine
today is the contouring and highlighting
stick and this has a really unique name
I hope I say it right charros Kuro and I
have it in the shade medium so basically
what you have here is kind of like a
double-ended lipstick
basically you've got your highlight
on one end and your contouring stick on
the other very compact product really
you know travel friendly size-wise there
and to apply it I basically just drew it
on my face you know I took the
contouring stick first and I drew that
kind of right in the hollows of my
cheeks I also went down the sides of my
nose with that I went a little bit
around the forehead as well and I
blended it out with my ELF small stipple
brush I love the light amount of
pressure that applies so it doesn't mess
up the foundation you've got underneath
and I just went around with the
highlight in the areas I would normally
put it kind of on the cheekbones down
the nose brow bones that sort of thing
and this highlights interesting maybe
it's because this is in the shade medium
but this isn't like your typical
shimmery champagne highlight this is a
very I guess warm sunny sort of
highlight it's got a little depth to it
but it's still glowy and shimmery and I
still think it works as a highlight for
and it does look quite natural I don't
think it comes across as being overly
metallic and something I may not have
mentioned about the contouring side is
that that is meant that it does not have
any shimmer in it when I was first
trying this a few weeks ago the first
thing I noticed about it was the texture
of this this is definitely not just a
cream product but it goes on your skin
with sort of a cream to powder texture
which i think is really perfect for
something that you're going to be
putting that's a cream when you're going
on top of a foundation I love how it
blends out and kind of a silky web
doesn't maintain any sort of doing this
on top of the skin I personally don't
really like it when cream products do
the cost on this is $25 and I got to say
I would buy this it's a two-in-one
product it's a really unique formula
from a lot of the cream sticks and
things like that that I've tried it
blends well it gives me the effect that
I want from a contour so I give this a
thumbs X product is the makeup mood
enhancer it says illuminating skin
filter so this is a product that comes
with a little pump here and the shade
that I have it in is golden candle light
this is also a $25 Prada this is the
type of thing you could mix in with your
foundation or your moisturizer if you
want it to have more of a glowy
appearance or you can just apply it on
top it has a nice amount of
I mean it's not something that looks
completely opaque and metallic you know
it's got a Sheerness to it and the
shimmer is very very fine and I think
very wearable the way I like to use it
as I pump out a little bit on my hand
and again I grab my small stipple brush
which is just a godsend for any sort of
cream or liquid type blush or highlight
or country get a little bit on that
brush and apply it on my cheeks I've got
to say I feel like it goes on kind of
subtle like when I'm here say in front
of my makeup mirror I feel like oh that
doesn't seem like there's that much on
and then you go out you see yourself in
the sunlight and it really shows up and
catches the natural light a lot more
you're familiar with benefits high beam
and Sun beam this seems kind of like a
cross between those two shades this
golden candle light color though this
gives are really pretty glow I don't
personally see this as a must-have for
me I feel like there are a lot of other
things on the market that are similar to
this even from brands like elf they have
something called the shimmering facial
whip which reminds me a lot of this type
of a product where it's that liquid
shimmer you can blend it in with other
things not a bad concept I just don't
find it to be all that unique or worth
the 25 dollars for me I also have a
lipstick and from what I've seen
browsing the site there are several
different like formulations that she has
this one that I have is the creamy color
classic lipstick shade here is misty ma
I did apply this for my look today I
have a little gloss on top of it now so
I noticed when I put it on it goes on
very smooth and really does give you
nice full color in pretty much one sweep
around your lips it might smell just
slightly sweet I don't notice anything
objectionable about this judging the
formula it has pretty good staying power
I mean it can get me through an entire
morning without feeling the need to
touch up and I don't feel like it's
overly drying so a good combination
there think to even drugstore brands
that I've tried like the Milani color
statement lipsticks or the Revlon Super
Lustrous
those are some fabulous formulas as well
that go on with full color in one step
and seem to have the very comparable
feel and staying power so it's a nice
product it's not probably something I
would splurge on okay next up we're
going to talk about the much-anticipated
life palette and these come in several
different forms the one I have here is
is the career life palette so you're
going to notice when we get into some
up-close shots that there's a lot of
neutral everyday type of colors and here
take a look at the palette I think you
can kind of see that there are four
different total looks basically in here
and with the palette you get kind of a
guide on how to use those so the four
different looks our power-suit girl and
charged out to lunch and natural talent
so if you're confused on how to use any
of the shades it gives you just a little
face chart on each one of those so I
just want to point out this palette
comes with a couple of tools it comes
with a small eyeshadow brush and an
angled brush on the other end you'll see
this used in the demo that I did and
also a little tool here where you're
actually able to poke out or kind of
pick up the shadows out of this palette
and I don't have it it didn't come with
what was sent to me but I believe this
is sold with just a small blank palette
that would hold the amount of one of
these quadrants so does that make sense
you can pick out then any of these
shades put together your own
configuration and take it on the go like
you're kind of deep potting them they're
all magnetized in here they're all named
and all the names are on the back of all
the products so in each of these
sections you've got a blush you've got
one two three four five six eyes shadows
and two lip colors it seems like in each
of the segments one of the lip colors is
more of like just a lipstick in a pan
and the other is more of a glossy form
you know part of the kit that I'm
wearing today are these purples I
actually used the pink blush I used this
kind of lilac shade all over my lid put
on a little bit of the deeper purple
shade on the outer part of my lid and
into the crease and then took the dark
plum for just a little added contrast
there in the crease as well and under
the eye and I use this pearly shade as
my highlight and used it to highlight my
inner corner also so this palette the
little tools that came in here and a
little blank palette that basically
holds a quarter of this palette that's
all $75 sometimes when I'm formulating
reviews on something it helps me to put
together like a little pros and con
list so that's what I've done for this
video and I just thought I'd share that
with you just my observations as I've
used this as far as the pros are the
positive points about this palette I
think it is cool that there's multiple
looks you know you're definitely getting
four fairly distinct different looks in
this palette also I like that there's a
combination of matte and shimmer in all
of the segments some shades are more
frosty some are just entirely you know
typical matte shades so that's nice
maybe being the makeup obsessed person I
am I also like the idea of the custom
compact no I don't have that here to
show you today but I like the thought
that I can go in with this little pick I
can pop out the different shades that I
want I can make my own you know little
to go palette basically I think that's
pretty cool too my favorite part of this
palette I do really like this segment
down here that I said contains some
really nice matte shades there's a nice
kind of rosy undertone with everything
that's going on I think that's a really
nice chunk of this pass bars the cons
for this palette just constructionwise
whenever you've got a big palette and
you're combining not just eyeshadows but
cheek products and lip products there's
the issue of the fallout from those
products getting into one and I will say
that these shadows don't have a great
deal of Fallout but nonetheless you've
got you know some very dark shadows
right next to your blush and I have had
you know little bitty particles in there
that just had to kind of like blow on
the palate basically and get those
particles off so I don't have some sort
of black streak going into my blush you
know and I'm kind of the tricky thing
while there's a ton packed into this
palette you've got everything very close
together and also of course with lip
products any bit of powder particles
which I've already noticed you know have
gotten into a couple of these lip color
another con that I noticed what this is
sort of the hit and miss pigmentation of
some of these shadows I think I came
into this with very high hopes watching
this with other palettes on the brain
like you know urban decay and the balm
I'm thinking of how soft and kind of
creamy and velvety smooth and super
pigmented those shadows are and then i
swatched these and i was a little let
down by the amount of payoff they really
had
I noticed across the board quite a bit a
sheerness with a lot of the colors do
seem to perform better on top of a
primer on the eyes than they do just dry
which is the case for a lot of different
eye shadows and shadows were giving me
what I wanted others not so much and I
had to kind of go back and even as I was
applying them on my eyes layer on a
little more product to build up to the
intensity that I wanted I don't think it
really competes pigmentation wise
intensity wise with brands like the balm
Urban Decay lorac some of those high-end
brands that really have buttery smooth
velvety rich eyeshadows
you
my bottom line is that I think it's an
interesting concept I like the thought I
like the theory behind having one big
pallet and then building your own
smaller pallet that you can take with
you using these you're really
trying these products on my eyes lips
and cheeks really wearing all these
various looks not just swatching but
just don't feel like I would spend 75
bucks on it because outside of the
concept I don't think the quality of the
individual products are just that unique
and amazing I really do like the lip
colors that were chosen in here by the
way but again it's kind of a shame that
they're in there amongst the powder
products then you're getting powder on
the lip products and you heard that will
speak a couple of other things to
mention one is the water liner intense
color eyeliner I have this in black
night so I've used this quite a bit I've
used it on my upper lash line I've used
it in the waterline which you are
advised that you can put it in your
waterline and it's supposed to have
really good staying power and I've gotta
say it truly does there are liners that
go on more silky smooth than this but
I've said this before about eyeliners
sometimes the ones that are just a touch
drier somehow they cling better to that
waterline and it glides on easily enough
it lasts me through pretty much an
entire day with just a little wear down
in the outer corner that's normally
where things in my waterline start to go
south is just on the outside but for the
most part it really lasts well there on
the waterline and it doesn't seem to
lose any intensity of the blackness you
know on my upper lash line either I
really don't have any complaints about
this I also felt zero sensitivity with
my eye you know sometimes you put
something on your waterline it's almost
like a I don't know if it's a few more
some maybe fragrance in the product but
it can kind of you feel like something's
there this really seems like nothing is
there if you've tried a ton of different
eyeliners particularly for the waterline
and just haven't found something that
worked really well this might be worth a
shot
product is the color facets and it's a
sparkling shadow topcoat in the shade of
celestial sparkle so this is like a
loose pigment it's got a different
packaging a trick in here that's unlike
anything I've seen it's kind of like a
getting almost going across the top just
a small amount of the product out you
have some pigments you will swatch and
there's almost a creaminess to it like
the product really hangs together almost
like it is being binded together
somewhat this is very loose and dusty
and like airy and sheer so I just dabbed
a little bit like just a tiny bit on top
of my I love you like there are powder
shadows that give you that little bit of
shimmer and sparkle that you could put
on and they would be pressed and they
would maybe be within another palette
you wouldn't need to grab for this I
feel like the thought of a shadow
topcoat is kind of a bit of a gimmicky
idea and I think you know you could just
put a sparkly shadow there and you would
have what you need so not really a
must-have product for me okay so that's
everything I've tried from em cosmetics
my top two products are probably this
stick the highlight contour stick I
really like that I think it's unique
formula went on very very easily blended
in like nothing I mean it was really
really great and I was pretty pleased
with this eyeliner as well something
that can stay in the waterline sometimes
that's pretty hard to find and this was
a nice black really didn't lose much
intensity over the course of an entire
day which is pretty impressive things
that for me were just kind of like I
don't really think I'm going to use this
type of thing very much as the makeup
mood enhancer that shimmery liquid and
also the color facets sparkling top coat
those were just things where I think if
you've got a good highlighter you've got
a good Sparkle a shadow you like you
know you may not really need something
like that lipstick was nice quality but
again there are many nice quality
lipsticks out there for lower price
points and again you heard my whole talk
on the life palette but I mean good
concept good theory just not quite the
execution I expect so thanks so much for
watching guys hope you have a great day
and I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
