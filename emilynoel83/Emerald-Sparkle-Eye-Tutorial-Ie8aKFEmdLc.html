insurance and then I'm going to my Sonia
Kashuk I on dazzling palette and I'm
going to use this pearly white shade
here with a flat brush and I'm just
going to dab that over the inner corner
and pretty much go all over the lid with
this next I'm going to use that same
shade with a fluffy brush and go up
under my eyebrow just to get more of a
light wash of color there's a highlight
then I'm going to this light brown shade
right here going to pick up a little bit
of that on my crease brush and I'm just
going to apply this lightly in the
crease just for a little bit of
dimension there then I'm just taking a
small flat brush so I have some control
over exactly where this goes but I'm
going to go to this pretty satin finish
green that on the outer part of my
lid it comes off is just kind of a dark
like all of the green shade to make sure
it's kind of seamlessly blended you can
take a little bit more the pearly white
shade and just dust over the board so
I'm going to do a thick line of some
liquid liner i'm using swing by the bomb
any nice rich black liquid liner will do
making this kind of a thick line because
this black will be the base sort of to
our glitter so go maybe a little thicker
than you might normally i am going to
wing it out just a little bit so i'm
just extending my line straight out
connecting it from the corner and then
filling in that little gap next I'm
going to just finish off the rest of the
liner here i'm using this NYX slide on
liner in tropical green and that's
actually going to be in our water line
so just a subtle way to kind of add to
the green in this look and really finish
it off you'll see the green in the look
really starting with the glue
then i'm applying just a little bit of
that out here in the outer corner and
connecting that to my wind going back to
the green here with an angled liner
brush and I'm just going to get that all
under the lower lash line here so the
glitter is going to be our very last
step so before that i'm going to apply
some false eyelashes here they're kind
of a natural said just going to add
those really really close it's very
important to get these right up next to
your lash line even though you've got
that thick liner that can kind of mask
the band you still want it to be really
really close so that way the glitter
will still have that base of black I
think that's what gives the look
definition yet that little bit of
sparkle now for the glitter I'm taking
this really pretty emerald green glitter
and this could be pretty beyond the
holidays because I believe this color is
the next pantone shade of the year or
whatever but this is I drama glitter
liquid liner from fem couture I got this
at sally beauty supply I'm going to take
this from inner to all all the way
through that wing there you can see
there's glitter all throughout that so
I'm going to go on top of the black here
I've tried some glitter liners where the
glitter is really like I want to say
watered down but it just you know
doesn't have a lot of punch to it and
this I feel like really does show up
after you put it on could go over this
with like another coat of the glitter if
you want even more sport including that
wing I am going to finish this off with
just one more little bit of mascara over
those lashes just to make sure
everything's bonded together and these
are the outrageous this is the
outrageous volume mascara from sephora i
actually had a smaller size of this and
I kind of liked it but it didn't last me
very long so I wanted to try some more
and i'm using a little bit of Maybelline
lash discovery mascara on my
or lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
