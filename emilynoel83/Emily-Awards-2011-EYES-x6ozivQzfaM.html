to pass along a bunch of different
all-star products eyeshadow eyeliner
mascara eyeshadow eyeliner mascara
eyeshadow my wife mmm an ass akira I
shadows eyeliner mascara hey everyone
hope you're having a great day you're
joining me now for part two of the emily
awards for 2011 so a look at my favorite
products or the past year part 1 was
face so you can link to that if you want
to see like what my favorite foundations
and powders and blushes and things like
that were but this one's going to be all
about eyes so this is going to be things
like primers and shadows liners mascara
isn't that sort of thing and we've got
some long-running winners in this group
and we've got some brand new things that
have come onto the scene here lately so
this is kind of exciting emily awards
have been going on for four years now so
if you see me looking down i am looking
to see if these certain products if I've
had them down as winners in years past
in the face video every all my face
products were Emily Award winners in
terms of like foundation blush etc and
for this one all the I stuff I have on
is an award-winning product in this
video as well
just start out talking about I primer
and my high-end favorite is favorite
three years running and it's two faced
shadow insurance I really really like
this product because overall when you
put a primer on it boosts the look of
your eye shadow so it can give your eye
shadow a little more intensity but it
also helps it last and I love with Too
Faced how you can put it on and it it
doesn't give you any added moisture even
though this will squeeze out if here is
a creamy product it doesn't add any
added oiliness or anything like that to
your lids which i think is really
important from the drugstore I love NYX
HD I shadow base this also gives really
good staying power and another kind of
dual purpose that this has that kind of
made it over take Palladio herbal I
shadow primer which was last year's
favorite is it I feel like when you put
this one on it actually can neutralize
the color of your lid a little bit
better so instead of just being sort of
a transparent product you put on this
will kind of mask little imperfections
and then you put your eye shadow on top
of it it's just a really clean base
shadows can often be seen as kind of a
primer type product in itself a lot of
people will use cream shadows its basis
for just regular powder shadows but my
two favorite and definitely be used on
their own if you don't want to top them
with it with a shadow they will still
have really good staying power high-end
favorite is from malli and it's the ever
color shadows stay calm and some
beautiful finishes so you'll get some
great shimmery colors some metallic
colors as well time to blend with them
but once they set you can really run
your hand across them and they aren't
going anywhere I've had this light
champagne color in the corner of my eye
to add some brightness fair that doesn't
go anywhere until I take it off at the
end of the day and I also love the stick
format because you can take the deeper
shades and wear them is like a smudgy
liner and it's just really easy to do
that you don't need any added brushes
and that's kind of what I wish would
happen for my drugstore favorite I would
love to see the maybelline color tattoos
in stick form but they still are my
favorite drugstore cream shadow because
finally something long wearing
had so many brands that are putting out
jumbo sticks and things like that and
it's all good if you plan to layer a
powder over them but the color tattoos
and this is a pretty bronze shade that
I'm showing you now they do have some
good saturation they may fade a little
bit as the day goes on but they don't
crease at least I have an experience
creasing with I don't have many high-end
trios and quads and so I just of what I
do have I don't consider it an absolute
favorite so as always I'm not just going
to name something for the sake of having
something in the category I do have to
drug store trios and quads which you
know i love that i want to give a little
recognition to one has one for this is a
three-time winner so this is huge and
this is a product that i tell you on
those quick days where i need to get
ready really fast and I need a look
that's going to look good with pretty
much anything I'm wearing I love this I
also love this for the ultimate smoky
eye as well and it's the cover girl
drama I squad I so enjoy this you're
getting a white deep deep black a silver
and a burgundy something about that
burgundy gives this brings this to a
whole new level outside of your normal
gray and silver smokey eye kids because
you can warm up your shadow you can
blend that out just kind of a little bit
towards your towards your brow bone and
it just gives it a whole new look so I
love this the quality of covergirl
shadows in these quads and trios it's
really good another outstanding trio is
from wet and wild and it's called silent
treatment and this is what I'm wearing
today so this is kind of you know taupe
and a really deep kind of shimmery color
and also a peach that can be a nice
highlight so I'm wearing them kind of
like that this on the lid this and the
crease and this on the brow bone and the
pigmentation of wet and wild shadows is
outstanding I love this as another kind
of daily use type type of trio they've
got some more fun colors but this is
just one of those that I think looks
good on all I colors in all situations
you can make it really dark and intense
want to
the favorite large pallet I have a lot
of high-end larger pallets because I
think they're a better value most of the
time than just getting the smaller
favorite this year and this has been
another like go to in the morning
getting ready for work I know whatever I
could possibly need eyeshadow wise it's
going to be in this bad boy and this is
the Smashbox photo op mega palette this
is a QVC item i believe it's exclusive
to QVC and last I checked yesterday it's
still on there but what this is and I
just realized I'm holding it upside down
but this is every trio Smashbox makes in
full size in a palette so not just
random shades thrown into a special
edition palette these are all the colors
that they actually make entry owes you
would find sold individually and the
photo op formulation which is a newly
reformulated thing for Smashbox
phenomenal so good so creamy not dealing
with fallout I like that you know you're
getting some color in here but most
things are pretty wearable and I would
wear any of that on the news so for me
personally it's a very wearable kit and
then in this middle panel you've got
even more things that aren't eyeshadow
but for the fact that you are getting so
many shadows i kind of consider it an
eyeshadow palette in my book and i
absolutely love it now we've got a
two-time winner for my favorite
drugstore large pallet and again i'm not
this isn't something you're going to
find in your drugstore unfortunately but
it is in that sort of lower-cost bracket
so that's why I call it drugstore and
it's the 36 smoky palette from Coastal
Scents one of my all-time favorite
Coastal Scents palettes because great
mix of neutrals and colors the colors
are super saturated I like that they're
also kind of separated into their own
groupings of six which makes it very
user-friendly it's also not a huge
palette so this is going to fit in my
makeup bag and when I want to take
something to travel I don't feel like
I'm taking something humongous so I also
like that for the Smashbox to they're
not too terribly big so I love both of
those pallets
what brand makes the best eyeshadows
that's kind of what I seek to answer
here with this category past for high
end it's interesting I had Smashbox
early on in my earliest years of doing
this back in two thousand eight Smashbox
was a winner then I had Smashbox in Mac
tied the next year the following years I
tried more mac i put mac on top this
year guess what it's the reformulated
smashbox shadows so early on i really
hadn't tried a lot of different high-end
shadows but i had tried some smashbox
and i loved it so I made it my favorite
you know now I mean I've tried a lot of
tried two faced Urban Decay all these
different ones now Smashbox comes out
with a bunch of reformulated I think
even improved shadows over what I had
back in the day back in these trios they
put them in these pallets and you can
also get them individually as well but
on the velvety softness of the shape i
feel like i like them better as a whole
than mac shadows because i've tried know
a decent amount of mac eyeshadows and i
do love some of them but I don't love
all of them and when I got this palette
and I was able to sample every Smashbox
shadow they're selling I love pretty
much all of them I mean there's nothing
bad to be said for any of them so it's
got to be my favorite I mean I just love
it for drugstore two years running my
favorite I'm going to grab a few more
here just to show you as examples is wet
and wild wet and wild is a wonderful
quality eyeshadow from the drugstore I
mean you can get them in sets of six you
can get some great trios like the line I
just talked about a little bit ago you
get them in sets of eight now too so
there's lots available there's great
variety in the color the color is super
pigmented it doesn't take much as of us
who love wet and wild we're probably
finding that we're not using them up all
that quickly because it doesn't take a
lot to get a good impact on your eye if
you're trying to save money and you want
to really expand your eyeshadow
collection what and while is a great
place to start
my favorite for high end is from malli
and it's the ever color automatic
waterproof liner these are seriously
super long-lasting I've determined this
line of liners to be the longest wearing
in the waterline I don't have any I
sensitivity issues with these either
they glide on really easily and I find
that the black the one called onyx is my
ultimate favorite I mean it's just so
deep and dark in the waterline you can
also wear it you know on your regular
lash line as well of course but I feel
like a real test of staying powers when
you put one of these in your inner rim
where it's constantly being exposed to
moisture so I also love the fact that
you don't have to sharpen these that's a
big plus for me that's something I
personally value in an eye liners the
drugstore there's Maybelline master
drama and these are also rather long
wearing and they're definitely one of
the longest wearing pencil liners that
I've tried from the drugstore they're
getting on that level with urban decay
and Mally you know with these really
long wearing liners so master drama is
one of those there's not a lot of color
variety with this line but they are
automatic and they do glide on super
easy they actually recently come out
with a brow product that my mom has
tried she really loves that but I like
the eyeliner pencils and then tied with
that for a drugstore liner is the NYX
slide on pencils but you do have to
sharpen these but the plus is that they
last a super long time again kind of on
the same page with urban decay and they
come in a lot of colors so um you can
get you know your bright blues or your
purples and greens and things like that
liquid eyeliner um I don't have a
high-end favorite I pride a few nothing
has really knock my socks off so it's
not going to be in this video but for
drug store this wood is four years
running it's still the best to me and
this year it had some competition and I
will just talk about that for a moment
here briefly Maybelline line stiletto I
love the sort of flexible end that that
eyeliner has but yet I feel like it
dries to a not totally matte black it
almost stays just the slightest bit
shiny and when I want just rich dark
black just gimme black and make it last
and don't let flake off revlon colorstay
blackest black liquid eyeliner you shake
it up it's got kind of that little
inkwell thing going on here and that's
the kind of chip you have it's like a
felt tip and you just draw it on very
basic but this there's a reason why this
is one for four years now and I love it
love the staying power love the richness
of the color and if you want black
liquid liner this is it
second year running its nag fluid line I
really enjoy my mac fluidline for the
fact that I've had this one for just
over a year now it's not even close to
being dry a lot of them do get dry a
little too quickly I think and this one
lieds on your I very easily it I don't
have staying power problems with it it's
very creamy it remains creamy even after
having it for some time so definitely
enjoy the mac fluidline and from the
drugstore I love the wet and wild cream
liner this may not lied on as easily as
mac but it still goes on pretty easy and
I mean if you got like a swatch of this
on your hand from wet and while I mean
it would not be going anywhere until you
got in there with some soap and you
started doing some scrubbing because I
love the richness of this black it goes
on very black it will last you through
some tears or I watering or whatever so
I'm big fan of that and the price you
just can't be
favorite mascara high-end this has
gotten raves throughout the year and
this is nalli volumizing mascara you put
this mascara on you do not get stiff
brittle you know like lashes that just
feel like they're little sticks poking
out of your eye they remain flexible
brush gives a nice amount of thickness
it's a traditional brush it's a super
black mascara and when you put that on I
feel like it's capable of grabbing even
your little lashes like if it's a day
I'm not gonna wear false eyelashes this
is one I feel like I can go to and put
on and be happy with it I can put it on
my lower lashes and it doesn't flake on
consider system must have my sister has
tried this and loves it i mean it is
just one of those mascaras that I feel
like you tell your friends about and you
get them on to it and they love it too
so I love Mally volumizing the drugstore
l made one coat get up and grow mascara
when this first got on my radar I didn't
quite know what to think of it I I've
had really good luck with all my
mascaras in terms of highlighting each
lash not clumping them together not
being too wet I mean I feel like across
the board they make a little bit drier
formula mascaras and this one has got to
be my favorite it gives me a very
similar effect to Malley's um the brush
is kind of big and it's a little bit I
don't know whether it's showing here but
it's a little bit of an hourglass shape
and I just love the thickness um talk
about highlighting all my lashes it does
that not sure if it's actually growing
my lashes making them longer thick or
whatever but just for the purpose of
being a great mascara to where I love
that
Warren false eyelashes so much
throughout the year I had to name a
favorite and there are a lot I really
like so this took some thinking and some
back and forth but what my favorite is
so what I'm wearing today I feel like
they are appropriate enough for everyday
but still dramatic enough for going out
there just kind of that happy medium and
they are from kiss and they are the 03 I
like that they're not too long I've
never had to trim these and they just
they also the bandwidth stands a lot of
where I don't know how many times I've
you know cleaned off the mascara peeled
off the the excess glue and what do you
know I'm wearing them again and again so
you can really maintain these lashes and
keep them looking nice and not all of
them I'm able to do that with favorite
brow product I don't have a high-end
favorite because I've really stuck with
my drugstore favorite since last year
and I haven't branched out a whole lot
so sorry for my lack of research here
but this is Maybelline define a brow
it's a very skinny skinny brow product I
showed this to my mom the other day she
was like wow that is tiny you know it's
a very slim pencil so if you're trying
to just fill in a few little areas my
shade is dark brown if you're wondering
with a little comb here so if you want
to comb back through them and make sure
everything looks completely natural you
can do that thanks for joining me for my
emily awards for eyes the next one will
be lips so that's always an exciting one
talking about lip glosses and lipsticks
and lip liners and everything so I have
so much fun making these videos i am
just thrilled with the feedback I've
gotten on the emily awards this year i'm
glad you're liking it and thank you so
much for taking the time to watch so
have a great day
