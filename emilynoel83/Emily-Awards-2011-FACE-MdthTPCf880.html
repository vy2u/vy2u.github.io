you my favorite most used products I
really love love love love love love
love things that make me pretty excited
things that I would recommend to you
people want to know what products are
really the best hi everybody thank you
so much for joining before the 4th
annual Emily Awards I can't believe this
has been going on for four years now
I've been picking my favorite products
of the year and I started back in 2008
thanks for bearing with me timewise for
how long this has taken me to put
together this year because I actually
put together a whole database on my
computer
showing the favorites I chose in years
past so I can keep track of what has won
multiple years and so it's just kind of
ridiculous how much has gone into this
and how much it's really grown back in
2008 I just had a very small group of
favorites and now it's grown to naming
favorites in both high-end and drug
store categories for every product it's
multiple videos it's really fun and
exciting for me to do and I hope you
enjoy it too so I want to let you know
that there will be a first ever anti
Emily awards at the end of all this
where I name least favorite products
because I know many of you tell me
that's just as important
really as naming a favorite product is
to know what things you might want to
avoid said this in years past as well
there are some categories that I just
don't have a favorite in and I'm not
just going to randomly name a favorite
just for the sake of having something to
talk about there because I think if it's
not truly a favorite thing it's not
worth mentioning here this is the
ultimate best things that I have tried
and you know I'm looking at years past
and nothing kind of just automatically
gets in just cuz it was a favorite last
year everything gets really waited
that's prime our high-end this is a
product that really a line of products
that has one for three years now and
this particular version of it has this
is the second year straight winning and
it is the Smashbox photo-finish light
primer I kind of discovered this light
formulation that is oil-free I realized
how much it improved the wear of my
foundation for the fact that it wasn't
weighing me down I feel like it didn't
make me oily throughout the day you can
put it on your t-zone no problem for
drugstore Rimmel fix and perfect Pro
this is a new version of fix imperfect
that came out this is not sort of a
creamy formulation goes on extremely
smooth not one of those super slick
primers I feel like once you blend it in
the texture of your skin feels so much
more even
I feel like staying power is improved I
feel like pore size is somewhat improved
with this product and I feel like it's a
definite improvement over the peach tone
original fix and perfect that came out
several years ago the first year I
actually have a winner
high-end foundation AK Pro Longwear
foundation this was something that I
remember when I first tried it right off
the bat I think I was using too much
product didn't love it right away as I
used it more and more and really got my
method down of you know blending it
using just the bare minimum amount of
product a very thin layer I love the
results I got because I thought the
coverage was fantastic so was the
staying power it was really even staying
power through all over my face which is
something I as one with combination skin
always looks for it you know does it
wear the same on my cheek as it does on
my nose and things like that so
drugstore favorite foundation this is
its second year winning Revlon Colorstay
this comes in two formulas you can get
it for combo to oily you can get it for
also normal to dry it has an SPF six in
it and the reason why I'm naming this a
favourite is because in really really
closely comparing this to some other
drugstore foundations that I love which
have been past winners like Rimmel
lasting finish and maybelline superstay
I love the fact that this is two
different skin types it comes in a great
range of shades
it also has wonderful cover
wonderful staying power and I referred
to this in my blog as just a real like
foundation game-changer because you can
apply this and mix this with other
foundations that might not be quite
performing well enough for you in terms
of staying power or coverage and you add
this to it you will get better coverage
and you will get better staying power
it's really kind of amazing about
mineral foundations now a great one this
is one that won last year as well it's
Mac mineralized skinfinish natural my
shade hair medium plus what I like about
this is I like that it's pressed first
off I think that makes it travel pen
friendly it makes it convenient the
finish on this is somewhat unique
because it's not quite as totally matte
as some other foundations on where this
lightly on top of liquid foundation for
a really nice perfected natural finish
or it can be worn a lot more since 2008
this is one for my drugstore mineral
foundation technically it's sort of like
an online brand that seems to be
equivalent with drugstore price everyday
minerals foundation I don't find myself
using mineral foundation as much as I
have in years past but when I think
about anything and new that I've tried
you know over this past year that has
had that mineral label on it has it been
better than everyday minerals and it has
not
I love everyday minerals for the fact
that it comes in multiple coverage
formulas get a lot of product other
things in this line like blushes have
been wonderful for me as well talking
about concealer now this was one of
these categories that had me going back
and forth and ultimately I had to ask
myself what concealer covers the best
it's got to tell you it is Laura Keller
the real deal concealer serious coverage
this is amazing for several reasons if
you've got any sort of problem if you've
got an age spot a Sun spot acne if
you've got under-eye circles even though
this isn't the classic salmon toned
concealer that I would talk about as
being great for under-eye circles this
is so full coverage it will mask any
issues you have and
I mean I don't know how many concealers
I can say that about and you only need a
tiny amount this might not look huge but
guys this is gonna last me a really long
time that I've already had this for
about a year it's incredible keeps a
natural finish on on the skin which is
very important for something that is so
full coverage laura geller has a
background in stage makeup she knows
what she's doing with this product and
it is just a fantastic full coverage
concealer there's a product that ties
with this that I think it's equally
important for coverage and I don't know
how many times in the past week alone I
have referred people to a video that I
have called full coverage concealer
trick and it features a product from
bare minerals called bisque I use summer
bisque it comes in varying shades
lighter and deeper but this is a bare
minerals product that you can use it's a
powder but it is a very full coverage
richly pigmented product that I feel can
go on top of any concealer and improve
the finish and the coverage level so I
have this I actually love this so much I
repurchased in the supersize from QVC
because I don't want to be without this
and I know how wonderful it can be not
only for really mattifying the area
under your eye and making that just
flawless coverage but around your nose
and other areas use it alone
use it on top of any other concealer no
matter how pitiful that concealer might
be it will improve it and it will make
it much much better cover in terms of
drugstore concealers we've got a couple
of new ones this year it is Revlon
Photoready this is a stick concealer but
it is probably the creamiest stick
concealer you will find that gives you
the least cakey coverage for under-eye
circles and any other imperfections
around the skin it's one of the few
photo-ready labelled products from the
Revlon's brand that does not have
Sparkle and glitter
new category of press powder while I do
not have a high-end favorite this year I
do have a drugstore favorite which has
been a favorite once in 2009
this is l'oreal true match powder
everything i love about this is the
coverage it gives I feel like it's
practically on the verge of being a
powder foundation comes in lots of
shades I like that it's can be a
touch-up product but it can be something
that you just swear on top of some
concealer and have wonderful coverage
with
and consider this to be a foundation
just in powder form and for high-end
thing I love so much or a Geller's
balance and Brighton I love this for the
fact that this product actually begins
as a cream it is swirled with various
pigments and various colors so it's very
corrective very forgiving on the skin
but once it's baked you know it becomes
this powder Laura Keller's baked
products will last you so long you're
not going to believe it it's a
tremendous value it's great coverage if
you're wanting extreme coverage put this
on top of a liquid foundation and you
will not believe the flawless quality of
your switch drugstore I've got to give
it up this year for Milani multitasker
face powder definitely a lot of coverage
with this product I have it here in
medium you can use this apply it with a
brush apply it with a sponge just
whatever you do don't apply it with a
very heavy hand because you will build
up a lot of coverage very quickly with
this but I still think it's great if you
have oily skin and you want something
that can really tackle that kind of
problem for you this is a great powder
for that
it's second time winning and it is two
faced chocolate soleil bronzer a matte
bronzer so no shimmer to it I feel like
it can be a great contour use it lightly
with a fluffy brush all over your face
to really perk up your skintone smells
like chocolate it is awesome I've loved
that and talked about that so much store
bronzer I've got several that I like and
the reason why I'm picking this
particular one which I picked last year
as a favorite is because it comes in a
couple of finishes depending on what you
like and it is the Rimmel natural
bronzer comes in Sundance which has a
little bit of shimmer to it or sunlight
which is totally matte I've heard from a
lot of people who say I have very fair
skin what's a bronzer that works for me
I would definitely shoot you in this
direction NYC sunny is great as well but
for the fact that sometimes people do
want that little bit of glow in their
bronzer I'm recommending rebel brand new
category this year for Best contour
everything I do every day just to give
my face a little more dimension
sometimes it's just under my cheekbones
but usually under the jaw as well a
little bit around the forehead I think
contouring is just something you can
totally use to your advantage to sculpt
you're facing that I love for that this
year is the it cosmetics my sculpted
face palette so this would be a high-end
product here this is just a wonderful
thing to have in your makeup arsenal
because you have four different matte
contour powders so depending on what
your skin tone is and if you're a makeup
artist this is so cool to have all these
powders just right at your fingertips
depending on what skin tone you're
working with but I will use like between
these two shades to contour various
places on my skin and then you get two
highlights one is matte and one is
shimmery so it's everything you need
plus a total guide to take you through
exactly how to do it so it's a very
educational product it's wonderful
wonderful thing
high-end blushes love the Maui blushes
absolutely this is the effortless
airbrush version I talked about this in
my Malley one brand tutorial but you put
your finger on it you can kind of press
down on it it's not like the Maybelline
bouncy blushes this is more of a powder
but it's a hybrid cream powder product
and you apply it with a brush and it's
just gorgeous on it does not look like
powder on top of your skin it looks like
beautiful coral color so that's
effortless airbrush and I also love just
my single blush that I have in Mally's
glow this is a gorgeous pink that I'm
wearing today so I love something that
has emerged is a great favorite product
over the past year is from Milani and it
is the baked blush it's not been many
brands that have come out with such a
phenomenal range of colors not just
different colors but different colors
that would work for a really deep skin
tone and a really light skin tone as
well it's so many gorgeous kind of
squirrel's of colors here and it kind of
reminds me you know the Laura Geller
type thing but Milani is doing it and
they're doing it for a very good price
as well this is coralina that's great
blush if you've got darker skin how
about this blush in red vino I mean it's
just they're all beautiful and this is a
back-to-back winner and it's back to
Maui for this because I love her cream
blush system that actually pairs a cream
blush with a powder blush the act of
layering cream and powder I mean many of
us do that anyway it's very convenient
to have coordinating colors together so
this is a 24/7 professional blush and
you just put on the cream which blends
extremely easily on top of any other
makeup you have on and then you top it
with the powder it locks in it lasts all
day trust me I am looking at staying
power so closely with many of these
products from the drugstore and there
have been rumors that this is being
discontinued I'm still finding it in my
stores I'm still finding it on the
Maybelline website if this is being
discontinued I suggest picking up
whatever you can find in the store lean
dream mousse blush the texture on this
is so fantastic
this gives off a lot of color it's nice
and whipped and light it blends
effortlessly on top of your foundations
your powders your bronzers whatever
pigmented beautiful color
I love multiple shades there from the
peaches to the Pink's to the plums which
I have here so definitely if you can
find those still in your stores
maybelline dream mousse blush I felt the
need to mention that because it is a
true favorite of mine I an highlight I
got this last year around Christmas time
and it's truly an awesome highlight
product for being something that can
brighten the skin without making it too
shimmery and shiny I have it on now it's
the lorac perfect perfectly lit powder
in spotlight I have the mini I'm still
because it only takes a little bit of
this I'm not close to using this up but
I went ahead and bought the full size
anyway because I just think it's that
good too shimmery shiny but it can still
give your face a little bit of glow and
actually if you can believe it just a
little bit of coverage it's like it
covers as it brightens its gory a lot of
my drugstore favorites are just a great
product in their own right but I found
myself looking for a dupe for the lorac
because I loved it so much this is
really really close and this has emerged
as my favorite drugstore highlight
because again it's a highlight without
packing on sparkle from Physicians
Formula it's the happy booster in
translucent so you can call it
translucent but I mean it just has that
little bit of pearly glow and once you
put it on it is very subtle when applied
with a brush that swatch was a little
more opaque but you know what I mean
it's very very natural highlighting
for a finishing product and really a
touch-up product and it's brand new and
so different and something I use all the
time is my malli poreless face defender
I use this with the sponge that comes
with it so I'll put take my sponge go
like that dab it on my face everything
is instantly even mattified really
looking fresh something I use right
before the newscast and I love the even
satin finish this gives it's a clear
product it's really unusual but I
considered this to be something that you
can layer on top of make up time and
time again without adding weight and
adding visible makeup on top of makeup
you've already applied so thank you so
much for joining me for part one of the
Emily awards for 2011 you also for
supporting beauty broadcast so much
throughout the past year needs a lot to
me this is my passion I love making
these videos and I'm just thrilled that
you enjoy watching them as well so have
a wonderful day and I'll talk to you
