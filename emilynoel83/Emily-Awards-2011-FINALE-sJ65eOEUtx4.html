the 2011 Emily Awards finale time finale
time so now it's finale finale time I
was like hi guys welcome to the 2011
Emily Awards finale videos going to be
such a fun video because this is a lot
of those categories that many of you
have been asking about I've been
noticing in the comments section
throughout my other videos you know are
you gonna share some favorites for
skincare and nails and body products and
hair and things like that and so all
that kind of thing including some most
valuable products will be included in
this video and after this I am still
planning to do kind of a 2011 product
fails or anti awards or I'm not quite
sure what I'm going to call it but
you'll know it when you see it I'm just
products that did not work for me over
the past year so let's get started
my first category here is best brushes
and I've got favorite that is definitely
repeating for the third time here and
I'm really happy because this shows like
for the past three years that I've had
this very same kit from Sigma the
complete kit it has held up it's
survived multiple washings and so many
uses on a daily basis and it's just I
feel like the right collection of
brushes just a great collection to have
and I love it with this brush once the
powder brush everyday powder bronzer
things like that love this is a contour
brush and I'll also sometimes use that
for blood total must-have here just kind
of a flat brush to pack on your
eyeshadow in super love this blending
brush another super favorite is the
pencil brush this is just wonderful I
love using that to smudge products you
know under my lower lash line and it's a
great angle brush as well that you can
use for some of your cream products I
have the premium kit but I still feel
like the complete kit is just the right
brushes you know the brushes I will use
and put to use a damn for drugstore
brushes I've got to mention again this
was one that I chose as a favourite last
year and any time someone asked me it
says you know I want brushes but I want
them from the drugstore I always think
about eco tools it is the first thing
that pops into my life so comes with a
little brush holder but I kind of keep
these out handy in my brush container
here so I can use them but this is like
the mineral brush kit and these are also
super soft they feel so good there's a
great retractable brush from Ecotools
that I've blogged about they've got some
adorable like little short kabuki
brushes now that have these kind of
colorful design handles on them the
quality is just superior
for outstanding tool talk about it
underrated untalked about product from
me I mean I don't think I ever really
mention that I truly use them every
single day as I get rid these are min
tweezers I have this pair here this is
just kind of a classic set of tweezers
here from tweezer Minh these are light
pink I believe I got them from Sally
Beauty Supply and I'm pretty sure
there's some kind of policy where you
can send these in to be sharpened for
free
not totally sure I'm sure somebody can
clarify that down in the comments
section I haven't even sharpened these
and I just feel like they're perfect in
that they meet exactly right there at
the tip you know they are totally
together you can find any little bitty
you know just starting to become a hair
hair and pull it out no profit first
things I do after I moisturize I go
through and I pluck stray hairs you know
it's just part of my routine and these
have been wonderful never had to
repurchase and other pair of tweezers or
men's these are the only ones I have and
I'll probably continue to have these for
a real long time most innovative product
I gotta say I saw this one coming a mile
away
it's the Mallee poreless face defender
this is that clear product that you can
use with a sponge and I know I've shown
this several times but I put the sponge
in there and I twist I make sure I'm
getting some of this clear product and
then I use this to mattify basically in
my face and I don't feel like it's
overly like unnaturally matte I would
actually call it more of maybe like a
satin finish but I feel like Here I am
at the end of the day you know I have
not touched up my makeup since doing the
newscast and I just feel like this is
kind of taking care of those slightly
shiny area putting on something clear or
something virtually undetectable on your
skin but yet it changes the appearance
of the skin and makes it look more
refreshed
whereas loading on more and more powder
becomes more and more
I've got to point out this product right
here that it's been sitting back behind
me for many of my recent videos I got
this for Christmas this is the two-faced
sweet dreams palette and it's just one
of those things that becomes a part of
your room or wherever you're storing
your makeup because just stacking this
away is no fun this really looks like
kind of a frame basically like a framed
picture framed portrait and then when
you open it up you know you've got all
your eyeshadows you've got a great
mirror it's still adorable you know
every square inch of this product has
been covered in some sort of
illustration and then it's got that neat
little pullout drawer and you've got
your face products here I like that they
didn't jam in some lip products or
anything like that but they kept it all
you know that powder consistency and
then something else cool that Too Faced
does with their packaging is they've got
a little flap here that's holding down
some cards that show suggested looks
are the award for what needs to go in
your purse with this whole finale
actually I've been thinking about what
things have possibly gone under the
radar that are such must-haves I don't
even hardly think about them you know
what I mean like the tweezers I thought
you know that is such a must-have of
mine if I didn't have that like I'd be
freaking out if I was traveling and
forgot that and another thing that kind
of comes into that category or q-tips
and this is actually a little q-tip
actual q-tip case here and you can
usually find this in with the travel
stuff you know at your drugstore
wherever and comes in this little tray
and tada there's you're cute too and I
was interviewed by the New York Times
recently which is was an amazing
thrilling honor but and the topic was
like makeup on the go what do you take
with you truth is I don't take a lot of
things with me like I'll take my lip
product with me and a mirror but also
I'll have q-tips always because it's not
just about adding more makeup as you
touch up but touching up can really mean
taking away I would definitely be going
under my eye area taking care of any
smudges there you can also use these to
kind of go around your lip line if you
feel like you've got creasing and your
concealer around your eye I love using
q-tips to actually block that area right
after I apply concealer and pick up
excess product if you need to replan
something if you want to smoke out liner
that started out you know more precise
and then at the end of the day you want
to smudge it's just so many uses guys
for a q-tip and it's a simple thing and
it's a cheap thing
now we're getting into the most valuable
products MVPs and I have an MVP for face
eyes and lips and so for face after some
consideration I thought about what thing
is just really changed my world this
year and it was the Laura Geller real
deal concealer there's a lot of product
and it only takes a teeny bit to make a
difference on your face this was the
only concealer I had I'd be okay because
I can use this for under eyes just as
well as I can use it on my broken
capillaries around my nose around you
know a sunspot a zit you name it it
really goes on and it really covered
without having to layer on tons and tons
is the first time any most valuable
product has repeated the wet and wild
color icon shadow and again it's coming
in a lot of forms these days you know
you can get these fantastic five dollar
eight pan palettes and you know
wonderful trios and things like this
some colorful shades some neutrals
something that those of us who have been
using makeup for some time now can
appreciate is how this brand and how
drugstore makeup and drugstore eyeshadow
as a whole has evolved you know we've
got things now that we totally didn't
come close to quality-wise ten years ago
or more so I mean I love the fact that
you can go into your drugstore and you
can find a palette here that might
contain you know three or four Mac dupe
eyeshadows that are gonna go on just as
rich as you please and it's my hope that
they just continue to build on this you
know don't change the formula continue
to give us more great colors that kind
of thing because this is a loved product
in the makeup community not just by me
but for many of the rest of you as well
okay there's no I love so many of my lip
products in my last video but I'm giving
it to Revlon lip butters because of the
multi-purpose function that they have
the fact that you put them on they go on
easy they go on smooth they look a
little bit shiny
they're very packed with color the shade
selection I remember being really
impressed with that when I saw my first
display because normally sometimes these
new product launches it's like okay here
are my five to choose from but there was
a nice spread of colors I mean I'm
wearing one of these today this is one
of my favorites in sweet tart nice
bright pink check that's there
you got creme brulee it's kind of a
lighter option red velvet a gorgeous
kind of deep red so I think anybody
looking to experiment with a new lip
color can find a lip butter that's
probably gonna suit their needs and they
just feel so good on the lips I really
really love these things and I have
built up quite a collection of them now
so check out my full review if you want
more on the lip butters best skin care
products and I'm just gonna share three
I'm just kind of my top 3 skin care
products that I love and I want to put
out there first that with the Clarisonic
I got a Clarisonic for Christmas at
Clarisonic Mia - I want to say that I am
loving it so far but I think it's a
little premature to do a review on it I
want to use it you know more than a
month before I do anything with that
review wise thing I want to talk about
here one of my favorite products and
this was a favorite last year and ever
since college
the Olay daily facial cleansing cloths
and the ones I have here happen to be
generics because I had to purchase some
I couldn't get the Olay for some reason
where I was at and so I got the reason
why I like Olay is that they never
irritate my eyes but generally one side
is a little more scrubby and exfoliating
and one side is smoother takes off on my
makeup even as I use my Clarisonic now I
use one of these to get the bulk of my
makeup off and then in another step I
use the Clarisonic to kind of really get
that scrubbing exfoliating action going
to make
to take your makeup off and this will
swipe off your lip product it'll get all
your eye makeup off all your face makes
us are just convenience of not having to
go use a washcloth or dirty wants
somebody else's washcloth they're
phenomenal travel products for that
purpose terms have been great
exfoliating face scrub I've come into a
new world when I discovered this pride
because before I thought oh they have to
be kind of a coarse gritty uncomfortable
feeling and then I tried the philosophy
micro delivery wash and this is the
finest little granules I think I talked
about this in a video before this is
almost gone but it's the tiniest
granules and you can feel that it's
getting some scrubbing action down on
your face when you use it but you're
getting so much more of a concentration
of little bitty grainy scrubbers you
know doing the scrubbing action as
opposed to sometimes use a face scrub
and it's like okay there are five little
beads here floating around in this gel
what's that going to do so this does a
lost great product discovery this year
is the dr. Dennis gross alpha-beta glow
paints basically this is a self tanning
towelette for your face it is by far the
best self tanner for face I've ever used
natural color it does not look too much
it does not look like too little which
that's been the problem for me as I use
these and it's like where did it go did
I do anything did that tanner just put
any color on my face so this gives you
the color also contains good for your
skin ingredients some things that are
really giving you your freshest skin
possible while also giving it that great
for best body products first thing is
the philosophy 3 and 1 shower gels so
these are you know those things can be
used as your shower gel your bubble bath
or your shampoo and they all smell just
amazing my shower is full of them
especially since Christmas when I got a
bunch of them but one of my all-time
favorite scents it's actually the
perfumed one in inner grace and I've
been like rationing this this is really
just down to here and by container here
and it smells so good I love inner grace
it's one of my favorite philosophy scent
in they have so many yummy food type
scents and during Christmas I'm not sure
if you can get your hands on this other
times of the year but sugar sprinkles
funnel cake I was telling the guys at
work about these and how I have one that
smells like eggnog and one that smells
like funnel cake and they're like what
you know you don't walk around still
really smelling like this stuff but it's
so amazing in the body wash I'm like you
guys don't understand this smells
delicious another favorite and this is
repeating from last year and this is my
Schick intuition razor and I got to
point out that I feel like the skin on
my legs is practically more sensitive
than the skin on my face I mean I get
razor burn ingrown hairs all those kinds
of things very easily on my legs got
this soap built around here and
basically you don't even use a shaving
gel or anything like that you can just
shave like this these actually last a
decently long time too the cartridges
with the soap around smells really good
I believe they were like four blades
here on the razor and I just finally
have found something where I can shave
and I don't have irritation this is the
Queen Helen that's the same brand that
makes our Queen Helene whatever you want
to say the same brand that makes the
mint julep mask the cocoa butter cream
okay
comes a little jar like this oh it
smells so good and it's not really like
totally normal cocoa butter scent it
just smells a little bit tropic and I
love
luring other like body sprays and stuff
on top of it once I put it on but right
after I get out of the shower to really
seal in that moisture I will use this
you know on my elbows and just all over
and it really keeps the skin feeling
soft and for extended period of time
which is nice that's time again my
favorite hair products what in the world
would I do without my favorite hairspray
Tresemme tres ooh two-time winner here
this is so good I love this hairspray I
use it all the time it's the only
hairspray I use I use it when I'm
styling my hair if I'm gonna you know
tease a little area you know I'll pull
up some give a little spritz of spray
tease it I finish with this too got one
that I keep here at home and I've got
one that I always take with me to work
every day the number for extra hold is
what I always get I don't get the fine
mist there's an ultrafine mist and I
don't like it as well I don't feel like
it holds as well so this is the one
other kind of underrated under-the-radar
type thing is my con air pro clips and
basically these are clips that you can
use just like this fine young lady is
using here you can use them on your
rollers and what they do is they keep
you from getting that dent in your hair
that rollers can sometimes cause so I
for example use the Remington heated
clip rollers and those are great they
give you a really fast curl but around
my face and right up in here where you
know the hair is really visible once you
take them out on those top layers I use
these the combs cross and they fit all
the way around so you never end up
getting that bump no matter what kind of
Roller set you use if you've been
struggling like getting it to look just
right when you take them out you might
consider just picking up some of these I
think they're a real game-changer for
roll and my other hair favorite that I'm
so glad I discovered this here is my
Conair bun maker make a perfect bun I've
used this so much I've been wearing it
in a lot of videos in case you haven't
noticed I had this
in my video the other day where I had
the side bun even though it looked kind
of messy you know on the outside of it
the basis of the bun was this donut
thing which I have demonstrated in a
tutorial but basically you put this on
put your hair in a ponytail put this on
wrap your hair around it and you've got
a fuller bun and it comes with these
little hair pins that you can use to
secure it I know you can come up with
these things elsewhere you can buy them
just individually it like Sally's I
think but this little bun kit was the
reason why I discovered this in the
first place so it's just great for updos
or a low bun you can do things a little
bit tighter and sleeker if you want to
or you can keep it a little bit messy if
you want for the first time I'm going to
name some nail product favorites in this
video dolly Hansen complete salon
manicure as you can see a little bit
wider brush it just really applies the
color easily really smooth helps prevent
a lot of streaks and I just think the
quality of these is really nice when I
wear these I don't end up with a bunch
of chips or like premature chipping like
the next day like oh why am i chipped
but some of my favorite shades are
raising the bar this is a pretty kind of
metallic rose color shrimp Lee divine
gorgeous gorgeous pink and also
commander in chic which is a really nice
kind of grayish taupe color so they've
got a lot of great colors to choose from
but those are some of my favorites I
also love the Milani one coat glitters
because they truly are one coat I
couldn't quite believe it I remember
when I first tried these I was like is
it really gonna be one coat and it is so
like if you want pretty gold nails or
glittery red that's great in my favorite
shade a shade that I just love so much
and I think is so Universal wear it with
anything is the Sally Hansen diamond
strength in nude shimmer shiny
beautifully metallic I wouldn't go as
far as to call it rose gold but it just
has a nice little bit of warmth for
theirs thank you so much for watching
and sticking with me through this ultra
long serie
that is the Emily Awards I will be
having again that kind of anti Awards
video or the failed products things like
that coming up soon so keep an eye out
for them I think it's so fun to have
found a gigantic community of people
that gets excited about makeup just like
I do so thank you for watching have a
wonderful day and I'll see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
