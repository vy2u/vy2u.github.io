on hearing a little bit of shimmer
little little bit of shimmer a little
bit of shimmer oh yeah more like a
fuchsia pink fuchsia pink you ship it
you know I got a lot of lip gloss going
on here so very smooth so good very
smooth so so very smooth huh let's talk
about lips let's let's talk about lips
lips lips hi everybody thanks for
joining me for part three of the emily
awards i'm going to be sharing all my
favorite lip products and if i am
obsessed with any category of beauty it
is probably this one i love lip gloss
and lipstick and all that kind of thing
so i'm going to show my favorites in
those categories also gonna have my
favorites in certain color categories as
well so like favorite pink lip products
and red and neutral and stuff like that
so it's so much fun but this is really
hard for me like I've got you know a lot
of products that i love that didn't make
it into this video because there's just
so many that i've tried and really enjoy
after this there is going to be a big
finale as well so after this video first
there's lots to talk about with lips so
let's get started this was something I
tried somewhat recently and really
figured out how much I liked it and wish
I would have tried it sooner because
I've heard it has a cult following but
it is from the brand fresh and it is the
sugar lip treatment so this has an SPF
15 and if you really don't want to
splurge big time you can be like me and
get the smaller size because it's
lasting me a while and it does have kind
of like a little citrus vibe to it when
you smell it but what I like about this
is that it doesn't go on super thin like
when you put it on you really feel like
your lips are getting a treatment and
the drugstore this product has one in
years past since the EOS smooth sphere
lip balms I love the lemon drops just so
fresh and just kind of a great thing to
put on your lips in the morning I think
it just really gets you kind of feeling
awake but you just put it on like this I
mean it's just very easy user friendly
one that I use every night before bed
this kind of my nighttime ritual is the
these sweet mint i also like using these
before i put my lipstick on because
they're not too slick and I like to use
miss kind of like a primer product
practice
under lipstick and lip liner to make
everything light on easier and look
smoother on my lips pretended lip balm I
don't have any high-end favorite though
I've talked about this in a lot of
different capacities it could be a
lipstick it could be a tinted lip balm
it could be practically a lip gloss
finish and it's the revlon colorburst
lip butters these are so cool guys I did
a full review on these showed a lot of
different colors and when it comes right
down to it I'm putting it in the tinted
lip balm category because it just has
that convenience factor of a tinted lip
balm it feels good on your lips it feels
really hydrating but it also gives you
some color and the lightest shades kind
of make me think more tinted lip balm
and then the deeper colors you know like
red velvet which is also gorgeous you
know it makes you think more of a
lipstick but shades like creme brulee or
cupcake you know they're really
beautiful think of your lips great shine
as well can use one of these and that's
really all you feel like you need on
your lips I just really have not gotten
into any high-end lip liners I have a
few I don't consider them to be
outstanding favorites and it's really
not something I feel the need to splurge
on at all because over the years I have
found a brand that comes up with a great
lip liner and it is Jordana easy liner
and it's been a favorite for three years
now because I love their color selection
i love how easily they glide on and you
don't have to sharpen them and so I mean
if you're looking for a neutral like I
love the shade in rock and rose and
tawny baby berry is gorgeous its kind of
the color of what I have on my lips
right now and then plush plum is a great
Barry coso aren't dry at all so like if
you're one who likes to fill in your
full lip like I do if I'm going to use a
lip liner usually I go all over it and
it's very easy and quick to do with
jumbo lip pencils are emerging as one of
my favorite categories of lip Prada and
chunky but they give you still some
control you know when you apply and so
it's usually a really quick way to get a
nice amount of color my high-end
favorites won last year as well and they
are the bare essentials buxom big and
healthy lipsticks now these are a little
bit smaller size because over the past
couple years I've gotten like two sets
that have like four this size and as you
can see i'm almost use this one up
that's all i have left there but they're
really nice because i feel like they're
rather long wearing and they also have a
little bit of a tingle to them and
they're kind of minty i also wanted to
mention an awesome product from tarte i
know there are lots of like kits out
there that come with a lot of different
things and then like if you're looking
on QVC or sephora you know multiple tart
products try to find something that has
a lipsurgence in it because these are so
freaking cool practically call these a
jumbo lip balm pencil as opposed to just
a jumbo lip pencil because they really
feel like a balm on your lips a little
one which is really just kind of
prompted me to have to talk about these
now because I love this shade in moody
and it looks so dark here and kind of
intimidating in the stick but really
it's a nice berry color so that look
that looks beautiful on in my drugstore
jumbo lip pencils love the ones from NYX
they have a great color selection and
again it's just you know it's a large
pencil it's creamy it you know basically
fills in your lips very quickly gives
you a little more control than a
lipstick does for my favorite lip
plumper I actually have really latched
on to my high-end favorite so much to
the point that I haven't really looked
much for more drugstore favorites or
really just delve into that much at all
because i love the bare essentials buxom
lip gloss you put these on I've called
referred to them as kind of long wearing
because I feel like you know if you're
just wearing them throughout say a
workday they're going to be on there a
long time yes it will come off a little
bit on your coffee cup you know if you
take a drink and stuff like that but I
like they have enough tackiness to them
that they do stay on your lips but
they're not overly sticky I do feel that
kind of plumping action and I feel like
it smooths and kind of perfex the look
of your look well my favorites happen to
be like the pinky shades and I got a
great berry color here as well these are
a little bit shorter because again I've
gotten these in sets of four with the
big and healthy lipsticks if you don't
mind a little tingle on your lips which
I actually think is kind of cool and it
is again that minty type flavor you'll
like these i'm talking about these i'm
talking more in terms of formula than
recommending specific colors here but i
really think my high-end favorite
lipstick as it has been for the last two
years as well is mac and they've got
just the ultimate in color selection
plus they've got different little
divisions in terms of types like they've
got the cream machines which I really
enjoy like this one cream cup is a cream
machine so just kind of a really creamy
smooth lipstick and then they've got
like the Viva Glam 5 and the whole Viva
Glam collection if you're really looking
to get a lot of color variety or find
that really unique shade you know they
have tons in their displays it's now a
two-time winner for my favorite
drugstore lipstick and it's the revlon
colorburst you'll feel heavy on your
lips at all but yet with whatever shade
I seem to get I feel like the color is
so saturated so pigments something
really soft like this shade and soft
nude to really more bright shades like
I've got this one in peach and I've
tried some really bright magenta colors
and no matter what end of the spectrum
you're on they show up wonderfully on
the lips they feel good and there's a
lot of just rich creamy colors if you
don't like messing around with frosty
lip sticks or a lot of shimmer there are
a lot of really nice creamy colors in
this line that people are interested in
things like the lip butters those really
the lip products that feel good on your
lips really make them feel hydrated so
you might be interested in something
that I've really come to enjoy lately
and it's the Milani HD advanced
lipsticks one thing that I love about
these new
instantly notice they are skinnier than
your average lipstick and I love that I
wish there were more of these out there
that are just they're easier to put on
you don't have to think as much you can
kind of do these mirrorless you know
what I mean and they've got a great
shape called classy nude so that's this
one and then one of my favorite Berry
colors they have is raspberry blush but
these have kind of a smell to them kind
of a distinct smell a little bit sweet
and fruity which some people might not
like I really like and info and I just
think these are great favorite lip gloss
for high end this one won last year as
well and it's the philosophy lip shines
I wanted to talk about these again this
year because I really consider these the
lip gloss lovers product for a couple of
reasons these are that glassy gloss
finish some of them are colored like
these that i recently got a peppermint
bark and pomegranate bubbly they do have
you know a tint of these color so you
will look have that reddish look or a
plum look but um they're also ones like
cinnamon buns which is just kind of
really pretty and shiny and they smell
like you know exactly like what their
title is just like the philosophy body
washes that you know really fit their
description to a tee in terms of the
scent these are just like my drugstore
lip gloss favorite it's now a three time
favorite and this brand has come out
with different lip gloss versions over
the years but you know what I keep
coming back to the best and it's revlon
super lustrous lip gloss these glosses
are so good they're shiny they're the
perfect texture some art creamy some
have shimmer there's a nice little
variety there I wish they'd make even
more colors to be honest and if you are
a nude gloss girl and you like you know
really like glosses they've got a great
selection of those and kind of peachy
beige type color just the color you
think you're going to be getting when
you look at them in the container so
again that's a one of my things with lip
gloss and my other favorite is a
two-time winner and it's the knicks mega
shine lip gloss so these are great
because there's a huge color selection
with these
again summer creamy summer shimmery
summer sparkly you know it just you get
everything you want with this and I just
ran into so many shades that I consider
like I love that color you know how you
get that feeling sometimes when you've
just found the right lip gloss well I
found like I don't know half a dozen
right lip glosses you know in this line
because they've just really hit on some
good like light colors and pinks that
have you know just that gorgeous sparkle
to them and light up your face so I love
NYX mega shine now we're going to talk
about my favorites and some different
color families and guys this took me and
embarrassingly long time to figure out
what I was gonna pick as my favorite I
mean it was more complicated than
American Idol auditions I mean I was
just like weeding out and like pulling
yours group at your groupie you know I
like trying to decide which ones are my
favorite so a lot of thought went into
this so this is it I am wearing um my
both my favorite pink lipstick and lip
gloss right now estee lauder lavish pink
now it's not only because my name has
been engraved on this one but this is a
gorgeous pink as you look at it you
think oh that's like Barbie doll
bubblegum pink but it actually has a
really beautiful and the camera may pick
up on it a little bit here kind of
golden shimmer in it it's really a fine
shimmer nothing too obnoxious I just
feel like whenever I'm thinking about
wearing a pink lip product that's one
that's always in the back of my mind to
reach for and then favorite pink lip
gloss worn alone or I've worn it layered
on top of that lipstick is Revlon super
lustrous in pink pop oh my goodness love
it looks like this you know looks like
it looks in the container I mean my
goodness if every lips lip lusts you
know lying could get that through their
head you know that it should come out
looking as it appears in the container
you know that is wonderful i love the
opacity to that color um
gorgeous pink lovin for favorite berry
lipstick and allow me to get on my berry
lipstick soapbox here for a second I
think Barry colors look so good on so
many skin tone just adds that little
something and if you want to go just a
little darker than a pink like this it
can be extremely wearable you can feel
comfortable with them on I think this is
something people need to be looking into
more and i wanted to therefore introduce
a shade to you that i think is a great
starter berry color if you want to get
into that and it is a revlon colorburst
lip but very smoothie is a fantastic
berry shade so a little bit deeper look
than what i would have on my lips right
now is required on top it looks
wonderful and for those of you who say
hey I'm riding the berry train with you
I love the berry lip colors have you
tried Mac craving o.m.g creamy beautiful
so saturated like I mean you one swipe
across your lips you do not need to
overlap and go two laps three laps
around I mean one lap around your lips
will do it this is an amplified lipstick
so it is very I mean if I hold it up
against the wall I feel like it just
goes right into the shade of the wall
behind and favorite berry lip gloss and
this is a huge bargain it's the elf
super glossy lip shine and mauve looks a
little bit metallic plum Barry Lee if
you're just trying to like dip your toe
into the water in the world of berry lip
products for a dollar you can't really
go wrong favorite red lipstick this is
one for three years straight it is from
NYC ultra moist lip where in sheer red
talk about a wearable red for pretty
much anybody you know there's really
really bright warm red lipsticks there's
really cool Reds this is kind of a
neutral red lipstick that I've
recommended to lots of people and so
many have come back to me and said thank
you for telling me about that because
this is less than a dollar and it is
creamy red color that is not too bright
like if you haven't tried a red before
and you want to feel comfortable in it
you know not feel like your lips are
screaming at the person next
it's just really really pretty lip gloss
this one's a little more expensive but
it is bare minerals in pomegranate I
like this red as well because it's got a
little bit of gold shimmer to it not
overly bright I use this a lot on the
air for the news if I'm going for if I'm
wearing some sort of red in my outfit
and I just want to tie my lips back to
that and this is a really pretty one and
this has a nice brush tip applicator so
I like that a lot favorite neutral
lipstick and this is a great line of
lipsticks as well it's real moisture
renew and this one is in spot light
beige and so this is kind of a like a
peachy nude lipstick it's creamy it
doesn't have sparkle to it at all and it
looks really nice worn on its own
because these are a very hydrating
lipstick so your lips will just shine a
little bit but I also wanted to talk
about it because it's a nice base for
any kind of gloss you want to put on
clear kind of sparkly gloss it's only
going to accent this color or you can
put more Pink's on top of it it's just a
nice like base lip color lip gloss and I
have three to talk about here I could
not leave one of them out no matter how
many ways I looked at it I just had to
talk about them all so first one is from
Revlon super lustrous lip gloss in
foiled quite possibly one of my most
favorite super lustrous glosses it's
kind of like a metallic nude and if you
put this if you only want to wear this
right in the center of your lower lip
you know just right here it's going to
shine and it's instantly going to look
fuller your lips will instantly look
more plump so there's a little trick
they're all over it's very pretty as
well I also love this is probably my
favorite one of my top favorite Mally
lip glosses and this is in blossom this
one is sort of a neutral with a little
pink in it it has a little bit of a
metallic feel but not too much extremely
wearable anybody who just wants to you
know trial lip gloss these are great
ones to try because they're not
screaming with color but they are
gorgeously shiny
and then Nick's Cosmo wowza this one is
so lovely on the lips it has some
Sparkle it has some shimmer to it but I
swear you put it on in your face glows
your I mean everything just comes
together I don't know what it is your
eyes seem brighter your cheeks seem
brighter it just brings life to the face
so there you go guys those are my
favorite lip products it's a category
I'm very passionate about it took me a
long time to really narrow things down
but as you can see there are some
longtime winners here so some very you
know legitimate favorite products and
some newcomers to the scene this year
there's more to come in my emily awards
finale there's going to be a lot of fun
stuff in that video including things
like most valuable products MVPs and
also some favorites for skin care and
hair and all kinds of things so don't
miss out on that it will be coming soon
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
