on hearing a little bit of shimmer a
little bit of shimmer a little bit of
shimmer oh yeah s'mores like a fuchsia
pink fuchsia pink uShip you know I got a
lot of lip gloss so while I'm here it's
so very smooth so very smooth so so very
smooth huh let's talk about lips let's
let's talk about lips lips lips hi
everybody thanks for joining me for part
three of the Emily awards I'm going to
be sharing all my favorite lip products
and if I am obsessed with any category
of beauty it is probably this one I love
lip gloss and lipstick and all that kind
of things so I'm going to show my
favorites in those categories also don't
have my favorites in certain color
categories as well so like favorite pink
lip products and red and neutral and
stuff like that so it's so much fun but
this is really hard for me like I've got
you know a lot of products that I love
that didn't make it into this video
because there's just so many that I've
tried and really enjoy for this there is
gonna be a big finale as well so after
this video first there's lots to talk
about with lips so let's get started
this was something I tried somewhat
recently and really figured out how much
I liked it and wish I would have tried
it sooner because I've heard it has a
cult following but it is from the brand
fresh and it is the sugar lip treatment
so this has an SPF 15 and if you really
don't want to splurge big-time you can
be like me and get the smaller size
because it's lasting me a while and it
does have kind of like a little citrus
vibe to it when you smell it but what I
like about this is that it doesn't go on
super thin like when you put it on you
really feel like your lips are getting a
treatment in the drugstore this product
has won in years past it's the EOS
smooth sphere lip balms I love the lemon
drought it's just so fresh and just kind
of a great thing to put on your lips in
the morning I think it just really gets
you kind of feeling awake but you just
put it on like this I mean it's just
very easy user friendly one that I use
every night before bed this is kind of
my nighttime ritual is the these sweet
mint I also like using these before I
put my lipstick on because they're not
too slick I like to use them as kind of
like a primer product
under lipstick and lip liner to make
everything light on easier and look
smoother on my lips tinted lip balm I
don't have any high-end favor until I've
talked about this in a lot of different
capacities it could be a lipstick it
could be a tinted lip balm it could be
practically a lip gloss finish and it's
the revlon colorburst lip butters these
are so cool guys I did a full review on
these showed a lot of different colors
and when it comes right down to it I'm
putting it in the tinted lip balm
category because it just has that
convenience factor of a tinted lip balm
it feels good on your lips it feels
really hydrating but it also gives you
some color and the lightest shades kind
of make me think more tinted lip balm
and then the deeper colors you know like
red velvet which is also gorgeous you
know it makes you think more of a
lipstick but shades like creme brulee or
cupcake you know they're really
beautiful think of your lips great shine
as well can use one of these and that's
really all you feel like you need on
your lips
I just really have not gotten into any
high-end lip liners I have a few I don't
consider them to be outstanding
favorites and it's really not something
I feel the need to splurge on at all
because over the years I have found a
brand that comes up with a great lip
liner and it is Jordana easy liner and
it's been a favorite for three years now
because I love their color selection I
love how easily they glide on and you
don't have to sharpen them and so I mean
if you're looking for a neutral like I
love the shade in rock and rose and
tawny
baby berry it's gorgeous it's kind of
the color of what I have on my lips
right now and then plush plum is a great
berry color so aren't dry at all so like
if you're one who likes to fill in your
full lip like I do if I'm going to use a
lip liner usually I go all over it and
it's very easy and quick to do with
jumbo lip pencils are emerging as one of
my favorite categories of lip products
but they give you still some control you
know when you apply and so it's usually
a really quick way to get a nice amount
of color my high-end favorites won last
year as well and they are the bare
essentials buxom big and healthy
lipsticks now these are a little bit
smaller size because over the past
couple years I've gotten like two sets
that have like four this size and as you
can see I've almost used this one up
that's all I have left there but they're
really nice because I feel like they're
rather long wearing and they also have a
little bit of a tingle to them and
they're kind of minty I also wanted to
mention an awesome product from Tarte I
know there are lots of like kits out
there that come with a lot of different
things and then like if you're looking
on QVC or Sephora you know multiple
Tarte products try to find something
that has a lip surgence in it because
these are so freaking cool practically
call these a jumbo lip balm pencil as
opposed to just a jumbo lip pencil
because they really feel like a balm on
your lips
a little one which is really just kind
of prompted me to have to talk about
these now because I love this shade in
Moody and it looks so dark here and kind
of intimidating in the stick but really
it's a nice berry color so that look
that looks beautiful on my drugstore
jumbo lip pencils love the ones from NYX
they have a great color selection and
again it's just you know it's a large
pencil it's creamy
it you know basically fills in your lips
very quickly it gives you a little more
control than a lipstick does for my
favorite lip plumper I actually have
really latched on to my high-end
favorite so much to the point that I
haven't really looked much for more
drugstore favorites or really just delve
into that much at all because I love the
bare essentials buxom lipgloss you put
these on I've called refer to them it's
kind of long wearing because I feel like
you know if you're just wearing them
throughout say a work day they're gonna
be on there a long time yes they will
come off a little bit on your coffee cup
you know if you take a drink
like that but I feel like they have
enough tackiness to them that they do
stay on your lips but they're not overly
sticky I do feel that kind of plumping
action and I feel like it smooths and
kind of perfects the look of your look
couple of my favorites happen to be like
the pinky shades and I got a great berry
color here as well these are a little
bit shorter because again I've gotten
these in sets of four with the big and
healthy lipsticks if you don't mind a
little tingle on your lips which I
actually think is kind of cool and it is
again that minty type flavor
you'll like these I'm talking about
these I'm talking more in terms of
formula than recommending specific
colors here but I really think my
high-end favorite lipstick as it has
been for the last two years as well is
Mac and they've got just the ultimate in
color selection plus they've got
different little divisions in terms of
types like they've got the cream Sheen's
which I really enjoy like this one cream
cup is a cream Sheen
so just kind of a really creamy smooth
lipstick and then they've got like the
Viva Glam 5 and the whole Viva Glam
collection if you're really looking to
get a lot of color variety or find that
really unique shade you know they have
tons in their displays it's now a
two-time winner for my favorite
drugstore lipstick and it's the revlon
colorburst you'll feel heavy on your
lips at all but yet with whatever shade
I seem to get I feel like the color is
so saturated so pigments is something
really soft like this shade and soft
nude to really more bright shades like
I've got this one in peach and I've
tried some really bright magenta colors
and no matter what end of the spectrum
you're on they show up wonderfully on
the lips they feel good and there's a
lot of just rich creamy colors if you
don't like messing around with frosty
lipsticks or a lot of shimmer there are
a lot of really nice creamy colors in
this line if people are interested in
things like the lip butters those really
the lip products that feel good on your
lips really make them feel hydrated so
you might be interested in something
that I've really come to enjoy lately
and it's the Milani HD advanced
lipsticks one thing that I
love about these and you'll instantly
notice they are skinnier than your
average lipstick and I love that I wish
there were more of these out there that
are just they're easier to put on you
don't have to think as much you can kind
of do these mirrorless you know what I
mean and they've got a great shape
called classy nude so that's this one
and then one of my favorite berry colors
they have is raspberry blush but these
have kind of a smell to them kind of a
distinct smell a little bit sweet and
fruity which some people might not like
I really like an indigo and I just think
these are great favorite lip gloss for
high-end this one won last year as well
and it's the philosophy lip shines I
wanted to talk about these again this
year because I really consider these the
lip gloss lovers product for a couple of
reasons
these are that glassy gloss finish some
of them are colored like these that I
recently got a peppermint bark and
pomegranate bubbly they do have you know
a tint of these color so you will look
have that reddish look or a plum look
but um there are also ones like cinnamon
buns which is just kind of really pretty
and shiny and they smell like you know
exactly like what their title is just
like the philosophy body washes that you
know really fit their description to a
tee in terms of the scent these are just
like a drugstore lipgloss favorite it's
now a three time favorite and this brand
has come out with different lip gloss
versions over the years but you know
what I keep coming back to the best and
it's Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss
these glosses are so good they're shiny
they're the perfect texture
some are creamy some have shimmer
there's a nice little variety there I
wish they make even more colors to be
honest and if you are a nude gloss girl
and you like you know really light
glosses they've got a great selection of
those in kind of peachy beige type color
just the color you think you're gonna be
getting when you look at them in the
container so again that's a one of my
things with lip gloss and my other
favorite is a two-time winner and it's
the NYX mega shine lip gloss so these
are great because there's a huge color
selection with these
and against summer creamy summer
shimmering summer sparkly you know it
just you get everything you I want with
this and I just ran into so many shades
that I consider like I love that color
you know how you get that feeling
sometimes when you've just found the
right lip gloss
well I found like I don't know half a
dozen right lip glosses you know in this
line because they've just really hit on
some good like light colors and Pink's
that have you know just that gorgeous
sparkle to them and light up your face
so I love NYX mega shine now we're gonna
talk about my favorites and some
different color families and guys this
took me an embarrassingly long time to
figure out what I was gonna pick as my
favorite I mean it was more complicated
than American Idol auditions I mean I
was just like weeding out and like
pulling yours group a here's group B you
know I'm like trying to decide which
ones are my favorites so a lot of
thought went into this so this is it I
am wearing my both my favorite pink
lipstick and lip gloss right now Estee
Lauder lavish pink now it's not only
because my name has been engraved on
this one but this is a gorgeous pink as
you look at it you think oh that's like
Barbie doll bubblegum pink but it
actually has a really beautiful and the
camera may pick up on it a little bit
here kind of gold and shimmer in it it's
really a fine shimmer nothing too
obnoxious I just feel like whenever I'm
thinking about wearing a pink lip
product that's one that's always in the
back of my mind to reach for and then
favorite pink lip gloss worn alone or
I've worn it layered on top of that
lipstick is Revlon Super Lustrous in
pink pop oh my goodness love it looks
like this you know looks like it looks
in the container I mean my goodness if
every lips lip Loess you know line could
get that through their head you know
that it should come out looking as it
appears in the container you know that
is wonderful I love the opacity to that
color gorgeous pink
love it four favorite berry lipstick and
allow me to get on my berry lipstick
soapbox here for a second I think berry
colors look so good on so many skin
tones just adds that little something
and if you want to go just a little
darker than a pink like this it can be
extremely wearable you can feel
comfortable with them on I think this is
something people need to be looking into
more and I wanted to therefore introduce
a shade to you that I think is a great
starter berry color if you want to get
into that and it is a revlon colorburst
lip butter berry smoothie is a fantastic
berry shade so a little bit deeper look
than what I would have on my lips right
now less required on top it looks
wonderful and for those of you who say
hey I'm riding the berry train with you
I love the berry lip colors
have you tried Mac craving oMG creamy
beautiful so saturated like I mean you
one swipe across your lips you do not
need to overlap and go two laps three
laps around I mean one lap around your
lips will do it this is an amplified
lipstick so it is very I mean if I hold
it up against the wall I feel like it
just goes right into the shade of the
wall behind me and favorite berry lip
gloss and this is a huge bargain it's
the elf super glossy lip shine in mauve
luxe a little bit metallic plumberry
if you're just trying to like dip your
toe into the water in the world of berry
lip products for a dollar you can't
really go wrong favorite red lipstick
this is one for three years straight it
is from NYC ultra moist lip wear in
sheer red talk about a wearable red for
pretty much anybody you know there's
really really bright warm red lipsticks
there's really cool Reds this is kind of
a neutral red lipstick that I've
recommended to lots of people and so
many have come back to me and said thank
you for telling me about that because
this is less than a dollar and it is
creamy red color that is not too bright
like if you haven't tried a red before
and you want to feel comfortable in it
you know not feel like your lips are
screaming at the person next to
it's just really really pretty lip gloss
this one's a little more expensive but
it is bare minerals in pomegranate I
like this red as well because it's got a
little bit of gold shimmer to it not
overly bright I use this a lot on the
air for the news if I'm going for if I'm
wearing some sort of red in my outfit
and I just want to tie my lips back to
that this is a really pretty one and
this has a nice brush tip applicator so
I like that a lot
favorite neutral lipstick and this is a
great line of lipsticks as well it's
real moisture renew and this one is in
spotlight beige and so this is kind of a
like a peachy nude lipstick it's creamy
it doesn't have sparkle to it at all and
it looks really nice worn on its own
because these are a very hydrating
lipstick so your lips will just shine a
little bit but I also wanted to talk
about it because it's a nice base for
any kind of gloss you want to put on
clear kind of sparkly gloss it's only
gonna accent this color or you can put
more Pink's on top of it it's just a
nice like base lip color lip gloss and I
have three to talk about here I could
not leave one of them out no matter how
many ways I looked at it I just had to
talk about them all so first one is from
Revlon Super Lustrous
lip gloss in foiled quite possibly one
of my most favorite Super Lustrous
glosses it's kind of like a metallic
nude and if you put this if you only
want to wear this right in the center of
your lower lip you know just right here
it's gonna shine and it's instantly
gonna look fuller your lips will
instantly look more plump so there's a
little trick they're all over it's very
pretty as well I also love this is
probably my favorite one of my top
favorite Maui lip glosses and this is in
blossom this one is sort of a neutral
with a little pink in it it has a little
bit of a metallic feel but not too much
extremely wearable anybody who just
wants to you know try a lip gloss these
are great ones to try because they're
not screaming with color but they are
gorgeously shiny
and then Knicks Cosmo wowza this one is
so lovely on the lips it has some
sparkle it has some shimmer to it but I
swear you put it on in your face glows
you're I mean everything just comes
together I don't know what it is your
eyes seem brighter your cheeks seem
brighter it just brings life to the face
so there you go guys those are my
favorite lip products it's a category
I'm very passionate about it took me a
long time to really narrow things down
but as you can see there are some
longtime winners here so some very you
know legitimate favourite products and
some newcomers to the scene this year
there's more to come in my Emily awards
finale there's going to be a lot of fun
stuff in that video including things
like most valuable products MVPs and
also some favorites for skin care and
hair and all kinds of things so don't
miss out on that it'll be coming soon
