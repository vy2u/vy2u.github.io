Awards have been sharing top beauty
products with beauty enthusiasts around
the world this year we take you inside
the testing process wait
last chasm is that a technical term did
you save fifteen percent or more on this
general insurance
I guess just here's the let's just shoot
the video and your good part two of the
Emily awards this is all about eyes I'm
super pumped for this because I feel
like of all the categories of makeup in
terms of trying new things I feel like
eyes are probably the things that I've
tried the most of this year in terms of
brand new products and in this video I'm
so excited because you've got some
things that still even as I've tried
more and more I continue to win and so
that's kind of reaffirming to see that
like I continue to like an old favorite
even after all this time and I've also
got some great like kind of upset
underdog products that I'm thinking why
aren't people talking about these more
so those are the ones I think I'm really
really excited to tell you about in this
video
alright eye primer high-end this is a
four-time winner I'm getting it again
two Too Faced shadow insurance and I
feel like more and more high-end brands
are packing you know either a small size
or even a full size eye primer in with
some of their palettes so I feel like
I've tried quite a few this year but I
keep coming back to this one because I
feel like it truly does have an impact
on staying power of the shadow for sure
I mean this is not like a pointless
application to put on eye primer I put
it on every time I apply eye makeup and
I feel like it extends the wear of the
eye shadow also this doesn't feel
thicker heavy on the eyes so if you want
to put it on underneath another cream
product you really got some layering
going on this is virtually weightless on
the eye and it boosts the color payoff
that you have but also improves staying
power so like I said that's huge for an
eye primer from my drugstore of winter
it's a two-time winner it's NYX HD
eyeshadow base I don't have it
physically in my hand to show you so I'm
just kind of picture it here but I was
getting rid of stuff that I was running
out of and so that one I guess kind of
tossed like I'm out of that and kind of
forgot that it would be involved in the
Emily awards but that's a great great
low cost i shadow prime kind of
neutralizes the color of your lids so if
you've got redness and you want a base
that's more like a little bit corrective
my high-end favorite is still a
back-to-back winner so this one last
year and it's the Mallee ever color
shadow sticks these are my preferred
format for a cream shadow because they
are absolutely long wearing like you can
put these on rub on them do whatever you
want they will still be there at the end
of the day no need to top it with an eye
shadow so hardcore staying power but
also they're in a stick where it's not
too terribly wide so you can go under
your eye for smokey liner and if it
lasts all day why in the heck not right
but you don't have to sharpen it so a
couple of shades that I think would fit
well into anyone's collection or saddle
shimmer which is a really great neutral
and I also love champagne because it is
that great color that looks pretty all
over the lid or right around the inner
corner for some brightening gorgeous
they go nowhere like
so long wearing the drugstore we have
another repeat I promise there's gonna
be some new winter soon but right now I
mean it's the Maybelline Color tattoos I
wish these were in sticks just like
those that I showed you but they're in
little pots like this and they've come
out with new colors and new collections
here and there I love this shade called
bag to the bronze just a nice kind of
neutral color but they're all the same
kind of staying power you put them on
they don't budge and again you don't
have to top these with an eyeshadow to
make them work or make them last for you
I do have a new one to point out that I
don't feel like I've been hearing
anybody talk about and these have that
amazing amazing stain I wish they were
in a retractable stick that you didn't
have to sharpen but it's the Milani
shadow I was a great one called
champagne toast and so that's gonna be
just your traditional light shimmery
shade green Safari is beautiful I mean
with the color of the year being that
pretty emerald green if you're wanting a
green eye this can give you that and
last completely all day all night like
until you take it off small high-end
palette this isn't like a trio or even a
quad it's got eight shades in it but it
is still kind of small so I mean it's
really my favorite that I've tried here
and I got this at the tail end of the
year and I love this eye shadow formula
and it's bare minerals it's the ready I
shadow oh it's really mirrored in the
finer things and I just really like the
configuration of colors here I mean it's
a fantastic formula but I also just love
what they chose to put in because suits
you can get a really really dark pretty
smoky eye it's gorgeous mid-tone shade
but then some different shades in here
to brighten it up like this blue and
kind of this all of the really light all
of the golden green so compact it's
amazing for travel you do get a nice
mirror in there too so minute all those
things when it comes to a great palette
and I think this is a nice small
high-end one drugstore small palette I
have several to tell you about one is a
repeat winner and it's really the one
that comes to mind when I think smoky
eye because it's so small it's like so
efficient it's called the silent
treatment and this is amazingly
inexpensive the colors are so so
saturate
and lovely I mean just beautiful shades
but it doesn't take much when you use
them so you've got your great great dark
color it's like a super deep brown with
a little bit of sparkle a great taupe
and then this really light peach shade
which gives you that highlight without
looking like the dated like super white
frosty highlight it's just perfect
because it's got a little bit of like
skin tone in my other favorite for a
drugstore small palette and I really
like the whole range of these shades I
think the formula is great there is so
many gorgeous options but I'm gonna go
with the maybelline eye studio quad in
coral Oasis because this is a really
good representation of how these colors
pop this coral is gorgeous there's a
really pretty like spring greens a
formula dot that I compared at the
Lancome color design eyeshadows it
really they perform the same way they go
on with the same texture so I love these
and I would highly recommend them Simon
mentioned it's from the balm and it is
the rockstar palette it's called balm
Jovi it is amazing I'm wearing this
palette on my eyes today kind of one
after a palette that is largely neutral
but it still gives you some fun shades
to throw in there like I love the maroon
the olive green the navy blue for
straight up 100% matte shades that are
all like must-haves like your light
brown your cream dark brown plum I mean
I'm incorporating so much of this I've
got like the plum and the Alice copper
the the coppery color I even used the
blush not to mention and I did and this
is not about being a face palette but
you do get like two amazing bonuses here
with a fantastic mary lou manizer
highlight and this gorgeous blush which
is frat-boy and I've talked about how
much I love the bomb blushes so I've got
the blush on I've got the eyeshadows on
you get a couple lip products there as
well so a lot is in this but I primarily
think of it as being an eye palette for
all these shadows Amy and text your
wonderful staying power but bottom line
for this to be a favorite palette I love
the way it's put together I love what
they chose to include it's also just
really cute packaging wise is calm
so I want to mention a palette that I
know has been super popular in the
online beauty community but I think it
is really worth mentioning it's the
lorac Pro palette the reasons why
they've nailed this is that they stuck
with shades that people want to wear
like you feel like you look at this and
you could wear any of these then they
gave you half matte and half shimmer so
the options even though these seem like
all really kind of neutral wearable
shades the options you can get with this
palette are so I mean a number ability
to pop a look with like this gold shade
or this pretty garnet and then have you
know deep matte colors to anchor the
look is really important
these can have a little fallout I don't
love the formula as much as I love the
balm but they're still amazingly rich so
they come off with a lot of color when
you do get them on your eye just tap off
the excess when you get your brush in
these in these shadows which I pretty
much do with anything just in habit but
a really well-thought-out palette and
when you get this you feel like you have
every neutral you need so that's my
palette from the drugstore I hope you
accept what I'm gonna talk about here
because I don't find this in the
drugstore and it's not just one single
palette it's something you can put
together and it's a line of shadows that
I've just been so impressed with this
year and it's from Inglot and a lot of
people told me you got it right and this
is awesome because I created this
palette I put these shades together
chose them and I did write about these
on my blog so I'll link to the post that
explains but matte shades sparkly shades
shimmery shades they feel like velvet
and the price is relatively loving per
shadow it's not like its high-end prices
here and you can put together like a
really small palette something like this
or something even bigger now you can put
the palette together however you want it
doesn't just come as one palette but for
the fact that you have the ability to do
that and the shadows are so good and
they're at a low price I really wanted
to give that a mention
okay overall shadows so here we're not
just talking about one palette but maybe
looking at all of the kinds of shadows
in a certain line of makeup and what has
just the best quality high-end it's a
new winner this year it's the balm I
feel like I just tried a lot of what
they've had to offer from the shady lady
palettes to the nude tude which i think
is just it was just on the verge of
getting to mention for Best palette I
love that so much
we mentioned the rockstar palette brand
new meet Matt new all of these and more
than I'm showing you right now the
shadow quality is one that feels almost
creamy it like it hangs together and
when you put it on your lid it pops with
little effort without a lot of blending
without a lot of you know messing around
it just looks beautiful like I love the
eye look I have now the eye look I had
when I did this meet matte nude video I
got tons of comments on that I rarely
feel like I have to worry about fallout
with these shadows like you know little
specks coming down on my cheek or
anything like that they just perform so
well I'm not messing around here these
are they're called the bomb they are the
bomb if you're watching the deals on
HauteLook I mean you can get some of
these at an amazing deal like at a
fraction of the regular price so
definitely worth your worth your time
worth your money for sure or overall
shadow from the drugstore and yes I have
tried so much but this is a three-time
winner and it's wet and wild the color
icon shadows so you're gonna see them in
palettes of eight like this you're gonna
see them in trios like this we pay
double the price these are like five
bucks these are right around three bucks
it's amazing the only complaint if there
is one is and I think I said this last
year is I wish they would come out with
even more I want like the freaking
rainbow in these shadows because they
are so inexpensive so readily available
you go to your drugstore you go to
Walmart you can find this stuff you have
a little fall out kind of like I
mentioned with the lorac you know tap
off the excess but you have so much
pigment with the value in a shadow like
this it's gonna cost you five bucks
you're not gonna go through it quickly
because it takes so little when you use
it our eyelids are only so big
and it just does not take that much
product to make this go it's not one of
those shadows you scrub on it's like
okay gosh when will the colors start
showing no the color will show up
immediately you are missing out if you
have not yet tried what and wild
colorize my check eyeliner pencil for
high-end this is a two-time winner and
it's the Mallee ever color automatic
eyeliners they also have a new formula
I think it's called ultimate and they're
white but they perform like the same
staying power maybe a little bit
creamier but this is what I have the
most of and I'm still using up and like
I've got black Navy I've got Brown I've
got great wonderful range of colors you
don't have to sharpen these they go on
smoothly lasts amazingly and like none
other in the water lines so if I have to
put something in my waterline and I know
I really want to not have to worry about
this the entire day these are where it's
at also want to mention and I don't know
if we call this an eyeliner or what it's
an inner rim brightener and I discovered
this thanks to brunette beauty blogger
here on YouTube but it's the Tarte
emphasized and you know it's like an
eyeliner but you just put it in the
inner rim I'm not wearing it today since
I lined my inner rim but this has got to
be the smoothest easiest to apply thing
to the inner rim and you'll notice
instead of being white it's like just a
little bit peachy
you feel like you look tired all the
time something like this it glides on
you don't want to have to try hard to
put something on that sensitive you know
inner rim this goes on super smooth like
one swipe and it's there so wide I pick
that up and it really is long wearing
eyeliner pencil from the drugstore first
part of this you've heard about before
it's the master drama from Maybelline I
apparently have a real problem with
sharpening things I just don't like to
take the time to get out the sharp and I
also don't like like the little rough
bits of wood that sometimes don't get
sharpened perfectly and then they come
here your eye I'm just not into that so
I love this for the fact that you're not
sharpening it is really long wearing
classic black this doesn't come in a lot
of shades that's my only complaint but
for pure really dark saturated black
that really really lies
and it goes on really smooth this is
like the technology of the high-end long
wearing eyeliners in a drugstore form
for a drugstore price and new and this
is one of those things I'm like why
aren't people talking about these more
these liars from Physicians Formula are
so good and they come in tree Alisa said
brown eyes but you know get whatever
colors appeal to you but you get three
and so I've got like a black a purple
and a brown see that little purple band
on the black that means it has just like
the slightest bit of a purple shimmer
it's really hard to detect unless you do
like a big big swatch but overall it's
black and I'm wearing that as my liner
today and in the waterline and these are
such long wearing creamy eyeliner the
shade range is so awesome like this
purple is really purple and there are so
many other colors like sets that you can
get liquid liner didn't have a high-end
favorite but from the drugstore this is
a new winner this year and it's the Wet
n Wild mega liner it's just so
inexpensive and it works so well it's
not waterproof just so you know if you
needed waterproof this isn't but it is a
bold black eyeliner putting this on like
if I'm going to do false lashes because
you get that blackest black line across
your lash line and then BAM your lashes
go on top and it's just beautiful Ike a
superfine brush tip so I think it's
really easy to get on and maneuver her
cream / gel eyeliner for high-end this
is a three-time winner and I have
branched out and tried some other brands
and I was really unimpressed by how much
they dried out so quickly Mac fluidline
I really enjoy this at this particular
one for at least a couple here it is
still not dry it goes on with as much
ease as when I first got it with like a
little liner brush and it's really long
wearing so props to that for my
drugstore winter it's a new favorite it
goes on every bit as smooth as the liner
from Mac that I just described comes in
so many shades it's again Physicians
Formula with these shimmer strips these
are the cream gel liners they come like
little blocks you know so you come in
said
three and then you can separate them but
you get several shades so this one that
I have it's like a brown a purple and a
black and then I also ended up with this
neutral one that I've been playing with
a lot lately it's glam Brown on and it
gives you a black like a medium brown
and a gold and these can double as great
like long wear shadows but these don't
budge you know you put them on they go
on so creamy I know I've had this one
for quite some time and it's still just
as creamy and think of you like really
started collecting like the kind of
tower you could build with this I mean
it would be awesome I said I tried a lot
of products this year mascaras were one
of those things where I felt like I was
just trying to new mascara all the time
and you know what the high-end winner is
the same winner from last year so it's
kind of like you search and search for
this the next amazing thing but then you
go back to the old but goodie and its
Mally volumizing mascara this is a
mascara that is so rich in black it
manages to take my sparse lashes and
build them up not just in length but in
volume and the look of more lashes and
when you put this on it doesn't take
your lashes and make them feel like
brittle little spider legs or so they
actually maintain their flexibility as
if you know there might be a real
eyelash in there but this is the brush
the brush is awesome is a traditional
brush with kind of thick black bristle
felt like it's never prematurely dried
out or you know gotten old before that 3
to 4 month time for a drugstore mascara
you want to know about my all-star
drugstore lash look it would involve
I'll make it up and grow this is a great
texture of a mascara a phenomenal thick
brush and a formula that's not too wet
it's kind of like a really creamy creamy
thick formula and it builds up sparse
lashes great I've come into this too
many many have said they love it
when I wear this I wear this on top and
then I use my Maybelline lash discovery
on the bottom tiny brush I don't know
why this has not gotten mentioned in
Emily awards because this has been like
no matter what's going on my top lashes
this is always getting worn on the
bottom and it's a teeny tiny brush gives
you just the right look you want on
lower lashes doesn't overload them with
product very easy to use like two swipes
and you're done
things so love those two together as a
look so I wanted to give a shout out to
something that I've come back to in the
past year and it was something I used
all the time back in college and it is
l'oreal double extend it's got the
primer in one end and the mascara and
the of it's got that brush that i like
doesn't that look a heck of a lot like
mallies but when you put that primer on
with this the length is amazing if
you're looking for just something to
give your lashes incredible length this
is going to take you there a lash primer
is a really good thing and this is a
really nice primer that's built in false
lashes the lash of the year for me has
been the demi whispies I believe our del
makes them but I normally buy them from
salon perfect in like a four or a five
pack from Walmart and I've got them on
now they are the kind of lashes that
flare a bit out at the ends and just
give you kind of like a cat eye like you
just pop them on in regardless of the
shadow or the liner you're wearing you
have a cat I'm on my last pair here so I
don't have one to hold up and show your
ID of lengths and some of them kind of
crisscross a little bit and it's just
perfect for looking more natural among
your own lashes ended up with the brows
and I'll tell you what I used on my
brows today and what I've been using and
I think it works so so neat and it's
such a cool little just self-contained
system but it's from Anastacio is is
that how you say it not Anastasia
anyway I'm guys have been talking so
long this is the beauty Express for
brows and eyes I have it in brunette and
what's neat about this is okay you've
got all your instructions here you got
your little brush you've got multiple
stencils here so if you're just looking
to like form your brows for the first
time you can go through and you use the
stencil and you apply the wax and the
powder and then you can pluck your brows
like whatever is outside the stencil you
tweeze them and then you don't have to
keep using the stencil every day I mean
you could but what I did was I just use
the stencil once and mine happen to be
the high arch so I used that and got in
just the shape I wanted and now when I
go in and do my brows I just do some
and then I take it's the lighter of the
two is what I put in and then just kind
of fill in any sparse areas what's
really important to note what this is
this works very well if you might have a
scar or a bear area where you feel like
um like a typical pencil just does not
draw over it I know that sounds weird
but I'm sure there's people who know
what I'm talking about here it's like
the pencil won't write on those areas I
have a scar right on the end here and I
do struggle with filling that in but
this wax and these powders just go on
over it like it was any other area this
is just the perfect color here for me
and then you get a couple of shadows
where you could like brighten your inner
corner or under the brow if you wanted
just these angled brush I've got the
little cap thingy on there but that's a
really nice brushes well from the
drugstore something that I love that
doesn't give you all that shaping stuff
but it does give you like a wax and a
powder which is kind of cool is the elf
eyebrow kit for three bucks if you are
just kind of like wow I like what you're
talking about there but I don't quite
want to go there with the price this
gives you a wax and this is like a
tinted wax so this is medium that I have
here you have a little brush and yes I
use that brush it's like a little angled
one there and then a little like kind of
flat eyeshadow type brain put on this
wax and it kind of helps it sort of
tints the area a little you got the
powder which is kind of like the one
that I mentioned loving and the other
one but you put it on top and you spit
fill in those areas and so this is kind
of a nice little smaller on-the-go type
thing but I love both of those kits so
that's it for eyes as you can see if we
have returning favorites we had some
brand new things coming in bottom line I
have tried a lot of I products so I am
glad to have some closure on this now
and be able to share all those favorites
with us video is going to be Emily
Awards for lips so I hope to see you
again in that video thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
