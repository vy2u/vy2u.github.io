seems like the more products I try the
harder it gets and everybody wants me to
hurry up you've been doing it since 2008
maybe this time you need a little help
oh don't get any big ideas or anything
but I guess I could use the help
they're swatches yet cupcake I'm gonna
need a little bit of help here this is
pink manly stuff Ellen's Mally if it
looks pretty just put it on the lessons
what do they mean by bikini contest that
sounds awesome
I bet you wish you were in a bikini
contest right now everything done for
face yes all right I think I got a
finished up
hey everybody can you believe it it's
that time again it's time for the Emily
Awards this is where I share my favorite
products of the year and I do it for
high-end and drugstore various
categories so this is the first of
several videos for the Emily awards this
one's focusing on face products so it's
going to be you know primers and
foundations and powders blushes bronzers
and things like that so I hope you enjoy
my picks we're gonna get through and
kind of quickly so we can get to
everything and then the video after this
will be the favorites for eyes so
that'll be something else to keep an eye
out for a few products here and there
where I may not have both a high end and
a drugstore favorite and that's just
basically because I haven't discovered a
great product for that particular
category and I'm not gonna try to dig
and just talk about something for the
sake of talking about something for this
video so these are genuine favorite they
have won in years past that'll
definitely be pointed out because I
think that really speaks to the quality
of a product if as I've tried more and
more things that continues to be a
favorite first one for high-end is a
first-time winner and it's the Mallee
perfect prep primer I absolutely love
this primer and I've gone through one
already it is a truly unique texture
it's kind of like a super light whipped
cream except instead of feeling you know
moist on the skin after you apply it it
feels totally silky and anytime I'm
doing someone else's makeup I make sure
to use this because everyone comments on
just how luxurious this really feels on
the skin really just enhances the
staying power of your foundation helps
it go on more smoothly and evenly so I
love my drugstore pick is a two-time
winner and it is Rimmel fix and perfect
Pro this is a primer that really does
smooth out the skin it doesn't have a
real slick feel after you apply it like
some of those silicone based primers
have but I really feel like it does a
good job of evening out the skins
texture which is something I look for in
a primer because that is what allows the
foundation to go on more smooth that is
something that does enhance the staying
power of it because you don't have you
some light patches and some places where
it clings and things like that
I am liquid foundation we've got a new
one coming in this year and it really
took me by surprise here at the tail end
of the year because I loved my mac
prolongwear I thought this is good
coverage this is good staying power but
then I tried something many people told
me I should try if I really want a long
wearing foundation and it's Estee Lauder
Double Wear and I must say this just
kind of blew my mind in the coverage
department amazing coverage really a
full coverage foundation if that's what
you're looking for was the coverage that
kind of took it above mac prolongwear
for me
they were pretty equal in staying power
but this one just I mean you could put
it on and you really felt flawless and
it just works so well in the drugstore
another new favorite but I mean it's
kind of new because I've loved Revlon
Colorstay I love how Revlon Colorstay
liquid comes in two formulas one for
more dry and normal skin and one for
combo to oily skin and if you are really
in one of those two categories for sure
I think that's what you want to look
into in terms of the way it applies and
just how wonderful the finish is on the
skin
I love the new Revlon Colorstay whipped
cream makeup this goes on like a dream
I love applying it with my Sigma f80
breath you like the staying power is
totally there with this one but it's
just easier to work with texture than
the other liquid color stays that seemed
to kind of set rather quickly when you
would apply maybe a slightly more
natural-looking finish on the skin than
the color stay traditional liquids have
three-time winner for high-end mineral
foundation if you see me look down I'm
looking at my little database of all the
winners so I can see how many times
they've won but this is Mac mineralized
skinfinish natural this is a pressed
mineral foundation and I just love the
way it goes on I think it can be a good
standalone product maybe with a little
concealer underneath for those areas
where you need more coverage and then
apply this for a natural-looking
foundation this can also really enhance
any liquid if you put this on top it
gives it a flawless yet still natural
finish feel I don't feel like this is
the most matte powder I've ever tried so
that can still give you a pretty natural
look on the skin for drugstore price
range mineral foundation this is
something that has won for 5 years I
love this I have tried other mineral
foundations from the drugstore nothing
compares do my everyday minerals
everyday minerals the prices it's an
online brand but the prices are pretty
much equivalent to drugstore you've got
different formulations for different
skin types or skin needs so in other
words you can get totally super matte
coverage or you can get something with a
little bit more of a glow to it but I
love the whole line
I love the blushes I love the
foundations I think if you're wanting a
great mineral foundation this is
definitely a good one to try
one returning favorite and one new
favorite for high-end concealer one of
the things that I've loved so much it
has been from bareMinerals and it's a
product called bisque the shade I have
it in is summer bisque there's also a
product called well-rested that is I
feel like an even lighter shade of this
kind of a coverage product and think of
like your bare minerals foundation but
something with even more coverage to it
more concentrated pigment I feel like it
just really is great if you want to use
this alone as a concealer or I've done a
video called full coverage concealer
trick where I use this on top of another
concealer it may not even be a great
cream or liquid concealer but when you
apply this on top you get a completely
mattified area it doesn't take much I
think people sometimes make the mistake
of weigh over using this product just
takes a little but when you set your
under-eye concealer with it it can
really make a huge difference in the
amount of coverage you had another
concealer I really thought was worth
mentioning because I love the coverage
it has paired with a fairly lightweight
feel and it's the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and this is the first time I
tried this was this year and I've just
been thrilled with how well this works
it has a little pump on it and I like
the pump I find out it maybe pumps out a
little more than I need and so I wish
there was more control in that aspect
but overall I gotta say this is
something that packs in wonderful amount
of coverage while not feeling they brand
new favorite for drugstore concealer
this is a really new product and I was
really on the fence about giving it an
Emily award because I love my Revlon
Photoready stick concealer thought it
was one of the best stick concealers
from the drugstore then I ran into this
which I feel like provides even more
hydration I guess to a stick concealer
whereas in the old base they were all
like really really dry cakey too thick
to use in my opinion and now there's
something from covergirl plus Olay
called concealer balm and ever since
I've tried this I've been in look
coverage may not be quite as much as
that Mac Pro Longwear that I described
but for a drugstore concealer for
something that doesn't feel
it doesn't look cakey and it is able to
work on say under-eye circles or
discoloration elsewhere on your face
spots redness so wonder then another
thing I want to mention it is sold at
Target $15 kind of on the verge of not
being drugstore anymore but I consider
it still a drugstore product and it's
the pixie correction concentrate and
brightening peach
I've talked and talked about how great a
salmon tone concealer is for tackling
like those bluish under-eye circles we
can get and this is that peachy colored
salmony concealer that you can use to
really counteract that problem so if
you're looking for something like this
I know benefit Bobbi Brown you know
great high-end alternatives to that but
this is probably the lowest cost most
effective peach tone concealer that I've
brought loose powder and this could
technically be seen as a finishing
powder but I sometimes like to just use
it to set a foundation and it's the it
cosmetics bye bye pores really feel like
it does not give the white cast that
some finishing powders can give and it
just totally feels SuperDuper cement
really does kind of mask the appearance
of pores put it over blush over
highlight it won't take away the
appearance of those products but it will
give your skin just a totally perfect
look and I love that
now I have a favorite for drugstore
pressed powder and it is a let's see a
two-time three-time winner and it is
L'Oreal True Match and I recently
discovered another pressed powder that I
think is awesome it's the Revlon nearly
naked it feels a lot like this it's a
really smooth textured powder that
doesn't feel so dry and it doesn't seem
to just sit on top of the skin and look
like powder I feel the same way
basically about true matches just true
match comes in a lot more shades and it
gives the individual buying just many
more options to get a really accurate
match for their skin tone so that's why
I'm choosing true matches my favorite
foundation we have a two-time repeat
winner here it's laura geller balance
and Brighton love this stuff so much
this is a powder that actually starts as
a cream it's baked and it becomes this
powder swirled with lots of different
colors it's got some yellow tone in
there so it really has phenomenal
coverage this is another one of those
products like the Mac MSF that I
mentioned that can really work well on
its own or you can top a foundation and
give it some hardcore coverage mom
really enjoys this product I love it too
and I feel like with any of the laura
geller baked products they will last you
a really really long time doesn't take
much to get the coverage and the look
that you're after two-time winner for
the drugstore powder foundation I've got
to give it to the Milani multitasker
there's probably not another drugstore
powder that has coverage like this has
sexually smooth and this can be built up
for super Matt big coverage or you can
use it a little more lightly maybe
applied with a brush
first time winner for the high-end
bronzer and I love my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil but something else just
kind of edged it out a little bit this
year and it's Laura Geller it's my
bronzed and brighten this is kind of an
interesting looking bronzer you're
thinking wow that looks kind of light
it's world with some very very dark
tones and some very light colors like
light beige a little bit of pink in
there as maybe just the slightest amount
of Sheen to it
not much overall like I keep this in
with my matte bronzers you pop this on
your skin and it looks just so fresh or
bronzer got a new favorite I tell you
what I've been using this bronzer like
you wouldn't believe it's the Revlon
Photoready bronzer comes in one shade
called bronzed and chic but it has four
shades in there so - or lighter - or
deeper this is a really great contouring
product they're totally matte and so you
might use the lighter shades be like
okay I just need to you know pump up my
skin tone a little bit but then use the
deeper shades to contour your cheekbones
somewhat it's great I love this it's a
little bit pricier than some I've
recommended before from the drugstore
for the bronzer category but I think
it's so worth it for the way it's put
together with those varying shades 100%
matte love it
Cayenne blush I do have a new winner
this year yep first time and I'm giving
it to the blushes from the balm I love
all of my blushes from this brand
especially I love hot mama it is a
gorgeous kind of like peachy coral shade
I love down boy it's kind of like a
pinky like really true classic cool pink
color frat-boy peachy pink works for
everything wearing that one today a very
very pigmented only takes a little but
yet they're still very easy to blend in
and use so I love those drugstore
blushes I also have two new winners this
is six I first time for my ELF studio
blushes if you haven't tried these out
these are $3 apiece and the colors that
they put out I think are really great
choices they've got a
Coralie one I love this one called
blushing Rose because I feel like that
is like a great wintertime blush you put
it on and it's like you just came at it
came in from being outside in the cold
it's beautiful some blush shades you
just don't see from other brands and
they're so pigmented pink passion it
goes on more sheer than that but it's a
beautiful color it's tied with the
blushes from wet and wild wet and wild
again similar texture there to those elf
studio blushes highly pigmented one
great one that has a little bit of a
pearly shimmer is pearlescent pink and
then a great matte one full on color is
Heather silk that I love so much new
winner this is from NARS
it's the multiple in orgasm and this is
kind of like an all-over sort of glowy
product it's that color right there kind
of peachy golden it has definitely some
golden glow and shimmer there I think it
looks really pretty on top of the
cheekbone really glad I picked it up
because I think it just instantly
freshens up the face another new winter
cream blush from the drugstore and with
some of these I've just chosen you know
a total line like all of the balm
blushes I love for this one it's a
specific shade of cream blush it's the
Maybelline Dream bouncy blush in Hot
Tamale
this shade might scare you but I promise
it is so so pretty and by the way it's
fun to press on but it's this kind of a
shape like applying this with a small
stipple brush you literally just dab it
down into the product and you stipple it
onto the cheeks and it gives just the
most beautiful glow I love this color
high-end highlights I'm giving it to
lorac perfectly lit powder and spotlight
three-time winner amazing highlight I
mean we're talking about a highlight
that gives brightness to the face where
you want it but does not overload you on
shimmer you like when you put this on
not only does it brighten it covers a
little bit as well so a very unique
quality for a highlight to have and I
love that and I identified its dupe also
in my highlight dupes video and guess
what the dupe is also a favorite it's
wet and wild color icon bronzer in
reserve your Cabana I feel like this is
definitely a highlight shade though and
it's along the same lines as lorac in
that it is light it's brightening but it
does not overload you with shimmer it
gives you the contrast you want because
that's what highlighting is all about
you highlight and you also have contrast
with where you contoured and so this is
just gorgeous very affordable tons of
product in here if you don't want to
shell out the money for Laura to go for
this one
for a finishing powder I don't really
have a finishing powder so to speak I
mean I guess you could have seen the it
cosmetics as sort of a powder slash
finishing powder but I never used this
immediately after I apply my makeup but
i use it as a touch-up product maybe I
should change the category but this is
the Mallee ever color poreless face
defender this is clear and when you put
this on you dab it on with the sponge so
I'd like to twist my sponge on there dab
it over your face and it just kind of
perfects the area it does mattify it
does help kind of conceal the pores and
it just freshens more than anything like
it gives your makeup a look of more like
being freshly applied as opposed to
sitting on your face for hours and hours
so it's a great thing on the go that
