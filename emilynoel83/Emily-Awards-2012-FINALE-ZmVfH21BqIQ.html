Awards have been sharing top beauty
products with beauty enthusiasts around
the world this year we take you inside
the testing process Oh what's going on
in here I'm working on the dance for the
finale you know does it have a dance in
it like the grand finale a dance routine
I don't think we really need a dance
routine or do
we made it to the finale of the Emily
Awards for 2012 thank you so much for
supporting these videos this year like
you have and I just feel like there's
been so much excitement it's been so
much fun I've just really enjoyed
putting these together for you got a lot
of questions like are you gonna do
something on brushes or skin care or
hair and that's really what the finale
is all about mention my favorite brushes
also the makeup MVPs most valuable
products then we do a few for best
skincare best body products best hair
products and best nail products coz
that's not to say I'm not going to do
like a full-blown skincare routine
sometime soon mentioning every little
product but this video is really about
the total stand outs from the past year
starting off with high end but still a
brand that I consider to be affordable a
step down in price for example from Mac
brushes and that is Sigma the complete
kit has won in years pasture the
essential kit past I've mentioned the
kind that comes with the brush roll and
I think that brush roll is really great
but what's been appealing to me even
more and I have different little cups
around in my makeup area are the make me
collections and those are the ones that
come with the two cups where you can
store you know all your brushes in the
Sigma kit and then some or like your
liners or different things that are just
you know fit in the cup and then you
have to to sit out on your vanity or on
your sink if you're traveling to a hotel
you know you can just pop them open and
use them that way I sometimes split it
up is keep the face brushes in one and
the eye brushes in another if I'm taking
these I'm using them somewhere and this
is the set because you don't often see
me using these two ones on myself I use
these on others when I'm going to do
makeup on somebody else I kind of
reserved them for that is the essential
brush kit in here and these are probably
the brushes I use the most
I'm you've got a great big powder brush
here you've got a wonderful angled blush
brush your stippling brush a traditional
flat foundation brush and you can go to
the website and give these all closer
look for yourself but I mean I brushes
that I use all the time and tutorials
you know just a flat eyeshadow brush
that you can pack the shadow on with
you've got a great blending brush here
also a pencil brush which is great for
smoky looks and smudgy liner an angled
eye brush for more precise eyeliner
looks will ask me you know what's a kit
that I can just buy one kit and have
everything I need I really feel like
this is the kit that gives you gives it
all to you in just a couple of other
Sigma brushes that I think are worth the
mention just because I've used them so
much this year and they are the f80 and
also it's like little baby the p80 and
so this is just like a miniature version
of this one I really like the flat top
brushes that Sigma has they've made
different styles and they're still good
there's still the nice quality dense
super soft these are synthetic brushes
but why I like these that are cut very
blunt straight across flat top is that
they work the best in circular motion
well they have this great Brown top
brush there's not as much flexibility
there with the bristles it's more
tightest brush it is able to just the
the bristles have a little more mobility
there when it comes to working in
circular motions and that's why I feel
like it's perfect for buffing in
Foundation and really it's the same
story with this little flat guy to use
for your creamy concealer products it's
really nice to get right in there in
that inner eye area and then you buff it
out and you don't feel like you've over
blended your eye your concealer products
which can sometimes be what takes away
the coverage is because you actually
wipe it away with your fingers sometimes
so this could be a nice little blending
tool for that or drugstore brushes in
the last part of the year here I have
been trying out some more of the Real
Techniques brushes because many people
told me these are great and they do kind
of follow that same sort of feel as
those last couple of sigma ones I
mentioned you know really soft really
densely packed bristles are sold at Ulta
stores and one is the expert face brush
and this is another great foundation
kind of blending gradually more tapered
down the sides it has a little bit of a
tighter feel than the Sigma one that I
mentioned but I think it's still good
for blending out a cream or a liquid
foundation for some great drugstore eye
brushes and these are crazy cheap but so
good I've been really impressed they are
the target
brand these don't cost more than a
couple of dollars apiece and there's two
that I would really suggest you look in
so one is called smudge but it's really
about the size of like a flat eyeshadow
brush but it's not too terribly big to
show you like in relation to my eyelid
you can see how that could easily Pat a
shadow all over your lid or kind of
wedge it into the crease and build up an
outer V or that sort of things so that
one's called smudge and it's worn off
I've worn the name off the handle but
that's that one and then what I got more
recently it's called crease and I swear
this is a fantastic size for a crease
brush it's not too big it really is very
good for getting right in there these
are really soft brushes they did not
skimp on like the amount of bristles
packed in there outstanding tool I have
to give it to really some kind of unsung
heroes of my makeup bag because I think
about these all the time when I travel
or clean my brushes and those are two
times when I'm not necessarily shooting
a video to talk about them but they are
something called brush guards these I've
seen them you can order them or buy them
at Walmart they come in multiple sizes
you don't have a really great way to
transport your brushes this is a great
way to protect them as you travel they
can also be used when you clean them but
basically they slide on your brush like
that you pull them just a little way
past the tip and nothing's gonna mess
with your brush now it's gonna be nicely
shaped and that's where it comes in in
the cleaning aspect as well there's
smaller sizes that can get down to yours
you know very tiny brushes but when
you're cleaning let's say you've just
you know rinse them off and the brush is
wet you pull them past and then you
stand them down in a glass like this and
so not only is this shaping the brush
and it's helping to kind of squeeze out
some excess liquid the fact that you're
sitting this down in a glass everything
all that moisture is kind of being
pulled downward so I feel like it makes
for a faster cleaning for brushes so
love when I travel with my little kabuki
brush and it's like there is no good
slot in my makeup bag to hold that brush
for trap but there is a rather large
brush guard and it will totally expand
you can see here to cover that kabuki
brush and nothing's gonna happen the
bristles aren't gonna get messed with or
deform or whatever the end of the year
to me that has really brought about an
interesting formulation an interesting
function for me that's the it cosmetics
vitality lip flush go back to my lips
video and watch for more information on
these but basically what these are or a
highly highly moisturizing product that
will stain your lips give your lips
gorgeous color but at the same time make
them feel just as comfortable as ever
look like a lipstick and when you apply
them you get full-on color that you
might expect from a lipstick moist er
that it provides does hang around a long
time but even after that glossiness kind
of starts to fade you still have color
on your lips and it's color that does
not bleed up into lines that you may
have around your lips if you've
struggled with that I mean these are
like the new age of long wearing lip
products as a whole the brand the balm I
think we can all agree from the things
I've shown throughout the Emily Awards
they have adorable packaging with
everything the way they package their
blushes you know the little characters
they almost associate with some of their
things like Matt from meet Matt nude you
know this this Matt they're talking
about matte eyeshadows but they've
developed this character named Matt and
they've named all of their shadows after
someone named Matt so it's just really
fun you know the thing from their whole
brand that has really taken the cake for
me this year is that rock star balm jovi
palette showed this in the Emily awards
for eyes but they've taken all of their
shadows and given them like a fun play
on a band like Alice copper instead of
Alice Cooper from a practical sense I
love that they didn't have to make this
something gigantic to still work in fun
smart you know witty humor with all this
they gave you a couple of face products
and lip products named milli and Vanilli
which I thought was funny and also the
top for smoking hot looks here it's it
looks just like a billboard chart down
at the bottom showing you actually how
to use everything in this palette
together so I think it's it is practical
but it also is soo
that needs to be in your purse this is a
repeat winner because when I forget and
don't have these in my purse that'll be
the time when I need one it's like it's
just it has to be there and they have
neat little travel packs for these but
I'm talking about q-tips it is such a
basic inexpensive item in the realm of
beauty but yet it is the thing that can
be a multi multi problem solver for you
you had a watery eye allergy day and
your makeups not looking so fresh I mean
you can really take these under the eye
area and get rid of some problems you
know it's not makeup touch-ups I've said
it before are not all about adding more
on but sometimes it's a matter of taking
away if your lip product you know if you
had a red lip day and the red lips not
looking so hot anymore you know you can
go around and neaten up your lip line
again times eyeliner unattractively
collects in the inner corner you all
know what I'm talking about I mean one
press away and you're done perhaps one
of the best functions I've discovered in
the past year for the q-tip is the under
eye blot and this is great for people
who say my concealer always creases gets
into creases under my eye and it
collects in there the greatest thing
that this can do is you go under there
and if got a line and you just blot over
that line you can do this right after
you finish your makeup or a couple hours
later if that's when you discover it you
blot over it it will lift any excess
concealer that has settled into fine
lines right onto this q-tip throw it
away
you'd be done with it and you don't have
anymore that excess product there under
your eye now we get into the MVPs that
stands for of course most valuable
product and the one for face I'm giving
it this year to the Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation this has been a
game-changing foundation this year it is
for me the staying power of regular
color stay but it's in a texture that I
feel like comes off a little more
natural on the skin and it blends so
easily with this can be figuring out
your color because you do have to look
through a giant glass jar to figure that
out and sometimes it distorts the color
a little bit as a whole I find this to
be such a high quality foundation you
get it I mean at a drugstore price which
I think we all love MVP four-eyes took
me forever to figure this one out
because I mean I thought I could easily
go with a great eyeliner that I
mentioned in the Emily awards or a
mascara I've had amazing eyeshadows and
then I just thought wait you know aside
from all of that say it's a big night
you know a huge event you've got to look
your best what is that one thing that
it's like irreplaceable for an eye look
and this year I'm giving it to the false
eyelashes baby I mean this is the thing
that that takes up any woman a huge
notch in terms of glamour I did my
friend Callie's makeup this past weekend
we pop some false eyelashes on her she
was not used to wearing them she looked
at herself in the mirror and thought
wowza like what product gives you that
kind of an instant lift to the face just
ultimate femininity gorgeousness it is
false lashes I'm sorry but nothing no
mascara does what these kinds of things
do if you're wondering what I love I get
the salon perfect kind from Walmart it's
the demi whispies our del makes the same
style too but they're longer on the
outsides shorter on the insides and
they're not cut with absolute like
perfection blunt cut you've got a mix of
shorter and longer lashes in there I'm
wearing them now and that's what makes
them blend so well with natural lash
it's like what is that identifying
factor that makes a smiley face go from
male to female it's like when you see a
couple eyelashes they're you know that's
the girl you know it lashes are just
awesome and I had to give that a mention
empathy paper lips this year that's
another category I feel like it could
gone to a lot of different things but I
am going to say my Neutrogena moisture
smooth color sticks one of those
products it's like a little Emily Awards
bandit you know it comes in at the end
and it takes out all the other products
I'm wearing this one today and one of
the deeper colors I wanted to show you
how that looked this is rich raisin
looks like this in the package and it
doesn't like you know start to migrate
outside my lip total comfort you guys
heard me saying the lips video they're
the sweatpants of lip products because
they are just so easy to wear you know
so comfortable I can't get over it so I
love the pink in sweetwater melon and
there's a caramel color that's sort of a
noon as you can see it's not like overly
glossy it's not something that has a
greasy feel at all it feels like a lip
balm but better and with color Bilka
best skin care products and I am kind of
in a phase where I am reworking some of
the skincare items on my list like my
moisturizers and serums and things like
that so I'll get to an updated routine
soon but I have three still three
awesome things that are not gonna change
because they are just great one thing
that has just been such a long time
essential in my collection and you're
probably predicting it in your head
right now what I'm going to say but it's
the Olay Daley facials cloths I just had
to pick up a new box when we were out
traveling because I ran out normally
when I go somewhere like everybody wants
to use one of these to to like take off
their makeup they're like oh that's
handy and so what these are are just
face wash cloths they are dry and you
wet them down and they suds up a little
bit and they take off all my makeup I'm
talking about I make up stuff on my lip
stuff on my face it gets it all off with
this I know people like the
pre-moistened cloths and stuff but I
don't like the thought of having any
sort of residue on my face
so I love to get all the makeup off give
it a splash and then dry my face off and
I am totally 100% clean on the face also
use the equate brand from Walmart I
think those are called hydrating face
washcloths but I don't like
branch out a whole lot more than that
because I've had some sting II I
experiences with some auth brands from
like dollar stores and stuff like better
must have skincare product is what I use
whenever I have a breakout and I just
realized I've never mentioned this
before in an Emily Awards and it totally
deserves it
it is the clean and clear Percy gel ten
it's 10 percent benzoyl peroxide and
this I use this just as a spot treatment
if I have a zit I can put some of this
on it you can wear it you know under
your foundation and it can be treating
that pimple or before bed it's even
better because you're not layering on
more makeup
we're often than not when I get up in
the morning I've seen a huge improvement
like this thing just dries them up like
nobody's business i third mentioned for
best skincare products is going to an
eye cream and I know I am kind of
changing you know some of my skincare
but this is definitely a standout star
and it is the Neutrogena rapid wrinkle
repair eye cream I don't have a ton of
wrinkles around my eye but I do have
some fine lines and I feel like this has
been even more effective than something
I spent probably three times the amount
on from philosophy I got the I hope and
I kind of felt like that is not doing
quite as my really concentrate on this
area right here
and I feel like I've seen improvement in
fine lines and that era does have
retinol in it it's not overly greasy or
super thick so you can feel comfortable
wearing it under your makeup that's
sometimes an issue with really emollient
eye products best body products I'm
going to mention three here as well the
first one is a great self tanner that
I've loved this year that I'm probably
going to get back to using pretty soon
but it is the San Tropez bronzing mousse
this is still a supersize that I got
maybe last year from QVC and I'm still
working on because there's so much but I
love this so much because it dries so
fast so this really gives you deep dark
color and the non streaky aspect of this
comes from the numb I do rinse this off
every time but it's inevitably got a
little bit of staining but I just put
the mousse on here you rub it all over
and the fact that this is so wide this
takes the finger streaking out of the
equation and it covers such a surface
area as you apply so you don't have to
feel like you're going over the same
area again and again with your hands
which is always attendance at some
horrible experiences with certain
sunless Tanner's wearing off causing me
to look patchy like a leopard I mean
this doesn't do that also for those
times when you have slacked a bit on
your sunless tanning which has been me
over the course of the entire winter but
then you're a bridesmaid at a wedding
and your legs are going to show and you
want them to look nice
these Sally Hansen airbrush legs I have
it in deep glow so this does give you
kind of a tan and this is a spray
product and as you can see my sprayer
has gotten a bit messy here but the way
I use this I don't just spray it on my
legs because I feel like it can get kind
of messy I make a little cup out of my
hand
I do like five or six like sprays of
this into my hand and I mix it with some
body lotion any kind of lotion and then
I just apply it on my legs like a lotion
and what it is is like a bronzer but it
have any kind of imperfection on your
legs this product covers and it tans use
this on the rest of your body as well I
mean mixing it with lotion really gives
you a little more freedom and a little
more ease with how you apply it
one more mention for best body products
and this is for the philosophy three and
one shower gels cinnamon buns one of my
favorite scents also I just love the
unconditional love sin has a little bit
of a vanilla blackberry kind of vibe
there I just love it it's a very
particular scent I don't smell anything
else that smells like this and that is
why I like that same story with
intergrade like this is very calming
relaxing it doesn't have like a lavender
scent to it at all but it's just a
really soothing smell
now for best hair products so three of
my top top things and one of them has
been a winner for three years and it's
the Tresemme tray to hairspray so I have
big cans of this I go through entire
cans on a regular basis I just feel like
this is great for locking in whatever
style I might want to have am I'm doing
a loose style like this I'd love to
spray a little bit on because I feel
like it can really help in the staying
power of the car so I use it on the
level 4 and this is easily found in any
drugstore dollar store discount store
you name another best hair product and
this happens to come from Tresemme as
well and it is called the liquid gold
shine therapy and this is something I
use in the shower about once a week kind
of as a deep conditioner it changes the
look of your hair the feel of your hair
absolutely because of this shine and the
soft what you do after you shampoo your
hair you focus this mainly on like the
lower half of your hair toward the end
we've been on there for 3 to 5 minutes
in the shower and then you just rinse it
out so it's kind of functions like a lot
of deep conditioners do but I feel like
my hair has had such a nice shine what
I've been using this finally in the best
hair category I've got to give it to a
curling iron that has really just lasted
me for so long I used to use a lot of
Revlon curling irons love the Revlon
makeup but I tell you the curling irons
just I mean have conked out on me way
too soon on numerous occasions this I
got from Sally Beauty Supply thing was
at least a couple years ago and it says
Hot Shot tools Helen of Troy and it is a
pink curling iron the size is relatively
small this is always what I use on my
hair before I put my hair around velcro
rollers it's up so fast it has a nice
long cord this little guy here has never
gotten loose on me or anything like that
I mean I'm just thinking of the things
that have gone wrong with my past
curling irons and this one has done so
well so check out the curling irons at
Sally Beauty Supply I mean this one I
for some reason I think this was 30 to
40 dollars but I mean for not having to
replace it or having any issues with it
I think it's well worth it
for best nails I've got to go with the
thing that has been really the only kind
of nail product that has been on my
nails since probably June of last year
like since my first time using it
I have not applied any other kind of
nail polish and it is the Mallee 24/7
gel nail system I mean this is what I've
been using it involves the LED light so
you put your nails under here to cure it
all in all it is like a 35 to 40 minute
process for me so I think I've said
before it you know have a little hot
chocolate have a little wine you know
put pop on your favorite YouTube videos
and away you go it's kind of a nice
relaxing experience really but you buy
the kit and you get all of the products
involved like a gel primer a base coat a
top coat you get three polishes when you
buy the whole kit but then on top of
that I've gotten a few more for example
forever your girl the shade I have now I
bought that separately also love Cruella
which is a great read and to to is a
nice really like almost white shade on
the nail it's nice neutral to go with
every the bottom-line advantage for
these gel nails what keeps me using them
again and again is that they stay
perfect for two to three weeks I mean I
never do have them chip on me the only
issue is that your nails grow out a
little bit so you want to redo them at
that time but two or three weeks I mean
you're guaranteed good-looking nails
that don't go anywhere and I'm not the
kind that likes to redo my nails every
week or multiple times in a week or
anything like that I just want nails
that look nice and polished and finished
and not have to worry about them when
I'm doing dishes or you know doing
something where you know you're probably
gonna have a chip otherwise but here
they like so I love the whole system
can't say enough about it haven't had to
repurchase anything I mean I haven't ran
out of anything in my little bottle or
removal I like the foil method because I
think it makes it so easy and there are
multiple YouTube videos saying how to do
that so if you're interested you can
look that so that wraps it up thank you
so much for tuning in for the Emily
awards this year it's been extra fun
with some extra goofy silly intros so
I'm glad you enjoyed them
and hope you'll continue to stay tuned
to my channel for a lot more new videos
to come see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
