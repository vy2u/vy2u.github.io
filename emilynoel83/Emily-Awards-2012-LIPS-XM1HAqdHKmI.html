Awards have been sharing top beauty
products with beauty enthusiasts around
the world this year we take you inside
the testing process
cupcake you're just in time
nachos anyone Mama's hungry oh come on
lump it lip plumper what do they mean by
plump it I'll just try it again all
right
welcome to my world
obsessive compulsive cosmetics it's not
a personal problem all right I think I
got it finished
everybody welcome to part 3 of the Emily
Awards I've been looking forward to this
one because I really am a lip product
fanatic whether it's bombs or glosses or
lipsticks I mean there's been so many
new products coming out lately I'm
excited to tell you about some of them
that have been Award winners this time
around there were some decisions with
this category where I was like I'm gonna
have to go to bed and like sleep on it
and get up the next morning and figure
out what's gonna be the winner do not
take these decisions lightly starting
off with lip balm and this year I really
didn't have a high-end kind that I felt
like I was using a lot or finding to be
really outstanding
however for drugstore there were a lot
that I've been using
but the winner again this year and yes
they're right here iOS smooth sphere lip
balms I really really like these I was
just sitting around the house and I want
something you know a little moisture on
my lips I grab one of these I keep one
like on my end table in the living room
but I also like to use them as a lip
primer because I feel like they're not
too like greasy slick on my lips that
they're really nice to wear under a
lipstick or a lip liner or even a lip
gloss or something like that so they're
all really great I love the sweet mint
that would be a definite favorite also
love the lemon it's a really fresh if
you throw them in your bag you're a lot
more likely to be able to like reach
your hand in and know what it is without
looking for tinted lip balm high-end
again this was one of those categories
that for me in the past year it was
totally dominated by drugstore tinted
lip balms like I didn't have a high-end
one that I loved but I tried so many
drugstore kinds so last year Revlon lip
butter won in this category and I really
I don't know if I hadn't tried enough of
their deeper shades at that time but I
really this year classified them more as
a lipstick with a little extra hydration
in there but I think they're definitely
they go beyond a tinted lip balm so what
I have in this category for this year is
two to drugstore favorites
one is the Maybelline Baby Lips I think
these are just so handy
I mean if you want that thing to throw
on your lips with just a little bit of
color that you really don't need a
mirror to apply these are great my
favorite kinds are the cherry one so
that's like a nice sheer red it's kind
of like popsicle red and then the one
that is peach I think it's called peach
kiss yes like your shimmery nude I feel
like anybody can wear those and they
feel so comfortable on another kind that
I love from the drugstore is this
Neutrogena revitalizing lip balm the
packaging is very you know down to
business here but they are kind of a
different shape they're an oval shape
which I do like and they just have some
really pretty colors that are also very
you know moisturizing so I like petal
glow if you like a light pink and then
they've got a really pretty berry shade
- it's called sunny berry and it looks
like that for high-end lipliner my
favorite this year is from Too Faced and
it's the perfect lips and these are
really nice because they're retractable
lip liners that you don't have to
sharpen and they are so creamy and
smooth so if you're the type that likes
to fill in your whole lips with your lip
liner like I do these are really really
great for that and I have a couple of
specific kinds that I love this one
called perfect red really is a great red
lip line and I think you really do need
a red lip liner when you're doing a red
lip it just gives you a lot more on
precision with the look but I also like
a perfect spice I have a nude as well
but this one's just a little deeper than
their nude and I feel like it gives
always more definition to a light lip
this spice shade that's just a hair
darker than most nude color my drugstore
favorite has been a favorite for 1 2 3 4
years now and it's the Jordana easy
liners these are so great I love them
because they're inexpensive they come in
a lot of colors and they go on very
smooth so for a neutral shade tawny is a
good option one of the ones I use the
most from this line is the pink and it's
called baby berry so that's kind of like
my go-to for a pink lip know that you
could really ask for anything more from
a lip liner I mean they're inexpensive
they don't bleed outside the lip line at
least the shades I've tried
and they're just so user friendly with
not having to sharpen four jumbo pencil
high-end
I'm gonna give it to tarte lipsurgence I
feel like these are one of my standout
products from tarts line and they really
stand out in my whole makeup collection
I've gotten a lot of different shades
and purchased you know sets and
multiples and stuff like that the one
I'm showing you today is ensuite and
it's a pretty kind of peachy with a
golden shimmer these have a little bit
of a minty feel to them they're really
comfortable on the lips very hydrating
you just twist them up they don't really
keep their nice little point but opposed
to a lipstick you still end up with a
decent amount of control my drugstore
jumbo lip pencil favorite like came out
of nowhere I tried one of these I bought
it from Walgreens not all that long ago
and I was like okay I'll just give it a
try
fell in love with the formula went back
and purchased three more shade these
Neutrogena moisture smooth color sticks
are like the sweatpants of lip products
I mean they are so comfortable on your
lips you put them on they look pretty
they feel good I'm wearing one right now
this is the pink shade you're gonna hear
more about this later in sweet
watermelon love that pink I can't even
describe how creamy and comfortable they
are I was wearing one of these the other
day it lasted me through like the entire
morning and even after I ate some of the
color had worn off but my lips still
felt soft you know Regina even in years
past it's done a great job with some of
their lip products and this one has got
to be one of the best I've tried from
the line they've got a neutral that it's
called warm caramel so if you're into
that that's good
the first one I got was soft raspberry
and so that's kind of like a very
wearable berry type shade it's not real
dark but if you do like something deeper
rich raisin and they have like a fruity
scent to them it smells like a jello
packet like before you mix up the jello
it's like that concentrated really
fruity scent you try these get back to
me and tell me if you agree with me on
that because I feel like I'm get on with
that scent description
you only notice the scent really like as
you open it up and you give it away if
you're like wow that smells fruity you
put it on your lips it doesn't have like
a real it doesn't have a flavor to it
you don't keep smelling it so if scent
annoys you you don't have to worry about
that that you will notice it like as
soon as you open it you take a whiff
you're like woah fruity
her favorite high-end lip plumper got to
give it to buxom I love these lip
plumping glosses by bare essentials they
come in so many colors I always want to
get like the new holiday pack every year
from Pink's to berries to more nude
shades I've got a lot of these little
guys because like I said I get the multi
packs but they go on with a lot of great
color they also last longer than pretty
much any other lip gloss I put on there
just a little bit thicker they have a
little bit of a minty sort of tingle to
them if you're not into lip plumpers you
know you may not be interested at all
but even just as a gloss when I'm
thinking about topping off a lipstick or
a lip liner with some kind of gloss this
is one of my top formulas to go to
because I know it is gonna wear a long
time from the drugstore this year I'm
really glad I ran into the pump it up
lip plumper from NYX I've got a couple
of shades in this Jessica is like a
really pretty shimmery nude and Lindsay
is a pink shade that's just really
reflective like if you're looking for
that loss to put in the center of your
lower lip to make it seem fuller and
catch the light you really do feel kind
of a tingle with these I feel like they
make the lips look fuller do you want to
experiment with something like that NYX
would probably be the place to start
it's a much lower cost and then you
could move on to the buxom if you
realize you like it a lot
her lip stain for high-end if you keep
up with my videos you know I've
indicated you know what this was gonna
be and I just can't wait to tell you
about this ultra unique lip product that
seems to do something nothing else does
and it's from it cosmetics it's called
the vitality lip flush and what these
are they look like a typical lipstick
but they do really stain your lips and
they're about as hydrating as any lip
balm so I mean seriously you put them on
they feel so moisturizing there's lots
of vitamins and really nourishing
ingredients in these but then the color
remains on your lip and my mom is always
looking for something that wears a long
time and she oftentimes would wear like
those covergirl outlast like the the
things you paint on your lips for a long
wear because she says they stay in place
creep up in the little lines that you
start to develop around your lips and I
was like hey why don't you try one of
these and so I gave her a couple of
these vitality lip flush products and
she loves them she says they do not
travel up in her lip lines they're
really comfortable to wear so a shade I
love for like a deep red it's called
pretty woman and then there's an
interesting shade called Janousek wand I
think this may be their best seller it
looks like it might just be a totally
transparent like lip balm but this shows
up as more of a not really a fuchsia but
it shows up it's like a really nice pure
pink on the lips so the color sort of
develops as you as you wear it I think
what's so groundbreaking about these is
not just the fact that they're really
comfortable and they look pretty and
nice colors and whatnot but it's the
fact that they're taking a long wearing
product and putting it into a form that
people don't mind wearing you know it
actually like you're gonna gravitate
toward these because they are so
comfortable as opposed to those things
that took two steps and then you got to
put the blossoms run store um lip stain
I wasn't really running into one that I
felt like really knocked my socks off or
just blew me away in terms of the
quality but there's this unique product
from Maybelline and while it doesn't
totally live up to its claim I think it
looks absolutely gorgeous and it can
serve a function for you it's the super
stay
ten hour stain gloss from Maybelline and
the shade I have here is 120 it's a
really beautiful like berry red and it's
got an applicator like that so you put
it on and you're probably wondering what
is a stain gloss and this goes on and it
maintains some shine but it also wears a
really long time it didn't take me
through ten hours but it did get me
through like an entire evening if you're
wearing this for a full day I think you
might only need to reapply it like once
but this color is so rich and saturated
and gorgeous do have a little shine that
stays on there and you're wondering well
can it rub off can it kiss off onto
something or go on your glass a little
bit the longer you have it on the less
transfer I noticed onto other things but
it just does remain a little bit shiny I
feel heavy on the lips it doesn't feel
sticky if you're watching and just
saying I'm going to try something
totally different wear lip products are
concerned maybe give this a go again
it's 120 is the shade I specifically
recommend for a juicy red bordering on
berry lip another one that's new to me
this year and I remember the first time
I put it on my lips and I just kind of
side a comfortable creamy kind of
shininess luxurious nough sub these
lipsticks is great these are from Too
Faced they're called la creme a couple
of shades that are awesome nude beach is
a fantastic nude that you're gonna hear
about in a little bit also the deepest
of the deep shades they nailed it with
this shade called divine wine for people
who are loving that really dark lip
trend but they're just ultra creamy
oh.hello
no cupcake is endorsing these
specifically but they are just a great
great lip product
can you sit over there for favorite
drugstore lipstick I'm putting Revlon
lip butter in this carriage we write a
lot more of a shiny finish to them than
a lot of lipsticks do and I just love
the way they love the shade range the
one here in red velvet I mean I've got a
big gash in it but I love that color
so for shade selection and just how like
the name implies buttery smooth they
feel on the lips I love Revlon lip
butter favorite high-end lip gloss these
have a plumping quality to them they're
from the buxom line but they are the
cream formula you can see they look like
they're in like a frosted tube here I
have white Russian and berry blast and
these are like the ultimate lip gloss
formula they are so creamy full-on
opaque color there's no shimmer in these
there's just beautiful shiny long
wearing lip glosses I mean as for as
long wearing as a gloss can be I mean
they are that I love the other bucks and
you can have a little bit of shimmer in
there but for an all-around gloss like
they nailed it with these and so I'm
really glad I tried those this year for
favorite drugstore lipgloss I tell you I
went through my collection I looked at
everything and then I'm like man I guess
I just nailed it last year and these are
the same favorites I had last year
Revlon Super Lustrous
one of my favorite lip gloss formulas
from the drugstore I've got pink pop
here I've got coral reef I chose a
couple of bright ones to show you but
they have the wand applicator great
colors nice amount of shine just not
annoying feeling on the lid a lot has a
ton of great lip products but these are
amazing glosses i also like nyx mega
shine lip gloss an even broader color
selection than these love Cosmo kind of
a neutral shade beige pearl is another
really nice like light nude color
similar in texture to the Revlon and
these are just my favorite
now we get into some favorites for
specific shades so we go through pink
berry red and neutral with a lipstick
and a lip gloss favorite from those
specific shapes could be high-end or
drugstore I'm just gonna pick one for
each or in this case for favorite pink
lipstick I have two Mac cream Sheen
lipstick and speed dial such a gorgeous
pink I mean this is true it's got like a
little bit of brightness in there but I
think it looks so beautiful on and again
I love that cream machine formula also
the one I'm wearing today which is that
sweet watermelon shade from the
Neutrogena moisture shine color sticks I
love this I love this little hint of
shimmer I think this is a totally
wearable pink I'm just a big fan of this
formula I mean I talked it to death
earlier but this is a particularly
pretty color from that line favorite
pink lip gloss is the NYX mega shine in
beige crazy shade name why couldn't they
have called it like rose or something
like that
this is creamy this has no sparkle
talked about wearable if you don't
normally wear Pink's and you don't want
something the screaming pink at you this
is so pretty on berry lipstick I have to
to mention one is the deep dark berry
like from you know that trend that
everybody's loving of the dark lipsticks
and it's Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick
in black cherry
it looks so dark right there but you can
get a range of looks with this lipstick
like you can put it on sheer you can
like tap it on with your finger and have
kind of like a deep berry but it still
has more of a pinky tone that comes
through or you can put it full on for
like the deepest darkest lip
I mean it's so pretty love when you can
kind of control the finish and how it
comes off its really creamy it's not
going to come off with a lot of shine or
anything like that there's no shimmer
and then for true berry kind of fuchsia
berry
it's the Revlon lip butter and raspberry
pie I've become very attached to this
shade over the past year when I'm
wanting something berry that is just
that color I like this because it does
have the show
I factor to it and it just looks really
yummy and juicy on the leg berry lip
gloss I'm giving it to Neutrogena and
moisture shine gloss and berry fit I
remember when these kind of glosses used
to have like a beige cap on them like I
use these way way back in the day and
loved them and I feel like Neutrogena
has really nailed it when it comes to
truly moisturizing lip products so this
is a very good quality gloss but I love
this berry shade in particularly a
little bit of very fine gold toned
sparkle in this but overall it's like
the true berry color oh my gosh red
lipstick welcome to the most exhausting
category of all the Emily awards so far
and when I see Ultra moist look we're in
sheer red has one four one two the past
three years okay and so I'm looking at
that on my grid and I'm thinking you
know why did I love this color so much
and I'll show it to you here and I think
the reason why is that it is a true red
but it's just a step deeper than a lot
of the red lip colors that are out there
that are just labeled you know like the
key red from a certain line like it's
just a little bit deeper than that and
that's what I think makes it work for so
many people because it's just not as
loud and bright it's just creamy it
looks great on the lips but I'm thinking
maybe there's a better formula out there
maybe there's another product that gives
you that exact color that I love so much
but it's a little different formula and
so i swatched I don't know I think it
was a solid hour of swatching and
comparing for this one darn color and I
could not find anything even I have a
little drawer of red lip colors and
could not find anything that gave me
this exact look either it was a little
too dark or it went a little more toward
like the berry side of things or a
little bit more orange this maintains
true red but like I said it's a step
deeper than most
fire-engine red we try everything I
compare to all the new things I've been
looking at and testing out and this is
still it so there you go four favourite
red lip gloss and
was another one I was just like I don't
know if I should call us a favorite I'm
not sure how easily people can find this
I'm not positive if it's part of the
regular line or you know limited edition
but it's the wet-and-wild lassi gloss in
a glass of shine and this is deep red I
blogged about this color and it is like
it is so beautiful it's deeper than this
lipstick is it's almost you know you
could call it like a really dark berry
but I feel like it's just deep red it's
got a little bit of shimmer in there it
is so gorgeous I hope like maybe
wet-and-wild is watching this or I can
like email them and be like can you make
this please part of the regular
offerings of wet and wild because this
shade is so shiny
it's so like succulent beautiful read
favorite neutral lipstick so this could
be anywhere from a light nude to a like
a caramel e color but this is this does
happen to be a nude lipstick my new
favorite nude lipstick it is the Too
Faced from the la creme line and it's
nude beach this just so happens to be
perfect
I don't like matte nude dry looking lips
if I'm gonna wear a nude it's got to
have like a healthy amount of shine
normally I would go and like put a lip
gloss on top to give it that shine that
makes your face look alive again you
know but this is kind of like one-step
nude lip because it's the perfect color
in my opinion it's just got a little bit
of peach in there I think and then you
put it on and it gives you a shiny juicy
finish there is no shimmer in this it's
just straight-up creamy a very opaque
lip color and I love your gloss remember
how I said I would sometimes top a nude
lip with a gloss to make it shiny this
one is called peach petal and it's from
the Revlon Super Lustrous line so a line
of glosses i learned alone I mean it's
not gonna be quite as opaque as the
color you see here but pretty close and
I just think that's a great neutral
color but then I wanted to give you a
deeper option that I like and this walks
the line between a deep neutral and all
a little bit of berry thrown in but I'm
just talking about it here and this is
the revlon colorburst lip gloss and rose
pearl well it polished and put together
sometimes it's not always the ultralite
lip color that gets you there but it's
something like this that almost brings a
little bit of life back to the face
something just a little bit deeper and
this shade is really great that is the
Emily awards for lips I hope maybe
you've discovered some new lip products
you might want to try in this video and
there's still one more video to come in
the Emily Awards series and that is the
finale and I've got to tell you if you
thought we were crazy from some of the
intros in these past few videos I'm not
sure what you're gonna think of us after
this finale these favorites are being
posted on my blog so I thought that
would be an easy way for you to refer to
everything that I've mentioned in all
these videos and if you want to print
them off or you know go back to them
later it's just an easy way to get it
without having to go back to the video
so again that that's all on beauty
broadcast net so if I'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
