finale for 2015 I'm really excited to
share the products in this video because
they are a lot of really amazing
favorite products that just didn't fit
into any of the other videos so that's
kind of what brought about the finale
I'm several years back when I started
doing this and as you know I've done the
top ten style with my face eyes and lips
videos and I was actually thinking about
doing that with the finale as well but I
really think it would work best to just
kind of go about this video the way I've
done all the ones in the past some of
the categories are just so varied and
different like I've got skincare I've
got some hair stuff I've got all these
different things that I'll be talking
about so I just thought it would make
sense to go right down the list and give
you all of the winners as usual so my
first category is the only one that has
like a high-end and drugstore split and
we are talking about best brushes here
so the best brush for high-end really
one of the ones that I feel like I've
used the most and I found to be so
versatile is this it cosmetics I think
it's called the heavenly luxe dual
foundation brush and it has like a
foundation end which is really nice and
dense and super soft as you would expect
the it cosmetics brushes to be but then
the other end is really perfect for
concealer too or you could use that for
highlight or you know you could use this
end if you wanted to dab on a cream
blush you could use this into buff in a
powder foundation if you want to it just
blends really well in circular motions
just a great buffing style brush and
I've just used it a whole lot I know the
double-ended style is frustrating for
some people and it kind of is for me too
because many of us store our brushes in
a cup or some sort of style where it's
gonna be standing on its end so with
this I mean I do store my double-ended
brushes in kind of a long skinny tray
and I just keep them in a drawer and
then talking about drugstore brushes I
feel like it's been a very drugstore
brush heavy year for me I feel like I've
been using a lot from ELF a lot from
Sonia Kashuk a lot of Real Techniques so
that's great to see that there are so
many high quality brush lines from the
drugstore but up and up the
and from Target it has really got a lot
of great brushes particularly their face
brushes I've just fallen in love with
them this foundation buffing brush is a
great option I also am a huge fan of the
blush brush that can be nice for
contouring as well as blush even
highlight and then they have like a
little multi Peck set that has some
really nice brushes particularly this
highlight brush love the size just
really applies a targeted you know
pinpoint highlight where you want it
outstanding tool is one of my categories
and this year I'm gonna give it to one
of the unsung heroes of my makeup
collection and it would be my Tarte lash
curler I used to rape so much about a
particular curler that elf made it was
called the mechanical lash curler and
they stopped making it after a while it
had a nice little like handle to it and
I felt like it fit my eye so well it
worked so well and then of course things
get phased out and I got to say this one
from Tarte I really like so many things
about the way it functions it's got this
little pad here that it's kind of
squishy and I feel like that pad needs
to be a little squishy particularly for
straight lashes like mine to really get
a curl working in the lashes so I like
that
also the curve of this seems to just fit
my eye shape really nicely and of course
the pearls don't hurt either I got that
not this past holiday season but the one
before so it was limited edition I have
seen this pop up a time or two on
HauteLook but even if you can't get your
hands on this particular one you know
the style of their actual lash curler
the part that really matters is the same
with whatever kind they put out I have a
category for most innovative product and
this is not going to a real traditional
makeup product this year it's actually
going to a makeup bag which has been a
super game-changer for me in terms of
how much it can hold how well it keeps
things separated it has a compartment
for brushes it's just been awesome and I
think I talked about this even before
Christmas time and then did a lot of
traveling around Christmas used it even
more and it just reaffirmed how much I
love this this is from Sonia Kashuk it's
called the weekender and I know you're
seeing this kind of green and blue plaid
print that may not be everyone's cup of
tea but this comes out I think as she
puts
different collections it comes out in
different styles all the time so if you
look at targets website right now you'll
probably see like five or six different
varieties but it's such a great bag for
not only your makeup storage but also
toiletries I mean anything large the
compartments aren't too confining you
definitely have some flexibility with
this bag but one thing that was a real
must for me is the fact that it has
brush storage here so you just slip your
brushes right down there that goes over
the top and it's got a nice zippered
compartment that goes back behind there
I even fit like a smaller makeup bag
there for my teeny tiny things a huge
clear compartment over on the other side
and then a whole other side of the bag
opens up we've got these removable clear
bags here so if you want to see this all
packed up see examples of the things
that I've taken in it I do have a video
all about that for me personally it's
everything I need it to be and I think
that does qualify as a pretty innovative
product because there just aren't a lot
of makeup bags that you've run into that
really get the job done
how's everything you need there's so
many times where the bag will be under
sized and then I've got all these little
sub bags that I've got to worry about
taking next up is my award for the
cutest packaging and this one it's also
kind of a practical product as well but
I think the packaging is adorable it's
my in the palm of your hand palette I'm
really glad I had an opportunity to
mention this palette because it just
didn't fit into my other palette
categories it's just as much a face
palette as it is an eye palette really
it's got a couple lip cheek products
over here too but they've put in just
classic must-have amazing products from
their regular line downsized the blush
is a little bit giving you full sizes of
the eyeshadows but they put it all into
this sort of all-star palette but I love
what the interior packaging how they
kept the theme of all of these
individual products because you know the
balm is very distinct about the way
things are packaged so the hot mama
looks like the hot mama blush that's the
way the insane blush looks this is the
whole theme of like the how about them
apples the balm girls lipstick mary
loumanizer like you can recognize where
those are all coming from in their
full-size palettes and then the outside
is really cute because they've done
whole collage of all of the adorable
packaging from various products and this
says Volume one Greatest Hits Volume one
so I'm just hoping a volume two comes
out at some point in time because this
was a great great find every year I
mentioned a product in the category
needs to be in your purse and this year
is a back-to-back winner and it's just a
necessity it's my Revlon precision lash
glue like if if I'm wearing false lashes
and I don't have this with me I'm
concerned like I'm instantly a little
bit like I hope nothing happens to my
lashes and it's such a security blanket
type thing because more often than not
my lashes aren't going anywhere
particularly if this is the lash glue
that I use you know at the start of the
day to put them on but if you should
happen to need some sort of a lash
touch-up I mean it's not like you can
just grab for something else and make it
work it's got to be lash glue and it
really helps if it's a lash glue with a
wand so if I needed to just touch up
like the inner part started to come up
from my false lashes you can easily dab
this on your lash line and actually
press it back down without having to
completely redo the look so a wand
applicator is great with your lash glue
and this particular lash glue I think
holds better than anything like I said
it's not something I'm gonna have to
reach for very often but I love to know
it's there just in case because your
lashes start coming off I think you got
problems you need something like this on
hand so every year in the Emily Awards
finale I announce an MVP a most valuable
product for face eyes and lips but this
year it's pretty obvious what those are
since my top tens counted down to a best
product in each video so just to remind
you for face that would be the custom
cover drops from cover FX love those
love how you can just add a couple drops
to any foundation and a moisturizer type
product I personally love the way they
blend in for eyes it was the covergirl
super sizer mascara just a fabulous
mascara I think especially for people
who have lashes that struggle to hold a
curl lashes that you would really like
to see lengthened out a whole heck of a
lot
it just works great for me I feel like
it builds up volume and length really
quickly one way to really help your
lashes stand out more I'll just skip the
liner if I'm only going to wear that
mascara I skipped the
and I feel like my lashes look huge and
then my NVP for lips my number one
product in the lip video was the bite
luminous cream lipstick and this has
been a lip MVP before and for good
reason it's a really high-quality lip
product I feel like it's got all the
bases covered in terms of being
comfortable being incredibly pigmented
having a great color selection the added
bonus of having great ingredients food
grade ingredients now for the categories
of skincare body and hair I just share
three of the products in each of those
categories that would be my top picks so
one product for skin care that has
really just dominated the Emily Awards
I've been using these for ever it's the
Olay Daily facials or the equate
hydrating face washcloths I really will
just go either way like if I'm at
Walmart I will always go for the equate
cuz I think they really work just as
well but if I'm somewhere else and I
just really need them now I'll buy the
Olay this happens to be the sensitive
version with Olay you'll find different
textures on the cloths like I've got a
deep pore version that's a little more
scrubby that sensitive version you can
almost see through the little holes here
but these are dry cloths that suds up
when you get them wet and they are
fantastic for makeup removal I mean
fully removing all makeup including the
eyes these are probably the reasons why
I've had trouble being fully satisfied
with like the pre-moistened face wipes
because those never take it off as
quickly as something like this does
granted you've got to add your own water
to it but I mean it just makes for a
really quick and easy and thorough
makeup removal my other two things for
best skincare are actually masks I feel
like I've discovered quite a few really
great masks this year so I chose my top
two to mention in this video one of them
is the glossy a moisturizing moon mask
and you'll notice there are little
stickers all over this that's because
when you buy from this brand they give
you a sheet of stickers that you can use
to decorate your products however you
want so I do enjoy that but all of the
packaging aside this is a really great
mask for cooling refreshing making the
skin feel super hydrated and soft you
really feel like this is giving
something back to your skin it just
looks creamy and you know you put
slather it on your face it will feel
cooling it will feel really really
refreshing wow you've got the mask on
they say to leave it on for like 20
minutes but then when you go to rinse it
it feels even more like refreshing you
feel so good and then you touch your
skin after you're all dried off and it's
like ah it's so good you know it's a
really great mask and they have another
mask it's called like galaxy greens or
something and it's not a bad mask but
just the effects you feel from it on
your skin this is ten times better in my
opinion then I am two for two for loving
the gel masks from Peter Thomas Roth I
have the Rose stem cell mask and the
cucumber gel mask and these both like
they each have their own distinct scent
first off comparing these to the
moisturizing moon mask and this is the
most moisturizing of any of these but I
still think any skin type could use this
and benefit from it I don't think it
would make oily skin feel like an oil
slick because I mean you are going
through that whole process of rinsing it
off and your skin just feels I don't
know nicely hydrated afterwards these
seem to make my skin feel really soft
afterwards but they're a little more on
the clarifying side if that makes sense
I think the cucumber one most of all
like my skin just feels really nice and
deep cleaned after I rinse it off but
these can also be used if you want to
lightly use these on top of your night
cream or night moisturizer they say you
can sleep with a light layer of this on
and then when you rinse off in the
morning you really feel like the added
moisture has been locked in but this
Rose one is the one I've had the longest
I've used it a lot and I still feel like
I've got a ton left I don't know where
it's going so I sometimes when I go to
an Italian restaurant you got the big
plate of pasta and you're eating for
days and it's like where is the food
going it's still on my plate
both of these also when I rinse off I do
feel that nice cooling effect I would
say kind of go for whichever scent you
prefer most because they are pretty
similar in the overall effects for your
skin I would say they're clarifying when
you rinse your skin you feel kind of a
deep cleaned effect but still softening
this one adds a little more moisture
back to the skin okay I've got three
body products two of which are from soap
&amp;amp; Glory like soap and Gloria has been
the body care line that has just worked
its way into my life over the past year
and one
I absolutely loves my sugar crush body
butter cream so this has that sweet lime
scent it smells like a margarita and ice
cream mixed together it's just it's
refreshing its unique it's really
different and somebody had asked me if I
like this better than the Josie Maran
whipped Argan body butter and that is a
great product what they do for my skin
is not terribly different like they're
both both this kind and the Josie Maran
are very very hydrating for me but it's
just the scent of this really that's
taking it over the top and it's a really
good value you're getting just over ten
ounces in this tub for 15 bucks so I
would highly recommend that if you love
something refreshing a little bit
citrusy definitely sweet smelling now I
don't care who you are or what scent you
like I think you would absolutely love
the smoothie star breakfast scrub this
is my second body care favorite product
this smells so amazing it's like how do
they balance a scent that smells so
clean so fresh but also a little hint of
maple and just the sweetness and kind of
I don't know baked in goodness that you
might smell from a pancake it's like
it's so so good as you can see I've dug
into this a lot I use it in the shower
it is absolutely the most dense hardcore
scrub that I have ever used like you get
a little bit on your hand and it goes to
work and your skin feels really soft
afterwards as a result so in my book I'm
giving super high marks to a product
that's going to combine amazing scent
with a practical like really useful
purpose so that's exactly what this does
my third thing for body that I'm gonna
mention and I know it's not that
exciting and it's definitely not very
glamorous but it is very important and
it's my secret clinical strength stress
response deodorant and I get it in the
invisible solid not the kind that's like
I don't know some people might like it
but it's the creamy version that like
clicks up through I'm not a fan of that
this I find just it goes on it doesn't
show the scent on it is really nice
actually it smells a little bit on the
fruity side but this is like endorsed by
Oprah's life
or whatever you see that label on the
box when you buy it I sweat a lot and
this secret clinical strength in the
invisible solid this works better than
the creamy kind that clicks up for me it
really just keeps the sweating at bay
I've tried the natural deodorants like
the la vanilla kind I think it's called
that you know all natural is supposed to
be better for you to use those but that
stuff didn't do anything for me I felt
wet and sweaty and gross and I know that
part of this is just my personal body
chemistry probably I'm a hot person like
not sexy hot I'm not saying that but I
run hot like I'm not I don't go places
and always feel cold I generally feel
hot so what can I say it's a deodorant
that works it deserves a shout out for
hair my three products that I'm going to
talk about I have to work horse products
and one kind of fun thing so one of the
workhorses as you can see I just
mentioned one of these in an empties and
this is where we're at already on our
next one but this is the suave Naturals
almond verbena on two-in-one shampoo and
conditioner one step first off for speed
that's nice but it also just seems to
really balance my hair out I feel like
I've gotten on here and talked on ten
different occasions about how for a
period of time I had an oily scalp and
then I started using this and like my
hair was perfectly shiny manageable all
hair problems were really solved after I
started using this so I don't know if
it's the two-in-one or what the deal is
really but it just it works it really
truly works as a two-in-one I don't need
to pull in a separate conditioner unless
I really want to do like a hair masking
type thing in the shower you know an
added treatment this works well for
day-to-day for me I talked about liking
the finesse two-in-one as well that's a
little more moisturizing I do love that
one of the strikes against that though
is that it was really hard to find I
actually couldn't find that in any
drugstore and I had to order that off of
drugstore.com this kind of feel like I
see everywhere so that helps to plus
it's just a couple of bucks another
thing I keep up here in a small size
because I do attempt to touch up some of
these flyaways before my videos I might
not have gotten them all down this time
but it's my Tresemme tray to hairspray
it's the level for extra hold and I do
have like a giant can of this downstairs
as well it's just the best hairspray I
need something that's not going to weigh
down my hair
are not gonna make it feel greasy after
I go through part of the day and another
thing I love about this is I can kind of
use it as I style so let's say I put
some rollers in my hair some velcro
rollers and I want to sort of set them
in by spraying some of this once I take
my hair down I can brush through and I
feel like this has given my hair extra
hold even though it's like loose and
touchable and natural seaming you know I
like how the mist
it's very diffused and soft there are
some hair sprays that spray out like
like so hard like you're gonna kill a
cockroach with that stuff or something
like these are nice and soft and
manageable third hair product that I
love would be the flexible headbands the
headbands that have like a wire in there
that you can put on and go like this
wrap them around and you've got this fun
little look kind of like a bandana ish
type look but a lot less work than
having to wrangle around the bandana
these little things I mean you could
easily put that in without looking at a
mirror and it's great I have found these
I can't remember the brand where I found
these at CVS it might have been goodie
but I know for sure this one this plaid
print was the Remington brand and I
founded it Target they've got some
lighter solid colors that I saw last
time I was in there I just think these
are the neatest idea and if you wanted
to you could really like wrap him around
a bun or something like that I've got
actually some shorter ones that I had
found at CVS that were specifically to
go around a bun but I especially find
that I love this kind of thing in the
summertime because you can toss your
hair up in a bun or a ponytail or leave
your hair down throw this on and it's
like everything off your face you have
those days where you just want
everything off your face so thank you
guys so much for watching the Emily
awards this year and tuning in for the
finale and just supporting what I do
here on YouTube I really love the
thought that there is a community of
people out there all over the world who
shares this common interest like I do in
makeup and beauty products season is fun
and that we can all come together and
enjoy this stuff and know that it's not
the most serious thing in the world
makeup I mean it's just fun to have a
light-hearted fun hobby in your life
like this is it not and all this time
that I've been working on the Emily
Awards I've still been compiling my
little list of things off to the side of
other
I'm gonna do once the Emily Awards are
done so I've been working on that thank
you guys so much again for watching and
I'll see you soon
