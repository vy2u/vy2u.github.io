already every year the intros I feel
like have gotten better and better like
it started out it was just you know I
in 2008 I popped up on camera is just
like oh hey everybody I'm gonna call
this the Emily Awards and it was very
low-key you know one video now I got
multiple videos and I mean we did a
whole dramatic thing I think it was in
2010 like I shot something with Tyler
and cupcake then the next year it was
like I took bits and pieces of videos
from the entire past year and like clip
them together like a montage I had to
top it somehow and I came up with sort
of a preliminary idea and I didn't
really like it and then this just like
dawned on me the other day to do it with
really involving Tyler I was preparing
for his acting you had taken an acting
class yes I think I got an A - yeah it
was just a little bit better so we start
out shot of me frazzled surrounded by
the makeup and it was cool because I was
shooting toward the mirror so it'll that
first shot will actually show up out of
the mirror you always want your first
shot to be good always guess one more
same talking at the chair maybe this
time you need a little help you are such
an actor well I mean don't get any big
ideas or anything but I guess I could
use I don't need to be holding a Kleenex
this is gonna be montage of you just
trying stuff if you're looking at it to
be in the shot it's gonna need to be
kind of in front up and front year yeah
perfect timing here you're the assistant
around here test them like on your face
like I think she likes that one
I was already insurance joke he can make
about the shadow in food did you save
fifteen percent or more on this shadow
insurance
Oh lash curlers crayon guess just start
going into drawers and grabbing them out
and I'm gonna speed it up hmm you knew
that was gonna happen didn't you well I
like help me give me some answers aren't
you having fun spilled on myself a
little bit assistance okay it's in some
little ants chasm right
it's that technical term nachos suck it
up over there a leash malli did you just
lick that blew the camera loves you doll
Hey my assistant is used to working for
me I wouldn't drink that if I were you
it's recording it's just that inevitable
steady that's a wrap dude I think we're
good I've made a complete fool of myself
you're welcome
you did not you are awesome that is the
making of intros for the Emily Awards
more intense I think it's ever been it
was like two hours long time but I think
we've got solid intro for this really
award it's gonna be fun I think people
are gonna like it best more excited yes
that was not real tequila in my
margarita by the way week ever
everything I did was real like what ten
in the morning here the finale part make
sure you prep perfect prep poreless for
pressed powder it's fun to press on ah
and I mean oh it's really mirrored it
goes to put in because suits it's um I
want like the freaking rainbow in these
shadows I don't know I just it's it if
you need waterproof if you like really
start collecting like kind of towers you
could build with this honest hacia is is
that how you say it not Anastasia
or I was like I just I think these are
so freakin handy and moisture smooth
color sticks are like the sweatpants of
lip products I mean they are so
comfortable it smells like a jello
packet like before you mix up the jello
totally took this just so happens to be
perfect and I just kind of side
but they're just ultra creamy oh hello
okay we could not walk but they have
they do sell like like a little plastic
like the false eyelashes baby she looked
at herself in the mirror and thought
wowza it's like what is that identifying
factor that makes a smiley face go from
male to female it's like when you see a
couple eyelashes there you know that's
the girl so yes you must have these I'm
waving my wand oh that's handy 100%
clean on the face that doesn't wear off
like a leopard you know sheesh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
