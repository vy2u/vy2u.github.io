already every year the intros I feel
like have gotten better and better like
it started out it was just you know I in
2008 I popped up on camera is just like
oh hey everybody i'm going to call this
the emily awards and it was very low key
you know one video now i got multiple
videos and I mean we did a whole
dramatic thing i think it was in 2010
like I shot something with Tyler and
cupcake searching then the next year it
was like I took bits and pieces of
videos from the entire past year and
like clip them together like a montage
my favorite most used products I really
love love love love I had to top it
somehow and I came up with sort of a
preliminary idea and I didn't really
like it and then this just like dawned
on me the other day to do it with really
involving Tyler Tyler preparing for his
acting you had taken an acting class yes
I know like I got an 82 so did I yeah it
was just a little bit better so we start
out shot of me frazzled surrounded by
the makeup um and it was cool cuz i was
shooting toward the mirror so it'll that
first shot will actually show up out of
the mirror you always want your first
shot to be good always guess one more
time talking to the chair maybe this
time you need a little help you are such
an actor well I mean don't get any big
ideas or anything but I guess I could
use it I don't need to be holding a
Kleenex in Berlin on this is gonna be
montage of you just trying stuff if
you're looking at it to be in the shot
he's gonna need to be kind of in front
it up and Freyr here

myself you're welcome you did not you

really mirrored goes to put in because
suits it's um I want like the freakin
rainbow in these shadows I don't know I

think these are so freaking handy and
moisture smooth color sticks are like
the sweatpants of lip products I mean
they are so comfortable it smells like a
jello packet like before you mix up the
jello they took this just so happens to
be perfect and I just kind of side
but they're just ultra creamy oh hello
okay we could not walk on the left okay
but they have they do sell like like a
little plastic like the false eyelashes

and thought wowza it's like what is that
identifying factor that makes a smiley
face go from male to female it's like
when you see a couple eyelashes there
you know that's the girl so yes you must
have these I'm waving my wand oh that's
handy one hundred percent clean on face
