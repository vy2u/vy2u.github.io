Awards
I'm your host Tyler sponge tip we've
seen the face products now it's time to
move on to the eyes and let me tell you
the official trainer of the Emily awards
is quite the taskmaster she's been
working these products hard to determine
which will reign supreme the results
unprecedented this year there are 15
first-time winners now let's get the
latest from Emily in beauty broadcast
headquarters hey everybody welcome I'm
so excited for this part of the Emily
awards I have so many brand new winners
in the eyes segment of my Awards so
we're going to talk about a lot of great
product high-end eye primer it's crazy
cuz I'm looking at my computer here and
it looks like two faced shadow insurance
has one for four straight years but in
the past year I've noticed something and
it's even been happening with shadow
insurance tubes that I've gotten more
recently and I feel like they're more
liquidy than they used to be and I feel
like they're also more prone to like
separating and squeezing out like really
really liquid having that issue
repeatedly I don't feel like I can name
the product as a favor of any but I
definitely do have a winner for
drugstore and it's one that I've been
very very happy with and it's the Milani
eyeshadow primer and I know I've talked
a lot about the elf one dollar eyeshadow
primer that's a great one it's worked
well for me I haven't heard as good a
feedback from the masses on that one but
this one I think is just maybe a little
more advanced than that one and that I
feel like it does neutralize
discoloration on your lids a little bit
better than the El wear high-end cream
shadow a longtime favorite is keeping
the top spot it is not only a matter of
having beautiful colors but having great
staying power and the kind of style of
product that I really like I love these
malli ever color shadow sticks I love
the way that they twist up you don't
have to sharpen them they're just the
perfect size to get all over your lid
really easily or also go under your eye
with them champagne is a favourite shade
I just thought I'd show one here that
I've really probably used the most but
it makes a great base for your powder
shadows but don't feel like you have to
put
or on top because they're super long
wearing just as something super exciting
from the drugstore for cream shadows is
the Avon extra lasting eyeshadow pencils
I'd say from the drugstore but they're a
drugstore price range you can order from
your Avon representative or you can
order actually just from avons website
but these shadow sticks you'll notice
something familiar really similar format
and size to Mally's same staying power
and the shades that they do have are
gorgeous but there's not quite the
extensive shade range that Mally's has
but still some really really gorgeous
colors I love this color called amethyst
it's like a taupe with a little bit of
purpose mall palette high-end one in
particular stands out to me and it is
from bareMinerals it's the ready
eyeshadow and this quad is called the
happy place and I just love this color
combination I think part of what I enjoy
so much about this is that it's kind of
unexpected you know I really wasn't
thinking to combine peach and plum you
know just on my own but after getting
this quad and seeing how beautiful they
look together and I am wearing this one
today and I've got some of the peach on
my lid this in the outer corner smudged
under my eye as well we've got this very
cool like matte taupe that works great
for blending out the edges it takes some
of these shimmery shades just kind of
down a notch I think it's beautiful the
texture of these shadows is amazing I've
been falling in love with them like
starting toward the end of last year and
all through this year I've been enjoying
these kinds of shadows so much
now there's buns dip back here with you
for an Emily awards game break
apparently there's something out there
called the happy place that people have
been enjoying this year the happy place
I assume is some sort of bar where they
sell fantastic frozen cocktails Emily
her favorite small drugstore Pat was
just such a simple trio but the quality
of the shadows is outstanding and it can
take you anywhere from a really natural
daytime eye to a super dark and smoky
eye and it's wet-and-wild silent
treatment this continues to be my
favorite wet-and-wild trio I just love
the shades that are in here you've got
like a really soft peach this beautiful
like kind of silvery taupe and then this
wonderfully deep dark like brownish
black it goes on with so much intensity
like you actually need to make a point
to use a light hand with that shadow if
you don't want it to be like super super
rich but I love just the range that the
simple trio can create so it continues
to be a favorite of mine right high-end
large palette if you only knew how many
times I went back and forth on this
category it's nuts but I did settle on
two one is a returning favorite one is a
new favorite my returning favorite for
high-end palette this one last year as
well is the lorac Pro I get so many
people asking me you know would you
choose lorac pro compared to XYZ and
really this does have the best variety
for giving you basic eyeshadows you've
got a row of mattes a row of shimmers
you've probably seen this lots and lots
of times but you can get a ton of
different looks out of it granted you're
not getting a ton of like wild and crazy
colors but I feel like for overall
neutrals and a few kind of fun pops
color variety is good texture is amazing
I just could see this palette completely
filling the holes in your collection if
you're missing that amazing matte black
it's in here if you're missing you know
a gorgeous shimmery taupe it's here if
you're missing a perfect matte cream
shade you know it's in hand I think it
will continue to be popular year after
year after year
just because of how important the shades
in here are and how user-friendly it is
you know it's a compact palette it's
very easy to take with you to travel
what I'm thinking about what the most
people would get the most good out of
this one comes out on I also have to
mention a certain palette just from a
personal standpoint I feel like all the
looks I do with this palette I really
like there are a lot of times when I do
looks here at my makeup mirror I'm
thinking it's okay may not try that
again or not my favorite because I'm
always trying different things but with
this palette almost consistently get
something I like out of it and it's the
lorac unzipped so yes - lorac palettes
winning this year but this is home to so
many beautiful shade this is giving you
like a really warm neutral look with a
lot of pre bronzes some Burgundy's a
little rose gold in this palette I think
if you're getting started with
eyeshadows you start with the lorac Pro
and if you want an even more expanded
selection of neutrals you grab the
unzipped that's my take on their large
drugstore palette and by the way when
I'm thinking large versus small I'm
thinking like 10 or more shades so this
one from the drugstore has 12 and it's
the Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral shimmer
I like the eye on neutral matte I think
it's a pretty darn good palette but if
you get a chance to feel the way these
shimmery shadows feel I think the
texture is just to die for consistently
throughout all of these shades I think
it's great to have mattes you guys know
I love my mats but this particular
palette is so well done in these
textures we're overall eyeshadows so
we're looking at I shadow quality not a
specific palette but just across the
board what's the best from high-end my
first favorite is lorac I feel like
these shadows and I'm holding this
palette just as an example but across
the board from what I've tried even some
of their singles different formats of
the shadows I feel like they all blend
easily they're very true to the color
you would expect to give I've been super
impressed with all that I've tried from
lorac throughout this year
but I've also got to give a big
shout-out to the balm has really been a
favorite of mine their shadows over the
years they've got some great different
palettes and now I'm just recently
they've come out with singles and I'll
expand on these soon I know I haven't
talked about these a whole lot yet but
this is a palette that they've put out
that you can just fill with single
shadows or you can fill a Z palette with
their singles but they've taken like
some of the shades out of their palettes
that we know and love like new tude and
the different ones because I totally
recognize them and they put them in
full-size singles and these shadows are
impeccable quality as well I feel like
they're very similar to the softness of
the lorac shadows so really nice quality
there maybe even some more unique shades
that I run across in the balms palette
their matte palettes are great as well I
was kind of looking in my favorite
palettes for things that I really felt
like I used the most over the past year
and I think those were the lorac ones
but the balm has undeniably great
quality eyeshadows too for favorite
eyeshadows from the drugstore one of
these favorites that I'm gonna give has
been a repeated winner like one two
three four years now and it is wet and
wild for the price I think it's really
really tough to beat and I know wet and
wild will come out with new collections
here and there sometimes the new or
limited edition things that they come
out with are always like as fabulous
quality as the things that are part of
just the regular line that we always see
things like silent treatment the comfort
zone invitation will blow your mind
I don't struggle to blend them out on my
lids in my crease whatever color variety
is really pretty decent so I've just got
to give credit where credit is due I
think wet-and-wild continues to have
some of the best drugstore eyeshadow
the bread wet-and-wild is really turning
some heads this year ah
wet-and-wild takes me back to Spring
Break 2003 in South Padre the tequila
was flowing and the women were well
perhaps we get to that later but I want
to share another favorite with you if
you're looking for one of the best
values on single eyeshadows and every
color in the rainbow I've got to give a
shout-out to the Coastal Scents hot pots
I mean the cost on these like a dollar a
piece or something there's so many
different shades here I've taken one of
their Coastal Scents palettes and just
filled it up with some of you know these
little pans in any empty palette you
have but the textures are so nice really
really bold and pigmented a vast array
of colors matte shimmer you name it
anything you could want you know they've
got all of this selection and the
quality is just so good so liners now
I'm talking about high-end a brand new
favorite this year
I just could not get this one out of my
head because of how smoothly it applies
but it still got the amazing staying
power and it's the Tarte skinny smolder
eyes the one I'm showing you here is in
Sunstone bronze
Thank You Kristin game for like
reminding me that I even had this in my
collection months and months ago and
when you use it you're just in awe of
how little pressure you have to apply to
get full color and you can smudge this
out if you want to but it will set and
not move a little smudge tip on there
really a waterproof product can't be
from the drugstore a new favorite this
year it's the Jordana twelve-hour made
to last pencils there's a really nice
color variety in these I mean we're
going beyond just brown and black but
you've got a pretty light electric blue
I love the plum called purple fix that
I'm holding now I've actually got a
little bit of this in my look today so
pretty green too I've got a blog post
outlining all of these but they're
probably the least expensive drugstore
liner that will go on and set to a
completely budge free state liquid liner
I just have a drugstore favorite this
year and it's the Milani ultrafine
liquid
eyeliner specifically in the shade black
vinyl I did a absolute waterproof test
with these and unfortunately not every
liner in this line of Ultra finds is
waterproof like they say some will run
at the drop of a hat but this one is
truly truly like stays all day and
Beyond waterproof liner jet black it
will give you a great precise line
you've got that little fine felt tip
there glides on with full color no need
to like go back over it it's not watery
at all will easily execute your winged
liner if you want it to just a total
favorite no-brainer didn't have to
hardly think about it this is great for
an Emily awards game break anticipation
for fans has reached a fever image every
man woman and child is cheering on their
favorite products even animals look at
that little page Emily or cream or gel
liners again I don't have a high end
favorite that I would really latched on
to and loved this year but I've got two
drugstore favorites the first is from
essence it's the gel liner at midnight
in Paris this is black this is a
must-have everybody needs a black eye
liner right this goes on like buttah
with I love to use my Real Techniques
fine liner brush it just goes on so
easily sets completely to where you
cannot move it and by far one of the
cheapest gel liners on the market so if
you just need black you cannot miss with
that also got a mention for a great
shade selection the makeup get gel
liners these again are very long wearing
but for just those really unique colors
like this one this is one of my
favorites it's called Fame and it's like
this gorgeous teal with a little bit of
metallic stuff going on there I think
it's so so beautiful and there's that
and a whole spectrum more from her line
Lily affordably priced right along the
lines of what you pay at the drugstore
but just a great color range the new
winners continue high-end mascara I've
run into something that I just love and
it's Too Faced better than sex mascara
this is there
new release that came out this year and
I tell you what this is just lengthening
thickening does not make them feel hard
and brittle I feel like it just extends
them to the point where I'm like what
it's not a super wet formula mascara but
I don't find that it's that dry either
it builds on itself nicely
I just really have no complaints
whatever this is doing it's making my
lashes bigger and more lush than the
other stuff that I've used in the past
and here's a look at the brush it is an
hourglass shape but the reason why I
like it is that it doesn't go too far in
in the center because sometimes when
they they dip too far in and become too
skinny they're in the middle you can't
reach all of your lashes with that
probably write a book on the things that
I love about this so I'll stop there and
just tell you I love this mascara this
is the small size but I've got a big
size waiting for me drugstore I've got a
new winner this year and it's the
essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara this is just one of those that
over the past year you know it grew on
me and then I stopped using it for a
while because I'm like okay I know what
I think about that I'm gonna try some
more things and then I come back to it
and yep it's just as good as I remember
it's got this brush with a lot of short
rubber bristles and I might initially
glance at that and think yeah I don't
know about that but you know what it
really applies nicely kind of a dry
formula mascara it's great great
separation two coats I think you'll be
super satisfied with the great length
that you have just the look of more
lashes i've raved about this in various
videos here and there but this really is
a great mascara at a very low price
where false eyelashes another new
favorite this year it's the red cherry
number 43 love these lashes for a lot of
reasons I'm wearing them today as well
let's just give you the highlights here
great length not every lash on this band
is the same length which I think really
allows them to blend into your natural
lashes nicely they're not too long from
left to right how these really taper to
a nice short length right here on this
and so you can't really see where they
start or where they end right there in
the corner of my eye
they are dramatic though look at that
length the thickness I mean this is your
Night Out glam or doing an Emily awards
video bold fall slash but I love it back
with you for a game break folks they
might look like fuzzy caterpillars on
your bathroom counter these hairy strips
from red cherry are known to be some of
the most flattering on the eyes not that
I would ever wear them what behind me
who's responsible for this now my last
category and it's favorite brow products
for high-end again a new favorite this
shine it cosmetics and it's the your
brows but better skinny pencil there is
a brow power pencil out there it's got a
little thicker tip but it's that
Universal one shade fits all kind of
product I deal with this universal color
is that it can be lighter or darker
depending on how much pressure you apply
so when I want it lighter in on this
part of my brow I just apply light
pressure when I want it deeper in here I
apply a little bit maybe this skinny tip
lets me apply that pressure while
keeping a natural look it's got your
product on one end and then a little
brush on the other that you can go
through your brows with but this has
just been great a great great drugstore
option this is a returning favorite it's
the elf Studio eyebrow kit I love this
because it gives you options you know if
you just want to fill in your brows with
a matte powder you can do that you've
got a matte powder and then you've also
got a tinted wax this can be used on its
own if you wanted to fill in your brows
or for ultimate staying power and hold
holding the shape of your brows you put
this on fill in your bare spots and then
top it off with the powder I use the
little brush that comes in here it's an
angled brush and like a small shadow
Brad just like that you can decide how
it works best for you you know more of
the wax less of the packs more of the
powder less of it and you can just kind
of build your own routine with the man
do I
