Awards pregame show I'm your host Tyler
sponge tip and I'll be taking you
through some of the biggest Beauty
moments of the year it's the sixth year
for the Emily awards and products train
hard every year to earn the honor pushed
to the limit day after day first off
we're looking at face products let's
take a look at the stats we've got lots
of rookie winners taking the top spot
there are a number of two-time winners
as well and of course we've got
perennial powerhouses winning three or
more years now let's send it over to
Emily and beauty broadcast headquarters
for some analysis well thank you Tyler
and I think a pregame show for the Emily
Awards is a long time coming next year
hopefully there will be tailgating too
but I'm so excited to start out this
year's Emily award by the way in all of
these categories I offer a high end in a
drugstore favorite however as always
there seems to be a few little holes you
know in the awards because if I really
haven't run into something over the past
year that's absolutely wowed me
I won't include it in this video so I
don't like to just choose things for the
sake of having a favorite in a certain
category that's the way it's always been
really really excited about some of the
new things I've come across in the past
year but in the category of best primer
we've got an old favorite returning and
it is for high end the Mallee perfect
prep poreless primer product really
always kind of blows my mind whenever I
use it because it combines such a
luxurious texture yet it's just so darn
lightweight on your skin it feels like
nothing once you blend it out but it
really evens out the surface of your
skin do you think it really has an
impact on your pores as well you might
want to give this one a try for
drugstore another returning favorite and
it's the Rimmel fix and perfect proof
that a lot of claims on here to smooth
resurface bright and mattify protect but
it really really does a good job in
making your skin feel so smooth and do
yourself a favor once you put this
primer on go ahead and like pluck your
eyebrows give it just a little bit of
time and then just run your hands over
your skin and you're gonna feel this
great smoothness that your skin is
developed the first year that I've
created two different categories for
foundations light coverage and full
cover I don't have a high-end favorite
for light coverage that I've run into
this year I have tried some light
coverage they
but nothing's really wowed me as I've
said so my drugstore favorite for light
coverage is the Rimmel BB cream if
you've got really dry skin you might
want to use another moisturizer
underneath as well this definitely isn't
full coverage I still like that it's
giving your skin a little something
whereas a lot of those BB creams it's
like you spread them out you're like
okay it looks like there's nothing on my
face this really delivers for an emmy
awards game you might wonder what is a
BB cream and why do we need them I'm
joined by first-time winner Rimmel BB
cream how do you feel about this honor
okay anything you'd like to give
alright Emily back to you for the best
full coverage foundation two-time winner
Estee Lauder Double Wear absolutely love
this foundation for when I want to look
my most flawless this is definitely what
I want to put on I just love the finish
on my skin even if I've got dry areas
assuming I moisturize well have a nice
primer underneath this still looks very
skin light does a great job of
camouflaging any discoloration you might
have it's just a fabulous foundation
from the coverage standpoint and from
staying power you look at yourself at
the end of the day and it's like nothing
has changed so I absolutely love this
foundation and from the drugstore I do
have a new winner this year and it's the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous there
are a lot of really great drugstore
foundations that I think offer a lot of
coverage this is one that I feel like I
can classify as pretty much a full
coverage foundation I love the pump that
this bottle has also that really makes
things easier but also it's just very
easy to blend into your skin I like to
use a sigma f80 brush with this or the
double wear and then once I've got it on
it really really less and if you're oily
at all this foundation is just really
great on the t-zone my best high-end
concealer once again it's a tie and it's
a tie between the same two products that
won last year and it's two very
different forms of concealer but I like
them both equally but for different
reason where concealer it's so
multi-purpose it's really good whether
you want to put this over blemishes over
your dark under eyes I mean I think it
performs exceptionally well even in
areas where you might be dealing with
some fine lines but the coverage is so
so nice and yet the finish on your skin
comes off looking very natural because
this is actually kind of a thin liquidy
concealer um it comes out with a pump a
little goes a long way for very full
coverage and then my other favorite is
the bare minerals bisque or summer
bisque well rested is also in that
family of products but this is really
great for absolute maximum coverage if
you've got something to cover that you
feel like not only do I want coverage on
that but I want it to be completely
modified and perfected just a teeny bit
of this over your under eye area can be
a beautiful
full-coverage finish for you it's really
important not to overuse these products
but well-rested would be like on the
lightest end of the spectrum really
bright now you can use this alone for
good coverage but you can put it on top
of any other concealer to get absolute
maximum coverage a drugstore it's pixie
correction concentrate and brightening
peach particularly for your dark bluish
or kind of actually looking under-eye
circles this corrects and brightens
those beautifully this is also good on
any sort of dark spot discoloration a
little bit pricey compared to some other
drugstore concealers but I still
consider it in that drugstore brand it's
definitely the thing from the drugstore
that I steer people toward if they've
got really really bad circles under
their eyes does a category of loose
powder I've got a brand new winner this
year for drugstore and it's the elf
mineral booster and sheer is kind of one
of those powders that I think can
stretch over a lot of different skin
tones but it's so so lightweight yet it
does provide that mattified look that I
think helps your skin look more
perfected if you're wanting something to
set your under-eye concealer that's more
lightweight than one of those bisque
products that I mentioned this is
definitely something I would steer you
toward and it's great for just setting
your foundation it's going to be more
lightweight and lighter coverage than a
lot of the pressed powders or powder
foundations that are out there but for
some people if you feel like your
foundations doing enough for you this
could be all you need on so high in my
favorite loose powder and this is
against something that might be seen as
a bit of a finishing powder but it's the
bare minerals mineral phase product
seems like it's been around for a long
long time but whenever I happen to wear
this as sort of a finishing touch to my
makeup look I end up getting more
compliments about the way my skin looks
and I don't think anything can really
beat this super ultra finely milled
lightweight texture of this product
right some different versions or
formulas of the mineral veil over the
years but just the standard one I think
makes a great setting powder you could
use it after your entire makeup look
maybe you want to tone down your blush a
little bit or you can use it right after
foundation to really lock it in and help
it last longer my favourite press powder
I don't have a high-end favorite but my
drugstore favorite has repeated so
many times throughout the years for the
MLA Awards and for good reason of its
l'oreal true match pressed powder it
comes in a vast shade range and this is
definitely one of those powders that I
think walks the line between being a
powder and almost a powder foundation if
you really like a light makeup look
maybe just a little concealer and powder
this is definitely the kind of powder I
would suggest you try the texture is
just wonderful very nice and smooth not
chalky at all it really goes on the skin
looking natural for powder foundation
I've got a brand new winner this year
for high-end and it is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear stay in place makeup this
powder has just won me over over the
latter part of this past year because I
just think the coverage is phenomenal
the staying power is great and you
wouldn't believe the comments I've
received when I am wearing my Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation with this
powder well tell me I've got like a glow
or my skin looks really radiant or
something and I feel like I'm wearing
really matte full coverage products but
yet the skin looks just so nice and
healthy with the combination of these
two so not saying you have to have both
and this is just a really good
freestanding powder on its own I just
think for a really amazing full coverage
experience you paired this on top of
your double wear and you can thank me
later my drugstore winner for best
powder foundation I've talked about it
tons over the past year and it's the
next stay matte but not flat powder
foundation actually its first time
winning an Emily award but this is so
outstanding because I think it's got a
very unique finish on the skin it truly
does mattify okay it takes away the
appearance of shine on your face but yet
it's really good coverage and I feel
like the appearance is just so natural
you know I can't quite put my finger on
it it's not glowy at all it's not
providing any shimmer on your skin but
it just gives the most natural
appearance while also having coverage so
it's just the whole ball of wax it's a
lot of great qualities world into one
product bronzer is a longtime favorite
made to come back it didn't win last
year but it's just you I kind of came to
the realization over this past year that
this is one of my absolute favorite
things to contour with and it's the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer a perfect
for contouring your skin I used it today
you know under my cheekbones come around
my hairline I think it looks so natural
it's totally matte I've said it a
zillion times but it smells like
chocolate looking for a really fabulous
pigmented bronzer this is a great one to
try
it's an Emily awards game break host
Tyler sponged it back with you
turns out to Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer really does smell like chocolate
but does it taste like chocolate no it
does not
emily and from the drugstore I love my
Revlon Photoready bronzer in Bronston
chic that's the only shape this comes in
and I'm a little concerned as I talk
about it now because I have seen this
being marked down to 75% off in
different drugstores lately you can
really customize your shade if you want
lighter if you want darker I mean it's
just all depends on what part of this
you want to use you can really customize
if you still find this in stores stock
up hopefully it's not the end for this
bronzer because this is one of my
favorite things from revlon that i've
used in the past year balm is again my
winner this year for high-end blush but
specifically their in stain blushes if
you haven't tried this particular kind
of blush from the balm you will be so
impressed at how a powder blush can
truly stain your cheeks i mean it's got
the blend ability the ease of
application of a powder blush but yet
even just watching this on your hand you
can see how the color really hangs on
they just that pigmentation is so rich
and so intense that it totally binds in
with your skin and even if you just
apply this very lightly which is what i
do with most every color i have it's
still going to hang around and give you
great staying power on the skin so i
love this shade in lace that i'm showing
now i'm i'll definitely link to a review
where I show all the different shapes
from the drugstore a new winter so
excited about this the Coastal Scents
Forever blushes these are the bomb the
price on this they're under $8 apiece
you're getting a ton of product in each
of your blushes and they are so intense
rich with color a huge color selection
like around 20 different shades
I think this shade that I'm wearing
today is called lovely I've worn it very
lightly on the skin but just touching
the product I mean there's so much color
in here so a little goes a long way I am
confident that if you get one of these
you'll have it for a long long time they
call it forever blushes you might just
have it forever because you're not going
to use it up very quickly but they come
in a variety of finishes and those
finishes are specified on the website so
you'll know if you're getting a satin
finish a shimmer or a matte finish but
there's just a ton to choose from and I
would highly highly recommend you check
them out for cream blushes I really
didn't fall in love with a high-end
cream blush this year so I'm not going
to name a favorite there but from the
drugstore something totally edged his
way in right at the tail end of the year
and completely blew me away with its
amazing texture wonderful blend ability
on the skin beautiful color and it's the
new Maybelline master glaze blush stick
this is a superior cream blush formula
to anything that I've tried from the
drugstore it's so thin and lightweight
yet so beautifully colorful this shade
that I'm showing you now is pink fever
since the time that I bought this I got
an even lighter one this is just pinched
pink and this is beautiful as well a
little more neutral not quite as bright
as this why I love blending them in with
my ELF small stipple brush you're going
to be amazed at how easily these blend
in and they do not change the texture of
your face they're not going to feel
sticky dewy and you guys know that I've
got a lot of makeup so it's really
saying something when I reach for a
product almost every single day and in
the category of high-end highlight it's
totally the laura geller baked french
vanilla highlight this is a baked
product it was totally domed at first
and now it's kind of like sloping down
but this is just a gorgeous gorgeous
highlight because it's not too shiny at
all it's got the most rich beautiful
texture tried the wet and wild reserve
your Cabana this is like that only the
texture is just even more smooth and
soft and if you're wanting any sort of
coverage out of your highlight this
definitely has i know i've loved the
lorac perfectly lit and spa
I think that's beautiful this is going
to give you even less shimmer than that
but I love applying it with my Sigma
f-35 and going right in this area and I
feel like it just perfects it evens out
it brightens it's just a great step to
your highlighting and contouring routine
from the drugstore I totally have a
rediscovered favorite that's come back
for me and it's the Physicians Formula
happy booster and translucent see how
it's got this kind of mix of champagne
and beige and even pink colors and this
is really great for a highlight that's
not going to be too shimmery it's
definitely a little more shimmery and a
little more like pinky tone color to it
than the laura geller that i just
mentioned but sometimes I'll use these
two highlights in conjunction with one
another I'll just tap my brush
especially in that little light colored
heart there and then I'll just kind of
put this right on the apple of my cheeks
for a little extra glow I think it's
beautiful without going over the top if
you want to experiment with a highlight
that's just going to give you a very
subtle amount of glow but with no
glitter this is great I've sort of
redefined a category and the Emily
awards and I'm calling it mattifier
slash touch-up type product and the
thing that definitely is a clear winner
in this category for me no pun intended
because the product is clear but it's
the Mallee ever color poreless face
defender this is one of the most unique
products that I own in that it's able to
mattify your skin not add any additional
look of product but yet make your skin
look so perfected and the product is
just totally clear every rule came out
with something similar but it was not
the same because it was actually a
little more goopy it's not totally solid
like this one is with this product you
pick up just the amount you need and you
can totally mattify your skin if I were
really greasy we'd have a great before
and after but this is definitely a
fantastic touch-up tool but I've loved
for several years now and I'll continue
to use
putting linebackers to defensive ends
playing good D is important turns out
there's a face defender in the beauty
words by Malley and it's playing good D
on your face every day if you want it to
defending against the elements oil and
cats Emily back to you for favorite
makeup setting spray while I do own some
different high-end ones that I like I
just don't feel like they're measuring
up as much to win an award as the one
that I have from the drugstore that I
love so much and it's the NYX dewy
finish setting spray why I like this is
that I feel like it extends the wear of
my makeup look but it also makes the
greatest difference in the powdery
finish that my skin sometimes has when I
finish my makeup I mean think about it
you may have used a powder to set your
foundation then a powder bronzer maybe a
powder blush maybe a powder highlight
and then a finishing powder so think of
all the powder you've got on your skin
when people get close to your face or
when you get close to your face in the
mirror do you feel like you're seeing a
ton of makeup there this is a great way
to reverse that trend and really make
your skin look like a natural skin
finish but yet you're also enhancing the
staying power of your makeup throughout
the day so that's it that's my Emily
Awards 2013 for face thank you so much

round of the Emily Awards join us back
