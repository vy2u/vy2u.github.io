I'm your host Tyler sponge dip and we've
got lots of surprises in store will
point out the MVPs give props to the
innovative products there's a special
halftime show even address the
controversy surrounding Coach cupcake
and one of the categories first let's
hear from Emily in beauty broadcast
headquarters Thank You Tyler and he's
right we have so many surprises in store
during this video I'm really excited for
you to just watch and enjoy and have a
good time with us the first thing is
best brushes and I'm gonna talk about
high-end first and I don't know whether
or not you truly consider these high-end
but in terms of the price range of most
of my brushes these would fall into the
higher price range chosen a few key
favorites first off my Sigma F
annotation is such an important step to
your makeup it's really key to you know
get it all blended in very evenly very
flawlessly and that's what I love this
one for Sigma has a lot of different
styles of brushes different cuts of the
brushes that are somewhat similar to the
f80 in feel but I really like this flat
top kabuki because I can blend in
circular motions so well with this this
is the king of circular motion blending
and so that's normally what I do with my
foundation she does a great job of just
blending out any texture of foundation
whether it's like an Estee Lauder Double
Wear you know a really liquidy
traditional foundation and something
more mousse like or creamy it does a
good job with those even things that are
more like a BB cream or a tinted
moisturizer I feel like I get really
consistent even coverage with this brush
I also want to give a shout out to a
little set of brushes that has really
grown on me over the past year and it's
the Sigma precision set and think of
this as like the little baby equivalents
to the f80 and those kinds of brushes
for example this is the p80 right it's
just a little flat top brush and I love
using this for my concealer this one's a
favorite also the p84 this is an angled
brush it's not cut super blunt you can
see it's a little bit tapered down the
sides but I love using these kind of
interchangeably blending out concealer
and if you're doing any sort of cream
contouring you want to really precise
area of application maybe it's around
your nose maybe you want to conceal and
pinpoint conceal some areas around your
nose like these are just great brushes
and there's a set of five all different
shades the year has gone on I've really
enjoyed exploring the different shapes
and like when something's dirty you know
grabbing for a different one and
real-live saying oh that's really nice
for getting this area or that area
that's precious from the drugstore I've
got three random brushes to mention that
are definitely like MVPs of my
collection along with those Sigma ones
that I mentioned and the first one which
I've talked about til I'm blue in the
face on here is the elf small stipple
brush this is one of their studio
brushes a $3 brush and cream blushes
cream highlights cream bronzers any sort
of cream color product I think this is
great for and there's a key reason why
the bristles are fairly dense and
they're not too long so if you want to
stipple a product into your skin and
without the bristles really likes
flopping over or something you get that
nice stiff stippling effect you've got a
thicker cream blush that you've
struggled to blend in in the past you
can do circular motions with this but
apply just the lightest pressure
possible and you get a beautiful blend
but you're not messing up your
foundation and concealers that you've
worked hard on underneath you've had a
lot of cream blushes and highlight type
products and you just haven't been using
them I tell you get this brush and it's
like opening a whole new world for
yourself because it's gonna make it so
easy to apply them another key brush
this year has been my Real Techniques
fine liner brush I think this is just
the ideal brush for applying cream and
gel liners it is just the perfect size
it gives the best line nice smooth
application a little fine bristles in
this brush really do hold some product
so I don't feel like I'm dipping back
continuously used a lot of finer tip
brushes and I feel like I just have to
work harder to build up the line that I
want and on the other end of the
spectrum Real Techniques has a thicker
liner brush it's the pixel point one and
that just gives me too thick of a line
at least for my eyes so this I feel like
it's just perfect finally for a great
drugstore standout brush a Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush this guy has gotten
used in so many tutorials that I have
done and
what's special about it is that it's
probably half or about two-thirds of the
size of a normal flat shadow brush that
you might use to pack shadow on your lid
so what you're getting with this brush
is control it's so nice and flat you
will get like really good color payoff
out of the color you're packing on but
you can really get it precisely where
you want it on your eye maybe it's just
around your inner corner maybe it's just
something smoky right on the outside you
can easily wedge it up into your crease
as well love it so much outstanding tool
this is actually a two-time winner and
this is just one of those things in my
collection that gets used over and over
and over again and it doesn't always get
talked about all the time but it's
something very important to me and it's
the brush guard I keep this little cup
under my sink I use them so often when
I'm cleaning my brushes but also if I'm
traveling with my brush and I just did a
full brush guard review on my Beauty
broadcast Xpress channel if you want
even more details that channel is purely
reviews quick ones five days a week but
they're just great for protecting the
bristles of the brush and let's say I
just cleaned this brush having the brush
guard on it will allow these brushes
particularly like these goat hair
bristle brushes where I feel like after
I clean them the bristles are just going
out in every which way this keeps it
really really nicely shaped or maybe
you're traveling with like a really
strangely shaped brush that doesn't fit
in with your normal brush storage there
are multiple sizes of these some are
smaller some are larger and you just
pick the one that fits best and then
you've got a completely protected
breadth and like I said drying them the
air is able to get to the bristles so a
brush can completely dry with a brush
guard on it but if you're keeping a
great shape so I just love this little
thing my next award is for the most
innovative product and this year seems
like we're kind of sticking on a brush
theme here but the most innovative
product for me that I've come across in
the past year has definitely been the
Benji Bell brush tree
I have loved using this to dry my
brushes it's just a great little tool
and I'll assemble it real quickly here
for you
this is
sunflower style it's probably my
favorite style because you'll notice
there are a bunch of different sized
little holes here in the top so if
you've got I brush as face brushes
whatever you're washing this seems to
accommodate pretty much everything I
will wash it one time and you just poke
your brush up through there and it dries
vertically pointing downward so all the
moisture in that brush is seeping away
from the brush instead of back into that
ferrule potentially loosening the
bristles of the brush basically harming
the construction of your brush and then
once it's dry you just pull it on out
this is great you can put a brush guard
on one of your brushes as it hangs in
here and again it will maintain the
shape of your brush it will still allow
the brush to dry but really give it a
great shape once you take it out but I
love this thing I love how it stores
completely flat under my sink but then I
just put it out on my sink when I'm
using it and it comes in pink who
doesn't love that so I've got an award
for cutest packaging I think this is
very important I love I'm a packaging
nut I love products that are just
visually adorable and draw me in and
make me want to buy that thing
regardless of what I think the quality
might be of the actual product inside I
just love cute packaging and this year
best packaging has got to be the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette I mean it
really mimics the look of a nice giant
chocolate bar and I also love even the
box that it comes in looks kind of like
an old-fashioned candy wrapper so it's
so cute this is a great palette as is
but I think the packaging just steals
the show I mean how much fun is that
it's kind of a metal casing here so I
think it's really nice and durable too
but from the non practical standpoint I
think it's just so cute
are they very manly awards does
something get an award just for looking
cute
well someone here is a little offended
the official trainer of the Emily awards
believes her soft fluffy packaging is
unmatched
don't worry cupcake there's always next
year and we live back to you yeah hang
in there cupcake there is always next
year
thanks for the guilt trip next category
is needs to be in your purse and I think
we're all looking for great little
things that are great for touch-ups when
we're on the go and this year a thing
that has really saved me time after time
in my purse has been the Tresemme tres
two hairspray but in the small size this
is 1.5 ounces
perfect for travel but I mean there are
just times when you're out and about and
your hair style maybe it started
perfectly but all it takes is a little
wind and things are looking crazy
you can duck into a bathroom or use it
in your car whatever this has just been
great and I usually find this in the
Travel section of a drugstore a Walmart
something like then VP's in my world
that means most valuable product and I
try to choose one for face eyes and lips
these are products that have won an
Emily award in their respective videos
but just the total stand out from each
area for me the MVP for face this year
has got to be the Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation thank you to my guide
David he hooked me up with so many great
Estee Lauder products over the past
couple of years and this has just been
one that I've become so attached to
nothing covers like this there is no
foundation that really gives the
flawless finish the incredible staying
power anybody who's used this can vouch
for staying power and then I feel like
it also continues to look pretty fresh
throughout the day it's not like you
check your makeup and it's like yeah the
foundation still there it doesn't look
good but it's still there no this
continues to look nice too look Fred vp4
eyes I thought about this for a while
and it eventually came down to one of
those irreplaceable one-of-a-kind
product I need this product this is what
I use and it's the Milani ultrafine
liquid liner this is the shade black
vinyl
this is I believe the perfect black
liquid liner I love liquid liner I think
it looks so sharp so pretty on the upper
lash line
the precise felt tip of this liner
allows you to get really really close to
your lash line which is so important
this is also truly waterproof dries to a
matte finish I think a matte black liner
defines the eye like none other if it's
shiny you're not getting quite the
definition you think you're getting my
MVP for lips this year is without a
doubt the bite Beauty lipsticks the
luminous cream lipsticks I think they're
fabulous the one that I have right now
in my hand this is one of the
double-ended ones I have a bunch of
these double-ended ones that I got in a
set so I don't want you to think this is
how they typically come normally they're
larger more standard sized lipstick but
today I'm wearing the shade actually
rose a little bit of rose on the inner
part of my lip and then I went over the
whole thing with Palomino which is this
gorgeous hot pink so just an example of
the kinds of great shades that are in
this line there are beautiful reds nudes
that mulberry shade that I shared in my
lips video who can wear these on your
lips all day and your lips feel even
though they're a lipstick your lips feel
very nourished they don't feel too dried
out I don't think these are
exceptionally shiny lipsticks so for
them to feel as comfortable as they do I
think is a real accomplishment
the halftime show we were going to use a
reel of my bloopers but let's be honest
I haven't had any so instead I've
created a musical tribute for all the
MVP most valuable prize
thank you now some shoutouts to
standouts in different categories the
first skin kid okay best skin care
products and this product has won
multiple years and for good reason for
me I mean there have been a lot of skin
care changes that I've made over the
years but this thing has really stayed
the same and it's the daily facials face
wash cloths Olay makes these but equate
that's Walmart's store brand also makes
these and I will pretty much by the
equate all the time assuming they're in
stock but they work so much the same
don't irritate my eyes I use these guys
to take off every bit of makeup on my
face I get right in there get all my eye
makeup off
I love how one side is more smooth the
other side is a little more texture
basically once water comes in contact
with these they get soapy and lathery
and it's just a breeze to get all your
makeup another favorite this year is a
certain kind of brush head that I've
been using for my Clarisonic Mia 2 and
it is the Clarisonic luxe
satin precision contour brush - sonic
has come out with a couple of really
really soft brush head
and I kind of wondered whether this
would do enough for a soft as it is I
mean it's so soft it's like baby bunny
so I use my Clarisonic several times a
week after I take my makeup off I feel I
could get that extra deep Clin there's
one that's larger than the satin
precision one but I thought this would
be nice because they talked about how
you can use it right over your eyes
really getting in there and the sides of
your nose and stuff and it works so what
really is the most gentle thing and I
have used it over some areas that were
very driest let it do their work so the
bristles you're not bending the bristles
at all and then you you feel them twitch
back and forth all over your skin and
you're getting such a nice clean and you
come away with that Clarisonic post
Clarisonic smoothness that I love even
with this but it's just so darn gen
lastly for skin care on this is the elf
daily moisture stick and I consider this
kind of a skin care thing it's like a
moisture touch up throughout the day and
it's got a lot of great moisturizing
ingredients in it it's just a jumbo
sized stick here it's definitely thinner
than the feel of say a chapstick but you
just get a little bit on your finger
there and one of the key places where I
like to use it is under the eye if you
start to look dry there if you start to
see fine lines more throughout the day a
little dabbing of this and I'm seriously
like one circle around the product and
then dab a little under your eye you
don't mess up your makeup but you do
drastically change the look of that
dryness you could use it anywhere where
you're dealing with dry patches dab a
little bit of this over it and it's like
it solves the problem on contact
instantly I thought I'd be a shoo-in for
best body until someone told me they
were talking about best body product
Sally Hansen airbrush legs
love this this one last year too this is
just a fabulous product I use this all
the time if I've got to be out in a
dress and let's say I haven't been
sunless tanning or even if I have and I
want my legs to just look completely
flawless this stuff is the bomb this is
like leg makeup basically and I've got
it in the shade medium here and that
really does work for me
be in a can that would spray out and I
would always mix it with lotion because
I thought it needed to be diluted a
little bit to really spread easily on my
legs now they've done it for us you know
this is an easy to spread out lotion
product it does not transfer off on a
white sheath another great body product
that I've raved about on the Express
channel is the Josie Maran
whipped argan oil this is the vanilla
apricot scent and this is just like
life-changing body lotion I love it I
ordered like multiple little guys to
give to my family members so they could
try it a big dent out of this one but it
is just the most luxurious body cream
and the scent is just juicy and amazing
I love how this really fully absorbs
into the skin but I love the softness
that I feel after or next thing truly it
won me over on scent alone it's a great
product I don't want to discount how
well this product works but the scent is
mind-blowing and it is the hemp's pure
herbal extracts fresh coconut and
watermelon body wash watermelon there
are many products out there with a melon
scent but very few that are actually
watermelon scent that are giving you
that authentic fruity scent not like
candy but like the fruit and the coconut
and watermelon I mean come on like I
want to lick this stuff up if I could
this is so gums up beautifully the
texture is kind of a cross between a gel
and a cream stumbled across this on
ulties website I think it said online
only
but that coconut and watermelon scent is
just perfect some of us are blessed with
great hair but a little product never
hurt anyone here are some of the best
hair products give some shoutouts to the
hair products including a longtime
favorite my Tresemme tres two hairspray
I don't really have a ton of different
hair products that I love to use all the
time but this is definitely a daily use
thing I've gone through so many of these
cans this is the big 11 ounce key
you saw me show the baby can earlier but
just one of those hair sprays that
really finishes my look I use it also as
eye style for example if I'm pooping
something up a little bit I give a
little spritz of that and then I've got
a little more control as I style my
really fine hair doesn't weigh my hair
down does it make it prematurely greasy
a groundbreaking product in my hair
world this year has been the Carol's
Daughter monoi repairing hair mask a
fabulous deep conditioner to use in the
shower I put it on as soon as I can
after I get my hair shampooed and then I
don't wash it out until right before I'm
about to get out of the shower and it
just gives the most fantastic nourishing
hydrating treatment to the ends of my
hair and it basically takes that abuse
from heat styling and products and
everything that you've been doing to
your hair and it completely says it's
okay baby you know your hair's gonna be
fun but it smells so nice such a fresh
scent
I know getting this size it's kind of
pricey it's kind of an investment not a
cheap hair product but if you could
maybe get your hands on a sample size
and see if it works for you like it
works for me it was like basically
having a button I can push you just
saying softness please perfect looking
ends please Thank You Ashley for hair um
this is something that I travel with all
the time and it's my Vidal Sassoon
velcro rollers and these have the
attached clips this is the same little
bag that they come in I think and get
them for less than ten bucks at a
drugstore like Walgreens but I use a lot
of different velcro rollers just in
day-to-day any of them work what you buy
a Sally is what you buy at Walmart you
know velcro rollers are velcro rollers
but these have the attached clip you're
not gonna lose them yay oh my gosh I've
got so much hair looks they're traveling
you don't have to worry about taking
clips or you know what if I lose some
you wrap your hair up you clip it here
you're not putting a big dent in your
hair I mean this whole operation works
great and I also love that there's a
variety of sizes this would be the
largest love using those up in the crown
and then you've got down to this size
for I like to use them on the lower
parts of my hair to get a little more
curl out of it I've got
l cro roller tutorials but basically
you're gonna put your hair around a
curling iron first to get it hot then
pop one of these on maybe you don't do
it all over your head maybe you just
want a lot of extra volume up here let
them sit in your hair for as long as you
can and then take them out and you're
just gonna notice
awesome volume what's the best for
keeping your nails in tip-top shape here
are some items that really nailed it
first off I want to give a shout out to
a great all-encompassing gel nail kit
and it is the Mallee 24/7 gel males I
have tried a couple of different gel
nail systems from the drugstore and they
have not worked near as well as this
this polish this gel polish will stay on
your nails until you take it on me I can
go like three weeks I'm starting to see
growth you know at the bottom but no
chips for that amount of time it's
outstanding and she's coming out with
more and more shades selling them in
trios and stuff on QVC you know you cure
your nails and here with the light
everything's really easy to follow in
the directions and it's just kind of a
nice experience you know you turn on
some YouTube videos grab yourself a
drink do your nails and it's just kind
of fun to did I don't love like tending
to my nails constantly so this is like a
good low maintenance thing that you can
do once every two to three weeks of
course we all like our normal polishes
now and then and I would say my favorite
line of nail polishes is the Sally
Hansen complete salon manicure
I love the wide brush with this I think
it makes even application very simple
with many of these shades you could get
by with one coat they give a lot of
shine this is the shade I'm wearing
today it's called punch-drunk totally
that radiant orchid type color loving my
final favorite for nails that really
puts the cherry on top what I'm using
that is the Sally Hansen mega shine
topcoat and it's in the mirrored bottle
for a while I worried this has been
discontinued but it dries so so fast
gets amazing shine and really I think
extends the wear of the Polish so that's
the finale thank you everyone so much

your excitement with me I can totally
feel it
I love these videos I love you
