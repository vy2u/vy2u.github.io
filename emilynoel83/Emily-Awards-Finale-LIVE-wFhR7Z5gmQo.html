amazing the things that you can't do
like until right when everything's going

Abby's here Rebecca Jill yay
okay so it really it's working this is
awesome I did a little test rent earlier
today I don't know if anybody picked up
on that on YouTube but I think I might
have been live for like a second but
thank you again so much for joining and
for this live finale um if you've
watched the Emily awards before the
finale for the for this whole little
video series is kind of like a way to
talk about some of the winners that
weren't clearly in like the eyes lips or
face category you know what I mean so
it's just there's some random things
there's some most valuable products and
I do have all of the winners laid out
that I would normally mention any year
you know on the blog that's beauty
broadcast net and I just pulled that up
over here and checked it and the new
post is live so you can see exactly what
the winners are but I'm gonna jump in
because I want to talk about some of the
winning products I want to definitely
open this up for just random Q&amp;amp;A you
know whatever you guys want to talk
about and then um Tyler's got a top 5 to
come in and talk about and hopefully at
that point in time he'll bring Bell with
him and
you
it went for like 10 so I'm hoping like a
big interruption happening here but I'll
keep going I'll do whatever I gotta do
you guys know that so Texas Pennsylvania
Holly Springs Georgia New York L was
here I know else out in Arizona hi
Alyssa curly hi everybody
oh my gosh everywhere awesome possum
okay well I'm gonna start out and talk
about a few of my winning things I'm
gonna go through and kind of quit
because I really want to have time to do
questions and you know fun stuff but the
first category that of the finale is
best freshers and I wanted to pick out
some brushes just like some particular
brushes you know no because I can tell
you all like a whole brush set and there
are plenty of great ones but I thought
it'd be fun to focus in on the brushes
that have really been good to me you
know this past year and the first one is
definitely my Sigma f80 that is my go-to
foundation brush and there are a lot of
reasons why I like it first off it would
be that it works with so many different
kinds of foundations so really liquidy
ones more moose like or creamy ones and
I think the reason why it's so workable
is because it's so dense and it's really
soft and it has its L silence that and
it has like a good surface area you know
when I put it here on my face so it
buffs a lot in at once which i think is
really it helps you achieve that really
even flawless effect so that is my
favorite foundation brush I have tried
others that have come close to this but
this I really do think is the best pet
and just the best put-together brush and
then my other favorite for what I'm
calling high-end I don't know if Sigma
is technically high-end but it's
definitely price your brush is compared
to other stuff that I use and this is
the e25 and I use this in a lot of
tutorials love how it's pinched in at
the top that kind of flattens this brush
out so it works really well in the
crease and then also like blending just
above the crease or just blending
period it works really well I'm gonna
need to move faster I'm gonna need to
move faster through this or else I'm not
gonna get through everything Oh video
cutout can't see your video not getting
video just sound oh no did we break
YouTube surely not
well you guys will you update me I'm
gonna keep talking then if you're still
getting my audio okay go came back you
guys are awesome thank you for letting
me know um I've got a couple drugstore
brushes
what is this everybody let's say it
together the elf small stipple brush woo
I love this for the cream blushes the
cream highlights I mean it just nothing
else works like this this is you know
the bristles are short here's the thing
to a fiber brushes there are a lot of
them out there but a lot of them are so
flexible and bendy this is has short
enough bristles to where they say they
stay stiff so when you want to stipple
right here onto your cheek you know it
doesn't get all like mushy against your
skin so it's just really easy to apply
the product and not interfere with
whatever other makeup you're wearing and
then Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
again all of these products are listed
on beauty broadcast net with links with
related reviews if I have any that's
what the more info links are our past
reviews that the Sonia Kashuk small
shadow brush is the perfect size for
just patting shadow in precise areas I
use it a lot in my you know right outer
the outer part of my lid and also kind
of pulling up into the crease works
really well so those are best brushes
and the next category here is
outstanding tool and that is the Real
Techniques lash and brow
Gruber this is the kind of thing and it
always goes this way with this category
it's something that doesn't really get a
lot of love because a lot of times is
something that's used kind of behind the
scenes you know and I love this little
comb that this one has it's great for
combing through any kind of gunk you
might get in your lower lashes coming
through upper lashes brushing through
brows it's just a really awesome little
tool to have on
and what sets it apart for me is that a
lot of my little combs have a thicker
bristle on each side for whatever reason
and I hate that because then you can't
truly like comb through stuff so all of
these little bristles can easily just
comb right through your lashes and I I
have gotten a lot of use out of that um
what else what was the other category
and I'm not gonna go through everything
I'm not gonna go through the skin care
body or hair those are all listed on the
blog and I want to have time for
questions but um the next category is
cutest packaging it's right behind me
it's right here if the labelled carousel
from Too Faced and I know you know if
you wanted this now this was a holiday
thing it's gonna be pretty hard to come
by now but just judging the packaging
this is the cutest I mean come on now
it's about like a bunch of different
panels each of these is a different
palette so there's like several eye
palettes in here a couple of blush
bronzer palettes there's a little
mascara that I still have in there but
it's so so cute and yes Belle is in the
name so maybe I'm a little biased but
this is gonna have to hang out in her
nursery when I'm when I'm all done with
it here I just thought that was the most
adorable most innovative different kind
of packaging um that came out this past
season this past year um what else needs
to be in your purse a product that needs
to be in your purse and I will be
getting to the comments here very soon
by the way but a product that I think
needs to be in your purse in case of
emergency is the Revlon precision lash
adhesive now I'm not one who carries a
lot of makeup in my purse at all I will
have a compact I will have the lip
product that I've been wearing that day
but if I'm wearing lashes I must take
this with me because does anybody else
get paranoid that you know what happens
if your lashes start to come unglued
like that's a bigger deal than your
lipsticks ad right like that's a bigger
emergency and so I need whatever glue I
used which is usually this too kind of
tamp down any lashes that might start to
come up it doesn't happen happen often
but it happens just enough for me to be
a little freaked out so I need to have
this and this is great for touch-ups um
next category is oh the MVPs all right
MVPs very excited about this I have one
for face one for eyes and one for lips
and basically I look at all of the
winners that I had in those other videos
and I choose an overarching mega winner
for each category you know so for face
this year gotta be this folks for me for
me personally it has to be the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum coverage and
I need to make it clear that not
everyone needs this kind of foundation
but those who do they really need it you
know if you need major coverage and I'm
talking about that what this is best at
covering up is skin discoloration so if
you had melasma like I had during my
pregnancy if you've got redness things
like that that aren't necessarily
texture issues I'm not saying this can't
cover the texture II things that you're
having but I think it's best at covering
the discoloration so amazing amazing
coverage product and it only takes a
little bit if you think it looks too
heavy try using less but this this just
has worked wonders for me and if your
skin is pretty good or you know average
you know you don't need a lot of heavy
coverage don't get this but if you
really are having issues I can't mention
this enough because it was a real you
know I don't want to be overly dramatic
and say oops
lifesaver for me but it was a really
helpful product in being a one-step
thing that can cover the discoloration a
lot of people think okay you put on your
foundation then what concealer do you
use you know then what you really used
to cover it up this completely covered
up my melasma so yay for Estee Lauder
it's just a great product and then for
eyes my MVP this is crazy
Estee Lauder is like
my Sam Smith of the Emily Awards because
the little black primer is my MVP for
eyes this thing has really transformed
all of my mascaras I put it on first
I had an Instagram picture the other day
actually and I was talking about a Mac
pigment and several people instead of
commenting on the pigment they said but
your eyelashes you know that you could
probably tell I wasn't wearing false
eyelashes whoa this is looking rainbow
style here but I wasn't I wasn't wearing
false eyelashes but my lashes were
looking good is my boy and I had this on
under my mascara and it's just a great
great primer and it really looks super
natural if this was all you wanted to
wear but if you top take any problematic
mascara that you don't like and put it
on top of this it holds the curl that's
the most important point
it holds the curl that is my biggest
problem with my eyelashes and so that's
why this is a game changer and you could
use this as kind of like a extra long
wearing topcoat on top of your mascaras
too and the MVP for lips fun fact this
is the only MVP to repeat to win to MVP
awards other than wet and wild color
icon eye shadows and that is the bite
lipsticks and I just love these I you
know I here's my hair was my thought
process when I was thinking of MVP for
lips I thought okay it's gonna be bite
but then I went back and I thought about
several other things and then I said
hold up if you you know entered your
makeup room one morning and all of your
bite lipsticks were gone
you know like stolen somebody came in
and ransacked the place and took the
bite lipsticks how upset would you be
and my answer to that is very upset so
they are the MVP for lips I love to take
advantage of any deals where they've got
them double ended because it's these are
not cheap lipsticks to buy them one at a
time and there are so many great colors
if you can get a kit around the holidays
or even right now
I think they're still selling some
double-ended once maybe 12 bucks ish or
so but it's a really great deal so I
take advantage of that every time and
I'm so glad I do I do and this shade
that I have on I have on Palomino all
over my lips and then I blended a little
bit of another shade over it I use
scarlet and that's this really dark
shade so it's getting me a little bit of
that ombre ish effect guys stop talking
for a second so relationships but that
is what I was planning to talk about for
this video and like I said on the blog I
have highlighted three top skincare
products three top body products top
hair products and Tyler will be joining
us shortly for the Tyler Awards so now
I'm gonna look over here and see what
some questions what questions have been
coming in and thank you guys again so
much for joining me we wear it over a
thousand live viewers right now which is
just blowing my mind
this is a lot more than we've had for
beauty broadcast live in the past so let
me see here I'm gonna refresh the screen
hopefully I don't send the broadcast
into a tailspin but go to the newest
comments here Oh awesome everybody's
still saying where they're from Buffalo
New York
awesome yeah there's so many people here
hi Erica hi Amanda videos on the new
wet-and-wild makeup yes I will have some
new stuff coming there's a lot of new
Fergie stuff as well so I will be
getting some of that and doing some
videos also I have a ton a ton of new
NYX stuff I got a package in the mail
the other day
it's it was heavy as lead and it was
full of NYX makeup so I have I mean I've
already been kind of messing around with
some of that but dang I have a lot of
work ahead of me Oh
b:g blonde like the estee lauder is the
Sam Smith oh here's something funny I
used to work with a reporter at this at
the TV station and his name is Sam Smith
and apparently he's been getting tons of
congratulatory tweets on the Grammys
it's a Twitter account it's like Sam
Smith and then the letter I don't know
if it's W it's something in Kentucky wk
something and he was like retweeting all
these people who were congratulating of
the Grammy it's like Ron Sam Smith who
will be your back oh that's a good point
I don't know um I don't think bite is
underrated enough for me to to call them
my back but or who will be the Kanye or
the Glee or the Beyonce you know oh my
gosh oh has the flu got in your family
yet fortunately it has not I had a cold
it was was that before Christmas no it
was after it was it was right at the
start of the new year because it started
coming on me on New Year's Eve and Bell
never taught it and I was so glad and
Tyler it had a little bit of an allergy
type issue but he really wasn't sick
either so oh we've got a second on bite
lipstick and palomino Karissa Bandar
says it's the best it is awesome and I
love that they featured it in that
Sephora give me more lip favorites
sampler set that was great um how is it
being a mom it is awesome I must say I I
cannot believe I made a person well not
me solely I mean it kind of took Tyler
sort of played a role in this but like I
look at this little human being and I
think this everyday like wow you have
two arms and two legs and all the
fingers and toes you're supposed to have
and
like for some reason this continues to
fascinate me day after day after day
like you might think that's the thing
you kind of take for granted but
honestly I was just kind of nervous that
I would have the child with like two
extra fingers or something I don't know
and I just I just am in awe of her she
is so cute she is so smiley and fun and
I could take up like a whole nother hour
talking in the comforter so I should
probably stop there but it's it's going
great and I think it keeps things keep
getting easier I will say like the
things that I struggled with it first
like breastfeeding and you know sleeping
and stuff like that I feel like time has
been good to us it's kind of thing I've
seen so many things kind of work
themselves out as I've learned more as
she's learned more and yeah I think
Tyler will be bringing her up when he
joins us here and I was only planning to
do this for a half hour but that's gonna
be way too short so I'm gonna have to go
at least 45 minutes I just didn't want
this to turn out to be too long so like
when people went to go back to watch it
you know they'd be like oh my gosh I'm
not gonna watch that it's it's an hour
and a half you know but I guess I got
got done with the actual business at the
start so we can just you know have a
good time here for the rest of it when
are you gonna start beauty broadcast
live again so glad you asked Annie
Harris I think it's gonna be a two times
a month type thing on the weekends so
I'm thinking like every other weekend
doing a beauty broadcast live because I
miss it so much we became such a
tight-knit group those of you who joined
in and watched that and I really want to
get back to it it's just been really
hard to have guaranteed time when I'm
here alone you know if she needs
something if she's eat and feeling like
I had to you know really be on a
schedule what that would be really hard
but I think on the weekends when I'm not
here by myself that'll be better
Allyson violet is she answering question
from the comments yes um gosh I'm just
kind of bouncing around here because I
know I'm missing some of these but I'm
trying to get some in here and any
questions about yeah the Emily Awards or
how I do that how I decide on products
or whatever it might be feel free to ask
the way or if you'd rather just talk
about random stuff that's fun
did you play the Powerball today no I
didn't but I saw it being discussed on
the news and I kind of thought I should
so what's on my lips yes this is a mix
of bite innocent did I get like battle
on you
no no it's bite palomino and bites
scarlet Palomino is kind of the brighter
shade and then faded out into scarlet
yay oh good nicole says I just looked up
the bite double-ended lipsticks there
are only $12 and neutral shades neutral
shades that I know of to recommend fig
is kind of well it's more pinky but
that's a little more on the neutral side
I feel like I gravitate always toward
like the the brighter shades and I
haven't used my neutrals as much but I
have a double-ended one gets big on when
and and date
this is doesn't that look like a nice
one kind of a nice neutrally shade so
that's pretty I can swatch that for you
here I don't know if this is one of the
ones available because I got this in a
set but these are very
look how wearable those two would be
even mixed like if you wanted to take a
date and make it a little more like
pinkish that would be nice I just did a
little bit of reorganizing around here
today and I this is what I did I took
this thing this came from the Container
Store and I put all my bite stuff in it
so I've got the double ended lipsticks
the high pigment lip pencils random
stuff like the agave lip mask and
different ones and then these are some
like lip by
eyetality lip flush things from it
cosmetics but I love this I like having
them together like that because they're
like I said they're my my other babies
you know they're my special lip products
so sorry they sitting over there on the
other side of the computer well we see
bloopers outtakes from the Emily I
haven't thought about that would you
like to what is on your eyebrows wait
where'd it go where'd that comment go
they are on point thank you Thank You
Emily Madison on my brows are a new
thing for NYX that I'm trying
it's called tame and frame tinted brow
pomade and I'm liking this a whole lot
this is in brunette and it doesn't take
much like don't go scooping your brush
into that because it's gonna it's gonna
show up so I use that with an angled
brush and what I like about it is that
it actually has some hold to it and so
that kind of reminds me of my Too Faced
bulletproof brows this got a little too
dry on me and so I'm hoping this doesn't
dry out as fast as that good so it's
been like my second day trying it out so
thank you um let's see have you tried
the Real Techniques bold metals
collection on the fence about trying
them that's wrist loves beauty um you
know I I was thinking about it and then
I saw Kristin games review about it and
it kind of turned me off because she
wasn't real thrilled with I wouldn't say
all of them but it seems like there were
maybe a few more misses than hits with
that so I kind of thought I don't think
I'll go there but Real Techniques does
have a couple of new brushes out that
I'm planning to review just for the
regular line and one I found these both
at Walmart what is the sculpting brush
look at that puppy does that look dense
and fabulous or what so cream bronzer
any one could be good for that that's
what I've used it for three times
and then they've got a concealer brush
it kind of looks like these are trying
to be like the what would they be
s eighty fours from Sigma you know that
that type of thing a little smaller
whoa mine looks like a major like looks
like my thumb why how did it get shaped
like that you know that like has a major
Hitchhiker's thumb it's like a dude okay
anything there's this concealer brush
and it it reminds me of like one of
those little maybe the p84 only it's a
little bit skinny so we're trying those
out right now well not right now but you
know um do you have a sales video not
yet but I probably will because I've had
some sales happen to me over the year in
the world of beauty um when did you
first decide to come up with the Emily
Awards that was back in 2008 and I was I
don't know if anybody was watching back
then but I was back in the apartment and
I just thought I want to do a favorites
of the year and I didn't have near as
many categories as I do now I just did
one video talking about favorites and I
just decided to call it the Emily Awards
because I couldn't think of anything
else and that it's one of those things
were like the name stuck for example you
might not like the YouTube username you
chose like if you would know if you knew
you'd still be on YouTube to this day
you might have chosen something
different it's that kind of thing like I
kind of wish I would have come up with a
catchy or different name but whatever
the case may be it's step for all these
years and I'm not changing it now but I
just thought it was a great wrap up for
top products and a nice way to refer
people the things that I liked a lot
from the past year and I love I keep a
little database on my little laptop and
every year I have lists of the new
favorites so that way I can know you
know
many years a certain thing is one and I
can always take the new stuff that's
come out and compare it to the older
stuff because that's sometimes the flaw
I think of YouTube of you know everybody
getting very product hungry which I I'm
equally as guilty because I love the new
stuff that comes out oh I want this new
palette oh I want this new thing but
it's really great to UM think about all
the things from the past that you really
liked and continually every year you
know think about those things and see
how they compare to the newer items so
that's why I like not doing just yearly
favorites looking back only at the past
year because I think you should look
back at all the stuff and how does it
stack up so it's a lot of work it's it's
very thought consuming sometimes I go to
bed and I'm like I'm gonna have to sleep
on this one because I don't know which
product to choose you felt like stuff
like that I'm I'm obsessed I'm obsessed
I'm sorry somebody asked about my
necklace I saw out of the corner of my
eye and this was my push present and
this is my little B it's got teeny tiny
little diamonds in there so that was
from bub and it's not be for bub it's be
for Bill or I guess it could be be for
bub who knows kwc card design said this
is not beauty related but how long have
you been a st. Louis Cardinal fan and
will you take Belle to a game wait hold
on it went away
oh and love your videos and honesty
thank you so much thank you very very
much and I've been a lifelong Cardinals
fan
my dad was a st. Louis Cardinals fan and
even I I can't remember how young I was
when I first went to old Busch Stadium
to a game but it's just pretty much been
my entire life so yeah really enjoy the
Cardinals and I'm sure bill will you
know hopefully not one of those super
hot
like really hard to sit through the
games in the middle of the summer but
maybe when the temperatures good we'll
get her out to a game
she's got Cardinals onesies of course
already so I'm sorry I know I'm not
getting every comment because the
comments are coming in like mad but I am
just kind of looking over here and just
randomly checking it out so um any food
you do not like eating for the longest
time it used to be gravy as a little kid
I did not like gravy on anything
anything gravy dish just turned me off
and needless to say I got over that
because I love some biscuits and gravy

good thanks for joining us here or the
Emily Awards finale and basically I have
given them some of my awards taking some
questions and Tyler has chosen a top
five he has done so many reviews I say
we give it up for bub and tied a Friday
and all of the good work he has done for
that so you know it's been it's been
brave and I'd like to also give it up to
the person who has to end all that stuff
- yes
but anyways take the way bub do you got
a top 5 trailer name specific order or
just um however you want roll with it
this looks looking you okay alright
first off in no particular order
mm-hmm Old Spice spiffy pomade this was
a pretty surprised fine
I used to use during a surf hair
they just completely discontinued that
they switched it up they changed the
formula and I didn't like it yeah
probably look around for over a year to
find something similar and I had never
found it until they liked him up with
pista he's totally a new product they
don't think they'd even been a hairy job
before and it just it's like exactly the
same except it smells better so you'd
use this just once you he got onto this
he's stuck with it I've never used an
accessory using this awesome
fantastic highly recommended here's one
of those favorites
he knows Birds you know this is a recent
review okay google chromecast
that's probably what two videos ago
maybe it's that incredibly cool product
very cheap we've gotten a lot of good
out of it already what is it doing in
that show takes what's on your phone
your computer or your tablet puts it on
the TV lots of cool stuff you can do is
that I'm learning some new things you
can do that I've never even thought of
before
really neat and for the price you know
being able to watch all your Netflix and
all that stuff watch YouTube videos on
there it's fantastic I like finding
songs and stuff on YouTube and then you
just make a playlist and it's like it's
coming through your sound system and you
can just watch it right on TV it's
awesome really like if you want to burn
through a few songs you know music
videos all kinds of different things
well this would be one of the first
products I ever discussed when you get
emotional yeah
cocoa butter lip balm by cocoa care oh
yeah well I never never have chapped
lips anymore
put this on at night I don't even use it
every night anymore but a couple of
times a week at night I never get
chapped lips that's crazy
this has been like for years you've been
using I mean that apartment is
right two thousand eight thousand seven
inch been using it since then and they
last forever - you know one of these
goes along with it the cheap but if you
can find them something sometimes you go
through stretches where the hard to find
I have a link of course on beauty
broadcast net where you can buy these
they're just a little over a dollar on
drugstore comm so I bought him like ten
at one point and some of you guys have
also like sent some to the PIO box
do you want to come join forces downy
UNSTOPABLES
they are transcendent laundry product
just make your clothes smell awesome
every time it's no small pink ones yeah
I like to think what's the best almost
travesty mothers would think think on
the best point very easy just tossing
them in there but before you put the
laundry detergent in
nothing to it so now you've named one
two three four or five this is my Fox
Creek leather belt nothing too flashy
about it just a standard belt but it's
actual leather like real leather belt I
used to go through five six belts a year
it seemed like if not more they would
just break and come apart and I had this
one for well over two years now wear it
everyday it's fantastic oh gosh I have
to watch that bow lipstick on the bow
lipstick on the bow thank you it was a
little expensive from as far as belts go
but not considering how long I've used
it for
one of those things we spend a little
money at the beginning and ends up
saving a lot in the long term really
really good though
and those are the timer's everybody so
um somebody's asking about Belle's
outfit this was a gift from our friend
Katie who I used to work with at channel
3 she is now in Atlanta if you watch the
weather down there
her name's Katie walls and she I'm not
sure where she got this but it's so cute
it's got little poodles and Eiffel
Towers on it yes a shout out from

Mickey are you looking she's looking at
the comments going by oh my gosh what
was the one shoutout Washington State
shout-out Canada Sarah s Sarah s yes we
ran into Sarah at the IKEA in
Bolingbrook know Chicagoland area when
Belle was just about the size of a
grapefruit we get used to just wipe and
spit with our bare hands that's how we
roll how long have we been together 2001
Valentine's Day junior year of high
school the big dance
this guy got on his little msn messenger
system he and there was somebody who had
asked me to the dance but I was still in
a limbo phase and what to do
and we were talking and he swooped in
but first he had his sister get on okay
now you're mixing up stories right
I talked to Sarah first and she had
asked me about if I'm definitely
something there were just no recon prior
to might suspect recon
oh my gosh she's like what like even
weed any advice for new youtubers I
would say it's harder now to be a new
youtuber than it was when I cuz there
weren't as many people online I mean
there's just so many people doing Beauty
videos these days so oh you think that
but my advice is to try to seek out what
what is not currently out there and try
to fill a void if you can if there's a
type of video that you think should be
out there you know try to do that try it
it's really hard but I mean just
thinking of original video ideas that
you haven't seen scrolling through your
subscription feed a million zillion
times I mean I think that's important to
try to bring something new to the table
if you can because I just I think we
need more originality more I don't know
yes different things and don't try to
just fashion yourself like after a
particular person you might watch you
know definitely be your own self bring
your own personality to it and do it
because you enjoy it if it's seeming
like you know something really difficult
for you or you know if you don't if you
don't truly love it it's gonna seem like
work I think so yep that's what I say Oh
tardy pass we're bringing back to tardy
cast really tardy cuz were supposed to
bend down for two minutes we owe
