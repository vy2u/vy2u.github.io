who I am
Tyler sponge tip of course and this is
part three of the Emily awards the
much-anticipated lips category and
apparently this year the official
trainer of the Emily awards took things
to a whole new level
testing the products on yourself how
about that now let's send it over to
Emily and beauty broadcast headquarters
well thank you so much Tyler and thank
you everybody for watching the Emily
awards thank you so much for the
wonderful response to these videos we
look forward to doing them every year
and I personally always really look
forward to the lips part because I just
am so attracted to lip products you guys
know I just love trying new glosses new
lipsticks and interestingly enough I've
tried a lot of new lip products this
year but you're gonna notice the first
part of this video I've got a lot of
repeat winners and then things kind of
come apart toward the end and there's
tons of notes and lots to talk about so
let's jump right in
first off best high end lip balm and I
do have a winner for this this year and
it's the fresh sugar lip balm I have one
of these minis and I've actually gone
through like a whole one in the past
year and I'm on a new one companies
sometimes is like a little perk or
something from Sephora but these are
really fantastic quality lip balms if
you have a chance to try one I know
they're kind of pricey to buy like a
full-size on its own but it's not like
the slightest little lemony scent but
the texture is a little bit thicker than
a lot of like chap sticks that are out
there that sister loves these too in
fact I got her one of the tinted ones
for Christmas in berry and she really
likes that so there's a lot to choose
from if you like the tints but just the
classic one um has an SPF 15 and it's
really nice drugstore this is another
two-time winner but it didn't win just
last year it was something I kind of got
on a kick with before and I've come back
to it and it's the Nivea kiss of
smoothness I actually like this one and
also the kiss of honey I think it's
called Blanc the yellow - so just great
workhorse type lip products great for
those super dry chapped lips
it's kind of a no-frills sort of lip
product but it goes on really smooth
slightly thicker texture when you put it
on your lips and therefore you feel like
you've got you know that moisture
barrier there you've got a little extra
hydration for tented lip balm I have two
drugstore favorites actually on both or
something new first off the NYX butter
lip balms I really really like these
these have totally grown on me I started
with just a couple and now my collection
of these is expanded quite a bit but
these are a really nice lip balm I've
got a full review on them they're tinted
and they're not super shiny but I feel
like whenever I put them on my lips look
it's different you know it's different
from a lot of the tinted lip balms out
there slightly thicker in texture than
the Maybelline Baby Lips which I really
like those too it was kind of hard to
pick but a few great shades I love the
pink and ladyfingers brownie is a really
nice neutral and if you want a little
pop of red if you're just dipping your
toe into red lip colors I'm red velvet
is a really good option
it's time for a game break and this year
Nyx's come up with possibly the greatest
beauty innovation of all time a butter
lip balm it's portable goes on smooth
and his lip smacking good why didn't I
think of it Emily
another great little sign that I ran
into this year super affordable are the
elf lip balm tints and these are in
little pots and I have them in nude and
berry and these show up with such pretty
color on your lip it's a lot more color
than you would expect from a lip balm
like this especially with the nude you
think that would be super sheer but
really it comes off with nice color that
got a lightly sweet flavor to them and a
lot of great shine favorite lip liner
high-end I've got a repeat favorite in
this category and it's the Too Faced
perfect lips I love that these are
retractable lip liners that go on soso
creamy smooth like seriously one of the
easiest lip liners for filling in your
entire lip if you want to they've got
some great shades that I tend to reach
for a lot if I'm doing anywhere from a
nude to a mid-tone neutral lip is this
one in perfect spice it just gives the
right amount of like subtle contrasts
that I like to have maybe on the outer
parts of the lips when I'm using a
lighter shade favorite drugstore lip
liner NYX all the way loving these
retractable lip liners this year I got
like a whole set of them on HauteLook
and I just love these badboys creamy
they twist up full color so long where
you really want to take your lipstick
and pump up the staying power find a
coordinating shade in one of these and
use that as your base and it's so
long-lasting NYX has such a nice color
range you probably know that but this
one in red I would say is an essential
one for your collection because you
always want that nice clean border for a
red lip and this really gives you that
jumbo lip pencils you would not believe
how many of these I've tried over the
year actually you probably would and you
know that brands have come out with
these left and right and for high-end
I've got a returning favorite here and I
think it's very well-deserved because
I've only discovered more and more that
I like from this line over the past year
and it's the tarte lipsurgence
the one i'm holding here isn't fever
it's one of the lustre finishing
so it's like a red with a little bit of
shimmer really enjoyed experimenting
with some of the different finishes from
Tarte they've got great matte ones if
you're looking for something a little
bit different a matte that still feels
very soft and comfortable on your lips
that would be something to try but the
tints are nice the lustre love how these
go on very little me but still really
full color now do you remember last year
at this time when I was talking about
the sweat pants of lip products the most
comfortable thing to wear the Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks well I've
tried a lot a lot of drugstore jumbo lip
pencils since that time and guess what
still comes out on top yep I love these
from Neutrogena I think they are just
the bump I love these so much I love the
feel on my lips
these have been North Dakota winter
weather tested and I had no chapped lips
I mean they're a workhorse they are a
workhorse lip product they're not just
on your lips to look pretty although
they do but I think they totally create
that great barrier that you want between
your lips and the dry air I own pretty
much every shade they have and I even
wish they come out with more but a
couple that I just pulled out to show
you fresh papaya really nice kind of
springy summery shade and then rich
raisin a nice slightly deep read that I
think is very wearable favorite lip
plumpers um one clear winner for me and
it's the buxom lip plumper I love all
the different shades I've continued to
try more shades in these and love them
on the one I have here is called April
it's a really pretty light pink it's got
a little bit of shimmer these don't
really claim to be a super long wearing
lip gloss but they do hang around on
your lips quite a while because they're
a little bit they're sticky enough to
have some decent staying power but not
so sticky that they're super annoying at
least I don't find him that way there's
a little bit of tingle but not the
painful tingle that a lot of lip
plumpers have so these are just a
favorite and continue to be this year
favorite lip stain I have tried a lot of
different drugstore products that have
had stain in the name this year but
nothing has really ultimately appealed
to me even as close to as much as the
one that is my favorite and it's the
cosmetics vitality lip flood it's hard
to find something that's gonna give you
as much color as these do but it's still
so hydrating so on so many great oils
and ingredients in these when you put
them on your lips they feel so supple
smooth fresh a little bit shine but
you're getting really nice staying power
out of these I've had my mom test out
different shades and she hasn't noticed
any feathering outside the lip line
which is something she's always on the
lookout for this shade is genis a quoi
it looks clear but this is one of those
that turns kind of a magenta pink on
your lips so I really like this shade
but there are plenty of nice other ones
to choose from do you know when you're
going out shopping you don't have to
memorize all of the Emily awards winners
there's a blog called beauty broadcast
dotnet that lets you scan through a list
of all the products mentioned looks like
there are links to shop online and even
links to previous reviews for more
information someone went to a lot of
work and it wasn't me Emily okay drum
roll please
best lipstick high-end brand new winner
this year couldn't be more excited about
it it's bite Beauty all the way love
these lipsticks if you're a regular
reader of my blog you're probably not
surprised by this I've gotten a couple
of different sets that I've shown like
all the colors on my lips and I'm just
so so thrilled with how beautifully they
apply okay
there's great ingredients in there like
food grade stuff that it's okay to eat
if you wanted to which I'm not gonna do
that great color selection if you're one
of those girls who doesn't like to mess
around with anything remotely sheer you
will like these lips definitely like
hydrating feel I love when I press my
lips together when I'm wearing these and
I almost feel like yep there's still
moisture and something else I like about
bite is the way they do their sets I've
got a couple of minis and earlier in the
fall I got this set of the double-ended
ones and I like that they include colors
that are part of the regular line so if
you fall in love with one of these
shades there is a full-size available
for use this mulberry shade you might be
hearing about this in just a few minutes
again but that's what I'm wearing on my
lips right now
this pink called Palomino just get out
of town that is so pretty and in this
past year I have tried like some really
luxury brand lipsticks and very
expensive lipsticks but these definitely
stand out to me as the best from
high-end if you're wanting to put a
little more money into a lip product I
really think you should look into this
brand watch out I got a new favorite
from drugstore - it's the Milani color
statement lipsticks I love throughout
the earlier part of this past year
testing out every shade they have to
offer like I am so educated on this line
of lipsticks it's great I've tried their
neutrals their Pink's their orange
shades their Browns like every such an
impressive color range finishes of all
kinds metallic shimmer cream Manion
really full color nothing sheer about
them one of the shades that's really
been a favorite of mine this one called
uptown mauve just a gorgeous berry type
shade with a little bit of purple fruit
punch a gorgeous classic pink got some
really pretty nudes and neutrals as well
that I feel I can wear like on their own
without doctoring them up with any gloss
or lip liner which is kind of a big
thing for me so I love those Milani
lipsticks high-end lip gloss this is
actually a first-time winner kind of
surprising because they've always been
something I've used a lot and have been
on my radar for a long time but it's the
valley high shine liquid lip colors I
call these a gloss because they do all
have that really shiny glossy finish but
they're all very full color like a
lipstick I really like the applicator
they twist up and then they go through
this brush so you can get a really
precise application which is nice for
some of these deeper shades this is a
more recent one that I got called
marvelous and there's some Reds that I
just think that applicator is really
helpful with if you're just starting out
you want a really great works for
everyone kind of shade I would get
blossoms kind of a pearly slightly
metallic mid tone shade there's a little
bit of pink in it a little bit of gold
these have really good staying power
despite not being sticky at all so love
in the drugstore a returning favorite
and a new favorite an old favorite that
I've loved for a long long time are the
Knicks mega shine lip
NIC's always does it right with shade
range I feel like there's always a ton
to choose from so even if you've tried a
lot there's probably still more out
there for you to use I love that pretty
much every shade that you try seems to
go on and give you the color you would
expect to see on the outside of the tube
you know this shade called Cosmo so
stunning it's a little bit like Revlon's
rose pearl maybe even slightly more
shiny and metallic but I think it's just
so so pretty really brightens up your
face the new winner for drugstore
lipgloss also kind of a tie going on
here the Maybelline Color sensational
lip gloss these are not the little short
squatty color elixirs but the actual
color sensational lip glosses I don't
hear tons of people talking about these
but I think they are phenomenal a very
comfortable formula really opaque colors
in this line that really show up bold
and beautiful the bold and the beautiful
on your lips and I also really like this
shade it's kind of an all-purpose gloss
it's an almond crush is really great for
giving like a slightly pearly shine to
any lip color you've got on or just
apply it to the center of your lower lip
it looks really pretty that now we're
going into some specific shade favorites
if you're new to the Emily awards for my
lips I like to break it down into a few
different shade categories so you can
really get some good recommendations for
like pinks berries nudes what at first
off favorite pink lipstick I so so love
the Milani lipstick and fruit punch this
is such a beautiful troop it's bold it's
not sheer in the least it's a
straight-up creamy shade it feels nice
on the lip favorite pink lip gloss and
this is the only one from here on out
that has been a repeat winner in these
specific shade categories but favorite
pink gloss is the NYX mega shine and
beige complained for awhile that this
beautiful pink is named beige but it's
so so pretty it's a creamy pink it's a
very very classic pink color all in all
on the lips this is gonna look a little
less bright than this Milani lipstick so
if you're wanting just that really nice
wearable pink shade I think this would
be a good one to test
or favorite berry lipstick I'm wearing
it right now
it's the bite Beauty lipstick in
mulberry probably one of my favorite
bite lipsticks of everything I've tried
I think it's just the gorgeous deep
vampy kind of berry color but it feels
so nourishing on the lips it's not
giving you tons of shine just a teeny
bit of shine on there but I like that
it's not too much because I feel like
it's in control you know I feel like
it's not about to slip off my lips it's
just a beautiful color I love it so much
Tyler's bunched up here I'm told by
beauty lipstick contains antioxidants
found in wine well folks I'm inspired
instead of bite Beauty I'm creating a
product called drink beauty and even
faster more effective way of getting all
the antioxidants in wine Emily and for
favorite berry lip gloss I went the
slightly purple route a little bit of
you know radiant orchid that is the
Pantone color of the year and I've
gotten a lot of compliments on this
gloss I really like the way it feels I
love the color and it's the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss in fuchsia Feiner
it's also a little bit a gel-like on the
lips but it still gives off a nice
amount of color you want to try that
pretty orchid lip trim that everybody's
doing on that this would be a good way
to do it because this color is gonna
show up just a little more sheer than
what you see here in this tube but still
really really beautiful favorite red
lipstick this is big you guys a certain
product has been on a four year reign in
this category and it's the NYC ultra
moist lip we're in sheer red I really
like that lipstick but this year it has
been knocked off by something that I
think is just my ultimate red lipstick
and it's the NYX matte lipstick in
Alabama this is my kind of red I love
how it is a hair deeper than many of you
hair steeper actually then like a total
bright cherry red but I think that makes
it so wearable it really stays in place
it's absolutely full color and
these NYX matte lipsticks that you try
you're gonna be like wow you know that's
color intensity I think part of it is
that there's no shine bouncing off of it
so it just seems even more intense
favorite red gloss it's very pretty it's
from it cosmetics and it's the vitality
butter gloss in ruby slippers I love a
red lip gloss that incorporates a little
bit of sparkle I mean we're talking a
little different look right from that
totally matte lip but this is something
that's going to absolutely glisten on
your lips it's got a very very fine
shimmer but it's just a beautiful red
shade you cannot go wrong with that
super comfortable on the lips almost a
little bit hydrating even after this
wears off you don't feel dry on your
lips which is pretty impressive at
neutral lipstick no question it's Sonia
Kashuk shine luxe sheer in sheer pink
lust this this whole type of lipstick
was actually a real frontrunner for
favorite drugstore lipstick but they
didn't have quite the shade selection
that Milani does or like variety and
finishes but as a whole I do really
really love this kind of lip product
these are like a hybrid lipstick lip
gloss when you put these on you're gonna
be fascinated by the amount of shine
they have and this nude is perfect they
almost remind me and finish at the Too
Faced la creme lipsticks which I really
really like but maybe even more shine
than those then my favorite neutral lip
gloss is from Rimmel it's the state
glossy lip gloss which is a fantastic
formula really comfortable on the lips
and this shade is endless summer I think
this is a great everywoman lip color you
know it's light it's a little bit peachy
if you look really close it's got a
little bit of a golden e shimmer but it
could really be nice for just everyday
wear it again is very comfortable you're
gonna see this color on your lips it's
not sheer and it brightens up the face
without being a bold color if that's not
what you want thank you so much for
watching my Emily awards for lips
definitely one of my most beloved
categories I enjoy doing these videos so
much for you and thank you so much for
taking time to watch so there's a lip
gloss that's named stay glossy thanks
for stealing my thunder
rimmel we'll see you soon with a special
Emily Awards finale
until then I'm Tyler's punched in and
you stay glossy beauty broadcasters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
