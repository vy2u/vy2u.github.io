figured out the best things to keep the
eyes looking fierce even better but
highly trained statisticians leading you
through the top ten very best eye
products of the year and can't read
welcome to the 2015 Emily awards for
eyes hi everyone welcome back thanks for
joining me for part two of the Emily
awards part one with space so if you
missed that I will make sure to link to
it below and I'm doing top tens this
year I really thought this would kind of
challenge me to really look at all of my
Emily awards favorites and say what are
the complete and total must-haves and so
within this top ten they are all ranked
so we'll work our way up to a number one
eye product in this video I'm so excited
about those have honestly been a
challenge for me to put together because
on my blog I've still sorted out all of
my high-end and drugstore favorites for
every single category like I've done
every year and now go look at those
things and say how do they truly stack
up just drugstore high-end putting them
all together what's the best eye top ten
as I look at my list here you know I do
have some high-end items working their
way in but this is a pretty drugstore
heavy list here so that's kind of
exciting too
again if you want to see everything I
mention links to it links to other
reviews that I've done that give you
more info on the different things that
I'm talking about head over to beauty
broadcast net that's where it's all
clearly laid out for you but meanwhile
let's jump into this top ten number ten
is an eye primer that I've really been
loving and it was actually kind of a co
favorite with my Milani eyeshadow primer
which I really think is just one of the
best primers best value performs so much
like other high-end ones I've tried but
in the past year something else has kind
of jumped in that's been a really
interesting eye primer type product but
it's just so quick and easy to use and
it's from NYC and it's called the city
proof 24-hour eye primer or eye base
this is the base shade they actually
have some colored ones but this is
essentially colorless it does neutralize
the lids a little bit when you put it on
but I love how quick and easy it is it's
just a stick you just pop it on there
and I feel like
shadows really adhere to this and I've
had great staying power with it that
seems like every year for as much
planning as I do for the Emily Awards
something swoops in at the tail end like
something just comes in and says I'm
being a part of this and I will fall in
love with it and I will have no choice
but to include it in the Emily Awards
and I am talking about my hooda lashes
these are from who to beauty I actually
got these as a Christmas present
Samantha number seven style which I am
wearing today I just love the way these
look it's just undeniable like I was
thinking about so many other lash styles
that I have worn a lot of throughout the
year and I have loved but these just the
thickness how fluttery they are just the
gorgeous way that they frame the eye the
lash band is really durable yet it's
very flexible too and I've worn these
probably half a dozen times already and
I can already tell
they are so nicely forming just to the
natural curve of my eye I love that and
really when I first got these and looked
at and I thought okay these are gonna be
more dramatic than I thought you know
I've seen them on other people I've seen
him a lot on Instagram and stuff but
these look like more of a heavy lash and
I was looking for but then I got them on
my eyes and I'm like no they're really
good I just love these I think they are
gonna be my special occasion lash
they're gonna be the Blache I wear for
photos or just anything that's a big
deal and I said in the hall where I got
these that I hadn't trimmed them yet but
I did decide to actually go ahead and do
that I just turned a little bit off the
outermost part and now I feel like they
really perfectly fit my eyes so I love
those number eight my first pallet is
making it into the top ten and this is a
really basic pallet it could be a nice
companion to a lot of different things
but for me actually I have been so
satisfied with the looks that I've
gotten just using this on its own it's
just a great quality pallet I love the
way these shadows blend I love the way
they go on it's my Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette so neutral to the max
definitely some warm shades and cool
shades they're just so smooth so nice
quality your light shades are going to
be as rich and pigmented
deepest darkest shades and that's what
allows one color to kind of blend on top
of the next and just give you really
flawless looks if you like using powder
shadows as eyeliner you definitely have
some deep and dark enough shades to do
that for you awesome basic crease colors
I love this peach I of course love this
kind of rusty brownish red down here
it's a beautiful palette it's a very
unpractical palette I would say just in
terms of being able to be used fully on
its own for a 100% matte look or pulling
in some of your most shimmery pigments
and bright colorful shades so I have
been so super pleased with this palette
I remember seeing a lot of hype about it
and I held off I held off I finally got
it and I was like yes I love it number
seven coming in with a drugstore brow
product this is from Maybelline it used
to say before it wore off it said brow
satin on here okay then the packaging
said define and fill and then I went
online and for a while it said brows
satin now it's changed back to define
and fill so we're gonna call this the
Maybelline define and fill duo whatever
aside from the naming Fiasco I think
this is a great product you've got
basically two and one you've got an
awesome little retractable pencil here
that you can use to fill in your brows
and then to create I don't know even
more softness or you could use one or
the other layer them both for more
staying power if you want to you've got
this little spring-loaded applicator
here on the other side that is dipping
into powder and I just love topping my
lick with this I feel like the pencil
gives me the precision you know it gets
in those little places where okay I've
got a bare spot here I've got something
that looks a little different on my
right side from my left so I'm gonna use
the pencil to make sure that gets filled
in and then you've got this softness of
the powder that just kind of goes over
everything and really makes them look
nice and even so I have found this to be
a quick product to use an easy product
to use the one thing this does not do is
really hold the brows in place you want
to come in with a different like brow
gel on top to do something about that
I'll insert the name of the color I have
because it's really been dead on for me
and it's just been a really convenient
product number six I actually have a tie
there are two products I just couldn't
decide which to include in the top ten
in this video but when it gets right
down to it I think they're both equally
important so the first one I'll mention
is my Melania Supreme Kohl Kajal
eyeliner comes in one shade called
blackest black this is a retractable
pencil and it's really just everything
that I need from a product like this I
love using it especially in the inner
rim on lower or upper I feel like it's
rich in black it has good staying power
for me it's also just super creamy if
you want to put it on your natural you
know skin of your upper lash line let's
say it goes on very easily there it's a
pencil that will set for you it will not
move it's crazy affordable also I kind
of love that packaging is gold because I
throw this in with my other black
eyeliner supers look really easy to grab
I know this is the one I want to use now
the other thing that tied with this is
kind of like the lighter counterpart to
the lower inner rim shade and it's my
Milani shadow eyes I really like the
whole line of these there's a gorgeous
green that I've used for a lot of
different green eye looks that I've done
actually over the years and they just
got various shades and they're a long
wearing shadow stick so they're just
extremely creamy they go on they do set
you have some time to work with them and
smudge them out but trust me they will
set for you and I just loved using the
almond cream shade in my lower inner rim
for brightness so what I'm not going for
like a deep dark and dramatic look like
I'm wearing today I can just swoop that
in there my eyes look less tired they
look more brightened more wide-awake and
I just love having that number 5 this is
actually my winner in my overall list
for best drugstore eyeshadow formula and
wet-and-wild has had that category on
lock for like 5 years or something I
mean I really do love the quality of the
wet and wild color icon palettes I think
for me what's kind of been lacking in
the past year is they bring in all these
limited edition shades that are out for
a couple weeks and they're sold out and
gone and I want more like great quality
additions to their regular lines so this
year I feel like I was noticing another
brand really stepping it up in terms of
drugstore shadows putting out great
palettes some great singles as well but
the things I really want to highlight
for this
number five spot in my top ten are the
Knicks Avant pop palates I don't know if
you remember the video where I mentioned
these I swatch them all out they are
very impressive
they are highly highly pigmented shadows
I have three of them I pulled a couple
of them out to show you you've got art
throb here for those of you who love
your really intense shades I mean
there's a lime green in here there's a
really bright electric blue and they are
what you see is what you get type colors
truly I mean they're gonna look like
that on the eyes and then I really love
this palette called Nouveau chic I love
these neutrals I love peach and plum
together I mean this is like a drugstore
take on my bare minerals happy place
quad but with lots of other things to
work with as well so I've just been
really impressed as a whole with Nyx's
eyeshadows and I think these palettes
are just a couple of examples of how the
quality has become I think really
consistent with many of the things that
they put out and definitely got some
larger like really large palettes to
tell you about on once the Emily awards
are wrapped up and I have a little more
time to dig into those number four I've
got another tie it's a drugstore
eyeliner tie and I mean guys this is
kind of thing I sleep on it I go to bed
thinking which am I gonna pick and I
wake up still thinking I don't know it's
got to be it sighs so Jordana color Envy
in black Envy my Holy Grail black liquid
eyeliner it's so basic I mean you look
at it it's no frills the label has worn
off on me I mean it's there's nothing to
see here really it's just a black liner
with a small brush tip but it goes on so
easily the staying power is incredible
it looks so black when you put it on
first off but then it locks in for the
day does not fade just it's a reliable
Old Faithful eyeliner I love that then I
think in the last half of the year I had
stumbled across the Kat Von D tattoo
liner and I really loved it I thought it
was an innovative design it went on just
so so easily and I remembered I think
Physicians Formula has something like
that that's a pen style but a brush tip
pen and so I've started using this and I
and I'm in love with it really
goes on like an absolute dream and it's
called the ID booster it actually says
it's a two and one lash boosting
eyeliner plus serum in here and I'm not
convinced that it's making my lashes any
better I mean maybe it is it's just it's
hard to tell but what I really love
about it is the tip it's a teeny tiny
brush tip that comes to a perfect point
it applies so much like the Kat Von D
tattoo liner so I feel like I've got a
really great fine here coming up with
something similar to that from the
drugstore and I mean if you've struggled
with applying liquid liners feeling like
you can't get nice even lines or you
want just a really nice fine line I
would say this gives me a more fine line
than this one from Jordana all right top
three folks who got three amazing
products took a lot of thought kind of
jumbling these around wondering what am
I going to settle on for a real top
three number three is a very impressive
i shadow formula it ain't cheap but it's
really really good if you want to go
there I mean I can't say anything bad
about these shadows and they are from
visi art and my top pick that I've tried
so far from this line is the sultry
music Alice I have a lot more
information in a recent video that I did
where I was really weighing whether or
not these pallets were worthwhile and
the more I use this thing the more I
love it these are gorgeous shades that
have anywhere from a satin to a really
shimmery and metallic finish they're so
so beautiful in my look today the one
I've been wearing throughout the video
the star of the show is kind of this
rosy color here so I did some matte
shades and then I pop that right on the
lid I also used it a little bit on the
lower lash line it's just gorgeous
it's just one of the many things you can
do with this palette one thing that
really impressed me was that I can use
this palette and this palette alone to
get some beautiful looks I know anybody
who thinks oh well it's all shimmer well
it's not really because it's varying
levels and the deeper shades which would
be this color this color and this color
can anchor any of these other shades
beautifully and they don't look too
shimmery on the eyes to do that so I
love this palette I mean we're talking
next level buttery pigmented to see
them all swatched out it's like is that
liquid that I'm looking at because it is
so smooth and shiny and beautiful now
number two
this was the pallet that was kind of
neck-and-neck with that one as I was
sitting here thinking what is my number
two product gonna be I would say the
reason why this one that I'm gonna
mention edged out the Vice art is simply
variety um
fun not that the buys aren't busy art
however you want to say that pallet
isn't fun for me to use because I get
much enjoyment out of that one but when
you've got this many shades to play with
I mean this is awesome this is the lorac
mega pro 2 I enjoy this above the first
one that they put out I know there may
be some debate on that but these are the
Emily awards so I get to pick and I love
how you've got two rows of matte two
rows of shimmer there is so much you can
do with this palette there's so many
differing like directions you can go in
I love melon and tangerine okay I love
these purple shades they're like true
Purple's the shimmery shades at a glance
you might think okay a lot of neutral
shimmers but there's some really
interesting things happening this
olivine is like a taupe with the hint of
mint green it's super unique this blue
quartz shade here is absolutely dynamite
today actually to kind of surround that
pop of shimmer I've got on my lid I used
a lot of goji and Cabernet so I used
goji in my crease just to really give it
that beautiful soft berry look I have
Cabernet in my outer corner I also
smudged a lot of that on the lower lash
line as well and yeah I guess it
shouldn't really be a surprise that some
form of shadow from lorac is appearing
in this video because for years the
lorac Pro palette just the original one
that's in black that's just two rows one
matte one shimmer I still love that
palette for basics but this is stolen my
heart for variety you may notice a
tendency to have a little more fallout
than some of the Vice art shades I've
talked about but you know if you dip in
tap off the excess it's really no
problem oh yeah did I mention there's a
forest green in here because there is I
just couldn't be more pleased with this
palette I love it
number one the number one product okay
what has not been mentioned yet in this
video a mascara and this mascara has
been a game-changer for me this year I
am one who has lashes that point down
they're not super thick they're not
super long so when I can find something
that makes my lashes stay up lengthen
out thicken up it's like Hello
new best friend and this is the
covergirl super sizer those of you who
really watch my videos probably aren't
shocked by this a lot of its the formula
I think a lot of its the design of the
brush for me as well because this brush
is not completely surrounded the wand is
not completely surrounded with bristles
you've got a couple of places on this
brush that are totally bare and it does
hold a little bit of product it's not
like cooped up with product but the
thought is that you can get one of those
flat sides on your lashes and then kind
of extend on through with the other
sides that have bristles on it and then
you've got great length it builds on
itself nicely but I'm going to be honest
I don't have to apply a lot of coats
with this one coat is really enough I
new talking about a mascara at number
one because we all have different lashes
there would be people who would be like
oh no I tried that I hated it I hated it
you know I can't please everybody with
every product pic that I have but for me
for the impact this is made on my makeup
life not to be too dramatic here but
this is really an amazing find for me
personally and I have heard from a lot
of people who have lashes like mine who
have also really loved it so now let's
just keep our fingers crossed that this
doesn't get discontinued any time soon
okay there you go everyone that's the
top ten eye products of the year for
2015 next video will be all about lips I
love doing lip videos so expect a lot of
lip swatches a lot of try ons with that
and thank you so much for watching I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
