top ten list for just about everything
of course David Letterman had his ESPN
counts down the top 10 plays there's
even a book of the all-time stupidest
top 10 list and during a year one i've
tried more products than ever
why not narrow it all down to what's
really the best in a first ever Emily
Awards top 10 I've got the products the
staff here at beauty broadcast
headquarters has been working hard on
the numbers so let's get to it first
from foundation to setting spray the top
10 face products of 2015 hi everybody
welcome to the Emily Awards for 2015 I
can't believe this is the eighth year
that I've been doing this I am Emily
these are my awards I really love
sharing the top makeup products over the
past year with you and for me lots and
lots of thought goes into these videos
and you deserve it as my viewers as
people who tuned into me day after day
to watch I want to make sure I am giving
you the best information I can I don't
take this stuff lightly I hear from so
many of you that you not only look
forward to the awards but you base a lot
of your purchases off of them and there
was something somebody said to me last
year and I always look for feedback
toward the end of the awards you know
how can I improve them for the following
year is there anything I can do
differently and someone was saying you
know they've grown so much it's almost a
little overwhelming you know all of the
information that you get per video just
so many categories so many favorites and
they were basically asking me what would
my best-of-the-best be you know for face
products or for eyes or lips just
considering everything and that's kind
of been in the back of my mind in my
slow cooker as my mom would say over the
course of the past year and I was
thinking you know will I change up the
awards will I do it somewhat differently
and many of you said you still want
multiple videos so I'm definitely doing
that again this year but I almost wanted
to pinpoint the favorites even more
definitively I'm going to still give you
on my blog that's beauty broadcast net a
favorite high-end in a favorite
drugstore for every single category that
I've always had and
I've added to over the years for my
videos I want to really break it down to
a top ten so considering everything
whether it's drugstore or high-end it's
all being considered what would be my
top ten face products what would be my
top ten eye products lip products so
it's my hope that that makes this extra
helpful it makes it extra clear what the
most impactful products were that I've
used over the year and I don't know why
I did this to myself because this is
really hard but within the top ten I've
challenged myself to make it not
something that's in no particular order
but something that gets better with each
number so we actually work up to a
number one like top product in this case
for face and let me preface this top ten
by saying I feel like for face it has
been the year of the face related
palette maybe it's a bronzer palette a
contour palette a blush palette this or
that so many things in palette form and
simply within this top ten I have three
different face palettes that made it in
so that's kind of interesting but number
ten is actually a face mist this would
be my favorite face mist that I have
used over the year and I've really tried
a lot of them so many brands have come
out with something like this and my
favorite one is really my glossy a
soothing face mist this is a rose water
spray I think it's so refreshing I think
the rosy scent is so super accurate it's
just very uplifting something about it
really lifts your spirits when you just
spritz it on throughout the day so it's
nice in that respect but I also love it
immediately after my makeup application
because it takes away the appearance of
powder it makes everything look much
more skin like and I just love that I
also love just the quality of the mist
as well so many myths will kind of
splatter too much on your face at one
time or you can see little droplets this
has always been a very fine mist and
absolutely dead-on wonderful rosy scent
so I love this stuff number nine it's a
powder and this has appeared in the
Emily awards for many years and this is
my L'Oreal True Match pressed powder and
there are a couple key reasons why it
made it into the top ten number one just
the texture of the powder it feels very
rich it feels almost a little bit creamy
when you touch it not that kind of dry
chalky texture that you might notice
with a lot of drugstore powders and
number two it's so versatile I feel like
this works great as an on the
touch up tight powder but at the same
time you could apply it with maybe a
flat top kabuki style brush and get
absolutely powder foundation type
coverage out of it I really adore
products like this that I feel like I
can recommend and to different people
could try it with two different
motivations for using it and they could
still have great success with the way it
goes on also there's a massive shade
range in The True Match line so that's
always great it's going to have a matte
finish on the skin but it's not going to
look overly dry cakey like I said this
isn't like a chalky cheap powder it
really is nice quality number eight and
this appeared in my Emily awards last
year it's my it cosmetics your skin but
better CC plus it has an SPF of 50 and I
think this is really just the creme de
la creme of CC BB cream type products I
love that it actually has coverage it's
the kind of thing I was just applying it
the other day and thinking you know I
can slide this on so easily with my
fingers it does not take a lot of work
to blend it out my skin looks really
fresh and nice when I've got it on it
actually does kind of smooth over some
discoloration that I have in my skin
it's really to me one of the very few CC
cream type products that is a true
two-in-one most of the time unless I'm
extra extra dry I don't feel like I need
to apply an extra moisturizer with this
so I'm really getting the benefits of
hydration plus coverage fabulous sun
protection in there I've also enjoyed
the illumination version that has come
out and the bronzer for different
purposes but this one still all around I
think is my top dog for the CC creams
number seven the first face related
palette is making it into the mix and
this is from Laura Geller and it's the
baked color and contour palette this is
such a fabulous product it combines
three really amazing things from laura
geller half of your pan is the baked
bronze and brighten which is an awesome
bronzer it just really warms up the skin
gives you a great look of health I just
absolutely love that product and then I
cannot say enough about the french
vanilla highlight this is an ideal
highlight for people who want theirs
to have a little bit of a glow the
french vanilla highlight packs in the
teeniest bit of coverage it's just like
the perfect product for I think skin of
all ages people of all ages it's a
really great thing and then there's a
blush in here as well which actually
turns out to be the most glowy thing in
the palette I'd say it's a beautifully
pigmented warm pink and so everything in
here I mean this makes the ideal travel
face palette or getting three products
and one each of them extremely effective
in their own way so that's awesome
number six a drugstore Holy Grail
product that has been in my Emily awards
many times before and it is my Rimmel
lasting finish foundation this has been
repackaged over the years used to be in
a squeezy tube now it is in this glass
bottle that was not a welcome change for
me but still I'm happy to see that the
product on the inside seems to be the
same and something I know and love and a
rare foundation that I feel can work for
so many different skin types so many
ages I've said this before but my mom
who was in her 60s when she wants you
know more of a fuller coverage look on
the skin something a little bit more
than just a tinted moisturizer this is
what she likes to use I have loved this
on my skin I feel like it doesn't over
dry it doesn't look unnatural on the
skin it blends in super easily but it
gives me really great coverage and in a
drugstore marketplace where I feel like
the prices of foundations are creeping
up and up and up this one is like a
really fair less than $10 price tag so I
absolutely love it Thank You Rimmel this
is a great product number 5 another
palette and this would be specifically
geared toward people who want blush and
highlight and want highlights that
really really glow ever since I got this
palette I have just been so impressed
and I find more and more ways to use it
and it's my Becca afterglow palette guys
this is packed with products and Becca's
regular line this is not just full of
limited edition things that you'll fall
in love with and never be able to find
again it's a great kind of like try me
palette and while the sizes aren't huge
it doesn't take a lot of any of these to
get the desired effect you know on the
skin so for example today I've got on
this blush this is a blush called flower
child there are two blushes in this
palette so you've got one that's more
neutral one more pin
and then you've got these three
highlights to play with so I like to use
either topaz or rose gold as sort of a
blush topper so directly on top of where
I put my blush I use the rose gold today
and that's giving me a really nice glow
and then I can use the gorgeous
moonstone which is really bright really
packs a gorgeous highlighting punch I
just like to pinpoint that like maybe
just right in here or just under the
brow or on the Cupid's bow these are
very intense highlights I really love
the liquefied versions of the shimmering
skin perfectors from becca as well but I
think what took this one over the edge
for me this year was just how much I
loved how these particular blushes can
work in harmony with these highlights
and just give a really pretty look to
the face number four I would say it's
been the year of the dark circle for me
I mean I have had more darkness to
conceal this year I think than ever
before so I've got to give it up to the
product that has no matter what been
able to handle that discoloration this
is one in multiple Emily awards in the
past and it is my Benefit erased paste
in the shade medium mentioned recently
how the shade medium I think is really
key because it is so pigmented and so
peachy so it's extremely corrective it
can handle any amount of darkness on the
under eyes this is also a really great
coverage product on any sort of age
spots you might have on your skin on
pinpointed darkness this tackles it
really nicely in tone it's very similar
to the Bobbi Brown corrector in bisque
if you enjoy Bobby Brown products that's
gonna give you a similar effect to this
what tends to make this come out on top
for me is that I think it's a better
value you get more product here also I
find this to be the most like kind of
moisturizing corrective concealer on the
under eye area I'm getting more and more
dry in that area as I get older so I
just love how this gives coverage
without making that area look really
creepy number three we're getting into
the top three I feel like I need like
the lights to come down like hot
American eyes but look at something and
things are getting really serious now
that my number three product is a loose
powder this has been recently one of my
probably my most tested product this
comes at a very high price but it does
something very special and I think very
important to me in my make
routine and it is the by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder i have continued
looking for dupes for this and i'm not
gonna stop looking for tips for this
product because this is like a sixty
dollar powder and it is I think the most
wonderful thing for setting that
under-eye concealer the thing about this
benefit erase space is that it does
leave a somewhat tacky finish and I am
one who really likes to eliminate that I
don't want to look dry I don't want to
feel that tackiness and feel like my
products you know lifting away or not
having good staying power so what can I
use to lock in the concealer this really
is the key for me this is a super ultra
lightweight the most lightweight powder
I've ever used so I actually like
applying it either with a Beauty Blender
sponge or a flat foundation brush stay
away from anything too fluffy or it's
going to get super airborne and maybe
not actually go where you want it to go
on your face this is one of the only
powders that I honestly think looks
better later in the day like as I
continue to wear this powder on my skin
on my under eye area as the day goes on
I see fewer fine lines another key area
that it works great in is around you
know the areas where you see a lot of
pores so your nose the sides of the nose
I'm learning that just not any powder is
going to do on the under eye area
because so many look worse as the day
goes on they might look at their best
when they're freshly applied but then as
you have facial expressions and contort
your face around in any number of ways
they start to show up more so this is
serving the function I need which is to
take away tacky texture from the skin
give the area a more perfected look
because it's mattified but not look dry
my number two product incredibly low
cost but incredibly effective and to me
I see this as a dupe of something that
was prominent in my Emily awards last
year and it is my ELF contour palette if
you haven't tried this out this is
really a contouring palette that covers
all of its faces you've got a couple of
light tone shades here but then you've
got your cool toned matte contour shade
and then a little bit warmer lighter
shade that makes a great bronzer these
powders do pop out so if you have an elf
blush palette mate there's one of these
shade
you don't use as much you could pop in a
blush shade really customize it to the
way you want it and I've honestly
enjoyed elfs cream contour palette as
well but in terms of something where I
feel like I'm genuinely getting use out
of every part of this this is great and
it performs and swatches so much like my
Smashbox contour kit which pretty much
has like these three shades in it so
it's really an incredible value if
you've had apprehensions about the
quality of elf products these are nice
smooth wonderfully pigmented powders I
think you'll be very impressed my number
one pick for face products this year and
I mentioned liking products that can
perform differently for different people
I love a good multitasking product that
can be used in a variety of ways this
year my top favorite is the cover FX
custom cover drops I believe this is the
only cover FX product I have used I am
hugely impressed with this I have used
this so much maybe just a drop or two I
love how a little bit goes a long way
you can add it to any face product you
might want to put on so we're talking a
moisturizer you could add coverage and
make your favorite moisturizer a tinted
moisturizer you could add anywhere from
like 1 to let's say 4 drops that's kind
of how they outline it to add light
coverage to fullest coverage to any
product maybe you've got foundation
where you just thought gosh I'd love
this if it just had a little more
coverage add a couple drops of this the
shape range is massive I've got this in
in 35 you're just gonna use a little
dropper and I like to just mix it with
my fingers really with whatever I'm
going to use guys I have used this
alongside countless foundation formulas
high-end drugstore there has not been a
single one that I felt like oh it's not
blending well into that or it's creating
some sort of issue with the consistency
just like it swoops in once you've mixed
it all together you wouldn't even know
anything additional have been added but
then you put it on your skin you're like
thank you there's the amazing coverage I
have a high standard for coverage I have
dealt with melasma that's really
pronounced discoloration on the top of
my cheeks when people say something is
full coverage a lot of times it's not
like to me you know full coverage means
absolutely the ability to cover
everything and I can say with certainty
this can get you there I would say this
year what's putting this over the top of
my estee lauder
maximum cover foundation is just the
versatility with this you know just the
thought that okay I can take a couple
drops of this I can mix it here and
there not that can't mix the Estee
Lauder with other things but I feel like
the drops of this are thinner but yet
very very potent so I really think this
is one of those worth the money products
one of those where you get it into your
collection you're going to find yourself
using it in many different ways at least
I do myself I love this so so much so
