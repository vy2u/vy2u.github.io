foundation the blush the eyes and the
lips
nothing says flammer like a great
lipstick and we're all about sharing
here sharing the top 10 best lip
products of the year in part three of
the Emily awards for 2015 hi everyone
its Emily Awards for lips time and you
talk about some hard decisions with this
video I mean I was just running into so
many little mental obstacles as I was
trying to rank my favorite lip products
into an actual top ten that led to an
ultimate favorite this whole top ten is
so full of amazing things I don't know
what it is about lip products though
it's almost like when I was a kid and I
thought my stuffed animals all had
feelings you know cuz they do it's like
I feel like these lip products that
feelings I'm crazy I know but if you're
just now tuning in to the Emily awards
for this year I've already done my
favorites for face and eyes so you can
check those out I have still sorted out
my drugstore and high-end category by
category winners for you and that's what
I usually do in the Emily Awards every
year but this year I really wanted to
switch it up not only to make it a more
exciting more enjoyable experience for
the viewers but to also make it
something that time wise I could more
feasibly get done so in my top ten for
this video I will rank you know my lip
balms and lipsticks and glosses and all
those kinds of products but something I
also do every year in the lip category
is give shade favorites so a favorite
pink lipstick and lip gloss berry red
neutral so I will do all of those at the
end of this video I'm just kind of going
through them rapid-fire and I didn't
want to just leave that to the blog
because that's a very visual thing
talking about colors and shades and I
wanted you to see them all on my lips so
starting off my number 10 pick is going
to the NYX intense butter glosses so
they came out with the butter glosses
first that was years back and now they
have created a formula that goes on even
more opaque I think it covers the lips
more like evenly less streaky and I
absolutely love the applicator with
these as well it's kind of like
a little flat paddle type design and it
really lets you get that product right
out to the edge of your lips without
overloading the lips there are tons of
beautiful shades with crazy shine
they're really comfortable and they
smell so good
oh it's definitely like vanilla frosting
from a can and that's good to me I love
that stuff a couple of shades that I've
been holding here um chocolate crepe
that's a great neutral it's not too
brownish it but it's like a deep sort of
rosy brown and then black cherry tart I
remember when I was wearing this on
Instagram people were like ooh what is
that you know it's just a really dark
shiny vampy lip color you're gonna have
to keep a close eye on this when you're
wearing it you know make sure it doesn't
get messy outside the lip line I would
say that about most nearly black glosses
but I think this is really gorgeous
number nine is going to a super
comfortable product that I am
classifying this year as like a tinted
lip balm and it's the almay butter kiss
I don't think they're called smart shade
butter kiss lipsticks not only do I love
these for the colors but I love them for
the feel as well and to compare them to
a Revlon lip butter I feel like there's
a slight bit more thickness there's
something about these that feel just a
little bit more bomb like but yet I
still feel like I'm getting all the
color I like from a lipstick I do like a
lot of the lighter shades from this line
for whatever reason maybe it's just that
I know when I reach for one of these I'm
going for a no fuss type product and the
way the shade system is set up they have
them classified by a like light light
medium medium so it kind of gives you a
clue as to what might suit your skin
tone but I really go all over the board
with these I do not care what the
classification is over the past year
I've really loved berry light as sort of
a pinky light fresh shade also nude
light is a gorgeous soft peachy color
and the berry medium shade if you like
soft reddish berry colors number eight
is going to another lip gloss and these
are the makeup forever artist flexi
glosses quite a few months back they
graciously sent me like the entire
collection the whole lineup to check out
and try and I've really been gradually
just picking up different shades here
and there and experimenting with that
whole line and something that's really
special about this first off a gloss
formula
that's not going to be too slippery I
would say these are a slight bit thicker
than the intense butter glosses from NYX
and I'm not saying they're thicker in an
uncomfortable way but they have a little
bit better cling to the lips so that's
probably why these are ranking a little
bit ahead of the NYX one's super shiny
as you would hope I've tried so many
shades and I can't say that they are all
completely opaque it really does vary
there's some more sheer shades in the
line there are some that have a little
bit of sparkle or shimmer there's some
that are just straight-up creamy and the
intensity really does vary but I do want
to spotlight a couple of my favorites
one is 402 P and this is a really pretty
kind of like warm red with a little bit
of a golden sparkle very very fine
shimmer and then just any time of year
classic color 204 when I talk about
colors being rosy I think this would be
the epitome of that it's like soft red
you may hear this working its way into
the shade favorites and just a little
bit and I do feel like this goes on
really opaque but the other thing that
makes these so awesome is the super
unique applicator happening here again
with the flat design it lets you work
right out to the very edge of your lips
and not get a streaky application that's
sometimes the fault of Bill foot
applicator just they're a little too
small sometimes all the product that
they carry gets slapped on your lips at
once and the pressure you apply creates
a bit of a streak this the flatness I
mean you think about how you would frost
a cake you know with a spatula that's a
little bit wide and flat and this is
that kind of idea okay that's the second
time a cake or frosting reference that's
happened in this video number seven the
first liquid lipstick appearing in this
video one of two that I'll be talking
about in my top 10 so this would be the
drugstore pick for my favorite and I'm
talking about the Milani amore matte lip
creams I have two shades in these I
fully intend to get more if I can get my
hands on them I have embrace which is
this gorgeous deep berry and also
romance which is a slightly deeper take
on red a little bit more toward brick
read the phrase liquid lipstick gets
thrown around all the time this is a
consistency that I would actually
classify as a liquid lipstick it's
really
but incredibly pigmented and I think
something I look for in the liquid lip
colors is something that's not gonna go
on your lips too terribly thick because
if it's one like this that has that
little bit of dry down if it's really
thick on your lips that's when you have
that feeling like I can't stretch my
lips out or it's gonna crack or do
something funny so this maintains all
the flexibility you would want on your
lips but it does have really great
staying power I would say I can't
experience a little transfer off from
these I don't know if it's the depth of
the shades or just the fact that these
maintain a hint of moisture on your lips
but they feel so light another thing
about these if you really like matte
these truly do get matte for you coming
in at number six are colour-pop lippie
stix these have been such a new fine for
me over the past year and I gotta admit
I love these things I think they have a
massive shade range it's so fun to
experiment with different colors I love
how they'll release different
collections and incorporate so many
different colors and finishes and going
back to my like early early makeup using
days I remembered loving a slim format
for a lip product you know something
that's going to give you that little bit
more control than just a standard
lipstick does and so I love that about
these and there are several different
finishes that these come in as a whole
I've loved the sheers certain ones like
Tiger that's what I'm holding here it's
like a sheer deep berry I also love
kidoh which is a nice kind of like rosy
neutral and another one that came out I
think in the fall collection but I
believe it's still available is the
shade poison now this is a matte and I
really like the mattes and these have
kind of edged their way a little bit
over their matte liquid lipsticks for me
just because if these do start to wear
off a little bit I feel like there's
much more ease in reapplication with the
lippie stix that they do really lasts a
long time in a small detail but I really
appreciate how the colors of the shades
are actually on the bottom so if you
store them upright you know you'd be
able to see that at a glance so that's
helpful number five right in the middle
of the countdown a workhorse product
that gets used more times than I would
ever be able to mention to you and it's
lip balms Nivea lip balms are where it's
at for dry cracked lips if I'm sitting
down here to my makeup area and I'm just
starting to do my makeup I'm getting my
moisturizer on and I'm realizing that my
lips are SuperDuper dry at that point in
time right when I start my makeup I will
grab for one of these and the kiss of
olive oil and lemon is the one that I
have handy most of the time but I also
have down in my drawer the kiss of
smoothness the kiss of milk and honey
they're all really softening there's a
nice thickness to these products that
really makes you feel like there's some
sort of treatment happening there for
your lips they don't leave a whole lot
of shine maybe just the tiniest hint of
shine but they're great to be worn under
like a lip liner if you like to do your
full lips with lip liner but you feel
like they're a little dry to apply them
all over that way
this helps a lot of lip liners glide on
more easily number four this would be my
top liquid lipstick pick in the
countdown and it's the Estee Lauder
liquid lip potions oh yeah that's what
I'm wearing as I've been wearing here
throughout the video is this shade
called true liar absolutely adore this
color anytime I've got this on questions
abound it's just a really fantastic
purpley berry shade it's just the
perfect amount of purple in it for me
what's really probably most special
about these oh the other shade I'm
holding here by the way is called
fragile ego that's more of a reddish
berry but I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say these are the most
comfortable liquid lipsticks on the
market you are going to sacrifice a
little something with the whole
transferring off type thing some people
have a standard with liquid lipsticks
that they're not gonna go anywhere and
if you want something like that I mean
the colour-pop liquid lipsticks with the
doe foot applicator
those will completely untold Elise set
with this formula I mean you can get
some product off of there but I continue
to have so much color on my lips now if
you wanted like the freshest application
you could feel like you could go over
these again and not have like a crazy
thick uncomfortable feel on your lips so
I love that but seriously they feel so
good like my lips feel hydrated to wear
these but they're thin and completely
opaque and again with the stepped-up
applique
a little bit flattened out a little bit
wider than a standard doe foot and it
holds some product in there it comes to
a very gentle point I mean look at the
precision on the edge of my lip line and
there is no lip liner involved here I
mean I'm just able to use this and go
right out to the edge number three a
product very familiar to my Emily Awards
viewers is back in the mix this year and
it's my Neutrogena moisture smooth color
sticks the best jumbo lip pencils you
will find these are fantastic for dry
lips if you know you're going out on a
super cold crazy day but you still want
color on your lips use one of these your
lips will feel great comfort all the way
with these lip products and what really
launched these kind of back into my
radar I mean I've always liked these but
more recently they've come out with a
bunch of new shades and they're all
creamy they don't have any sort of
shimmer to them and they're so beautiful
a couple that I've loved the most are
the deep plum shade berry Brown for
those of you who like your little bit
deep neutrals rich raisin has been a
must-have just from way back when it got
some lighter nudes in there they've got
some really saturated like berry Reds
that are gorgeous they kind of make me
think of my Almay butter kiss lipsticks
that I mentioned at number nine only I
think even more treatment Orient number
two is a rockstar lip liner product that
has come into my life recently lip
liners have the potential to be very
versatile products because you know you
can just use it for the definition you
can kind of fade them in for an ombre
effect on top of a lipstick or you can
just use them flat on their own for a
more matte looking lip so I love the
versatility of these I recently blogged
about a huge shade range today are the
NYX
slide-on lip pencils so if you remember
the slide on eyeliners that they put out
that are super long wearing great color
selection very very creamy and easy to
apply they've taken that kind of a
formula and put them into a lip liner
and they really lock in
so the staying power is tremendous with
these even the lighter shades to the
deeper shades there are some really fun
brights in this collection a couple that
I am just sharing with here and nude
suede shoes absolute must-have
and then I also love Dark Soul to be
worn alongside deeper berry colors
you're going to have that fine tip of a
classic lip liner pencil but they are
exceptionally creamy if you're
considering buying these and I'll link
to this on the Emily awards post but
I've recently done a blog where i
swatched them all out I've tried on all
of my favorites and I just really love
these number one has anybody been
wondering where the vite lipsticks is
been hiding I love my bite lipsticks as
we started getting closer closer to
Emily awards time I knew these would be
toward the top you know they're a
must-have lip product in my collection
if somebody came in and swiped all my
bite lipsticks I would be absolutely
crushed they're made with really great
ingredients the luminous cream lipstick
formula I think is one of the best
feeling lipsticks on my mouth they've
got some gorgeous shades I love like fig
and date for the more natural colors
couple of my more dramatic favorites
would be Scarlett which is a really
really dark red I also love mulberry
which is kind of close to the shade I
have on now the way these lipsticks go
on there's a softness there's a richness
to them you're not going to run into
shimmer and frosty finishes they're
creamy they might leave a hint of shine
I almost like a glow to the lips just a
little bit that big feel person with lip
products you know if it's going to feel
annoying on my lips if it's going to
feel too heavy too uncomfortable it's
not gonna be something I want to grab
for very often these just have that
beautiful kind of soft velvety texture
on the lips if you want any of them to
become more matte what I would say to do
is just immediately blot them off and
they'll pretty much get to that place
because like I said these aren't
glittery frosty products to begin with
by beauty lip products have been
multi-year Emily award winners for a
reason you know they continue to stack
up so well even with newer things that
come out I continue to adore these lip
products my words of advice would be
treat yourself to a luminous cream
lipstick and if you ever see a set come
out also these double-ended ones that
they sell I mean unloaded with these and
this is the format that I have with most
of mine and it works for me because I'm
not going through lipstick super fast
and it lets me try a lot of different
shade
now we're gonna go rapid-fire style
through the shade favorites and you're
gonna just see these going on like back
to back to back starting off with best
pink lipstick I'm gonna give this to my
colour-pop lippie stix in last call I
think of this as winter pink I think
I've described it that way before it's a
beautiful shade and then my top pink lip
gloss my la girl glazed lip paint and
blushing these remind me so much of the
OCC lip tars a bit cheaper it's gonna be
a very glossy finish but once the gloss
wears off you'll continue to have a lot
of nice color on your lips for my top
berry lipsticks it's a tie because each
one it's like apples and oranges they're
on opposite ends of the spectrum so a
very intense one which is the one I've
been wearing throughout this video is my
Estee Lauder liquid lip potion and true
liar again it's gonna go on full color
it's gonna feel lightweight but just
talking about color this really hits
that purpley deep berry right on the
head I love it but then I also want to
mention my album a butter kiss and berry
light definitely a more sheer quality
but so so comfortable there is that nice
lightly sweet scent with these I don't
know if I mentioned that earlier
favorite berry lip gloss got to give
this one to my NYX intense butter gloss
in black cherry tart it's dark it's
vampy little tip here if you want to
blot it off a little bit you're gonna
see a little bit more of that reddish
berry start to come through but at the
onset it's gonna be just very intense
and I love that I think it's a gorgeous
color for top red lipstick a two-way tie
one of them being a liquid lipstick and
it's my amore matte lip cream in the
shade romance again a deeper take on red
and this one's beautiful it's very
glamorous can't wait to explore more
shades from this line and then my
Charlotte Tilbury matte revolution
lipstick and bond-girl
a really different kind of red a deep
kind of neutral rosy brownish red I
really love this formula to top red lip
glosses first off my buxom full-on lip
cream in cherry flip I love the kind of
minty tingle that goes along with the
buxom lip products as well and then also
as mentioned before the 204 shade of the
Make Up For Ever artist plexi gloss much
more of a rosy red much more neutral in
this color but I think it's gorgeous and
definitely I had to mention it here
because I think so many people would
love this shade
like wear it to work and feel a little
bit lamb wrist but still very like
professional and not too out there and
favorite neutral lipsticks these two are
seriously like one and the same for me
because when I wear one I'm usually
wearing the other and this is just a
great all-around matte lipstick formula
if you just like traditional matte
lipsticks you know you're not into the
liquid stuff the color sensational matte
line touch of spice and daringly nude
these two are wonderful together I'll
wear like touch of spice all over and a
little bit of daringly nude on the inner
most part they just they're made for
each other they should sell them in a
little box set because they are like
best friends my favorite nude lip gloss
this is from the L'Oreal extraordinaire
line and the shade is called nude ballet
it's a really really soft pretty
delicate nude shade it's hard for me to
find great nude lip glosses that I'm
truly satisfied with because so many
will come off to sheer this one is just
perfect if you want to gloss up those
neutral lipsticks I just mentioned this
is nice on top of that but you can
totally wear this alone and I think be
perfectly satisfied in the color that it
gives off that is all everyone that's my
Emily awards for lips thank you so much
for watching I hope my fellow whip
junkies out there really enjoyed this
because I had a whole lot of fun coming
up with this video coming up with these
favorites trying everything on for you

the Emily awards this year will be the
grand finales so stay tuned for that
that's where I'll talk about some hair
stuff some skin care brushes tools

awards so thank you again for watching
