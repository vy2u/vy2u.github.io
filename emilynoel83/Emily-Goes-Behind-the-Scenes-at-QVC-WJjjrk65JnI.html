broadcast and i'm so excited to tell you
about my big project with QVC i
partnered with QVC to do some different
videos on fall makeup trends but at the
very start of my day i got to tour QVC
studio and it blew my mind I've really
been watching QVC for years and years I
remember watching it as a child for fun
I would sell people things out of a
catalog it was really really neat to see
hosts in action to see behind the scenes
got to meet so many great crewmembers
and then we came out to a new location
and got to shoot several different
videos for fall trends I met Audrey and
Sharon from mom generations they're
awesome
so I got to share some stories with them
and get to know them a little bit better
try out some new products on them for
fall makeup last step of the look is
just a little mascara so everything was
just a total joy and I feel like I
learned a lot got to meet a lot of great
people and this is an experience I will
never forget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
