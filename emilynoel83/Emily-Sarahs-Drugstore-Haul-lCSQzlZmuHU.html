this video I'm with Sarah you may have
remembered Sarah from a review you did
she did a review on some Redken
hairspray I said nonsense number 22 so
we went to the drugstore today we went
to Walgreens and Sarah picked up quite a
few different things to kind of add to
her look so what'd you get um we got the
physician formula shimmer strips I've
never done highlighting before and then
we did it in her videos and it looked
interesting so yeah that's like kind of
it's kind of a bronzer on the bottom so
she can she can use this really three
different ways for a highlighter on the
top of bronzer and all of those can be
used like eyeshadows so I have this I
really like it so I kind of kind of
steered Sarah in that direction yeah
that's nice too today that way did my
makeup I love it thank you we got two
new kinds of eye shadow for really
covergirl was on
buy one get one half off so yeah we got
the drama eyes which I've talked about
before which is probably the best thing
you can get from the drugstore for like
a smoky eye cuz you've got like a silver
a red a black and a white and you can
just pretty much you could make that as
dark and intense as you wanted to or
just like a daytime look as well just
using the color sliders so we use like
the silver kind of on the inner part of
Sarah's eye and then we went on the
outside with some black and we used
another color though that we were
thinking about looking at other palettes
this pretty navy blue shade and so this
was from what room it's from the Queen
selection oh okay so that's like the by
the like the Queen after midnight so
that was really pretty because this
color like the more I kind of overlapped
it with the lighter shades the more the
blue stood
and then when I used it kind of with the
black it just created like a an
interesting kind of different look and
it looks really pretty with her blue
eyes so if you're looking for something
you know kind of a really nice blue
shadow it took like hardly any of that
to create the look so I was really happy
with the way that turned out so yeah we
just kind of decided less hair groups
did you lose your hair so that's gonna
be I think that's gonna be really really
usable for her the between those two
things so it's about the fantastic lash
from covergirl yeah that's that's been a
saver in mine for a long time and it's
just it's good for length and thickening
and it also kind of adds some curl
because Sara's got some false lashes on
I think that way to do your next event I
think they're number 21 is that right
yep number 21 I always use 53 so this is
a new experience I like it these seemed
a little bit longer and maybe a little
bit longer like the strip itself but
also the lashes are just a little more
dramatic and I think they turned out
good do you think you'll repurchase
those sir yeah I think so I like them a
lot I have a hard time branching out
because thank you so much for than they
didn't have them so yeah the only three
was sold out so now that I like the 21 I
probably won't buy 53 now you're stuck
know how to do anything fun very often
so we're going out tonight though we're
decided very excited so yeah the the
mascara kind of helps your lashes get
that curl in them and when you put on
eye lashes that are curled anyway you
know it all fits together a little
better so we got the Loreal decrease
eyeshadow base and yes reviewed this
numerous times
so yeah it's there really aren't a lot
of options for like a primer from the
drugstore I mean sometimes you look
online you'll find different things but
if you're just in the drugstore you're
gonna find like just a small handful of
options and I think this is definitely
workable we used it underneath her look
tonight so I guess we'll head towards
the end of the night we'll kind of see
how it all hung together
go from there but yeah sure it'll be
fine yeah we good and then we got the
covergirl lip slicks which is also an
experience that usually use a lot of
color I'm not wearing it right now but I
work earlier I forgot to like which is
good because I don't like the stick
never seems to work I mean it always
seems to kind of get like bunched up and
like kind of like scraping it off later
it's yeah it like it's just it's gross
yeah it didn't do that yet so it's these
claim to be like a tinted lip balm Oh
what shade is that bronze goddess so I
mean it looks it looks a little dark
actually in the tube but when she put it
on earlier it's just like a slight lie
dude can't do color yes swatch that it's
really super it's super sheer um really
nice if you got a little bit of a tan
going on maybe or just want a little
something different for the lips but
tonight what she's got on is she's got
on mac lipstick in angel which is a
really light pink and then I went over
that with one of the the Coastal Scents
max what shape was that
Odyssey it's like a really really light
shimmery pink it's like the color of my
nails right now it's it's really pretty
a sheer and I just thought if she's got
her eyes sort of so dramatic we'd go a
little lighter on the lips so I liked it
a lot I think her I think she just looks
beautiful so I got a few things from the
store to my letters getting bored so we
had to leave early
yeah we could have probably gone a lot
longer but I did the covergirl buy one
get one half off I got the fantastic
flash as well because I figure for as
many times as I review this and then
I've like run out of it and haven't been
able to show it because you know I go
through it kind of fast but this is a
really good mascara like we said just
for all-around you know it doesn't take
a long time to dry it's not super like
wet and you know gets all over so easy
to use and good and then I tried
something I hadn't tried before it's the
wet slicks lipgloss into two and I have
this over sort of a more pinky lipstick
kind of right in the middle of my lip
for that plump look and then I got this
purple and it's called purple diamond
from sinful colors a lot of people have
told me to go out and try this and I
haven't really I think I've had maybe
one shade and this is just kind of like
a pretty purpley shimmery shade and I
put it over my I guess Lackey be like I
didn't want to go in and actually take
off my work my toenail polish or my
fingernail polish so I but I layered
this over what was like kind of a
metallic silver shade on my toes and it
gave it a little bit of a sparkly look
and I layered it over like a they really
really light almost white shade on my
fingers and it looks kind of like
purpley pink again Tyler's around here
somewhere I'm not sure I thought he was
gonna maybe make an appearance but he's
being shy oh oh yes here is what were
you doing Tyler video games what game
were you playing the new men is it fun I
haven't played a ton yet since I've got
it but I like it a lot better so far why
is it better are you still playing the
practice games yes I have to practice
before I play real games it's not worth
he takes it very seriously like there
have been times when I've been doing a
tutorial in here and I have just been
like mid-sentence or something and I
carry like and I have to stop and like
kind of redo what I learn nicer it's
usually a swear word usually not very
nice words Tyler doesn't say not nice
words what's he talking about
angel tellers perfect according to
grandma my grandma for watching well I
guess we better wrap this up get on to
the rest of our activities for the night
