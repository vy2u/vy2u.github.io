this video it's the 20 questions tag and
if you're wondering why Tyler's sitting
here with me it's because he was tagged
to both of us got tagged every day
fabulous tagged us to do this and so we
decided hey we're gonna do it doing it
so oh and by the way a quick
announcement Tyler now has a blog I know
it's ridiculous
we figured he has thought city can set
up a blog so he has a few posts on there
so I'll put a link in the sidebar and
you can check it out if you want to but
it's it's sort of I mean I think it's
kind of guy oriented but yet not totally
I think there's probably a lot of things
that have everybody something very human
it's random it's not like all about one
thing so anyway let's get started with
the questions number one is thing you
cannot leave the house without there's a
lot of things I would prefer to not
leave the house without like my purse
and phone and stuff but I would say keys
are without a doubt number one for me
yeah these are pretty important suppose
you have to lock the door obviously yeah
I'm just gonna assume that's like a
functional thing that everybody's got to
take with them so I'm gonna go with my
phone Tyler has a relationship with his
blackberry that is it's something
special and yeah if you're it's really
hard to put into words so I'm gonna try
it's it's a little annoying sometimes
I'm sure there are probably some people
who have been through the situation
where somebody is like so attached to
their blackberry they're always like on
it texting someone like you're probably
you're going to probably hear that thing
go off all throughout this number two is
favorite brand of makeup Tyler what's
your what's your insight on this really
we're today so let us go with whatever
looks the best in the packaging in the
tacking okay my brother couldn't name a
brand that this one's really this one
what you had was really hard for me
because I I used you know I used so many
brands of makeup and I I mean drugstore
or high-end I would be hard for me to
pick but I would say the one that I get
the most excited about so if I get
something from I think Smashbox is
probably across the board I really like
the quality of almost everything they
put out and I think it's pretty
innovative they do a lot of new things
but um I mean it's really just barely
kind of standing out among the rest
because I used so many kinds like if I
had to pick one drugstore I don't kind I
don't think I could like I would have to
look back there and see like okay I mean
I like so many different things I don't
think I can do that um number three
favorite flowers don't really have a
favorite well what do you usually get if
you get me flowers I would say primarily
roses those last ones I got you were
pretty awesome yeah they were roses with
like hydrangea or some like the little
kind of clusters around the roses it was
really cool
yeah I like that I like roses too that
was what we had is our flowers and our
wedding too so I like roses number four
favorite clothing stores that's a good
question
I like buying clothes to be honest with
you I'm really cheap probably JCPenney
or something like that yeah I like I
mean I like places where you can go and
get a lot for your money and we like in
our mall I like going to Macy's
I like Wet Seal but I feel like with
some sometimes at Wet Seal like you
really have to look like you have to
seek out the thing that
is maybe it looks a little more
expensive than it really is you know
what I mean like you kinda have to have
some judgment there question is favorite
perfume Tyler uses a body spray and I
use all kinds of different stuff but say
my favorite is the chocolate packs oh
that is so that smells so good oh it's
it's amazing and we need to oh there's
no way we can really yeah you should
people mental invent virtual since we'll
work on that
this could smell it yourself yes my
favorite would probably be I like the
Victoria's Secret colognes I was given
like a set of a whole bunch of them the
very sexy Victoria's Secret the one that
comes in the little rectangular kind of
container well I guess the mini one was
like that but I'm not sure with the
full-size mom but that's probably my
favorite scent um next question heels
are flat heels for me because I am we've
been asked this a lot I am 5 feet tall
Tyler is 6 6 so I don't know I just feel
very short and I do like to the little
boost that heels will give you it makes
my legs seem feel a little longer
comfort wise yeah they're not so good
but Tyler gonna say on 7 do you make
good grades oh well I don't get graded
anymore because I'm out of school but
when I was in school I I made good
grades I I had to work really hard I had
to study a lot to get him I felt like I
wasn't the type of person that would sit
down like barely study for a test you
know those people that just could not
hardly do anything and still wind up
getting a decent grade on a test like I
have to study a lot and Tyler is my
exact opposite on that so until I got
the last 4 months whatever study as hard
as anybody
split before that I got good grades
without working too hard
mmm yes so yes I did make good grades I
never ate favorite colors blue blue blue
I would say my favorite color is
probably I like bright colors overall
like I guess I'm not worrying breakers
right now but if I had my choice I like
like turquoise pink pink is probably
number one I really like orange too
those are the sorts of colors that I've
learned kind of look good on TV as well
and doing the news usually those
brighter colors so they pop right is
great too um next one I feel like we're
going really slowly through these always
get lost - I live energy drink energy
drinks do you occasionally a lot of them
though are so much sugar so if I do
drink an energy drink it's the
sugar-free kind but lots of stuff with
caffeine in it I rarely drink energy
drinks um what you think maybe I would
need to because of getting up so early
for the news but I usually just take
some coffee with me I don't drink a
crazy amount of coffee or caffeine
really at all but I do drink a little
bit of coffee every day on my way to
work or while I want to get to work just
to perk me up a little bit um next one
is do you drink juice I don't really
drink a lot of juice I have nothing
against juice but a lot of juice I mean
you talked about sugar and stuff a lot
of juices really have a lot of sugar
yeah boy juice because I mean even if
it's the real natural stuff where they
don't mint sweeteners and stuff it's
still not even this good for you is just
eating them eating a piece of fruit so
I'm just assume drink something that
doesn't have calories in it
don't drink your calories heat your
calories that's kind of a I feel -
number 11 do you like swimming I love
swimming as it's a little kid though I
mean it's really travel there
range when I my mom got me into swimming
lessons as a little kid we had a pool in
town and I was very reluctant first like
I actually escaped from the swimming
lessons at first and I was like sitting
there on the bench waiting to see me
like jump into the deep end and she had
told me I was like mom I'm worried
they're gonna make us jump in the deep
end today and she was like no they
wouldn't do that not this you know not
at this class or whatever and they did
that day and so she just say they're
waiting and then I'm like tugging on her
like mom I don't but eventually like I
got past the fear and I got up to the
level where I could have become a
lifeguard if I wanted to like I I built
up I felt like swimming built up a lot
of muscle like swimming your back if you
regularly swim cardio-wise and just you
wouldn't think you would really build
muscle doing it but you do and I love it
I'm not nuts about swimming I like being
in the water just I'm terrible swimmer
no no swimming specifically water things
yes the water things next one is do you
eat fries with a fork no now pans then
once it's those little ones like a steak
and shake or something with the cheese
on next one what's your favorite
moisturizer um I like to kind of rotate
mine and I do it a lot on a seasonal
basis because sometimes during the
winter I need more moisture obviously or
if you're the kind of person whose skin
gets drier in the winter time you might
want something more rich but what I've
been liking lately is what I use when I
wake up in the morning and it's from be
luscious and it is part of their vitamin
C collection it has an SPF 15 in the
moisturizer and it just has this really
refreshing citrusy scent and you put it
on it and just like you take a whiff of
it and it just makes you feel a little
more awake kind of mean you splash your
face with cold water you feel more awake
that kind of scent makes me feel more
awake so I really like that when I just
kind of stands out from a lot of the
typical just you know average
moisturizers you get me I've had Tyler
um using like the Olay complete which is
a pretty good moisturizer all around it
has the sunscreen in it also I think you
use some kind of clean and clear thing
that says night on it that you can use
before bed supposed to be good for you
before bed that anti-aging stuff is
probably something that Tyler and I can
both be thinking about I like if you're
looking for anti-aging I just used some
of this from time to time too but the
Mary Kay time life stuff is really good
um next do you want to get married later
on in life just go check on that next
one and for people who don't know I
always think people just know this but
they don't necessarily Tyler and I are
married we're not just boyfriend and
girlfriend next one do you get mad
easily when provoked Oh in certain
situations I can handle a lot of stuff
though it's not getting mad Tyler is a
pretty like even-tempered kind of guy so
he's not going to be too you know this
end or that end of the spectrum I don't
think but I know I tend to be maybe a
little more excitable I can get a little
bit more fired up about something but I
usually don't get that if I get angry
especially if I'm in a work setting I
would probably kind of you know kind of
swallow it and just try to go on with
the flow and put my happy face on if I
can number 16 are you into ghost hunting
no no 17 any phobias Heights pretty good
it's funny because you're so tall but
yet Heights is your phobia feet are
still in the ground
my phobia I I guess if I had to pick
something it would be getting in a car
accident I get a little bit like almost
I get really anxious sometimes if I'm
riding with someone and I'm not the one
driving and I'm in like a really traffic
packed situation like and cars are going
fast and there's a lot of cars and it's
an unfamiliar area someone else is
driving and I feel like we're following
too close you know like I get a little
apprehensive when that happens and I
just feel like I've heard of so many
people getting in like you know people I
know getting in horrible car accidents
and I just you know read about them all
the time on the news and it doesn't it
hasn't really desensitized me at all I
guys still get very very nervous about
that sometimes 18 do you bite your nails
I used to I used to and probably when I
first started doing videos not too long
after I started a night announced that I
was going to stop biting my nails and I
actually excuse me I actually did stop
biting my nails and you might have seen
how my progress went with that in my
earlier videos but the key for me was
just keeping him painted that is the
biggest key because then you don't want
to bite them when they look nice and so
I just continually kept polish on him
yeah I've never really had a problem
with biting my nails I've probably done
it twice a couple of times when I didn't
have nothing on us somewhere and thought
my nails were too long didn't that's a
good thing number 19 have you ever had a
near-death experience
yeah and I'm Collision pretty big car
accident but you were you came out of
that no it's fine close enough to near
death one little thing that was wrong in
a situation like that
I haven't been in any real severe car
accidents I think my family was in when
I was a pretty young child but it was
nothing that it was something going on
with one of the wheels and something
came loose but it didn't turn into a
major problem could have been a lot
worse than it was but other than that a
cheerleading gave me some near probably
near severe injury situations but
nothing that would be near death um
number 20 do you drink coffee yes I do
drink coffee most mornings before I go
to work but not not excessively and I
can I can get by without it if any -
I'll drink it but I'm not really that in
love with the taste of it so no yes but
no on a regular basis I guess all right
well that wraps up our 20 questions
thank you guys for lasting through that
if you do if you did if you gotten to
this point if you didn't eat your
problem if you have any other questions
for Tyler or I I mean you can always let
us know on our blogs or Facebook pages

writer's block kind of situations so
