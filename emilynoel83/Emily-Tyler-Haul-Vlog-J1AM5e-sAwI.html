different setup here because it is dark
outside we don't have the natural
lighting of the window right now so we
kind of twist around on the couch but if
we might want to turn down the TV a
little bit probably good idea okay BRB
alright TV has been successfully muted
and we're back we um we went to st.
Louis for a couple days I've had a few
days off work and it's been an spit the
gum out it was a really fun time we got
to do a little sightseeing I guess you'd
say they need some good food and we also
got some new things so um I probably got
more new things but Tyler cutting
without one new thing but they were very
explain there were so we're going to
show you what we got is really kind of a
haul video here first thing I have to
show you is this kit from Smashbox that
I got and I got it to create this super
dramatic i know i went there with it the
very dramatic navy smokey eye on it's a
kit for brown eyes and it's the master's
class glamour eyes for brown and so you
get seven different products in here
that's the look i created it's so cool
because you get this little pamphlet I
know very good Tyler so pumped I and you
can do like these three different I
looks and so I just did a tutorial on
this look so keep your eyes out for that
up soon but it was so fun and I love
these products and just to show you real
quick what comes with it I put it place
them all back in here nicely so you can
see but you get this awesome quad I have
four different shadows you get the
Bionic mascara and this is like a blue
so an indigo indigo blue and so this is
all kind of centered around tones of
blue you get a jet-set waterproof liner
in midnight blue you get a cream liner
in blue steel yeah another primer to try
out guys so a photo-finish lid primer
double ended I brightener something that
goes you can like see Tyler through this
double-ended pencil that gleich
highlights your brows and the inner
corners of your eyes awesome little tiny
brush for people interested in a tiny
brush um so it's awesome oops it just
fell out it's really really cool i've
just used it for the first time and so
it's basically a tutorial of me doing a
tutorial so i got that from sephora so
that was awesome moving right along I
got this product from Sephora from
benefit and it's called 10 why is it
called pin because it makes you into a
ten perfect ten yeah that's what it says
on the back of its a bronzer highlighter
in one I was needing not so much the
bronzer but more the highlighter and
then I thought why not make it a 24
right so you get the bronze were there
too i have that on as well so kind of
use the bronzer as a contour and then
the highlight so pumped about that as
well so those are a couple of like kind
of investment that make up pieces
because you guys know you're hearing
more from me usually about drugstore
than high end but yes we went to the mac
counter as well and I pretty much knew
what I wanted to get um which was good
because they're kind of busy there they
were going so I had an idea of a couple
of Shadows I wanted to get one more
neutral and one a little more colorful
so I got the I got the shadow in satin
taupe so you guys are all probably like
nodding your heads yes yes you should
have that so that's just kind of one of
those grayish neutrally topi brown sort
of do anything colors and then the more
colorful one that I just couldn't take
my eyes off of when as soon as I saw it
I kept kind of going back to it and it
is cranberry and so I don't think my
lighting is doing this justice at all
but it's just not um but it's like a
reddish it's it's a frost book these are
frost shades but and it's just really
pretty i play with it as soon as i got
it and
just a great warm way to warm up your
eye look and then finally I got a
lipstick this is a frost shade and angel
light kind of nude pink I don't have
that on my lips right now and I used a
different color for this tutorial but
yeah it's really great great for
underneath different colors and I just
like could go under a lot of different
kinds of glosses and look more pink more
gold or nude or whatever so anyway I
tried to breeze through that as fast as
I could for the sake of Tyler here
because he has something exciting to
talk about 200 super what you get
where'd you go I went to champs champs
sports mmhmm yeah in the mall and got
these shoes some under armour shoes very
nice the workout in and run in and you
got those because yeah the ones i had
before just got torn apart didn't last
very long so i thought i'd spend a
little bit more get a more quality pair
for these last a while what brand were
the ones with it lee bak rebuffs didn't
last too long so the fair ahead before
that lasted like three years so i had
high expectations TN work out so we
overall we had a successful trip I would
spend plenty of money but um you know I
think we we spin pretty wisely was room
and I think we both had an idea of kind
of what we went in to look for but
anyway keep your eye out for that
tutorial because then it's going to be
fun to watch me follow a tutorial I
think instead of making up my own but um
what else do we have to add
just like that good I think I've been
going on though anyway thank you guys so
much for watching our little would haul
video here haven't done one of those in
a while but they're fun to do it with
the special stuff I've never been done
before so this is Tyler's very first all
again so thank you guys so much for
watching thank you for blogging thank
you for joining the facebook fan page 2
um Tyler may be starting up a blog here
of his own pretty soon I'm gonna get him
going on it because I think he's got a
lot to say I think he might come across
as the strong silent type but I think
there's more under the surface like I
think he's got quite a bit of like
knowledge about fitness and job
searching and lots of really random a
lot of rid of blackberries oh we have to
do our blackberry waters in first yeah
I've become people asking about this is
a black I have the blackberry tour he
has the curve curve so they're a little
different mine's the newer awesomer one
i know there i know there are some fans
of the curve there the like their curves
too so mm-hmm there yeah there's some
differences that we can compare set
Tyler dropped mine last night he was
sitting it somewhere and i got i am very
protective like I keep it in my purse is
down here I keep my blackberry in this
little sheath like this it's from body
glove and found it at walmart but i keep
it in here in my purse because i don't
want anything in my purse to scratch it
so yeah a little-little protective of it
so what it got dropped outside of its
little holster I was very scared but it
made it through no scratches so it can
be dropped on the floor once no
scratches anyway guys we better wrap
this up so thank you so much for
watching and unite
