setup here because it is dark outside we
don't have the natural lighting of the
window right now so we kind of twist
around on the couch but we might want to
turn down the TV a little bit okay BRB
alright the TV has been successfully
muted and we're back we um we went to
st. Louis for a couple days I've had a
few days off work and it's been spit the
gum out it was a really fun time we got
to do a little sightseeing I guess you'd
say that need some good food and we also
got some new things so I probably got
more new things but Tyler got one new
thing but they were very explicit
they're worse so we're going to show you
what we got is any kind of a haul video
here first thing I have to show you is
this kit from Smashbox that I got and I
got it to create this super dramatic I
know I went there with it the very
dramatic navy smokey eye and it's a kit
for brown eyes and it's the master's
class glamour eyes for brown and so you
get seven different products in here
that's the look I created it's so cool
because you get this little pamphlet I
know you guys are so pumped and you can
do like these three different eye looks
and so I just did a tutorial on this
look so keep your eyes out for that up
soon but it was so fun and I love these
products and just to show you real quick
what comes with it I put it place them
all back in here nicely so you can see
but you get this awesome quad for
different shadows you get the bionic
mascara and this is like a blue so an
indigo indigo blue and so this is all
kind of centered around tones of blue
you get a jet-set waterproof liner in
midnight blue you get a cream liner in
blue steel yeah another primer to try
out guys so a photo finish lid primer
double ended eye brightener something
that goes you can like see Tyler through
this
double-ended pencil that like highlights
your brows and the inner corners of your
eyes awesome little tiny brush for
people interested in a tiny brush so
it's awesome
oops it just fell out it's really really
cool I've just used it for the first
time and so it's basically a tutorial of
me doing a tutorial so I got that from
Sephora so that was awesome
moving right along I got this product
from Sephora from benefit and it's
called ten why is it called pin because
it makes you into a ten perfect ten
yeah that's what it says on the back of
it's a bronzer highlighter in one I was
needing not so much the bronzer but more
the highlighter and then I thought why
not make it a twofer right so you get
the bronze were there too I have that on
as well so kind of use the bronzer as a
contour and then the highlight so pumped
about that as well so those are a couple
of like kind of investment makeup pieces
because you guys know you're hearing
more from me usually about drugstore
than high-end but yes we went to the MAC
counter as well and I pretty much knew
what I wanted to get which was good
because they're kind of busy there they
were going so I had an idea of a couple
of shadows I wanted to get one more
neutral and one a little more colorful
so I got the I got this shadow in satin
taupe so you guys are all probably like
nodding your heads yes yes you should
have that so that's just kind of one of
those grayish neutrally taupey brown
sort of do anything colors and then the
more colorful one that I just couldn't
take my eyes off of when as soon as I
saw it I kept kind of going back to it
and it is cranberry and so I don't think
my lighting is doing this justice at all
but it's just not but it's like a
reddish it's it's safe Frost both these
are frost shades but
and it's just really pretty I played
with it as soon as I got it and it's
just a great warm way to warm up your
eye look and then finally I got a
lipstick this is a frost shade an angel
light kind of nude pink I don't have
that on my lips right now and I guess
your different color for this tutorial
but yeah it's really great great for
underneath different colors and I just
like could go under a lot of different
kinds of glosses and look more pink more
gold or nude or whatever so anyway I
tried to breeze through that as fast as
I could for the sake of Tyler here
because he had something exciting bug
but you know what you get where'd you go
I went to champs sham sports got these
shoes some Under Armour shoes very nice
workout in and running and you got those
because yeah the ones I had before just
got torn apart didn't last very long so
I thought I'd spend a little bit more
get a more quality pair for these last
one well what brand were the ones in the
Lee Bach rebuffs didn't last too long
stone the pair I had before that lasted
like three years so I had high
expectations to me and work out so we
overall we had a successful spent plenty
of money but you know I think we we
spent pretty wisely but I think we both
had an idea of kind of what we went in
to look for but anyway keep your eye out
for that tutorial because it's gonna be
fun to watch me follow a tutorial I
think instead of making up my own but um
what else do we have to add
just like think of I think I mean violin
anyway thank you guys so much for
watching our little wood haul video here
haven't done one of those in a while but
they're fun to do it with the special
stuff I've never done before so thank
you guys so much for watching thank you
for blogging thank you for joining the
Facebook fan page to Tyler may be
starting up a blog here of his own
pretty soon I'm gonna get him going on
it because I think he's got a lot to say
I think he might come across as the
strong silent type but I think there's
more under the surface
I think he's got quite a bit of like
knowledge about fitness and job
searching and it's a really random
blackberries we have to do our
blackberry yeah I've become people
asking about this of a black I have the
blackberry tour he has the curve curve
so they're a little different mice the
newer awesomer one no there I know
there's some fans of the curve there the
like there curves too so yeah there's
some differences that we can compare
that Tyler dropped mine last night he
was sitting it somewhere and I got I am
very protective like I keep it in my
purse is down here I keep my blackberry
in this little sheath like it's from
Body Glove and found it at Walmart but I
keep it in here in my purse because I
don't want anything in my purse to
scratch it so yeah little protective of
it so what it got dropped outside of its
little holster I was very scared but it
made it through no scratches so it can
be dropped on the floor once no
scratches anyway guys we better wrap
this up so thank you so much for
watching and
it's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
