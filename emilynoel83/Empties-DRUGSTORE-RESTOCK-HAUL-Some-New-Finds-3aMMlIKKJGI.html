be like a little different take on MPs I
thought I would just cut to the chase
and go ahead and repurchase you know do
my little restock of the things that I
have run out of or the things that I'm
really close to running out of that I
really don't want to be without and I
thought it would be fun to just kind of
see it from that perspective you know
because sometimes we rave and rave on
certain products but what are you
actually going and buying again and
again so this is going to be drugstore
Edition because I was in Walmart ahead
bill with me she's my little helper
she's actually a really great shopper
right right here at man if I tell her
something like hey don't let me forget
the bananas she won't let me forget the
bananas you need to have around but I
picked up some things that are like
continual repurchases one of those items
would be my equate to and one daily
facial claws I'm such a broken record
with these products but for a long time
actually I had been on to the Olay once
and that's going back to college yell I
was using those in college to take my
makeup off then I started getting these
do you ever feel like you're the person
who's single-handedly keeping a product
in business like that's me this is for
normal skin it says gently exfoliates
and conditions and they're called
two-in-one daily facial cloths they used
to call these like hydrating face
washcloths but they're basically these
little folded up cloths and you add
water to them and they suds up I can get
them all over my face right up in my eye
area I never have any irritation and
they're just really good at effectively
removing all of my makeup I've tried so
many different like cleansing bulbs and
all these crazy things here and there
and this is always the thing that like
does the cleanup job for all the stuff
that the other thing could get rid of
you know so in here there are 66 clods
there's like two plastic pouches of them
and yeah I just love them so much and
I've been asked a lot about favorite
makeup removers and this is just my
favorite thing to use I mean there might
occasionally be like a really resistant
lip product or an eye product that just
doesn't want to come off and then I'll
follow up with maybe an oil-based eye
makeup remover on a cotton round but
most of the time this stuff's going to
do the trick and it still feels pretty
gentle on my skin I'm not like scrubbing
them to pieces and they're great for
travel too as opposed to like a throwing
in an entire thing of wet white
you can just throw a few of these for
you know however many days you'll be
gone and they're great I love them now I
am about out here of my Garnier skin
active micellar cleansing water the one
for all skin types even sensitive it
says and I love using that at the start
of my day like when I sit down here to
my makeup area I feel like I'm able to
bypass that step of like rinsing my face
off at the sink and I just put some of
this on a cotton pad go all over my skin
and my skin really has been very good
I'm not one who deals with a lot of
breakouts I feel like my skin is getting
that nice will fresh start before the
makeup routine so I got another one of
those be gentle with that one okay
gently oh I got a new deodorant actually
this is a deodorant I have repurchased
now for the third time and it's the Dove
dry spray invisible it's the one that
says no white marks on 100 colors I
cannot believe how good this deodorant
is and I normally get it I think it has
a pink cap and this one has a blue one I
think that might just be a different
scent on it perhaps gosh I hope I bought
the right one because I really love the
pink one the scent is really really good
on the one with the pinkish colored cat
but I was shocked you guys because I
normally use the secret clinical like
the Oprah's life class recommended
you know stress relief whatever I would
normally use that I thought it was doing
about as good job as any deodorant could
do for me know now when I use what I
have left of that instead of this stuff
I can tell a major difference this stuff
keeps me so dry it's so like sheer
colorless I feel like I'm not even
putting that much on at all and it works
so well and you guys I am a hot person I
sweat it is summertime you know and this
stuff so good again I hope the Blue Caps
podiatry purchased isn't a fail guess
two times now I've gotten the pain point
okay I needed some more eyelash glue
stored in my life I always need new
eyelash glue and the Revlon precision
lash adhesive I love butts like you
can't find that anywhere
everybody knows the struggle that we're
all going through now so I end up
getting this kiss strip lash adhesive in
clears as one I have sitting here that
I'm almost out of and it also is the one
that says
with aloe it's pretty darn close to the
Revlon like it's getting me through it's
going to be good enough even though I
wasn't like jumping up and down about
repurchasing this product I still you
know I know I need it I got some cotton
swabs some q-tips and they are
leopard-print why why are these
necessary well I am almost out of my box
of hot pink q-tips in what way can we go
bigger than hot pink q-tips leopard
print animal print q-tips that's where
it's at I did a mascara repurchase
because I do not want to be without my
lash paradise and I was trying to
calculate last night how long have I
been using the current tube my first
tube of that and I think it's been
between two and three months that I've
been using it and it is definitely
starting to seem a little dry it's still
giving me a good application right now
but I can just tell the difference in
the formula and I do not want to be
without this mascara so I went and got a
new one and then I noticed
wait what's mystic black it says mystic
black for the shade and the shade of the
one I'm currently using this one just
says blackest black my first tube but
yeah this one says mystic black I'm
trying to understand what the difference
must see is it going to be like the
blackest black ever or is there going to
be some kind of sparkle in this I don't
know you guys I will have to report back
to you on that I may have another two
weeks left with that other lash paradise
but I love that mascara so much great
for length great on days when I don't
want to do any eyeliner nothing real big
with the eyes but I really want my
lashes to stand out that's the best
stuff and then I always repurchase this
the covergirl clump crusher water
resistant I couldn't even begin to tell
you how many times I've repurchased this
stuff because it's the best on the lower
lashes when you don't want smudges if
you've got special occasions and you
need to wear it all over like upper and
lower lashes it's really good it gets
paired so many times with so many other
mascaras what's happened down there
there okay I got some more of this stuff
because I want to compare it to some
other setting sprays that I've been
using it's my beloved hard candy shear
and be hydrating primer mist it says 12
hour power on it
says coconut water infused up here and I
have gone in search of this probably two
or three other times that I've been to
Walmart and it hasn't been in stock so
when I saw it the other day when I was
with Bill I grabbed and that completely
used one of these up and while I'm not
in dire need of a setting spray right
now like I have others I could use I
just wanted to do some comparisons
between this specifically and the one
from Too Faced The Hangover one it seems
like they're really really close now you
guys know what happens when you're
shopping in the drugstore even though
you've got your list of things you know
your empties you need to replenish you
end up picking up some other things that
you don't necessarily need one of those
items is this Maybelline face studio
blender sponge I have not used this yet
so we're going to crack it open and see
what this feels like
and it's taped down so securely and if
only they would close up the lip
products as well as they can close up
the sponge lip products are always
getting compromised in Walmart this is
what it looks like it's got a flat edge
that's kind of like contours kind of
curved in it's really really soft I
suspect this is going to definitely
expand size-wise when I saturate it with
water and it seems like it's going to be
super soft so I will use that in an
upcoming video also from Maybelline I
got the master camo color correcting pen
and this is the one that says apricot
for dark circles light to medium skin
tones I went ahead and use this today
and I have since topped it off with a
really light concealer because guys this
is I think really too dark for my skin
tone this shade here it's a little too
deep and maybe I use too much of it
because you know you have that first
experience where you click up through
the pin and you're clicking and you're
getting impatient
so you're clicking even faster then all
of a sudden usual everything comes up I
may have used a lot but still this color
tone just seems way dark and it is
advertised for light to medium skin
tones and I felt like I was blending it
in and I don't think I even totally have
it blended as well in my inner corner I
used a really light concealer everywhere
else and my circles are still peeking
through so I'm not I'm not really
feeling this product so much and the
last thing I picked
is another one of these maybelline
superstay matte inks i got it in the
shade loyalist these are one of those
things that is always like there's one
in every shade sitting out there and
they've all been cracked open and messed
with you can tell that the seal has been
broken but this one this one was good
and I love this product so much I have
two shades I have lover which is the ma
be pink and pioneer which is the red and
I've just been wanting to try more of
these so I think I'm going to try this
one on the spot with you here I'm taking
off my little on this is the Neutrogena
soft caramel lip balm and we will see
how this product goes because this is
the first nude that I've tried from this
line so okay it's not quite as light and
scary as I thought it was going to be
you kind of worried or at least I do
about these matte lip products that are
nudes and the ones that are too light
can sometimes look really chalky like
extra dry but this one looks like
actually a great shade awesome
now the question is will this one last
as well as those bolder colors that I
have will see throughout the day how
that goes but I love this formula so
much it feels thin really lightweight
flexible kind of moves with your lips
but lasts like none other
I found myself wishing as I was looking
at the line I was wishing there were
more like neutral shades or mid-tone
neutrals but this nude is really pretty
I think I'm going to love that okay okay
so that is my little drugstore restock
some things that I have legitimately run
out of or really close to running out of
and had to have my backup sandy so thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed and I would love to know what
products do you absolutely always ensure
that you have a backup of I would love
to hear and thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
