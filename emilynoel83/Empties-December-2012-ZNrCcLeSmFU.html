morning outside I had to switch up my
lighting a bit and I thought I'll shoot
something other than a tutorial instead
I will do my empties video my very first
empties you like it's such an
informative way to tell people whether
you like something or didn't when you've
used up the entire product you pretty
much become kind of an expert on how
that worked for you and I was watching
some videos from brunette beauty blogger
actually her youtube name leaves off the
are at the end but I mean she's got
great videos in general but I just
started watching your empties and I was
inspired to do the same so I'm just
gonna go through and give you just a
brief little bit of feedback on each
thing that I've used up and lets you
know whether or not I would repurchase
or if in some cases I already have you
know there are those products you just
don't want to run out of and you want to
make sure you've got the backup so
that's the situation with some of these
um including my equate every day facial
hydrating cleansing cloths and i got
these these are an alternative to the ol
a hydrating cleansing cloths which I
love the Eau de la daily facials and
that's what I started using but it
reached a point where I ran out of those
and I went to the store one day and
could not find those same ones so I'm
like I'm going to try the equate kind
and these are not the pre-moistened like
face wipes these are dry and you get
them wet and they start to suds up and
you can really remove all your makeup
even my eye makeup these take off on my
eye makeup too and I was impressed with
these because they do take off my eye
makeup without irritating my eyes like
many generic brands hey I go through
these all the time and repurchase them
all the time sometimes Tyler uses these
that says for normal to dry skin and I
really feel like I can use these
year-round no problem it's not like they
make my combo skin I'm a little more
combination to oily in the warmer months
and it's not like these make me greasy
or anything like that through all of
this mithya body sunkist firming
moisturizer for medium to dark skin so
this is a gradual self tanner I think
the name might be different now because
I have repurchased this and I need to
double check what they're calling you
don't know how much it's actually firmed
but what I like to
about it was that it was an easy gradual
tan that you could actually see some
gradual Tanner's I feel like are so
gradual I don't notice them building up
and this color will build up also the
scent is not objectionable as some
people say you know sunless Tanner's
have that kind of wacky sent going on so
this is a good one good one from the
drugstore and I have gone out and bought
it other I've got a lot of small size
things because I like trying that QVC
Beauty test tube and I legitimately will
try pretty much everything that comes in
there and discovered some great favorite
things from those one is the micro
delivery exfoliating wash from
philosophy this is kind of a small size
i think it's a yeah two ounce thing here
but this lasted me a long time because
i'll use it every couple days and what
is unique about this is that the little
beads are the little granules in this
exfoliating wash are like the finest
ever and there's so many so when you
scrub you don't feel like with some you
know scrubs you fellow there's like
three granules of something what's that
doing for my skin like this really
exfoliates and does a great job I will
be getting more of this because I find
it's such a refreshing clean wonderful
feeling once I finished using this so I
sometimes alternate this with days I
used my clarisonic um and I'll use this
even after I've taken all my makeup off
I'll go ahead and use this for that
extra deep deep clean and i really like
nothing else in an exfoliating type
product that i really didn't see the
hype over is the kate somerville
exfoliate this is an intensive
exfoliating treatment sunlight leave it
on my face for a couple minutes and then
rinse it off and I mean it's got a real
almost a tingle / sting when you put it
on your skin and anytime I rinse this
off like afterwards I'm look at my skin
after the shower and thinking what did
this do exactly like my skin doesn't
feel that much smoother and I don't like
to see an overall brightness like I do
with the philosophy or after using my
clarisonic or something like that so I
mean I just I don't see myself buying
this another thing that I've got here
that came from a test tube is the first
day beauty smooth shave cream fab legs
essentials with fab antioxidant booster
so um this is a shaving cream I had
nothing to glamorous here but for a
while I've run out of my Schick
intuition which is the racer with the
built-in soap around it which I love the
sensitive skin for that like I have the
most sensitive skin on my legs and they
get bumpy and bad like with pretty much
anything I use this is good but I don't
feel like it's anything really special
it was pretty moisturizing I mean it
felt like really heavy duty when you put
it on it's not like a gel to a cream or
foam or anything it's just a straight-up
cream and it worked well but it's just
nothing i'm going to repurchase like I
said like the intuition really well for
how it keeps my legs in good condition
after a shitty eternal grace from
philosophy this is a little bottle that
I got is like a free sample from Ulta um
eternal grace I don't like it as well as
inner grace which is probably one of my
favorite philosophy cents I don't think
I even like this one quite as well as
pure grace which is really that they say
soap and water clean I mean it's just a
really fresh scent and i would probably
purchase that one or inner grace before
i repurchase eternal grace this is still
a good scent but it's just it doesn't
really resonate with me i guess it's
kind of it makes me think of has more
green notes in this one I don't know
just not that much of a fan another
thing I used up here is from Tarte and
it's the mark huija see brightener I
treatment so this is a little eye cream
and you can see I just licked that well
I did I didn't like it clean obviously
but i did use it all up entirely and I
felt like this was moisturizing
hydrating but I didn't see like really
any improvement in like fine lines
around the eye area I just felt like I
was putting it on just for the fact of
having a little extra hydration there
and I think to buy this full-size I mean
that's too big of a price to pay for me
just for a little added hydration in the
under eye so not really feeling I used
up all of my Bronson Brighton from laura
geller you're looking at the tile I hit
tile on this because it is a terracotta
tile these baked products are baked on
and I love this product this is a small
size I'm really close to doing the same
with my balance and Brighton in the
small size even if you get these
miniature sizes quote unquote I mean it
will last you so long with these Laura
Geller baked products and I do have a
big one that I'm currently using of my
bronze in Brighton i also have a big
balance and Brighton waiting for me got
my mom onto the whole balance and breton
thing as well it's just a really nice
powder foundation and this bronze and
brighton is like a nice um i would say
like a light cut two colored bronzer if
you're looking for a bronzer not just a
contour with but for something to take
your whole skin tone and just give it
like a boost bronze and brighton is
really good for that and it's pretty
much matt i mean it may have just the
slightest hint of shimmer but overall
just a good natural finish great looking
bro you step all of my wet and wild mega
liner just a nice classic black liner
from the drugstore i have repurchased
this accidentally got the kind with
sparkle in it that's okay i'll probably
still use it but it's just got a little
fine brush tip very inexpensive very
good if you're just looking for a
standard liquid liner this is not
waterproof so i'll point that out and my
review with my mom we talked about the
L'Oreal telescopic waterproof which
really really is hardcore staying power
this is for those who are not needing a
waterproof lining that really does last
as a pencil liner that I've run out of
is my Malley ever color automatic
waterproof liner in onyx I love this
liner this is I mean for my waterline
this is my go-to because this lasts
longer than any liner I have in the
waterline and I'd have some good ones
but they all tend to start wearing off
from the outer corner and then slowly
you know it's like you've just got a
little bit on the innermost part and so
this one lives really well and I do have
another one of this and I have the
ultimate version which is just a little
bit creamier that's in my Malley today's
special value kit that I reviewed on my
blog so I've got a couple waiting in the
wings here and I wouldn't have it any
other way
because I love love that line a couple
lip liners I've gone through my Rimmel
exaggerated lip liner and ravish one of
the best red lip liners from the
drugstore I would go back and get that
again I think that's great also buxom
has a big and healthy lipstick and the
shade is fresno and this is like a deep
break red and i have used this so many
times when i'm doing kind of a neutral
lip to just deepen up the outsides and
give a little more dimension to the lip
and I mean I'm totally out of this I
can't get up anymore just a little bit
that it is still in there that another
one of these buxom that came in a kit
that's pretty close in color to this so
I'm probably not going to be racing out
to repurchase this any time so you're
going to round this out with a few
mascaras I'll make it up and grow love
this mascara I have another one waiting
for me this is a really full lush dense
brush here with a what I would call it
fairly dry formula mascara which I feel
like is buildable it's great for fine or
thin lashes because I feel like it just
it you can keep going over it and get
great length and volume with this so
I've recommended this to a lot of people
um so I would say definitely look into
get up and grow if you've got lashes
like mine that need that extra boost
most of the time also I went through
this telescopic explosion carbon black
I've tried this a while back not in the
carbon black version this one's just
blacker I guess it's the mascara with
the little ball there and I found this
to be a nice way to get into you know
your innermost corner and this is just a
nice little tool I guess almost a
mascara tool to get in there and get a
little extra separation sometimes I
don't know if it's worth it to me to
repurchase this because it's just it's
just an extra step and I don't know that
it's that necessarily the elf exact lash
mascara i barely use this it's already
dry so it's kind of like I don't think I
use this up necessarily that is it is
pretty darn dry it's a teeny tiny brush
mascara i definitely prefer maybelline
lash discovery over this
would be like for your lower lashes to
really get in there and it's just this
brush is so short and so close to this
part here it's like really tricky to get
in there and it just does not evenly
deposit the product on my lashes like
lash discovery does where I can take
like one swipe here one swipe here and
I'm done with lash discovery this too
much work so those are my fds that's my
trash I hope you guys enjoyed this video
um I'll try to do more of these whenever
I feel I can I don't know if it'll turn
out to be monthly or what but I will
definitely be holding on to those empty
products so I can show them in a future
video so thank you so much guys hope
you're having a great day and I will see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
