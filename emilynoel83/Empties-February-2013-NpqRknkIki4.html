have a big bag that I have been
accumulating from the bathroom I've also
got a bunch of makeup over here to talk
about as well so this is stuff that I've
completely used done just because this
is being called februari empties doesn't
mean I've used everything in the month I
just ran out of it this month I may have
had it for several months but I think
these are some of the most informative
videos to watch from other people too
because I think by the time you run out
of a product you've really formed an
opinion about whether you like it or not
made one of these already as well i
think it was in december and got some
really good feedback on so there's going
to be a lot of products talked about i'm
going to keep my feedback on them very
short basically you know what I
repurchase them again or why or why not
so I'm gonna start off with like this
stuff that was in the bathroom and body
products type of thing actually this was
sitting on the kitchen sink it is the
black cherry Merlot foaming soap from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I absolutely love this
have several of the little hand
sanitizers in the scent it's so juicy
and deep and sweet I mean I just I love
this smell still sell this somewhere let
me know but I just thought that was a
fantastic so um tresemme trade to
hairspray um level for this is my go-to
hairspray I've talked about it a lot
probably had one of these in my last
empties video this is just my favorite
hairspray for you know finishing a look
I feel like it tends to hold the look
pretty well for me but the same time
doesn't get to crispity crunchity so
wait that is the slogan for butterfinger
I believe crispity crunchity peanut
butter is sensodyne pronamel gentle
whitening this has been the toothpaste
we've been using and I don't have the
strongest teeth ever so this is supposed
to strengthen and harden your enamel so
and if anybody asked me what I do for
whitening this is a whitening toothpaste
and that's all I you have an empty from
Tyler here he loves the olay
pore-minimizing cleanser and scrub as
you can see this is all empty in here on
the product kind of gets pushed up to
the top as you use more
and it sort of swirled with like white
and a light green color and it's got a
little bit of a scrub type texture to it
like it lathers up but you still feel
the scrubbing action I feel like he uses
this up these up really fast this is
like his third one so I don't know if he
just uses too much product or what five
fluid ounces in here but its oil free
and his skin responds well to it and I
don't usually use it because he does go
through it so fast he also used up into
its wet Oh gift up this mango Mandarin
suave shampoo that's just what he uses
and he usually just gets a different
scent every time I've got some mini
products that I just like I would get
these from either like a free gift with
a purchase or they come in some sort of
like QVC beauty test tube or something
and of course I'm bad about just sitting
it aside of waiting to try it I start
using them all at once and then all of a
sudden I'm like uh the showers filled
with mini products I need to start using
these so I made a point to use them up
and so I thought I'd tell you about them
first off we've got the Nick Chavez
plump and thick thickening shampoo I'm
not a huge fan of this I feel like when
i use it i don't know if it leaves some
buildup on my hair but it's very evident
the biggest thing i can always tell
about a shampoo is with my fine hair if
I feel like it's making me oil II too
soon or sooner than normal and this one
I mean I just don't think it performs
that well the ocean damage reverse
restorative conditioner and I do like
this this was an I feel like it's a nice
conditioner for really making your hair
feel soft and silky once it dries but I
don't think it gets me prematurely oily
it doesn't seem heavy I know oh sean is
kind of one of those cult favorite type
brands some people are real into it if
you are if you have product
recommendations from the line let me
know this is something I might consider
buying again I think this came and sort
of a gifted duo but it's the moonlight
path shower gel and the spray this has
the scent kind of of baby powder I would
say that's kind of what i would take the
and I'm not nuts about it clearly I used
it but it's not my favorite so I had a
little spray and I thought it was kind
of nice to use after a shower and when I
use the body wash i would use the spray
but I don't think this is my favorite
bath and body works since so i won't
repurchase that i do however love the
rio rum berry OMG i love this scent so
much this is like fruity juicy i want a
popsicle in this scent i want air this
flavor someone tell me that like this
summer they're coming out with this
scent again couple minis from philosophy
here one is amazing grace I mean that's
a classic philosophy cent I have
repurchased that sent in perfume form
several times for my mom I know she
likes a very feminine soft scent it's
really just one of the biggies of
philosophies whole brand I actually
consider getting this for myself um not
in the shower gel format because it's
such a good scent maybe in like a body
spray or a perfume format same deal with
the love sweet looks hard to describe
since sometimes but this is kind of a
mix of light floral and sweet and as
with a lot of philosophies sense
especially in there grace collection
like it can be hard to exactly put your
finger on what you're smelling but this
is a very lightly sweet scent this is
another one where it's like you know I'd
use it in the shower but if I were to
pay for like a full size I'd probably
just go ahead and do it in some sort of
missed where I could actually smell it
more after the shower if you know what I
like it better than my favorite inner
grace um it's getting there it's getting
close I love inner grace is probably my
favorite from philosophy okay now we've
got some makeup kind of skincare ish
things i love these all almay oil-free
eye makeup remover pads they're really
thin little pads you get like 120 in
this pack and this was a fifty percent
more pack here but it's totally empty I
don't have one to show you but they're
nice for like if you wake up in the
morning you have any sort of residue I
mean you still washed your face tonight
before but there's you
pick up and something's still lingering
it's nice to have those handy to remove
those they're nice to have if you're
doing someone's makeup and maybe they
didn't totally get everything removed
before you start working on them or I
these can also be nice to help you clean
off your false eyelashes which is
something I want to demonstrate for you
in a video any irritation from those
either I also didn't get irritation from
to this this is clinique take the day
off makeup remover for lids lashes and
lips so just a little guy there I don't
know how I got this or why but I've had
for a while and now it's gone and I
would just use this more like with a
q-tip pop it in there how the oily part
of it would separate from the other
liquid that's in there it was that kind
of an eye makeup remover doesn't
necessarily work any better in my eyes
then no pun intended in my eyes but
doesn't work that much better than other
eye makeup removers I've tried two faced
primed and poreless skin smoothing face
primer this has SPF 20 and this is the
bronze tint it's actually worn off I
think it was just called bronze glow or
bronze tint this is a really nice
textured primer I've talked about before
and I have a little bit left I was glad
I was able to talk about this before I
totally ran out so I could show you what
it is here squeezed out a little bit
more this might look a little scary
there but I swear if you have like a
medium skin tone and you put this on it
gives you the effect of like you've sort
of Sun lyst hand a little bit it gives
you like a veil of bronze econ when it
really blends out nicely if you're the
fairest of the fair I think it might not
be a good shade for you but if you're
medium to getting even a little bit
darker or tan um I just think this is
really nice it perks up the skin a
little bit quite as slick as like a
Smashbox photo finish but still I mean
kind of creamy smooth just like the idea
of the tint there so I've got maybe a
couple more uses left but I wanted to
talk about it before it was totally ran
out of a mini sized Urban Decay primer
potion this probably came with a palette
or something I like it it works a lot
like to face shadow and share
friends and if you're looking for
lower-cost options the fergie wet and
wild eyeshadow primer is a good one and
also the NYX HD eyeshadow base I feel
like they're a really similar
consistency to the primer post a few
mascaras to tell you about one is this
mini tart lights camera lashes and this
one didn't seem to have a lot of product
in it to begin with I mean I know it's
small but still you usually have enough
of a sense of what it's like you know
when you sample it and it just didn't
seem very creamy but I do love the brush
on this and this has been a mascara I've
enjoyed in the past nice thick brush I
feel like it defines all your lashes it
doesn't give super length but that's
where this other one from Tarte comes in
that I think is a little bit better on
length and just bigness of your lashes
and it's the tart gifted Amazonian clay
smart mascara it still got that same
kind of rush that I love and we're
talking traditional bristles here not a
rubber bristle brush but this is great
for definition this one I mean I can
feel there's like nothing left inside
we're going through a lot of mascaras
right now so I'm not at a point where I
need to be repurchasing anything but if
we're talking about which one of these i
like better it would be this one and
this would be the one that I would more
lean toward repurchasing also i've got
my covergirl LashBlast clump crusher
this one was great I think this was a
really nice design on the brush I think
it's a little bit smaller just a little
bit easier to maneuver than the regular
lash blast I think the formula is every
bit clump free and non flaking as the
original I just kind of prefer this
brush it's got a ton of little bitty
spikes on it that are kind of short and
as far as a drugstore mascara goes that
you can kind of count on and you know
you don't to worry about smudging
flaking under the eye I think this is a
great stuff my schwing black liquid
liner from the bone i got this when it
was on sale i think on hautelook at one
point in time and it's got kind of a
longer felt tip if you've tried l'oreal
liner intense this is a lot like
that and sometimes I don't know if I got
a bad one but when i tried liner intense
a while back i felt like it wasn't as
rich in black as it could be this one's
really really glad i don't think it's so
different as far as liquid liners are
concerned to repurchase this for the
price so I'm liking like my wet and wild
mega liner and I've got a couple of pins
like pin form liquid liners and I'm
using and finally a couple of lip
glosses I'm sorry to say my backup of
the Jordana lovely lip gloss has bit the
dust this was such a pretty shade and
it's kind of hard to show you see if i
can it's not quite swatching full color
here because there wasn't a lot in there
but there's what it looks like it's been
an Emily Award winner it's a wonderful
neutral that picks up a lot of shine and
I've not been able to find this in
stores again so sadly it's retiring but
a really similar one to this is the
revlon colorburst lip gloss and rose
pearl I have a bare escentuals buxom lip
gloss that I am now out of and it is in
the shade Michelle this looks like it
had a fight with my lash glue I'm not
sure how or when but there is like glue
all over this but there's not really any
product left in here see if i can it's
always some you can get off at your
bread it's a great berry color I part of
the reason why I'm running out of this
is I use that a lot when I did the news
because the Buxton's tend to last a
little bit longer on your lips and this
berry shade just worked for a lot of
situations a lot of outfits i was
wearing so i kept this with me in my
makeup bag on it take to work quite a
bit so i love that color I've got plenty
of berries that are similar I don't know
that this is different enough to
constitute a repurchase but I do love
the shade so there you go guys that's
what's going out with the trash I am
glad to get this stuff off my hands now
and start racking up some other empties
and I do these videos just kind of as
I'm able I can't guarantee that it's
going to be every single month but when
i get stocked up to about that kind of
amount i'll do another video oh I was
also going to ask you if you want to see
products that I've hit pain
then on the reason why I'm kind of torn
on this is because just because I hit
pan it may still be a while before i
actually use it up but at the same time
when you've hit pan I can at least be
able to show you the existing product
and more easily describe it I've got
bronzers and powders that I totally hit
pan on and I formed my opinion on them
but I didn't know if you'd want them
included in this kind of video so let me
know thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
