we're talking about empties and bub I've
been accumulating all the empty stuffing
goin to we got some doubles in that I
could not use all this stuff up myself
so he's been doing a lot of it I've got
a lot of surface area to wash he's six
six y'all so we're just gonna get
started and go through like the big body
shower type stuff first and then I'll go
through like the makeup stuff that I've
gone through did you use up any makeup
past few months
no still holding strong okay we actually
have been using this step up over the
past several months it's been too long
since I've done an empties video and
shout out to Kristen for this awesome
tub that accurately says they've decided
so we know where to put them
this is a body wash Old Spice Old Spice
it's it's my favorite one really but
I've actually been on a kick where I've
just been using up the stuff we've
already got because we have a lid that
we have a lot of things yeah I'm on a
body wash nobody so I finished these two
bad boys off and now I'm just using
whatever we got and that's called dry
skin defense but you didn't like it and
they discontinued it a while ago and
then they brought it back another double
this is full a pore minimizing cleanser
and scrub I actually really like this
quite a bit I don't like the scrubs very
much don't like the graininess but these
these don't bother me I actually like
them and I love the way they come out
it's got a pump and it just kind of
comes all the way so you always finish
it and you never have to worry about
when you get to the end getting extra
product up because it just it's
completely empty in stuff it is oil free
and it's like two shades if you're
looking for this in the store it's like
a light green and a white shade swirled
up through the product I remember I
think Tiffany do you may have
recommended this a long long time ago
and so I picked some up you really
latched onto it and you've gone through
more than this
where's the time that we've been having
the store shower so you love that it's
very good
oh my gosh that has been in our shower
forever that was one of those one of
those body washers that I finished it up
it's actually multi-purpose it's so big
it is a three-in-one shower gel bubble
bath shampoo it was from Ulta banana
cream dream it does smell awesome smells
great I'm not a fan of the consistence
of you know but it feels kind of watery
to me a little watered down little bit
thin I don't know that this is something
we'd rush out to repurchase again plus
it's huge
if you buy something this big it would
be yourself lucky you it's crazy
apologize by the way if you notice any
broccoli on my teeth I just got done
eating broccoli and he just got back
from work we have two things here of the
suave Naturals buds got one he's holding
this is the Sweet Pea and this is the
aloe and water lily this is pretty much
the kind of shampoo he uses yeah convert
his since family size
he's the only one pretty much using it
and he goes through them really quickly
so it's true
look your hair's looking good though
what do you think about these scents I
don't think I've ever had one that I
didn't like the smell of you know what
one was really good I think it's a green
apple that was really good yeah but I
don't I don't have a whole lot of
requirements when it comes to special
haircare true Tyrell toros it is
actually a three in one product you can
use it for your face hair and your body
which I love you did that you use it for
everything I didn't have any problems
with I thought it would be weird on the
face but it seemed to work just fine I
like the smell of it and that would be
so weird for me to put my body wash on
my face because if it's fragrance is
it smell good yeah it smell good but
they want like a heavy fragrance but it
smells good I liked it I'd use it again
I have no idea what it costs I very much
enjoyed it I used it up pretty quick
though that's one thing if you're using
it for everything you're gonna burn
through some of it that's a great point
you want to shower quick that's what you
use another thing we have here is from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it's the pink
sugar plum I think we got this over the
last holiday season and honestly we went
through the majority of this really
quick and then we just had a little bit
left so it was just kind of hanging out
in the shower for a while but actually
Tyler was the one who really latched on
to this I mean this is an awesome scent
it smells pretty good kind of like a
berry mm-hmm a berry scent really nice
and he just loved it and I remember
telling me one day he like popped out of
the shower he's like I really like that
pink sugarplums
even men can use the pink sugar plug but
I had to look for that in the holiday
time again I would repurchase that this
is some Kiehl's face wash got this from
our friend David yeah it was part of a
little kit I don't know if that ever
focused but it's not that big of a deal
it is good smelling mitt menthol II
smell mainly smooth called facial he
feels good as a cooling feel on her face
I liked it I liked it quite a bit I used
it up really fast what's the name of it
um heals facial fuel energizing face
wash and if you want to learn more
actually about another Kiehl's product
that tyler really really likes it's a
moisturizer and it's over on beauty
broadcast express so that was just
posted there I also had a tyonne in that
video and I think was it a blue shirt
also I'm pretty sure no it's what you
mean is why true white shirt blue tie I
think was a lighter blue shirt but I
don't know no you might be right
another shower thing that we had in
there was this Neutrogena ultra gentle
daily cleanser this is a big bottle this
is a 12 ounce bottle a man says
dermatologists developed for sensitive
skin this is another thing that I used
occasionally but you use the most bub so
it comes out like a Jill
and lathered up so what you liked it I
thought it was pretty good you feel like
you've got your face clean and my face
clean had a nice neutral scent to it
which is better okay
this was good we've already talked about
now all the stuff that he had a hand in
you slant and I have to move on and it's
getting dark fast so he's gonna go if
you'll excuse me I'm gonna go you may go
thank you um thanks for your time okay
so I guess I'm flying solo for the rest
of this some other things that have
gotten used up which Tyler
I hope Tyler used some of this because
this is a handsome but that's not what's
on our kitchen sink for a while it's the
berry sangria from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I
absolutely love this kind of soap it's
another one of those things like if you
get frustrated when you're trying to use
stuff up and you can't get all the
product out like these completely get
used up all the way every time and I
continue to repurchase these just in
other sense I think I've currently got
like island margarita out there and I'm
sure I'll get into some fall and winter
scent soon but I love love this kind of
soap I've got it in the kitchen and the
bathroom a couple of sort of tanning
type products that I've gone through one
is the Banana Boat summer color
self-tanning lotion deep dark color and
it says for all skin tones
and this is just basically a sunless
tanning lotion and it's one of my
favorites from the drugstore and yes I
did get a backup of this already so I've
got a full one waiting on me to use it
at being waited so come on in
I got full one in my cabinet waiting to
be used still but can't really squeeze
any more out of here but it's tinted so
you can tell where you're putting it
when you're putting it on your skin and
it's not necessarily like a gradual tan
color builds up fairly quickly and after
you use this a couple times you really
notice that it's there so I like that
one another thing that is absolute holy
grail for me is the Sally Hansen
airbrush legs and it's in the lotion
form oMG this is so great I liked the
airbrush legs even in the canned form
but I was always mixing it with lotion
to thin it out you know and so now
they've come up with something that I
don't have to change a thing about it it
goes on so easily you've got any like
bug bites or shaving nicks or you know
any sort of problem ingrown hairs like
anything that doesn't look quite right
on your legs this just smooths them out
and I love it this shade is tan so tan
definitely does give my legs a little
bit more of a tan look than they have
naturally I also have medium which I
really like and will probably continue
to use through most of the like fall and
winter season but it's just a great
thing to have on you Emily I bagged up
just some more makeup type things that
I've gone through
one is the Almay oil-free these are the
eye makeup remover pads this was a
container of a tea and I like the I
think they're nice for removing any
residue you know but I also like to use
them with my false lashes I'll make like
a little taco out of one of the pads and
put the false lash in there and it
really breaks down any mascara that got
on your false lashes so I did repurchase
some of these but I got them in the I
think it's called soothing and deep
puffing it's a pink container and it's a
new version so I'll have to keep trying
those and let you know how that works
I also went through a little thing of
elf eye makeup remover pads 24 in here
then feel like these were quite as
saturated with remover as these were so
I don't think I'd buy those again stop
the Savino ultra calming daily
moisturizer great for sensitive skin
it's got SPF 15 where I've dealt with
eczema issues on my face this was always
something I could use and not feel like
I was gonna irritate it too much so I
really liked that moisturizer oh I've
got an NYC shear read that just has a
little bit left but it was really just
time to get rid of it you know I needed
a new one I love the shade I did
repurchase it it's a nice deep red I
think it's a great fall color I've
always liked this red and thought it was
really really wearable
yeah this one's just too old and I
needed a different one can you hear
Tyler out there mowing go I think he's
going right past the window a few
mascaras that I've gone through the
Jordanna best lash extreme volumizing
mascara I know a lot of people love this
mascara and I really love the brush
great like short bristles
tightly-packed bristles though I like
the way it packs the product on my
lashes however if you take it just a
little too far this is one mascara that
I find does give me the funky ins have
you ever noticed that like it builds on
itself to a point and then the ends of
the lashes start pointing in all
different directions this is a good
mascara just don't forget to use it in
moderation another mascara that I've
used up is the voluminous false lashes
from L'Oreal and this I remembered being
like kind of a nice brush it's really
really long you know left to right it's
kind of a dry ish formula as well which
builds really nicely on its own and this
coming from the girl who's wearing like
massive false lashes right now but I
thought it looked kind of unnatural like
I didn't love the finished look of the
lashes when I got done with it so this
is not something I'll be rushing out to
buy again I might by the way buy the
best lash extreme again no real average
mascara for me the Revlon Photoready 3d
volume this is a rubber brush and it's
got little bristles at the tip sort of
similar to the concept of like benefits
they're real this just did not build up
much volume or length on my lashes so
either I didn't like that lastly some
nail products I've got several top coats
that I've used up Sally Hansen mega
shine this is my favorite I have
repurchased it but the way this goes on
I feel like it dries super quickly it's
very very shiny the one issue is that I
feel like I go through them pretty
quickly because the product in here will
dry up kind of fast still it's my
favorite it's the best so again that's
Sally Hansen mega shine it's in the
mirrored bottle and the Milani glossy
top coat I liked it it didn't dry near
as quickly as the other ones so not
looking to buy that again I also
this is the out the door I got it from
Sally's this is pretty good I don't know
that it really extends the wear of my
polish quite like the mega shine does
you know when you've got a really solid
topcoat that can affect how well your
nail polish lasts without chipping and I
don't think this was maybe quite as good
in that department and it's not entirely
gone there's just a little bit left but
it's just so thick right now that I
can't really use it anymore I have a
little size at this Essie fill the gap
Ridge smoothing base coat I really
really liked this has been empty in my
collection over there with my nail
polishes for a long time and I just got
to looking at it and I'm like yeah
that's done for I need to get some more
this is a really nice fast drying base
coat and this is reminding me I need to
do my nails right now nail polish that
I've pretty much used up as the Sally
Hansen insta-dry and beige blast so just
kind of an off-white color for your
nails and as I was going through my nail
polish area the other day I realized how
many like neutral really soft kind of
nude or light shades that I have like
this so I won't be buying this one again
nice it wasn't my favorite for like
really long wear on the fingernail I did
really like the Cutler thanks for
watching our empties if you like this
unisex style of empties video let us
know we'll try to do them a little more
frequently we may not have as much stuff
but you know now that I've got this
rocking bin yes and the good news is we
can now throw all of this stuff away yes
for real nice recycling thanks guys for
watching we'll see you next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
