this video a little different kind of
video from the make up stuff now I've
been asked a lot about doing like vlog
style videos or maybe a different
channel for it and I thought well maybe
it'll just be easier if I want to do a
few of those videos to just put them on
this channel and you can see what I do
you can see like maybe I'll take you on
at some point to work with me and you
can see like how I get ready for the
newscast and all that stuff but just
thought I'd kind of record my day and
see how so here's my outfit today I've
got my trench coat on here which is kind
of nice very easy to wear like wearing
you know having the tie around the waist
kind of cinches in the waist a little
bit I've got on some of those legging
jeans and my little boots there that are
I don't know I can't remember where I
think they came from what seal a while
back but they're really cute they're
brown and they have a little fuchal on
them there and I've got my loom little
leopard print bag here that I got from
Macy's a while back it's a Kathy Van
Zeeland bag and it was really on sale
and I really I don't know I just
gravitate towards them I am on my way to
made these today my mission is to get
some of the Lancome Hypnose mascara I'm
sure that won't be a problem because I
feel like they're very eager you know it
makeup counters to sell you stuff and
the reason why is because I have been
really keeping up with my makeup artist
Mario he's on Twitter I think he's
makeup by Mario but he's a makeup artist
for Kim Kardashian and a lot of does a
lot of other celebrities as well and on
his blog he does like this get the look
saying where he'll basically outline
exactly how he does certain makeup looks
and so I thought you know that would be
kind of cool to see exactly how that
works because I've noticed a lot of the
looks he was done where he's used that
kind of acid mascara the lashes have
just been huge and so I thought maybe
I'll experiment and see if I can get the
look like Mario Genson so here we are
navigating the streets of wonderful
Southern Illinois there's a lot of
traffic for some reason this morning I'm
thinking a train came or something this
is something I don't run into much on my
way to work because I what I'm going to
work it's like you know 3:15 in the
morning and there's like nobody on the
streets except sometimes I'll get have
to stop for a train but it's not too
often than I have to do that
so what's Tyler doing this morning he is
doing a little thing from work over at
SIU they're having some kind of a career
fair at the law school and so his firm
that he now works for is I guess talking
to prospective you know potential new
hires or whatever and he's kind of
sitting at the booth I guess and doing
whatever he is really liking his job so
far I've gotten some questions like on
Twitter like you know how to else
Tyler's new job going and he is loving
it
what's really cool is that the firm he
works at is super close to where we live
so he can actually just walk to work
it's pretty neat Walgreens yay it's set
up here on the sign visit the beauty
advisor this afternoon I always thought
I'd like to be a beauty advisor at
Walgreens closer to the mall yeah you
know what I love Saturdays so much I
mean it really just I look forward to
them so much cuz I'm actually on a
normal person schedule
there's Macy's here's my mall in general
that I go to but yeah we're gonna make
amazing stuff here major
unexpected hole just happened there yeah
I got the Hypnose mascara that I was
planning to get and then I was convinced
to get the the lash booster the primer
which I thought might be a good idea I
kind of wanted to try full-sized that
anyway and then it came with this free
gift kind of bag and in it is some lip
gloss and some I'm sorry so skincare
stuff this little bag of tricks here so
I'm pretty excited about that and yay so
you know those chicken salad kits that
come with the Tyson chicken in them and
you like mix in the relish in the Mayo
well I had an experience a few days ago
where the Mayo and in several of these
where the Mayo was like nasty and runny
and I wouldn't even use it and so I mean
I thought well if somebody actually did
eat that even though it looks totally
nasty you know they might get sick and
so I emailed the company and they said
thank you for contacting us they sent me
this letter back I just emailed them
like a week ago so I was kind of
surprised and so they say they're going
to I guess look into it or whatever and
then they sent me these free coupons for
new stuff so that's pretty awesome I was
pretty impressed with that okay so I'm
walking over to Tyler's office
so we can say hi to him wearing my
moccasins which is awesome and this
these windows where the inside of his
office I'm pretty sure I can maybe see
in him through the windows I'm not sure
turns out I was looking into the wrong
window before I just knocked on it
though thanks for letting me in
we were peering in from the outside and
I turns out I was peering into that
little extra room not not your main
office so well here we are
Tyler's firm Liddy work set what's up
give us a little like give the peeps a
tour of your office here that's your old
pub all night you're signed siu
basketball that appears to be us yes
old picture of you in action my horrible
messy desk why is it messy you look like
you have many papers and files I do
these arrange different cases do you
normally get to wear hooded sweatshirts
to work I got Tyler this clock from Big
Lots
it's got like a wood finish I thought it
would look nice and his but when I'm
sitting in one of these chairs and to be
a client
I got my moccasins on as previously
stated on the trip over I think I should
have come in the front just cuz the
front you know just looks a little more
like less coming in the back door we're
coming in the front door of Tyler's
office I would see that tree and I like
this little couch in the waiting area
and that's kind of kind of cool desks
swear Tyler's office used to be when he
was the Lawford's room looks like fun
TV this is like creeper mode creeper so
my camera has ran out of batteries on me
twice while making this video but I am
still going on just going places where I
can plug it in so so this is the pasta
salad Tyler and I are gonna make later
it is bowties with pesto feta and cherry
tomatoes it's really good he's made it
once before I got Tyler this food Food
Network favorites cookbook so that looks
like been asked like what are my
favorite magazines and one that I love
and I get almost every time is the
People StyleWatch
I like it because you get like I like
seeing like celebrity fashion trends and
stuff like that but I feel like with
this magazine you see you also like um
you know beauty related stuff and you
just see that that's like the part of
People magazine that I am most like
interested in which hair color works and
just the clothes and whole fashion site
thing
it's less like gossip magazine ish and
more just like beauty and fashion so I
almost always get the style watch when
it comes out and I like allure because
the lore is like the you know beauty
magazine I when I was first starting out
with makeup I felt like I learned
learned oh hey it's it's underwear I
learned a lot about just you know basic
application tips and product reviews and
things like that I always felt like I
learned a lot out of the lore magazine
so anyway like that one and then lately
I've been getting a lot of hey it's
Jessica Simpson again I've been getting
a lot of ideas for makeup tutorials and
and some hair ideas as well just in my
day to day hair styling and the
sophisticates hair style guide because
they give a lot of like first a ton of
hair ideas but also like product
suggestions like here is Lauren Conrad
and then it suggests like a product and
a styling tool and kind of describes how
to get her look and since so that's kind
of cool also in this particular magazine
it's robin meade robin meat is they had
like news anchors and talked a little
bit about their hair and stuff love
Diane Sawyer but Robin is the best
she's like my news career type
inspiration but um anyway like in terms
of makeup and stuff it seems like like
they all have a particular celebrity I
think this is good girl was on the Real
Housewives of New York I didn't watch
that one quite as much as the OC ones
but with when they profile these
celebrities they have like a little
interview and then they go down and they
talk about like the different beauty
products that use so I always found that
interesting as well but yep those are
the magazines I like so I was talking
about earlier how I went to Macy's to
get the Hypnose mascara from Lancome and
I got that I'm really excited to use it
and as I was saying like makeup by Mario
he I act like that
his name he just always mentions using
this mascara quite a bit so I thought it
would try that out and I could do maybe
some comparisons and see like compare
the results of like what this mascara
gave me compared to the pictures in his
get the look blogs where he says he used
this on particular celebrity men anyway
I got that and then while I was there
the girl that the counter was like
recommending this booster pratt lash
primer basically so that I can try to
wear that along with that mascara and
see if it helps it wear any better but
so since I bought those two things she
was like you qualify for a gift and I
was so excited it came with this bag
which is it's pink and orange and it
came with all this stuff inside so let's
take a look what's in there that little
card I might need to tell me what all it
is but there is a skincare product and
like a moisturizer and some kind of
serum I think really need to educate
myself on some of these products I think
this is an eye makeup remover and then
there are two juicy tubes smoothies
which I have one of these little guys
and I like it a lot
so these colors are tickled pink and
Fifth Avenue
frosting that looks good and then
another mini mascara which I have a
little one of this so already I wasn't
too nuts about that but the bags cute
and I just thought wow you know wasn't
really expecting to get a whole lot of
Macy's today but I guess that's the way
it worked out well I went to Sally's and
I got these little spatula things and I
was thinking you know that any time I've
seen these I thought well that's more of
a like makeup artist type tool but then
I was using this primer in one of the
new primers from L'Oreal is the studio
secrets magic perfecting face primer or
something like that and the
fish if I have nails like these are
super torque nails I mean these are not
long but when I get in there I always
end up like scooping out some of the
product in my nail I hate that so I got
these little spatulas I thought I could
use them in like products where there
was a little tub and I needed to get
something out and sometimes those tubs
just aren't shallow enough to get the
product I guess with these videos I just
kind of want to get a feel for what you
guys want to see you like um you know
I'm just kind of taping random stuff and
putting it together and if that's what
you like that's cool but I was thinking
you know maybe I'll do some of these
like sort of a work related thing like I
could go to the news station and maybe
show you some behind the scenes there
and just everyday stuff and you know
less makeup focus but maybe there is
still some makeup stuff in there because
that's what I like so much so I hope you
guys enjoyed this hope you guys enjoyed
getting to see Tyler again and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
