our new house we have been doing some
painting and making a few little changes
here and there and I just wanted to give
you a quick update before we get totally
moved in and get everything situated and
that way it'll kind of be like a before
and after sort of thing when I do
another video updating you once we've
gotten everything in here so I'm just
wanted to show you around a few of the
different rooms and see what we before
this is our entryway and what we've done
here so far is basically we took a shade
of it was a greenish paint that this
whole area was and we changed it to a
really really pale yellow we actually
painted it at first a slightly brighter
shade of yellow which you know I kind of
still liked but it was just I don't know
I couldn't quite didn't think I was
really going to get used to it it was
just a little bit bright so this is a
little bit softer and I think it's gonna
work since this area is so open as you
can see to the rest of the house I think
this is going to be more of a neutral
tone that's going to work with a lot of
other things so we've got a couple of
closets on each side once you walk in
and as you can see there's leaves a
little open archways to other parts of
the house so this side over here takes
you right into the dining room and so
what we've done here is think of this a
deeper red shade which Tyler and I
really love um it's it's called red
sangria and so just a gorgeous shade of
red paint there I'm actually joining you
from the future home of beauty broadcast
as you can see the walls are pink
there's lots of white and pink going on
in this room right now that's about it
because there's still the painting clogs
down on the floor this weekend
it'll be Memorial Day weekend is when we
are actually moving everything into this
house and we will be permanently in here
for good so
this will become my make up room
basically I've got an l-shaped desk that
I'm gonna put in here and I've got quite
a few different plans for it so I'm so
excited to show it to you once it all
comes together but for now I just kind
of wanted to give you a taste of what's
going on where I will be doing my videos
in the future I think it's gonna be
really good for my videos in terms of
lighting and just I just think the whole
setup is gonna be great I'm really
excited for it but this does kind of put
me off a little bit in terms of doing
videos and especially doing tutorials um
I definitely haven't lately been able to
do as many videos as I typically like to
do and tutorials it's been really hard
to find the time to just sit down and
put those together so just to let you
know there are still two more tutorial
videos on the way for my other two
contest winners so those are still to
come one will be sort of a school look
and the other will be a bridal look and
I've still got a couple videos to do in
my series on of different eye colors and
I've gotten so many requests that I've
seen I know I haven't been as active on
my facebook page and on YouTube as I
would like to be but I just wanted to
let you know that I'm really excited for
this room which will be the new home of
beauty broadcast so thank you so much
for tuning in for this quick update and
keep checking back in thanks a lot guys
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
