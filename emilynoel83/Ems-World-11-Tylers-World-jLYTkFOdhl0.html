joining us for this m's world video it's
been a long time since I've done one of
these and there's actually been a lot
going on do you think I'm still we're
still holding off on doing a full tour
of the new house because we're waiting
to get all our living room stuff in so
that may take a couple more weeks still
but as for today we're gonna do a little
shopping pick up a few things
Tyler has an iPad now I do so maybe
he'll tell us about that in this video
and I'm also going to quiz Tyler about
makeup related things to see how much he
knew and I think it's going to be pretty
funny because I did ask you you know I
asked him the other day like just I
don't know why I was like what is this
Tyler and he just had no clue so anyway
I guess we'll just see what else the day
holds but thanks for joining us and
we'll see in a bit anyways but you're
sitting on my arms
Tyler is carrying in the barstools we
have two more bar stools that he will
get to construct later and perhaps if
I'm taping that he will act a little
less frustrated then maybe have to pull
out a few words I know
last time it was got a little
frustrating but I've got some questions
about these sunglasses that I have on
right now um they're really nothing
special or expensive I got them from
Kohl's and I don't even know try to see
if I can even find a brand name on these
I don't even know what exactly the brand
is but I got him at Kohl's
I don't know maybe a month or two ago
and they were really cheap they were
maybe not much over $10 so yeah no fancy
designer sunglasses there Tyler what's
she doing oh just finishing up putting
the dryer cord and apparently they don't
send those along with the dryer yeah we
got our new washer and dryer Tyler's in
our little laundry room area here is it
hard to do no struggling of course did
you get the right that's quite handy
Hey light came on in there
what kind of Wyatt washer and dryer do
we have here is there Whirlpool Duet
they're like the energy-efficient is in
there this door so the other day I
randomly asked Tyler I was using
something I was like you know what this
is and he drew a blank I think and so I
thought wouldn't it be fun to do a video
where i quiz Tyler on some makeup
products we see how much little
knowledge just from you know I'm just
kind of being in the other room or
hearing me to a tutorial or anything
because I we really don't I mean we
don't say you're talking about makeup
all the time
from that we'll see what he what he
knows so first off how about these what
do you think these are brush covers
brush covers do you know what they're
called the brush guard that was I'm
impressed I didn't think you'd know that
how did you know that what kind of brush
is this a fan fan brush very good do you
know what it's used for I'm gonna take a
shot in dark and say contouring mmm I'm
highlighting is what I would is that's
what I would use it for just to really
lightly apply something or to sweep off
like little pieces into a make up sort
of falling it you're doing good
what kind of brush is this okay so now
this one I probably shouldn't it's okay
stippling brush yes used with what would
you stick along foundation yes what kind
of brush is this kabuki brush absolutely
right how about this I'll cover up what
it actually is what do you think that's
used for yes it's a glue for your false
eyelashes yeah you're right it is it is
eyelash glue so far you've gotten
everything right I must have made this
too easy what is this what is that
product when I guess I have no idea I
don't know that's a cream blush
free blush dream mousse blush what kind
of AI would you use to do these with
these colors what kind of AI do these
colors create and I saw the back of it
that is that is a smokey eye palette
from NYX what is this this product here
bronzer and highlight yes
that's from Physicians Formula and that
is a shimmer strips it's a bronzer and
highlighter in one in conclusion Tyler
knows quite a bit about makeup
apparently picked it all up secondhand I
guess cuz I don't but that's the way
Tyler in school I mean you you just kind
of learned by listening you didn't
really have to necessarily study things
real hard you just kind of picked it up
over time I've done a lot of talking
about these things so I guess that makes
sense a big part of your life it's how
do you like how you like in the makeup
room
it's very bright sharp you like it I'm
sort of nice I tweeted about the bench
this is this cute little zebra print and
Finch we got at this store called
weekends only it's a close-up kind of
furniture place yes and you put it
together assemble it it's cute you want
to sit over there show that how sturdy
and big it is Oh lovely Tyler thank you
for getting in your manly pose now it is
really really hot outside today
Tyler is out on our deck he is
installing
some lights it will go out there I think
he's trying to get those up but yeah
it's really toasty outside we'll see how
he's doing
hi my friend the cameras this is Ames
world is pretty much all about you
awesome dude maybe the pressure was on
and okay I could do it hey guys we were
just watching a show about the best hot
dogs in the country and guess what that
inspired us to do yeah we got not not so
good I got a chicago-style hot dog from
this local place that we've never been
to before and Tyler you got a jumbo
chili cheese dog they were awesome
yeah and still smell like chili
oh my anyway we're sitting here now and
I had mentioned at the beginning of this
video that Tyler has an iPad now yes
it's really cool so I thought I would
there it is
tell us the basics about it first I like
what size is it what are the
capabilities and stuff but the size of a
piece of paper basically like a standard
piece of paper really fan okay pretty
light very small in the keyboard it's
just a screen and the keyboard pops up
if you need it you think it's living up
to the hype of the iPad it's greatness
yeah so far I've liked it a lot I really
haven't found a whole lot that I don't
like about it mm-hmm really fun I've
never had a Mac before either so it's
kind of a first experience with that and
this new little yeah device this is kind
of like your home screen and you can
turn that on
on and off with the push of a button and
you have to like login with the password
and stuff that's because you don't have
to do that that's because the work email
is on here oh okay here you've got like
different icons and these are like your
apps and stuff so you can go to youtube
this screen right here is what comes on
I think must be on every one so it's got
your calendar email photos iPod and
there's iTunes Store that took me a
little bit to figure out where's my
music that's on that iPod
can you go YouTube you can or you can I
sorry I'm running out of space on my
memory card right hilarious video if
you've ever seen it BP spills coffee
how's it going well you previously did
two of these right and you had a couple
of kind of tough moments with those two
right yeah I'm about to get to the
toughest part what is the toughest part
this is a completed stool right here so
these are really nice they're tall we
used to have his some schools that are
like counter height stools in our last
apartment which worked there but here we
have a legitimate I guess bar height so
we had to get bar heights tools and they
swivel and they've got a nice amount of
space to sit on there so we will have
four of these surrounding the bar by the
way this is the shirt I got from Kohl's
today it's from Kandi's and it was on
sale as kind of like a little animal
print thing going on there so yeah
should be the easy part you have like a
halo of light coming around you need to
give Ellen an inch back after Oh feel
like you're at a bar we're gonna sign
off for now guys I think Tyler's did
enough work for one day on a Saturday
nice little Saturday night high school
thank you well thank you for tuning in
and we hope you'll join us again for
more M's world videos and more videos on
beauty broadcast good night have a great
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
