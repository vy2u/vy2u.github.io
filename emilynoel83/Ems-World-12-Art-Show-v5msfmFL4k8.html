I'm headed up to my sister's about three
hours away from where I am now she is my
sister Kelly aka pup that's my nickname
for that I've had ever since a really
long time ago but anyway she is in an
art show so I'm taking the next day off
from work to go check that out tonight
so Tyler can't come with me he has to
work tomorrow so I am just gonna make a
road trip out of it it's a several hour
drive but I'll check in with you through
uh throughout you know along the way and
I will show you some of the action once
I get to the Art Show alright guys just
stuffed up for a sugar-free Red Bull
because I've been up for a while today
and I'm feeling a little bit tired I am
at like the busiest gas station ever
there's so many you can't really tell
from this shot that there were cars that
every bump when I got here and there are
a ton of pumps and they're a bunch of
cars like hard fear there's something
dolls nearby and it's just crazy but
yeah got myself my Red Bull my egg salad
sandwich and I am ready to get back home
driving now we are actually on our way
to her art show I am riding with dad
there and mom and that car ahead of us
is pup and her husband Jeff
in my lap I am holding one of pups
signature snack items that she has made
for the Art Show which are her cheese
balls that come off looking kind of like
pine cones they really need it's like a
littles in this year remember what's in
this like I like a cream cheese base
there's some bacon in there some herbs
and spices and stuff it's very tasty and
you can eat it just with these almonds
or you can use a cracker or something
but they're very cute they come off
looking like big pine cones you can
check pups blog if you want to see that
recipe if she has a lot of different
recipes on her blog but mom how was the
trip over for you guys
nice air-conditioned car maybe the ice
is very steamy yes see the outside
stop up ahead she's followed by her
entourage for the evening
looking like a movie star
you're looking like a movie stuff I'm
just in my rocker
what are you toting but I've got some
sugar cookies that I have decorated and
a little things
so there's pup mom Jeff and dad
you should self and your people
so this is the art show cut this part up
here you can see through the window
there's one of her some awesome works of
art
several other artists are involved in
the show
we'll take a closer look
this is her muscles
just amazing and you can check out Kelly
Adams and calm
for more on these
well it's going to come off on the
camera
they are gorgeous watercolor
and I'm done abstract watercolors
realistic
portraits the stuff taken
portraits are just really so we have a
lovely little refreshment table appears
and then these are cups amazingly
decorated sugar cookie she's got
strawberries
watermelon ooh
it's certain along
so
competition
by the other artists
it's really cool too you can check out
the different pictures and the
explanation there behind everything
recently
glare
I remember when you were working on this
you were actually doing this at our mom
and dads but you altered the background
to make it probably even more difficult
than it was originally right
culmination in my apartment
in the kitchen
I love that it's you working on a
painting so therefore you had to
recreate the painting here we're beyond
we have it's so real - because
would always like to sit there near you
while you fainted and I remember a time
when I believed but step right on your
payday she stepped in like an area like
this that one
she worked her way over to a little
place where she wasn't with that the
angriest you've ever been at fun or what
how did you react and how did you handle
this kind of gas she stepped in a good
spot and she stuck with new colors if we
go downstairs and look at it you will
see that pop friend is still in there
kind of disguise it a little bit but
still in there so it's our little
collaborative just a minute here
Oh cat quick Christmas
open if he hadn't told me to look
everybody can make it to
champaign-urbana
or Illinois to see an art show but I'm
sure there's something going on in your
town or where you live so check it out
and see what you can learn about art but
the artists where you live I think
there's an interesting story behind
everything is like there isn't news when
you're talking to a person retired
person about painting that you learned
something new about themselves these are
my deep thoughts say the people don't
think they have absolutely no talent in
the world
