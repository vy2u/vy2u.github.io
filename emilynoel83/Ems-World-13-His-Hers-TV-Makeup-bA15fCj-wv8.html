routine when you come to the station
first of all it's 503 and normally what
I do is first I have to straighten my
hair with a really really hot iron so
naturally curly hair huh and then I use
bare minerals on my face cool it done
only takes me a few minutes to do I'm
getting pretty good at it usually you're
not here this early though no normally I
come in about 2:00 in the afternoon but
you've got a lot of things in your
makeup bag I do have some fun things
actually I'm leave you've encouraged me
to get some of this stuff yes but yeah I
still have a lot of Avon stuff mm-hmm I
gave a nice product so it's pretty safe
awesome so this is our makeup area here
that we have it's a smallish counter
with a thing that simulates what the
lighting is like when you go out on the
set Ross have you done your makeup yet
not yeah got to cut one more vo
and I'll be ready to go what am i
technique I've learned from Emily and
I'm really sorry if I messed up oh you
won't Maybelline unstoppable eyeliner
and it's been so dark around that
exactly because because I don't wanna go
black since my hair is so light sighs
great we're done from this is that fun
mascara with a really fun one that it's
very maneuverable yes yes
it's the telescopic guy I abused too
much over what are you doing around I am
putting on the makeup that Emily
provides for me you're pretty not again
what Brandis I have no idea
it's Rimmel it is it's called stay matte
and it takes away a meanness yes because
I have a shininess problem you also you
have a slight little I'm from the races
in st. Louis last weekend yeah
now doesn't Kruger use covergirl great I
do have Gregor on one of my videos I
think saying he uses covergirl um you
know
are you guys going to be using cable out
there yes I think we will be using the
table well that can't be fun um do you
want like that has the background or do
you want it yeah this time I'd say I'd
say somewhere where it can be seen on
camera in all right am I pretty enough
yes I'm pretty for TV it's so sad how
quickly guys can get away with doing
that okay so what the Katie do now I've
moved on to novels I am working from a
Lancome palette for neutral colors there
exactly and it does well with my skin
tone and then I'm an accent the corners
really well with the door
is one of my favorite products actually
bought it in high school so I'm saying I
bought this in 2003-2004 and there are
still plenty of it it's a great
investment but I use it on my cheeks so
I've already put some on my cheeks and
also going to use a teeny tiny touch of
it whatsoever lid oh I wish I could tell
but um you can't see it it's worn off
hey you know they're made they're made
this be somebody who sees this and is
able to recognize it but it's oh it's
kind of shimmery kind of bronzy looking
yeah I guess it's a bronze and it's
fabulous it's a magnet exam any tiny bit
because it's so highly concentrated this
is part of Kevin's morning routine
he has covergirl as we recently talked
about and some concealer
do you have time to pull a couple of
quick images off of Google of like
toothpaste and what not I thought we had
toothpaste video but I guess we don't
know I'm using my favorite lip close if
I beta
it's called cashmere Brown it's looks
nice and I'll blend it with a couple
other things I'm kind of obsessed with
blaring lip gloss on top of my lipstick
primer makes it shiny exactly so I have
like my Avon pink called darling keen
eyes kind of like the sunshine
kevin has some Almay under-eye concealer
today got pressure
hopefully Kevin doesn't care that I'm
doing that's like you know exactly I
don't do this right I look like a clown
no you're doing it fine yeah thanks
all you have to do is blend it in and
you can do that you're pretty much good
personally for me I'm gonna wear
probably less than I wear right now
because it's going to be yeah it's like
I when I retreated Robyn me then she
tweeted me back and said we do the same
makeup we do airbrush but we do less
than we did before we got smooth skin
you're probably going to like Kevin and
Katie I mean you're probably not gonna
have an issue with that okay so I just
sort of refreshed my make up a little
bit and now we're gonna get ready for
the show
