great weekend this weekend my mom and
dad came down for a visit and my mom
helped me out with my hair gave me a
little bit of a a color and cut the
color is actually a semi-permanent hair
color from Clairol natural instincts the
shade is ebony mocha it's at like black
Brown basically it's very very dark
brown and that's kind of the way my hair
naturally is but over the summer it gets
lightened up and that's not necessarily
the way I want it so I got some layers
kind of put back in my hair but the
length overall is about the same but mom
did that for me and then I help Mom out
with her makeup get my camera flipped
around here so mom how you doing fine
yeah I'm always quite a wizard with the
makeup oh really she's never done this
for me before we talk about makeup and
maybe we'll be shopping and show you
know give me hints on things I should
get and I've done that but she actually
did my makeup today and with the way mom
did her like normal face like foundation
routine but I did her eyes and good job
really and I appreciated it and now I'll
have a few new we're going we're going
out now to buy a few things that I might
need to mom's gonna do a haul but
there's this liner that mom's trying out
here it's from Physicians Formula and
it's called the let's see there's the
name the eye definer felt-tip eye marker
and I have it this is actually mine in
black that she's holding but I went
ahead and today you wouldn't be able to
tell but I used a dark brown shade on
her and it really worked well it goes on
super easy and we tested the staying
power last night and we thought it was
pretty good I mean I think it was on for
probably I don't know four or five hours
maybe at that point but we'll see how
well this gets through the day and mom
will recap this for us give us a little
review on it I have a lot of Physicians
Formula stuff that I'm going to be
trying and telling you about but this is
one thing that I think people really
want their eye
to stay throughout the day so I think
it's a critical thing we will check back
in late we are back home and mom is
going to show us her hull what she got
was she only picked needed a couple of
things because I gave her a few things
that I recommend that I had on hand so
first off we've got tell us what this is
mom this is the shade it's called sun
kissed and it's the covergirl outlast
why do you like this stuff simply
because at my age and I think even
younger you start getting a feathering
around your lips that little lines
lipstick and run into this won't do that
of course you just put that on it dries
for a few a minute or so and then you've
been on the top coat and really you know
can take you most of the day okay that's
good and that was I was looking for a
different shade it's your caution to
people would be that the color isn't
always as it necessarily appears and
then Walgreens tended to have a better
selection or selection than say a
Walmart although they were a little more
expensive and we also like the mom has
on right now l'oreal infallible in
amethyst that's what's on our lips right
now so it's a little bit it's kind of
like a neutral but it's got a little bit
of red in it I like it hmmm okay what
else
okay this is the wet and wild color icon
palette in vanity this is actually the
only one in the six color collection
that I don't have but the neat thing
about this is you know you're getting
some matte colors and this you have
three matte colors and three colors with
shimmer we're interested mainly in the
matte shades and we want like we did a
look with mom today
where we did this like a light color all
over her lid sort of one of the these
medium colors in the crease and then
just a little bit on the outer part of
the lid not a big outer V or anything
dramatic but we just deepened it mom if
you kind of look at that look down
we just deepen too
a little bit in the perfect in the outer
part of the eyelid just with that
slightly darker color creates a little
more definition a little more contrast
with the light shade I use the B
luscious eye and lip primer also on our
lids and it appears that the products
are holding up really well on top of
that so wearing a little better the
liner is still wearing nicely as well as
until she's got some really long wearing
stuff and hopefully we turn out to like
that eyes shadow as well now in the
makeup room where mom and I have been
enjoying different products that I've
been using on her and stuff like that
also this book mom if you open that up
and just kind of flip through it a
little bit for us so we can see some of
these pictures I mentioned this book in
a previous video it's called Bobby Brown
living beauty there's lots of before and
after pictures here's yeah this is a
great example of all of the different
you know like kind of makeover she's
done on just everyday people of
different ages and I told mom that if
she wanted to learn you know any new
tricks I think this book is a pretty
valuable resource just highlighting you
know different skin problems and how to
overcome them with makeup products and
in different kinds of skincare so yeah
so mom's gonna check that out of my
little library over there and I also
sent a few of my favorite type products
her way one of them is the Milani
minerals blush the shade is called my
tie and I've raved about this blush a
lot I've used mine up almost oh it's
nothing there's hardly any left and I
had this extra one and I thought mom
would like it because she is into the
peachy pink tone blushes why do you
think blush is so important for people
to wear because you always say like you
would never go without it right I've
always worn it since I was a teenager I
always felt like when I couldn't
and just kind of made your eyes light up
a little bit you just looked a little
healthier little happier yeah I don't
know it just it just seems wrong without
I've never probably ever done without it
and it's just kind of one of those
things and I am kind of a cheap person
and then also talking about long wearing
stuff we mentioned this eyeliner before
the it's a felt tip um oops
what I'm using today on her is the dark
brown and so we're gonna continue to
keep an eye on this to see how it wears
through a full day but so far half the
day it's doing well but it has
specifically that really nice point yes
is really better than any of the brushes
that I've been using and it's very easy
to control too and then what I also have
here is this is from covergirl and this
is the outlast lip stain this particular
shade is for 15 and mom feel uncap that
it's looks like a magic marker basically
but that is going to provide I've talked
about this before and I've used it in
different videos but it just provides
that tint to your lips that will really
last a long time you won't even feel it
feels you know like nothing but for
mom's issue she doesn't want it
feathering outside the lip line and so I
think that this will be something she
should try and tell us you know if that
works for her mm-hmm one more thing that
we forgot to talk about here this is
from Mac I have a large size of the mac
fix+ but I also had on hand this travel
size of the charged water and I think
they both work in a similar way at least
from what I've been told you know this
these are the kind of things you can
kind of mist on your face when you get
done with your makeup if you feel like
anything looks at all chalky or too
powdery or not quite as radiant as you
might like you can kind of spritz it I
sort of like to spritz it up straight in
the air and kind of let it fall on your
face so you don't get too much on you
but mom has known about that technique
well it was just for water just spray
with water you can and this is probably
better
it smells new smells nice smells better
all right welcome back everyone we are
now it's it's bad and Tyler and mom and
me and we are on our way to this special
little Lodge where they have a really
great restaurant and we are southern
Illinois is actually in the heart of the
Shawnee National Forest and a portion of
that forest is giant citynet giant City
National Park drive City State Park
State Park I believe anyway it's a
portion of the forest and there's this
little lookout tower you can go to get a
great view of the area and we're going
to go do that but first
Tyler is here and Tyler went golfing
today with dad
so what can you tell me about the day's
game I played pretty well got my first
birdie

giant city lodge we're on my way there
the camera ran out of battery so now

watching some Cardinals baseball on TV
and recovering from our big meal what
was your favorite
describe the meal for us dead like mom
used to make it hit in the farm fried
chicken mashed potatoes and gravy green
beans those dumplings corn sweet it was
awesome time for another assessment on
how long your makeup wore I can see your
lipstick is still on and your eyeliner

quite well for you and please and so I
think you're gonna enjoy that and how
easy it is to be Taylor hello
