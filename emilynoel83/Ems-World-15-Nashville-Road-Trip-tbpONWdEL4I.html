for this m's world video we're kind of
going back in time with this one because
i now am home after my weekend in
Nashville but I did take my camera and I
took my digital camera and I also took a
lot of pictures that I twittered as we
were out having a great time I went with
Tyler and we met up with one of my best
friends Caitlin and she is now working
in Alabama if you are in the Birmingham
area you may be familiar with her on TV
because she is a meteorologist and so it
was just great to see her again we used
to work at the same station and we did a
great vehicle one of my favorite videos
actually was what some Kaylee's makeup
bag she is just so much fun and she's
been to Nashville several times but this
was tight me and Tyler it was our first
time going so we got to go around and
see a lot of fun things I also got to
the hotel and we're playing around with
our little uh Sleep Number bed what's
the noise your bed is making ready I
feel like you're preparing for takeoff
yeah 100 that means it was almost can we
make the number change it is again
softer or harder I'm gonna go down
because I went to a softer it doesn't
make any noise mmm the number going to
hi everybody what you're doing well
that's 60 right now in front of yours it
hasn't made noises yet something is
arriving I'm trying to buy cowboy boots
but they're all like 300 bucks hey you
really weren't gonna buy them I think
even if they were like 50 bucks I don't
think you probably feel like that
comfortable Plus here what you're
wearing cargo shorts
I mean superhot a doer cargo cargo pods
Tyler got some hair gel because he's
such a diva and has to have this certain
Jill this is kind of a lame TV in here
they need to update Oh Ross that's
relaxing they'll put you to so Bama wait
you you're doing it yeah I feel like
these Sleep Number beds gonna get got
more squishy
I didn't say Sleep Number beds need to
have like a massage situation with them
and maybe a heating pad I know this is
not oh yeah like the like the so after
our afternoon in Nashville after we got
over the fact that we could adjust the
settings on our beds we took a matter
and then we got ready to go out again I
did Kaylee's makeup even though she has
I mean eyes she's like the makeup guru
at her TV station now I guess everybody
is really impressed by her makeup skills
I think that's awesome I love that
because we worked a lot together with
her makeup and just buying it and going
to the drugstore together so it's really
cool to hear that she's taken off with
any wasn't happened here today we're in
a serious place we did a lot of makeup
and a lot of hair mm-hmm
kayla has a lovely is sporting a lovely
smoky eye go um she did her her lovely
face makeup and then I went in with the
Urban Decay Naked palette and gave her
this very seductive smoky look and it
turned out really well I think no I
think it's awesome I love it always love
it when Emily does my makeup Hey
I enjoy country music so it was really
neat to just get to hear all of these
up-and-coming artists that were trying
to get their names out there and just
singing in all these different bars up
and down Broadway
and
a fun weekend I wish it could have
lasted so much longer I really missed
Kaylee now since we're both back home
but if I do something like this again I
will definitely bring the camera again
so you guys can see Kaylee and our fun
antics together but I hope you all have
a great week and I will keep more of
these ends or videos coming up in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
