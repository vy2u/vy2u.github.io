road trip mumu mylar is here he's
driving at the moment I am proud we did
some eating you just fill my order
Tyler reveals his cure for hiccups what
do I do
just blow out all the air out of your
lungs we talk about some misconceptions
from the husband tag video we did some
might call him with strong silent type
but he's really not silent especially I
did an impromptu eye tutorial on another
Emily what are your makeup he goes yes
and we all just had a really fun time
all right guys it's time for another ins
world video thank you so much for tuning
in for this I have a lot of fun with
these videos in case you can't tell but
it was really fun this past weekend
Tyler and I went up to visit Tyler's
sisters the twins there are a couple of
Tyler's younger sisters and we it was
family weekend where they go to school
so we were able to go up there are on
our way to go see the twins we went last
year I remember tweeting pictures from
our night out you meet somebody in the
bathroom that was yes I did I was we
were at this you know the hot the
college hot spot we'll call it out
remember the exact name but anyway we
were there and I was in the bathroom and
I saw this girl I was washing my hands
and she's like you have the YouTube
channel or something and I was like yeah
ah the pores we had me and Tyler had to
get on the road and we stopped for some
food along the way thank you
backyard burger get some backyard
boogers you just fill my order no I
didn't feel the whole thing and besides
I was a film doesn't exist in new
cameras he stays
we're shooting shooting video
if you sing it's definitely going under
how's the backyard burger we had a
national train chain chain I'm not sure
I guess we'll have to ask the commenters
have you guys ever heard of a backyard
they're good it more of a dramatic smoky
eye tonight I keep hiccuping this is
something that I think is the first time
it's ever happened to me when I've been
on the spot on camera and this goes for
like when I've been doing videos here
like for beauty broadcast or when I've
been like doing the news at work but I
don't think I've ever gotten the hiccups
while I was shooting video of anything
if I have told my breath and you have to
handle all the talking oh we love the
Sun
I did very well all they've ever known
only as you exhale no you're not allowed
to inhale okay why do I do
just blow out all the air out of your
lungs Oh
very intense but it works
just hold it hold it hold it until you
feel like you can't take it anymore and
then you blow out wherever you feel like
you're gonna suffocate
just basically carry it to the point
where you can't go any longer
once you let yourself breathing in your
hand moving on
just browning
very sad look on her face right now blow
it out
don't bring that don't cheat on Eugene
someday I'm gonna do this
come back and then you have to do it
again I didn't feel like I was gonna
suffocate
so we'll see how long it takes before i
hiccup again huh
I feel good I feel free of it you know
you can kind of tell I don't know maybe
it's kind of a mental thing but like I
feel like I'm definitely not that's what
I did to get rid of my hiccups check
with your doctor before trying this
method we're talking about the husband
tag that he did and that was where Tyler
went through and he answered a ton of
questions about kind of like our
relationship and just some random like
fun things and thinking about how the
comments were we we decided that there
were a few misconceptions about him I
think there might have been a few like
for it set for example I noticed someone
said well clearly Emily wears the pants
in this relationship because she talked
so much here's a here's a deep
discussion question for everyone
just because you talk a lot does that
really mean you wear the pants I don't
think so I think thinking a lot of
things could mean you're insecure
it could mean you'd be unsure of your
status I mean we were totally being
ourselves and being completely natural
during that video as like anybody who
like my mom was able to recognize or
anybody else who watched that video that
really knows us so I mean if we were
kind of be doing it the other way around
we wouldn't have really probably been
ourselves in that video you know what I
mean and probably one of my highlights
of the past week was the Britney Spears
episode of Glee
I thought personally I liked it a lot
but here's what Tyler and I had to say
about that I loved the I the only thing
that I kind of wish there was more of
was more group renditions with the whole
cast you know what I mean I was a weak
person but that was where it was lacking
I thought because I like seeing you know
like the entire group perform stuff I
love toxic so much more than any of the
other numbers and I think part of the
reason why a I really liked that song
and I choreographed a routine to
cheerleading tryouts back in college for
that song so it I'm kind of a mystery
but also
I just thought that
it was just more interesting to watch
with the whole entire cast and
Schuster's voice on that son he was he
was killing Fergus beautiful so we
finally made it all the way up to the
twins house and we had a really good
time watching your couple of 30 yeah but
I only got like 10 minutes for the
students implement and Gabby's this
watch it was really long well she was
watching TV and I just know I have to
give this special shout out to Emily
what are your makeup it candy goes yes
has been watching my videos which i
think is so cool and she also has a
little issue of her own with her eyes
and we were able to give her a little
tutorial on the spot this is Emily and
what we're doing is trying to kind of
create a crease with her with your
eyelids so what I've done is I took if
you look down I put a light shade all
over her eye
and I put it a little bit under eyebrow
and then I am going in with like a
really dark shade like it really dark
gray or a black or something and if she
looks down you can kind of see where I
went with this I went right along the
lash line on the outer part and then I
went right up here now you can see she
doesn't really have a crease right there
but what I'm doing is putting a darker
shade there and when you put a dark
shade somewhere
it makes things recede it makes it go
back in basically so that's why we put a
dark shade right there where a crease
might be that's basically what you get
and you get more dimension you make this
whole area look like you know there's a
little more going on and you can do that
with colors you could take a plum color
or a green or navy blue or anything
that's basically a little bit darker and
you can get these products from the
drugstore and I'll put like a little
list below this video
you just need to have a couple of
brushes that are actually really cheap
these brushes I got from I actually have
a couple that are like this smallish
size they come together they're
available at CVS and the brand is called
essence of beauty and these are called
freeze brushes so that's basically what
we did and they're really easy because
they're so small like if you have a
giant brush and you're trying to go in
and do all these things it would be
really hard but because this is a small
brush I'm able to put the product
exactly where you can use a pencil or
use a brush like this that's angled and
just put that in your darkest shadow and
then I went right over here and I just
under along all in all we had an amazing
weekend it was definitely wish we could
have spent more time there but we just
had a fun time me and Tyler and getting
to see Tyler's family and just having
fun on our little road trip on family
weekend so thanks so much for tuning in
for The Sims work video guys I hope you
have an awesome day and a great rest of
the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
