road trip woman hilar is here he's
driving at the moment I am driving we
did some eating you just fill my order
Tyler reveals his cure for hiccups what
do I do he's blow out all the air out of
your lungs we talked about some
misconceptions from the husband tag
video we did some might call him the
strong silent type but he's really not
silent especially when you need to know
it's wrong I did an impromptu I tutorial
on another Emily what are your makeup it
can he goes yes I was a very big and we
all just had a really fun time alright
guys time for another ends world video
thank you so much for tuning in for this
I have a lot of fun with these videos in
case you can't tell but it was really
fun this past weekend Tyler and I went
up to visit Tyler sisters the twins
there are a couple of Tyler's younger
sisters and we it was family weekend
where they go to school so we were able
to go up they are on our way to go see
the twins we went last year I remember
tweeting pictures from our night out did
you meet somebody in the bathroom that
was that is yes I did I was um we were
at this you know the hot the college hot
spot will call it out remember the exact
name but anyway we were there and I was
in the bathroom and I saw this girl i
was watching my hands and she's like you
had the youtube channel or something and
I was like yeah south of Porsche we hit
me and Tyler had to get on the road and
we stopped for some food along the way
thank you we're at backyard burger get
some back yelled bogus you just fill my
order no I didn't feel the whole thing
and besides I was a film doesn't exist
in new cameras he stays we're shooting
shooting video
hi if you sing it's definitely going on
how's the backyard burger we had good
looking for a national train chain chain
um I'm not sure I guess we'll have to
ask the commenters you guys ever heard
of a backyard they're good it more of a
dramatic smoky eye tonight I keep
hiccuping I hope that you know this is
something that I think is the first time
it's ever happened to me when I've been
on the spot on camera and this goes for
like when I've been doing videos here
like for beauty broadcast or when I've
been like doing the news at work but i
don't think i've ever gotten the hiccups
while I was shooting video of anything
if I have told my breath that you have
to handle all the talking oh we love the
Sun hi oh I didn't do very well holding
my friend not only as you exhale no
you're not allowed to inhale okay what
do I do just blood all the air out of
your lungs Oh
can be very intense but it works
just hold it hold it hold it until you
feel like you can't take it anymore and
then you can blow out wherever you feel
like you're going to suffocate just
basically carry it to the point where
you can't go any longer and
once you let yourself breathing in your
hands will be gone
which is rounding is a very sad look on
your face right now blow it out
don't bring that don't cheat IMG tongues
I'm going
comes come back and you have to do it
again I did feel like I was going to
suffocate so we'll see how long it takes
before i hiccup again huh I feel good I
feel free of it you know you can kind of
tell I don't know maybe it's kind of a
mental thing but like I feel like I'm
definitely not that's what I did to get
rid of my hiccups check with your doctor
before trying this method we're talking
about the husband tag that he did and
that was where a Tyler went through and
he answered a ton of questions about
kind of like our relationship and just
some random like fun things and thinking
about how the comments were we we
decided that there were a few
misconceptions about him I think there
might have been a few like prison for
example I noticed someone said well
clearly Emily wears the pants in this
relationship because she talked so much
here's a here's a deep discussion
question for everyone just because you
talk a lot does that really mean you
wear the pants I don't think so i think
thinkin a lot of things could mean
you're insecure you are but it could man
it convenient you're unsure of your
status I mean we were totally being
ourselves and being completely natural
during that video as like anybody who
like my mom was able to recognize or
anybody else who watched that video that
really knows us so I mean if we were
kind of be doing it the other way around
we wouldn't have really probably been
ourselves in that video you know what I
mean boss and probably one of my
highlights of the past week was the
britney spears episode of glee I thought
personally I liked it a lot but here's
what Tyler and I had to say about that I
loved thee I the only thing that I kind
of wish there was more of was more group
renditions with the whole cast you know
what I mean I was a week that was where
it was lacking I thought because I like
seeing you know like the entire group
performs up I love toxic so much more
than any of the other numbers and I
think part of the reason why a I really
like that song and I choreographed
routine to cheerleading tryouts back in
college for that song so I I'm kind of a
mystery but also
I just thought that it was just more
interesting to watch with the whole
entire cast &amp;amp; Schuster's voice on that
song he was he was killing for his
people so we finally made it all the way
up to the twins house and we had a
really good time so the very high G a
very motivated I started watching your
own couple of 20 30 questions yeah but I
only got like 10 minutes possessed
students implement and gabi just watch
it was really long well she was watching
TV and I I just completely now I have to
give this special shout out to Emily
what are your makeup in candy goes yes I
was a creepy Jimmy has been watching my
videos which i think is so cool and she
also has a little issue of her own with
her eyes and we were able to give her a
little tutorial on the spot this is
Emily and what we're doing is trying to
kind of create a crease with her with
her eyelid so what I've done is I took
you look down I put a light shade all
over her eyelid
and I put it a little bit under eyebrow
and then I am going in with like a
really dark shade like it really dark
grey or a black or something and if she
looks down you can kind of see where i
went with this I went right along the
lash line on the outer part and then I
went right up here now you can see she
doesn't really have a crease right there
but what I'm doing is putting a darker
shade there and when you put a dark
shade somewhere it makes things receipt
makes it go back in basically so that's
why we put a dark shade right there
where a crease might be and we create
that area of the few months that's
basically what you get and you get more
dimension you make this whole area look
like you know there's a little more
going on and you can do that with colors
you could take a plum color or a green
or maybe blue or anything that's
basically a little bit darker and you
can get these products from the
drugstore and I'll put like a little
list below this video in the information
of our so everybody can check that you
just need to have a couple of brushes
that are actually really cheap these
brushes i got from i actually have a
couple that are like this smallish size
they come together they're available at
CVS and the brand is called essence of
beauty and these are called crease
brushes so that's basically what we did
they're really easy cuz they're so small
like if you have a giant brush and
you're trying to go in and do all these
things would be really hard
because this is a small brush I'm able
to put the product exactly where I'm at
and that's it so I just kind of put a
little bit below um you can use a pencil
or use a brush like this that's angled
and just put that in your darkest shadow
and then I went right over here and I
just kind of nodded it right under and
right along the upper lash line so all
in all we had an amazing weekend it was
definitely wish we could have spent more
time there but we just had a fun time me
and Tyler and getting to see Tyler's
family and just having fun on our little
road trip on family weekends so thanks
so much for tuning in for this ends
world video guys I hope you have an
awesome day and a great rest of the week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
