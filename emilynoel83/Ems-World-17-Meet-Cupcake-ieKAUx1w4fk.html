that I now have a cat honey
home yourself it's okay you're fine

video camera
I'm so excited I've been wanting a cat
really ever since I moved out of mom and
dad's house and you know you couldn't
have a pet in my dorm room couldn't have
a pet in the first apartment I moved
into when we came down here to southern
Illinois so now that we are in our house
I am so excited to have a cat and her
name is cupcake and she is so sweet oh
you're very sweet
you get in there she came from a shelter
we adopted her she was living in a cage
basically and they were taking good care
of her and everything but I mean it's
just the way the setup was she was in
there with several other small cats and
it was just really loud and I was like
ISO when I met her I really wanted to
get her in like a good home environment
and so that's what I feel like we've
been able to do and Tyler and I are both
really excited this is her little bed
and it is leopard print as you can see I
got this from Petco and it has this
little like ball you can bat around
there but I just thought that was so
cute I don't know if she's gotten in it
and used it at night yet but I really
like him that I got her this little
pumpkin for Halloween how cute is that
she's really getting used to just being
in a big house having space to roam
around you know as she pleases okay oh
my okay she sees herself in the mirror

and how she responds
