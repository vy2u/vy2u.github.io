for this new m's world video um in this
video it's kind of tracking my
adventures over the weekend as Tyler and
I went back to Monmouth College to visit
and go to a football game and hang out
with some friends of Monmouth in
Monmouth Illinois is where I went to
school for four years for college and so
did Tyler and we just have so many great
memories there I mean it's a great
school
fighting ska had a great experience each
of us in terms of academics there but
also I mean it was a school where I
cheered for for years where Tyler played
football there's a place where we met so
many wonderful friends and it was also
where Tyler proposed our senior year
thinking about Monmouth really takes me
back so it was amazing to get to go up
there and visit we don't get to go up
there that much I mean it was like a
six-hour drive as you can see I just got
back on this video we're going to take
you to some fun tailgating that we did
over the weekend other teams come to
play Scots come to kill so the Monmouth
Knox football game it's known as the
Turkey Bowl and it's one of the oldest
rivalries in college also give you a
little tour of the campus that we
managed to fit in before we let on with
college founded way back in 1853 so for
starters we arrived at Monmouth Friday
night and then we had kind of just
chilled out hung out with one of Tyler's
old roommates Seth and his girlfriend
Brooke and then we got everything
together the next morning and headed
over to the game to tailgate we are back
for basically the major football game of
the season well it's not necessarily the
most always the most competitive game
but it's like the big tradition it's
called the Turkey Bowl
eleven years in a row yeah for 12 to
this it's a very long-standing rivalry
what else is really exciting this
morning a little something I found on on
a certain homepage like this website
YouTube the on the rise poll the result
of that was getting to be featured on
the main page of YouTube and they didn't
just put like one video or just a link
to my channel but they posted like four
videos
I'm super excited and thankful for that
I think I was amazing for them to even a
be included in the poll me win it and
then they go out of their way to do such
nice things that was just amazing so
thank you YouTube and thank you to
everybody that took the time to watch hi
everybody
you like to say anything to the camera
oh not east party Bush just showed you
can follow not East party bus on safe
Scott's
eight Knox today huh you're gonna run
out the team I'm gonna run the team out
today got my big old Connell flag
Connell gave me his flag so I can really
put them out and everything like that
and that's really nice good fun for
those who don't know Monica's The
Fighting Scots and that's why the kilt
is going on here thank you very much
very nice I do have undergarments by the
way okay Delta camp is now just an
update now to more natis party buses
have shown up so have the police and
many more at one the college students
you show me your paddle in what says
Fighting Scots other teams gonna play
Scots come to to mediate no the bells
Bob kind of on the side of a hill for
most example field is down in kind of a
bolo we are forced down the parade
fulfil your old 42-yard Lana what
landfill and it sucks he's the worst
field in football history setting up the
game with three former football players
keeps you well informed of all the
mistakes it seems Tyler can't take his
eyes off
oh yeah
13 going on in the center the steps here
Myers do you have any comments on what
you just witnessed I was intense we're
going to keep in mind that Monmouth
College is the Fighting Scots so yeah
that's our mascot and there is such a
tradition that goes along with it had
this football game but at Monmouth you
would have seen the pipe band and I mean
just so many wonderful game day
tradition the game was really fun the
only disappointment for me was that
there were no cheerleaders we always
would we wouldn't travel to every away
game but we would go always go to the
Knox game because it was Knox and
Monmouth are very close in proximity and
it was just always one of those games
where there was a ton of fan involvement
everybody was really fired up but no
cheerleader so I was really disappointed
to come back and see that
for the game we got to go out and eat
with some more some more buddies of mine
and Tyler we left I really wanted to
make sure I could show you guys some
shots of the campus so you knew a little
bit more about Monmouth College because
it is a small school it's a small
liberal arts college for your school
but it was definitely I mean it's one of
the most memorable experiences in my
life is the time I spent there so I just
wanted to show you around campus a
little bit Monmouth College founded way
back in 1853 this is not too far off
campus in Monmouth and this is Holt
House and to fellow members across the
country of Pi Beta Phi
that's the commonly noted sorority but
it's actually a women's fraternity
this is Holt House this is the
birthplace of of Pi Beta Phi it was
founded here way back in 1867
so there are PI's and universities and
colleges across the country and this is
where it was founded right here in this
house and this was where we had the
privilege of having many of our meetings
our initiations and pledge ceremonies
things like that so I thought those of
you who are pipelines would be really
interested to see this Tyler and I have
been here at Monmouth the whole football
field has gotten a total renovation and
not only do we have awesome new stands
which we could find our names on those
seats because we donated money to the
stadium but you can see it's got an
amazing turf now it's going to be so
awesome when we find seat with our names
on it found our seat it's right here
class of 2006 our name is on a chair
Siler is sitting in his seat
this is Cleland Hall this is the first
dorm Tyler stayed in when he came to
Mons it old Greer Hall trees kind of
blocking it here but this is the first
dorm I stayed and I stayed here my
senior year in my junior year I believe
didn't I know those little balconies are
actually used at times to be kind of a
steep walk actually to get up here to
Wallis Hall which is kind of the I guess
the trademark building of the campus
this is where I had most of I had all of
my communications classes so numerous
speeches given in this building we
produced up on the upper upper floor
there was where we produced MCTV which
was our campus TV station in the front
of Wallace huh absolutely beautiful
building lots of memories there it is
the Health Athletic Center Tyler spent a
great deal of time here worked here
Tyler worked here during college and so
we got in might be that might be the
basketball team and they're practicing
now I don't know this is where Tyler
used to work Tyler was in charge of
making sure all individuals had their MC
ID card I'm sure he was very diligent
about the knowledge this is adorable a
little place to get like smoothies and
my mom and dad would always tease me
like I was going off to Monmouth and I
was staying at a resort or something but
really it's true better look at the
library great little outdoor area there
to study and when we kind of open up
back to the field right out here on the
night before homecoming our senior year
where there's this big bond fought not
really a bonfire but like a pep rally
huge celebration but all the students
come to a lot of the alumni and that was
when Tyler proposed to me
for your left out our diely next Kenny
you all we have been trying to go for
long faces and we're going to need your
help longer you guys ought to be out
here tomorrow you know for us like you
guys have been you guys are a big part
of that we have by far the best fans in
the conference that you were singing
over half
cages
