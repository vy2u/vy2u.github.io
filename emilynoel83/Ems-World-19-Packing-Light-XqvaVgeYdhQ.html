tuning in I hope you had a wonderful
thanksgiving now we are like moving on
to Christmas time I've got some actually
some pink lights here in my beauty
broadcast room so I have started
decorating I am so excited for Christmas
time because this is the first time I've
actually decorated a house for Christmas
so I mean I've got little trees and
stuff everywhere I have a tree decorated
with pink stuff and with cupcakes in
here in my beauty broadcast room and so
I'm going to do a video coming up kind
of just some decorating ideas for the
interior of your home and stuff like
that also an update my hair is black I
pope you guys like my mom did this for
me over the weekend i was actually
noticing how on TV on anchor morning
newscast and we had were in HD now and
we also have um i know it sort of maybe
a golden eat own light that is shining
down on us and i really like the look of
rich dark hair on me and so that light
was actually taking my dark brown hair
and picking up on any golden the
undertones and it really was kind of
giving it a look I wasn't then that's
about so I was like let's go really dark
and this actually comes off looking
pretty much like dark brown on air but
here it really has that black look to it
but it's um this is clairol natural
instincts i think the shade is called
midnight but it's described as just
being black so kind of a change for me
but i think i like going back in time a
little bit to thanksgiving i was able to
travel back home and see my family not
just mine but also Tyler's would they
live very close together so it's kind of
easy for us to split our time that way
but I was able to see my lovely sister
Kelly aka pup again and as are so much
fun we had like this epic jenga game
over I'm dying is gonna fire you but we
get your patient we were just
fit all kinds of fun stuff and while she
was there and packed it into a short
period of time but tough husband Jeff
was also there and Jeff is such a super
nice guy and he told me about some of
his packing tricks because he's done a
lot of traveling and he is able to pack
so many things and we're talking like
your toiletry items into such a small
little bag so he showed me his bag and I
thought this would be great for tips for
guys and girls because we still have
Christmas coming up people visiting
family how do you travel lightly but
still have everything you need here with
pup the lovely puppy who you may
remember from previous videos and her
husband Jeff and Jeff huh you have a
small small bag here how did you first
decide you needed to travel with just
such a small amount of stuff okay I was
lucky enough to be able to travel around
the US and the world is a video game
producer but I'm also quite obsessed
with packing light getting everything
that I can for a week-long trip into a
single backpack and getting all of my
toiletries down into it is actually a
small little sunglasses case and and
it's pretty easy to get things
relatively small but you always run into
the issues that there's certain shampoo
there's shaving cream that must go along
if you're a scruffy rough man as I am
today and that it's almost impossible to
get it down into a bag this size right
so with some advice some from some
travel bloggers this is what I've
actually come up with which helps
satisfy me for a 10-day trip in Europe
once so so this really is a sunglasses
case this is a sunglasses case it had a
it had a pretty colorful flower on it
which to make more manly I took a black
marker too so that it is no longer the
pretty green
this is simple so for example grabbing a
tylenol plastic bottle but actually
filling it with all the different
varieties of advil or claritin or other
medicine that you want instead of taking
along separate ones that simple foldable
toothbrush that's a must everybody can
find these of course a razor really is
no substitute for a straight razor
alrighty ah a single shout wipe and go
because you never know what you're going
to get on yourself while you're eating
or doing other disgusting things a
single piece of soap because it's
difficult even when you're traveling in
places like Europe to actually find the
soap in in three or four star hotels so
that's just a bar of soap that's just a
simple bar soap I do also carry
occasional move it to me what it's a
product from dr. bronner's and we can
put a link up for it and it actually
shampoo + hands so plus you can use it
to wash your clothes as well Wow is
something else that i do i pack with
only two or three shirts when is that
very expensive that product er like it
lasts a long time it's it's a little
pricey but you can get a large bottle
for about twenty-four dollars toothpaste
of course so now we get into some of the
more interesting things so for hair care
products taking it out of the larger
bottle and putting it into a car max
container it still solidly city sealed
you don't have to worry about it
breaking comes out it's already where
you use like a little tiny dab a little
dips yeah exactly sack hearing news just
carry something that and for a cup of
they trip I mean yeah that would be
absolutely all you need right shaving
cream now then always know that even if
you get the small shaving cream there
there you know rather why and there's
still at least this tall it'd be almost
impossible to fit it into something like
this so this is Trek and travels pocket
shaving soap they have both shape they
have shaving soap they have shampoo and
they also have regular so so this is all
TSA compliant but what it is
is it's essentially dehydrated shampoo
or shaving cream in this you just put a
few drops of water on it and it converts
just back into much easier if you do
this in the shower and it just converts
back into shaving shaving gel and
actually shaving gels and shaving oils I
have an extremely tough beard these work
much better than most evangelion creams
and once you get used to it it's it's
wonderful for your skin I'd use it all
the time except it's slightly more
expensive how would you get in there
like enough this actually came with 25
and all it takes is one or two every day
instead of antiperspirant same problem
you always end up larger bottles this is
actually mineral salt so it's small you
could use a much smaller chunk of this
you could break this in half so you know
just use the chunk and that's your
deodorant it is a wrong when I when I
travel I tend to spend from 6a in the
morning until 8pm at night trying to see
as many sites as possible and certainly
this is in all kinds of weather and this
is worked exceedingly well if not better
than most antiperspirant that's awesome
and I would like to know that gem
doesn't sweat just for the eddington
women we know how to swear wall now yeah
I don't know if that would work is only
but what's firm well that next trip you
take it and try it okay report back
right that's the way I've been able to
get all of my week-long toiletries into
a small little bag which can then go
into a small backpack to actually do
what's called backpack free or luggage
free traveling oh my god essentially you
just carry everything on your person and
this is part of that so that I can take
this i can take along my iphone and take
along just what I'm wearing and a few
changes in clothes it's a movement if
you search for packing light you'll find
a number of blogs or articles talking
about how to do
this and essentially you just have to be
slightly nuts now huh have you tried
this packing strategy with your stuff or
what do you do let's see what that's my
makeup and then we have 140 x yes I mean
how do you deal with this stuff I feel
like I'm pretty proud you just have to
be natural you know my biggest yeah you
think how i need a bacon these are my
things makeup-wise the uncommon once and
you and I mean pup travels light no I
think this shows I mean that would be
hard giving ya a little eyelash curler
and I need tweezers so that's what I
travel with but I don't have like my
shampoo and shaving cream or resource or
anything like that in there here so it's
amazing what he's able to do so thank
you again to Jeff for taking the time to
do that video with me I think it's so
interesting and perspective on traveling
and packing and stuff like that but I
just love incorporating other people
into my videos because I am blessed to
have some great people in my life
friends family people I love that I me
not only do they have something to share
something to offer but I just feel like
they have the nicest sweetest kindest
personalities and I guess the more I can
spread that out to the rest of you I
feel like I'm doing a good so thanks to
everybody for watching and I will see
you very soon bye
um how would you rate to the
thanksgiving fair we came up with them
its okay its beauty broadcast people
respect that it turned out really well i
think i was i was afraid that we
wouldn't get everything done everything
has to be done same time that's a
challenge but somehow we kind of did it
either stuff since happy thanksgiving to
all to all to most remote to the non
haters
I think more should reference was at 68
impressive you press up not yet done but
when I think it is the best Jenga ever
Jenga this is we're on the 26 level ok
we will join you with further progress
we're really going away from probably
the traditional rules of Jenga here and
we are we took all of those separated
pieces except for right here at the
bottom and we basically we combined them
here here here so serious at this one
stop stop what laughing to me dying is a
fairy we reviewed the situation where I
advise busting out one of those two and
it started to shake so that's a bad idea
it's clearly tipping it's at about 35
levels and we are going net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
