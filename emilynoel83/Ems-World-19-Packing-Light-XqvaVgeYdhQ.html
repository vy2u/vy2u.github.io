tuning in I hope you had a wonderful
Thanksgiving now we are like moving on
to Christmas time I've got some actually
some pink lights here in my beauty
broadcast room so I have started
decorating I am so excited for Christmas
time because this is the first time I've
actually decorated a house for Christmas
so I mean I've got little trees and
stuff everywhere I have a tree decorated
with pink stuff and with cupcakes here
in my beauty broadcast room and so I'm
gonna do a video coming up kind of just
some decorating ideas for the interior
of your home and stuff like that also an
update my hair is black I hope you guys
like my mom did this for me over the
weekend I was actually noticing how on
TV um anchora morning newscast and we
had were in HD now and we also have I
know it's sort of maybe a golden eat own
light that is shining down on us and I
really like the look of rich dark hair
on me and so that light was actually
taking my dark brown hair and picking up
on any golden the undertones and it
really was kind of giving it a look I
wasn't then that's about so I was like
let's go really dark and this actually
comes off looking pretty much like dark
brown on air but here it really has that
black look to it but it's uh this is
Clairol natural instincts I think the
shade is called midnight but it's
described as just being black so kind of
a change for me but I think I like going
back in time a little bit to
Thanksgiving I was able to travel back
home and see my family not just mine but
also Tyler's would they live very close
together so it's kind of easy for us to
split our time that way but I was able
to see my lovely sister Kelly aka pup
again and is there so much fun we had
like this epic Jenga game dying we were
just
fit all kinds of fun stuff and while she
was there packed it into a short period
of time but pups husband Jeff was also
there and Jeff is such a super nice guy
and he told me about some of his packing
tricks because he's done a lot of
traveling and he is able to pack so many
things and we're talking like your
toiletry items it's just such a small
little bag so he showed me his bag and I
thought this would be great for tips for
guys and girls because we still have
Christmas coming up people visiting
family how do you travel lightly but
still have everything you need here with
pup the lovely pup who you may remember
from previous videos and her husband
Jeff and Jeff you have a small small bag
here how did you first decide you needed
to travel with just such a small amount
of stuff okay I was lucky enough to be
able to travel around the u.s. and the
world is a video game producer but I'm
also quite obsessed with packing light
getting everything that I can for a
week-long trip into a single backpack
and getting all of my toiletries down
into it is actually a small little
sunglasses case and and it's pretty easy
to get things relatively small but you
always run into the issues that there's
certain shampoo there's shaving cream
that must go along if you're a scruffy
rough man and I am today that it's
almost impossible to get it down into a
bag this size right so with some advice
from some travel bloggers this is what
I've actually come up with which helps
satisfy me for a 10 day trip in Europe
once so so this really is the sunglasses
case this is the sunglasses case hit
hediye it had a pretty colorful flower
on it which to make more manly I took a
made black mark or two so that is no
longer the pretty green
this is simple so for example grabbing a
Tylenol plastic bottle but actually
filling it with all the different
varieties of advil or claritin or other
medicine that you want instead of taking
along separate ones
that's simple foldable toothbrush that's
a must
everybody can find these of course a
razor really is no substitute for a
straight razor all righty
a single shout wipe and go because you
never know what you're going to get on
yourself while you're eating or doing
other disgusting things a single piece
of soap because it's difficult to even
when you're traveling in places like
Europe to actually find soap in in three
or four star hotels so that's just a bar
of soap that's just a simple bar soap I
do also carry occasionally with me with
it's a product from dr. Bronner's and we
can put a link up for it and it actually
shampoo plus hands so plus you can use
it to wash your clothes as well Wow
is something else that I do I pack with
only two or three shirts that very
expensive product like it lasts a long
time it's it's a little pricey but you
can get a large bottle for about $24
toothpaste of course so now we get into
some of the more interesting things so
for hair care products taking it out of
the larger bottle and putting it into a
Carmack's container it still solidly
City sealed you don't have to worry
about it breaking comes out it's already
where you use like a little tiny little
dibs yeah exactly it's not carrying
loose just carry something that and for
a couple of a trip I mean yeah that
would be absolutely all you need right
shaving cream now and then always know
that even if you get the small shaving
cream there there you know rather why
and there's still at least this tall it
be always impossible to fit it into
something like this so this is Trek and
travels pocket shaving soap they have
both shape they have shaving soap they
have shampoo and they also have regular
so so this
LTS a compliant but what it is is it's
essentially dehydrated shampoo or
shaving cream in this you just put a few
drops of water on it and it converts
just back into much easier if you do
this in the shower and it just converts
back into a shaving gel and actually
shaving gels and shaving oils I have an
extremely tough beard these work much
better than most evangelion creams and
once you get used to it it's it's
wonderful for your skin I'd use it all
the time except it's slightly more
expensive this actually came with 25 and
all it takes is one or two everything
instead of antiperspirant same problem
you always end up with larger bottles
this is actually mineral salt so it's
small you could use a much smaller chunk
of this you could break this in half so
you know it's use the chunk and that
doehner it when I when I travel I tend
to spend from 6:00 a.m. in the morning
until 8:00 p.m. at night trying to see
as many sites as possible and certainly
this is in all kinds of weather and this
is what seemingly wolf's not better in
the most antiperspirant that's awesome
and I would like to know that doesn't
sweat well next trip you take it and try
it
ok report back try that's the way I've
been able to get all of my week-long
toiletries into a small little bag which
can then go into a small backpack I
think to actually do what's called
backpack free or luggage free traveling
oh my god essentially you just carry
everything on your person and this is
part of that so that I can take this I
can take along my iPhone and take along
just what I'm wearing and a few changes
in clothes it's a movement if you search
for packing light you'll find a number
of blogs over articles talking about how
do this and essentially you just have to
be slightly nuts now have you tried this
packing strategy with your stuff or what
do you do
let's see well that's my makeup yes I
mean how do you deal with this stuff I
feel like I'm pretty proud just have to
be natural these are my things
makeup wise thank you and I mean pop
travels light no I think this shows I
mean that would be hard to unity but
yeah a little eyelash curler and I need
tweezers so that's what I travel with
but I don't have like my shampoo and
shaving cream or a resource or anything
like that in there so it's amazing what
he's able to do so thank you again to
Jeff for taking the time to do that
video with me I think it's so
interesting and perspective on traveling
and packing and stuff like that but I
just love incorporating other people
into my videos because I am blessed to
have some great people in my life
friends family people I love that I mean
not only do they have something to share
something to offer but I just feel like
they have the nicest sweetest kindest
personalities and I guess the more I can
spread that out to the rest of you I
feel like I'm doing you good so thanks
to everybody for watching and I will see
you very soon bye
I'm how would you rate to the
Thanksgiving fare it's okay its beauty
broadcast people respect that it turned
out really well I think I was I was
afraid that we wouldn't get everything
done everything has to be done same time
that's the challenge but somehow we kind
of did it hey there's touch says Happy
Thanksgiving to all to all to the non
haters
reference impressive uh not yet done but
wait I think it is the best Jenga ever
Jenga this is we're on the 26 level okay
we will join you with further progress
we're really going away from probably
the traditional rules of Jenga here and
we are we took all of those separated
pieces except for right here at the
bottom and we basically combined them
here one of those two and it's it's
clearly tipping it's at about thirty
five levels and we are net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
