here it is guys it's 1:30 in the morning
it's Friday and I'm ready for the
weekend maybe here we are straight out
of bed this is you know where I start to
think okay some kind of transformations
got to happen yeah my breakfast every
morning is usually one of these EAS
advantage protein shakes it's pretty low
in calories and sugar and I can't forget
to turn on the coffee maker because I
always take some with me to work so I
can drink it there and get kind of
perked up then I have to turn on ABC
World News now because I just I'm that
type of person I need to have something
going in the background this is kind of
like the My Morning News you want does
anybody out there watch this too some
newscast in the middle of the night it's
actually pretty good well I'm now in my
makeup area um shaking up some
foundation getting getting my makeup on
for the day it's you know about a
quarter till 2:00 like people do I've
been asked you know what what Tyler does
while I'm getting ready and you know he
just kind of gets up with me and drink
some coffee and you know just starts his
day early as well okay that was a joke
he actually um you know it's sleeping
right now we're fortunate to have an
extra room here where I can you know I
basically have my closet and then makeup
and everything and I'm just able to use
it to get ready in the morning and not
really disruptive I'm doing the
all-important under eye concealer here
I'm using my Bobbi Brown corrector right
now in bisque it's like a peachy color
and I put that down as kind of a base
for circles and then lately I've been
just taking my dream mousse concealer
and light
four to five and then it's a little bit
lighter has a little different texture
and I kind of use that to really do away
with the circle and then I set it with a
little bit of yellow toned loose powder
Oh about 20 minutes later there we've
now got a face and makeup on
so I shower the night before so that way
it cuts out a lot of time in the oven
for today I'm just going to wear my hair
down kind of curl it a little bit just
touched it that we cube is today's
outfit you can see that cardigan the
blue shirt jeans and my boots I like
wearing my boots with these kind of
jeans it's the part where I actually go
and I say goodbye to Tyler I kind of
just tap him and say you know I'm
leaving and he pretty much is half
asleep so good stuff hi
I got my makeup bag my coffee my lunch
and my purse / bag here and we're ready
to hit out the doors the moon at about 3
a.m.
heading door I actually read somewhere
that it helps you as a news anchor to
warm up your voice before you do the
naval sink and sometimes along with the
radio on my way to work just to kind of
get my voice
ready I can tell a difference if I'm not
talking much before the newscast and
then I go on and start reading my voice
just doesn't have a very good tone to it
I'm probably the only one that can tell
the difference but you'll notice we hit
a lot of green lights
there's just I'm the only car on the
road pretty much so yay
yeah happy music it's 3:20 in the
morning maybe and it's Friday
did I mention songs that you don't hear
a lot during the daytime all the
randomness comes out at night I tell you
yay
bright lights first stop at the station
is the makeup area where I leave my
stuff our newsroom this is Kevin good

morning weather anchor and made the
forecast and now I'm just trying to
listen to these two
it gets pretty pretty funny in here in
the morning that's your area that's your
region it's with all the weather cave
because they they hide me from the
people in the weather I in the newsroom
because just getting the studio ready
for the show here so I got to get of our
plasmas turned on we got some new plasma
yes for anybody all three new plasmas
you can see we'll get to those event
from get logged onto the computer here's
our answers can have their teleprompter
which is very necessary
god forbid you all memorize the whole
shell these are our teleprompters you're
going to turn these on large cameras in
the studio here very large compared to
my level wool guy one two plasmas class
Proctor
though Clint does not you heat Clint
sees himself yes cannot read from a
script everyone else I'm a diva I have
to see myself in the screen himself now
we get the lights I quit I okay so your
school this is one of our two light
boards we keynote spit back here behind
the Weather Center
we just flip up this switch and this
turns on part of the lights in the
studio okay as you can see here we got
to go back here way behind the Weather
Center
this is where our electric board is
everything marked with an end we have to
turn on this do do a lot of switches
roth's
yes it is but it makes simple they can
see you better
sweet so let's see what's it finished
lighting looks like the weather center
which actually is like a functional area
because work is actually done back here
but then the lights come on it's like a
studio set anymore weather wall you'll
see more of that later
um the desk is sick and make sure none
of them are out for that Scott and I
would have to change which would involve
getting on a ladder yes so you can see
all the lights way up high if you're
sitting on the desk and you're looking
up at the lights it's really bright
so if I've mentioned like doing your
makeup a little differently when you're
under these lights that is definitely
the case okay it's now 5:15 we've got
about 15 minutes before the news goes on
everybody's kind of wrapping things up
getting last-minute pieces of video
edited right Ross doing last-minute
research for instance a last-minute
research and this is when I usually come
over here and I once these lights come
on which kind of simulate what it's like
out on the set you kind of realize okay
I need more bronzer because my face
looks pale or
you know something you you figure out
sort of what changes you need to make
and what makes this setting so different
for makeup then others are so even
though I've done my makeup at home

need to do and it takes you know about
10 minutes touch some things up and then

today's forecast Clinton nice weather

the way it is going to be today as well
more sunshine but warmer temperatures
Saturday more sunshine warmer
temperatures no complaints let's take a
look outside right now as we move in on
our tower cam Harrisburg a man who was
nearly hit by a light rail train in
Phoenix Arizona
owes his life to to assistance with the
police department there surveillance
video from the train station shows the
man who appears to be intoxicated he
fell off the light rail platform and
onto the tracks Tuesday night the two
police assistance rushed to help them as
they flag down the Train and police say
the train driver saw them in and pulled
the emergency brake just in time
no one was injured talk about serve and
protect man those guys
the train driver the two police officers
just on their game yeah we can't see you
because there's not a watt anyone oh
yeah I do I do where they distribution
kind of time but they're not any longer
than my hair is now so but they do add a
little whatever on your neck so that
were some day yeah is slippery this look
like a mullet and we're getting
the all-time mullet Monday Mullen Monday
oh wow great I mean a great sure they
just any other feedback John um actually
I do have some legitimate feedback um I
think I probably would have instead of
putting the si si layoffs okay in the
news now since that was a news story
from last night at 10:00 in the only
round at tonight's Hollywood or I would
have added the boat shot to the the news
now I got okay I would have issues okay
now that the newscast is all done we
work on cut-ins so those are little
updates that you see like throughout
Good Morning America or the Today Show
when you see the local news station cut
in with news and weather that's what we
do so it only lasts a couple minutes so
we usually go through a few different
local stories that we did throughout the
newscast and so right now I'm just kind
of sitting here going through that
writing up a promo that will run
throughout the weekend kind of teasing
what we have coming up on Monday and
also putting some of the stories that we
did online so that's what's going on now
and then for the rest of my shift pass
this it's usually reporting doing some
kind of story whether that means going
out and doing a story or just working on
something in-house that will eventually
air you know it's just whatever whatever
is needed that's what we do all right
everyone I'm leaving now is getting to
be about noon now I don't know if you
can see that on my clock but I have this
little Bluetooth device right up here
that you may be able to see and that
allows me to talk on the phone
hands-free and so this is the point in
my day where I usually give my mom a
call so we're just gonna get her on the
phone and see what's
did you say yes darling I kind of have
to yell at the thing sometimes to pepper
to pick up my voice is not most
sensitive thing
ever but mom hi ma'am
I know and guess what mom I know I'm not
gonna get I'm recording this for a
YouTube video I know this is real life
people yeah I've been recording my day
all day just like so people can see so
people can see behind the scenes of the
newscast and stuff and so I thought you
know I just go through and do what I do
on a typical day and I usually call you
it this time right I certainly do
so much everyone for tuning in for this
video I am back home now it's Friday I'm
ready for the weekend and thank you so
much for watching and thanks to all my
co-workers who allowed me to bring my
little camera in and do something for my
channel here I'm really glad that people
who watch my videos regularly we're
interested in seeing this there's
actually quite a large number of viewers
that I have that have approached me with
comments about TV news or journalism in
some aspect and how do I prepare and
what sorts of things do I need to do I
have done videos in the past answering
some of those questions but I think
probably one of the most informative
things you'll watch is just kind of the
real behind-the-scenes stuff that you
got to see in this video informative
funny I don't know but I really take my
job seriously it's very important to me
I really enjoy all the people that I
work with and I think that probably
shows in in the work that we put
together as a whole the morning show
crew so thank you so much for following
me through my day and hopefully I'll do
some more of these videos kind of
randomly in there if there's something
cool going on at work
I know of where I don't know maybe
sometimes it's the days where nothing's
going on that some really funny stuff
happens so thanks again for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
