glad to share this video with you
because I've been wanting to ever since
I got decorated for Christmas time I've
been wanting to sort of show you around
my house and just kind of point out some
of the ways that I have decorated for
Christmas now I don't claim to be any
sort of a professional decorator just
like I don't claim to be a professional
makeup artist but I just sort of wanted
to show you what I was doing and I
thought it would be cool if you posted
like a video response showing how you
decorated your home you can see I've got
some of my lights up back here behind me
but I also have just some different
little trees around the house I mean
it's nothing like super spectacular or
anything and I'm sure some of you have
gone far above and beyond this but I
just wanted to share it with you because
this is one of my favorite times of the
year and something about just getting
the house decorated makes me feel a
little more like being home with with my
family you know at mom's house and stuff
like that so anyway just wanted to give
you a quick little tour it's not going
to be really a full house tour but just
some of the places where I've decorated
for Christmas as you walk in the door
you'll probably have a cupcake greeting
you here she definitely comes to
attention whenever she hears anything
happening near the entryway but I've got
this little mat here outside my door
I'll maybe take some pictures if I can I
just have the outside decorations
because I just have not gotten the
chance to really get any good pictures
outside in the dark you know when you've
got no light and then only your
Christmas lights that in our entryway
we've got sort of these little archways
here and you can see I just did a little
decorating there and got the candles and
whatnot and I was really excited about
what I did here I've got these little um
like three level stands that I found at
Hobby Lobby and I've been using them
sort of all season long hi honey
I've got like some little things down in
there but I made these trees and you can
get them real cheap this was just I mean
this tree looked like nothing when it
was kind of all folded up but when you
pull the branches down I mean it's just
like a little three dollar tree and I
got these
little mini decorations this is all
Hobby Lobby here and I didn't both up in
gold since I've got the gold mirrors
here so I have it kind of symmetrical
maybe could have been more creative with
this I don't know but I just thought
they looked pretty here in the entryway
and I might put some lights on them next
year I think that would be kind of a
pretty way to brighten things up right
as you walk in the door you can see that
gives way to the dining room over there
so we'll get to that in a second but
first the living room and this is our
Christmas tree it is a it's a seven and
a half known seven and a half or seven
foot tree that I got from Hobby Lobby
once again I got this cute little I'm
trying to like reach my arm up there to
the top but a little tree topper there
and I did it sort of in a red and gold
theme but I put in some of my own
personal woodland creatures among other
things here I've got like some little
ornaments that I've had for you know a
long time ever since I was a little kid
and mom kind of compiled some of those
for me so I could put them on our tree
so yeah this is the first time I've been
in you know my own house during the
holidays we've had an apartment before
but this is definitely big time
decorating and I didn't have a tree
skirt yet and I went with this leopard
print a little blanket and I actually
think it's kind of cute down there so I
think I might just keep it but I got our
stockings kind of here where the
entertainment center and stuff is you
know I didn't have a real good mantel
area to put that oh hey it's QVC what
are they showing I have no idea some
food of some sort but I love QVC I'm
always watching that oh by the way
Kardashian confidential a review coming
on this very soon I've read this book
and I will let you know what I think
about it in an upcoming video got my
little snow globe this is one of my
favorite pictures from when Tyler and I
got married I've got another one over
here that is I know
that might be my favorite there that was
in the limousine when we were on our way
out I just love that picture will Santa
Santa coasters you know this cute little
like corner bookshelf thing at a local
furniture store and I put another little
tree that it came with the built-in
pinecones so that's always a bonus there
but got these cute little candy cane
candles and some wedding pictures down
there I actually have a wedding like
video slideshow that I put together
that's one of our engagement pictures
there me and Tyler in the kitchen area
we've got kind of this bar going on here
and I don't have a whole lot going on I
like these big jumbo candles you can get
from Walmart this apple cider was
amazing but I wish they were selling new
little topper things for Christmas I
couldn't find any at my store so this
one still has the leaves on it but I
like how it sort of also protects you
from our protects a cat that could be
walking by from the flame is our dining
room and I've got this that's neat
centerpiece now this was given to me
last year by a group of firefighters
when I went and spoke at their Christmas
dinner and so it's kind of like a fake
floral arrangement a that little
firetruck in there and I just thought it
was pretty so I wanted to bring it out
again this year this is a red and gold
decoration that I was going to put on
the tree and it just I didn't have near
as much of it as I thought I had so I
just kind of weaved it around in my
little centerpiece area there was some
wine bottles and candles and stuff and
then this little tree I just could not
let go of this is our little 4-foot tree
that we had in our house or in our
apartment last year and I just thought
with this room having red walls it's
just kind of like a Christmas room and I
thought this little tree kind of tucked
in the corner here would really brighten
it up and so I did that tree in years
past with a lot of silver on it so I
just kind of went with
that and wrap some silver ribbon around
it begin to ribbon I think ribbon looks
gorgeous on trees and so I just went
with silver ornaments now last but not
least I've got to take you into the room
I might be most excited about and this
is my beauty broadcast room and this is
what it looks like with the lights kind
of turned down but I'll I'll pop them on
for you and show you what it really
looks like and by the way I do have a
room tour that I did not long after I
moved in but I got this little candle
thing I believe this is a Hobby Lobby
product but it's got the little
flameless tea light in there and then
this is my tree that I did up all for
offer pink in the beauty broadcast room
and it had this little tree skirt can't
remember exactly where I found that but
I've got it kind of all in a weird
little configuration here but this is
sitting on like an upside-down Bowl I
put the tree skirt over it look at the
cupcakes isn't that cute Walmart was
selling so many cupcake ornaments and so
you can get them in like pink sparkly
like that and I got these pink ornaments
the ribbon the whole nine yards so this
is my little pink tree I love to turn it
on when it's all dark in here and I'm
getting ready getting my makeup on in
the morning and I've got this cute
little tree I might just have to leave
this up past Christmas because I enjoy
it so much and then just for the heck of
it I got these cute pink like LED lights
and strung around the rest of my makeup
bookshelf here which I think kind of
brightens it up and looks cute in the
back of the video well thank you guys so
much for taking the time to watch you
may notice that this video is a little
clearer than some of the other videos
for the past couple I have used my brand
new camera it is a Canon and I will
write all about it on my blog and kind
of let you know what I guess some of the
features are because I'm still learning
this camera has many more things that it
will do than my old camera so I'm
excited to learn I'm kind of learning as
I go but I will keep you posted on that
since I have gotten a lot of questions
already thank you thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
