this video if you checked out my big
hall from birthday and Christmas for
this year you know I mentioned a couple
of big gifts that I left out of that
video but was doing separate videos on
just recently I posted the one on my
Vega vanity girl Hollywood makeup mirror
which I'm sitting in front of now I love
it so much
but really the granddaddy of all the
gifts that I got was something that I
cherish so much and part of the reason
why is because it was created by my
sister and it's a portrait of me here
sitting in this very chair in my makeup
room doing my makeup and she did it off
of a photograph she took from me back in
the summer and she just absolutely blew
my mind with this picture what was neat
was that over the past you know few
weeks that she's been working on this
she's been updating her blog and her
website was sort of the progress she's
been making and so I've been able to see
you know how it was coming along and I
knew it was gonna be amazing my sister
is a former high school art teacher she
is a an absolutely outstanding artist
she does a lot of watercolor paintings
that's her specialty and her portraits
are so lifelike it just takes your
breath away that's all I can say but
anyway I was keeping up with her
progress on this painting and it was
just so cool to be able to see that but
then on Christmas day when she brought
out my painting and she also did one of
Tyler sort of in his setting at work in
his office and when she showed us those
full-size in person it really just
brought me to tears
I've seen a flick so it's actually a
little embarrassing I mean just I don't
know I don't really show myself crying
on video all that often and I mean just
I was bawling like it really really
brought me to tears to see these
paintings in person because um it's it's
they're there several reasons why I mean
the the quality of the painting is
amazing and as I'm looking over here I'm
looking back at the painting which is on
my wall right on that side but the
detail is almost scary when you look at
certain things in the painting and then
you I look at my makeup table I'm like
that thing you know it looks exactly
like you know this palette or this piece
of makeup or the mirror the flowers
whatever it all just totally matches up
so accurately it is almost scary but um
also I know the kind of care that goes
into this the thought just the amount of
time when you know when someone's giving
you a gift that is not just something
they went to the store and purchased but
something that they threw their whole
heart into you know to make it and to do
it just I mean I just I just I guess I
just know how much um how much it
matters to my sister to do such a
tremendous job on everything she works
on and she does it she just does
everything flawless enough of my
emotions the hell
take a closer look at the painting all
right so we have cupcake down here my
cupcake she is taking a little mat but
right up here is the painting and it is
just awesome
again this was taken she took a picture
of me here in my area you can see it's
my old makeup mirror that's in there but
every little detail is so incredibly
accurate I mean the brushes that are
there those flowers you look at that Too
Faced palette which was one that she
gave me the pencils amazing just the
detail on all these palettes
the writing on everything is totally
there my face I mean that's so my face
and what was interesting was it right in
this area in here she had a paint spill
it's the color of paint that's in the
background and it actually spilled all
over this general region and she was
able to correct that and you can read up
on her blog as to how she was able to
pull that off and make it right again
but as you can imagine that was pretty
upsetting to have that happen but this
is so me this is me and my makeup area
like my sister was suggesting you know I
just kind of put it up here to start
with because I thought it was neat to
have it in this room too but you know I
may switch it out with tyler's or have
this one go in his office his come in
mine or you know put this somewhere else
but I really just adore my sister and
I'm so thankful that she went out of her
way to do something like this for me it
really means a lot
and now Tyler's we don't have put up
just yet it'll either go in maybe his
office here at home or hi you can see my
reflection or it may go in his office at
work I'm not sure which but this is him
at work the photo was taken there and I
mean it is amazing when I first saw this
she kind of unveiled his first on
Christmas this cupcake but when I saw
his face I mean I could tell from the
pictures online
but it was just so him but you look
closer to his face and she got
everything just amazing and this is
watercolor paint you know this is not an
easy and easy means of painting but she
got his hair his facial hair just his
whole face is so Tyler so I mean it
really did just bring tears from my eyes
when I saw it you got kind of a messy
desk going on here
even his diploma there you can see from
law school it's all in there and just
another incredible painting I don't know
which one I mean obviously I love my
makeup one because that is my area and
my element but I can't get over just the
way Tyler looks in this too I mean it's
just the way you see him so many times
the way I see him and it's just really
really awesome to see him in painting
form all right guys thanks again for
watching I hope you have a wonderful
start to 2011 hard to believe the New
Year's already just about here but I
thank you so much for all your your
loyal viewership over the past year it's
