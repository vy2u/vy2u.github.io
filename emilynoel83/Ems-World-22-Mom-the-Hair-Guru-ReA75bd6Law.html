me for this video this is going to be a
little bit different kind of video
because my mom is here to take part in
this one with me so yay something we
really haven't mentioned is the fact
that when my mom was what age were you
when you started about 19 19 she
actually was running a beauty parlor
basically with us with her sister up for
all of you out there that are interested
in makeup this takes us back to the
1960s right right that was when it all
started for you so you went to beauty
school cosmetology school after high
school right yeah 65 66 so you were
telling me that if you like to watch Mad
Men yes it's really accurate very
accurate clothing hair makeup you know
just the way they walked everything what
do you see is like the biggest
difference between image and the way
women were then and the way they are now
well I feel like they were put into a
certain way of being that they really
couldn't escape if they wanted to get
along in the world at that time there
was a lot of judgment made out of here
there what there was that there were
certain hairstyles that were in there
were certain hairstyles that definitely
were not in not the way it is today
which i think is a lot better today
because you have this chance to be who
you are and I do the things that you
want to do he got into this you started
it up with your sister Jodi my aunt and
when you started doing it back then what
people wanted was a hairdo that would
last them throughout a week yes so you
you would be expected I mean a lot of us
I think watching this would say I wonder
if my hair can last it through an entire
day let alone a style or some kind of
updo that could last a whole week but it
may not have looked that good right then
but they came back and back combing was
a big thing right
twenties are really teasing maybe it's
what the term is now but that was a big
part of the hairstyle itself you
actually created a hairstyle for these
people they knew what they wanted you
knew how to do it and everybody was
happy I'm gonna describe some of the
styles because I'm not even really sure
what well that there was really
everything in length that you wanted but
everything was more precise flips were
big but they and they could be long but
they could also be very short and very
very short hairdos were in but they were
very high it seemed like the longer the
hair at the bottom the flatter it was on
the top and then when it was really
short it was so high on time so you knew
all of this and as we worked in beauty
school there was always a trend going on
and so you follow those trends and in
the beauty shop you follow them too and
you said some sometimes you know people
would come in wanting a look that they
saw on a celebrity and you kind of kept
a little I don't know lookbook or some
idea of what you were seeing that you
knew that you could do risk and I would
kind of hit them toward things that I
thought either their hair would do or
that they would look really well yes
like everything that you ever saw that
was slightly ridiculous it was done man
I think it's interesting how people talk
about going to the to the hairdresser to
your stylist and you kind of unload a
lot of emotional baggage I guess it was
a time for them to do that what was the
atmosphere like when you had somebody in
there cuz it was you and your sister you
had two chairs you had - what - dryers
or whatever new dryers going a very
small room and really not room to do too
much moving around but everyone was
comfortable there it seemed like they
liked the small atmosphere that you
provided and everybody knew you very new
you very well you knew them their
families their friends it was a I did
have a few people from out of town on
each side of our town
but generally it was factory working
women at that time that had the money to
put out for that one time in the
afternoon that they could just totally
relax and and have things done for them
don't good about it but it's so
different from right now where it's like
you've everybody is kind of getting up
in the morning going through their own
personal routine they everybody's got
their own you know straighteners and
curling eyes and blow dryers and
everything but here it was a time where
you're gonna basically give your hair up
to whoever your stylist is and it's
almost like they're Perry there really
wasn't you had their hands in it that's
right and and it belonged to you you
know what to do with it they really
didn't know and they would leave and
they say things like if it could just
stay like this and that was there that
was a plan the entire week but they
slept on satin pillowcases they had head
coverings that would sometimes work you
know for them they had a certain
knowledge of certain little pin curls
here and there might help them that
morning you know so they and then get
very happy with that and they feel like
I've left this a week it still looks
pretty good if I succeed like I first
think this was something you wanted to
get into to begin um my sister had
started doing it yeah oh my sister she
was about three years older and she
actually got this shop started in my
parents home before of course I would
have and I started learning here from
her before I went to school and actually
did hair of that stuff I mean I knew the
styles then that I could do in the
beauty school you did actually didn't
work on people so that was the way that
went and it worked out very well in both
of it in that era people knew they
needed their hair style in business was
pretty much you had every week you would
do the same people same time of day you
were booked solid if you were newly out
of school because they thought we
probably knew the new styles and that
was very important everyone to be very
current and you would go out and just
like Mad Men we were coming about those
very
Styles I did I think about every I think
about Jill when I think of madmen I
think of every women of man I think if
anybody watches it too you think about
Joan and they're always done the outfit
is fitting with an end everything is
precise and you feel like everything has
just been so thought about and it's also
feminine oh yes I never the nice look it
was a nice time but you were everyone
that did not fit everyone I mean that
look even people wanted to branch out as
they do now today and be who they were
and show their personality and this way
you were kind of confined confined like
there were three people that wore the
same hairstyle they didn't even maybe
look like or it wasn't terribly suitable
for them but that's what they did they
saw their neighbor with if they wanted
you know
well it's interesting it's interesting
and thank you for giving us a look into
what it was like to be in beauty in in
those days and if anybody else has any
stories to tell if we've got any viewers
that are like my mom's age that have
some memories of that to share in the
comments section and we can talk about
it some more so thank you so much thanks
for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
