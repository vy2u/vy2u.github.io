where Tyler is going to do some cooking
Oh baking even what are you gonna be
baking strawberry shortcake and you're
gonna be doing it in a special way right
it's going to be gluten free Tyler's had
some stomach related issues and so we're
gonna try out some gluten-free cooking
actually he's been eating gluten free
for about three weeks
oh well now so we're gonna be continuing
with that theme through this dessert and
I will be enjoying the result exactly
hope you enjoy they dude so we're making
this recipe for strawberry shortcake
that's on the back of this Bisquick
gluten free box sleep two and third cups
of the mix this is Bowl cam got a few
desserts in my repertoire in your
wheelhouse
what are your favorite what are your
best desserts my cheesecake my French
silk pie that's right he can bake that's
what it says to me third and Tyler's
being careful not to screw it up because
he knows he's wrong right now that won't
look too deep into the cabinets because
as you can fear they're not extremely
user-friendly organized right now I'm
glad you gave it a smell first to make
sure no I guess smell and a wipe out
with the hand oh he's going for the
paper towel all right what are you going
to do I'm beating up three eggs awesome
quarter cup sugar in there quarter cup
sugar for all who are closely following
this recipe right now nice guns Oh
cupcake cupcake it's carrying her toy
cake er how much milk will read that I
have to go out of my way to say milk
because everybody acute you and mom and
everybody accuses me of saying milk Oh
milk and pillow
instead of pillow and pink instead of
pink 3/4 milk into the weapons Tyler
sniff test has been proven to be quite
quite effective here's the look at the
recipe that looks amazing I'm gonna
measure out half a teaspoon of vanilla
putting that in with the wet ingredients
we probably just had enough left for all
right let's check double check here make
sure that's everything and good cook
always double checks that motto
somewhere a good cook always a sniff
test and be double checks this is a
whisk
you learn about that in the culinary
school so your grandma made some pretty
good desserts up in North Dakota did she
not she did she was a pretty stud Baker
stud Baker what was the best thing she
made a vanilla cake she called the
old-fashioned cake that was just awesome
for a while it's legend legend wait for
it dary wait for it if you're lactose
intolerant dairy How I Met Your Mother
fans'll 1/3 cup of butter which I need
2/3 cup of butter which is not even half
the butter stick has a sweet little mark
letting you know where the third look
Cap'n what's your current favorite song
right now Tyler probably J Lo's on the
floor halo and pitbull about Enrique I
don't know I can't remember that's
interesting like cutting butter and
flour okay so you've got your butter
into some smaller pieces and now that's
gonna join the dry ingredients I have a
feeling this might take a while
nope I think I'm gonna show this whole
thing to everybody painstaking process
okay maybe I might add a bit is your
favorite How I Met Your Mother character
you gotta love Barney I mean Barney is
so entertaining I like Marshall too
though I've been compared to Marshall by
multiple people multiple people
including my sister and your sister yeah
those are the two I think we're good hmm
maybe they're a little high safe is that
how it's supposed to look I think so
I basically do desserts and grilling
little chunky looking that's the butter
lots of peeps in anticipation of Easter
all right I think we're getting ready to
dollop you should do six six out of that
okay so this is gonna be fairly
good-sized right six mounds that will
become short cakes
what was that hmm
there they go into the oven shortcake
only ten minutes
there's no until golden brown sitting on
them that's problem good make up the
strawberry sauce uh-huh and then we're
gonna do homemade whipped cream wowza
that's a knife everybody getting
sharpened this guy's here's cutting fake
butcher steered these aren't exactly the
best looking strawberries ever but I'd
like to say you know what I'm doing here
but I'm just slicing them right just
slice no real instruction here alright
so with my help we got all of these
strawberries done yeah just gonna sweep
them up a little bit
quarter cup of sugar correct
I could probably do some Splenda type
things or artificial sweetener but we're
just trying this for the first time
there's no real reason so I think you're
gonna stir that up and you're gonna find
that the moisture from off of these
strawberries is gonna kind of make its
own little syrup
see so we got here ready set go
look at those big bit more time you
might want to rotate them
it really is heavy you're not just
playing are you all right we're getting
ready to do some whipping cream make a
lot of whipping cream we may just have
to eat a lot of it it's possible bottoms
looking at look good
nicely done milady
booyah hunter now do all right here we
go we're moving fast we're moving fast
vanilla there's not much less than I'm
always gonna eyeball in it we're
officially to eyeball in it stage okay
we're gonna take this here bowl just got
this shadow - grandma no syrupy
strawberries we got this shortcake
it's really good I like that I feel I
won't keep the entire bowl of that guy
like the spoon interesting fact heavy
cream does not have any protein or carbs
in it it does not relevant fat partyin
partyin partyin partyin she's been
trying to get that to happen for weeks
and it finally worked finally worked
partyin partyin partyin partyin alright
everybody here is the finished product
how scrumptious to those look what do
you think I feel look awesome I think
you did an amazing job from all right
here we go now you cut basically real
quickly before that bite you cut those
we layered whipped cream and
strawberries in between put the top on
and then made it a little decorative top
exactly
alright here we go gluten free
