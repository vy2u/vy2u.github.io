today so I thought I would take the
camera along with me and first off shoot
a little outfit of the day so we're
gonna try this out here I'm gonna sit my
camera down and I'll show you the top
part first because this is a maxi dress
so I've got my little um jeans jacket on
because it actually is raining out but
otherwise this is just a tube top and it
appears kind of plain you know from this
view because it is black but if I back
up down the hallway here not sure how
much you can still see but it is
actually it has like this big floral
print that goes all the way down so I'll
just lift it up and show you so that's
what's kind of on the bottom it's really
pretty it's very tropical see me I got
this at Macy's and I just love it I
think it makes me actually look a little
taller than I actually am so I enjoy it
I'm just wearing some little like wedge
shoes that have kind of a black
crisscross thing going on we're on our
way to do some shopping and guess what
to get to some good stores we have to go
a good teal teal liner on the bottom I'm
enjoying that I think it's good what do
you think
on salutely football t-shirt on and
one pair of khaki shorts awesome I
always wear the LX wear maybe we should
get you another pair do you think bad
idea
Tyler is like the kind of guy you have
to prompt him like do you need some new
clothes do you do want something new
because otherwise he doesn't like seek
it out he's not like let's do some
clothes shopping I don't think I've ever
heard Tyler say that it's probably
because I've never said it since he's so
rarely get the chance to get breakfast
we're going through some drive-thru
action here don't you hate it when you
get lipstick on your sandwich I think
you got gypped I think you're supposed
to have two sausages on there hmm I got
a biscuit Tyler has a little phrase that
he likes to say about biscuits and we're
going around the curling queue right now
no this is the Tyler's Ford Fusion
I love the satellite radio that tells
you who's singing isn't that awesome
if we were any the Jets
Wynonna Naomi what's really cool is at
nighttime there's little lights that
come on that can you can make like pink
or blue or something and you can look
out the top dude oh my god it cuz it
gets better gas mileage is biscuit
eating bulldog yeah but I can't remember
it for right now
but they said the woman comes in which
is like chewing the guy out let you son
of a biscuit eating Bulldog orbits and
so you'll call me Ella hello there so
call me of is feeding bulldog he'll call
cupcake a biscuit eating bull up or just
biscuit eater or the other day Tyler
just started calling me biscuit I said
what is this nickname super interesting
story huh I think it's awesome
will resume soon with more stories we're
gonna get some gas right no where are we
gonna get it from whoa how do you set
your mind to
different one
we are loves or as Tyler always says
love's not there getting gas somewhere
bathroom real quick to be anything no
thanks though you will what a gentleman
that one guy was wondering looking at me
funny over there wondering why I was
shooting a video maybe he watches Beauty
broadcast and he wanted to be on the
latest ms world I really don't know I
get almost like anxiety on the road
around said ice sometimes when they
can't stay in their Lane when their
whether they're drifting off the side of
the road or like into the middle you
know it really makes me question whether
or not they are awake I don't know what
else scares me all these double Becker's
deals anybody have nightmares about one
of those sliding off into your car yeah
I do
it's a little Brie
and so I just talk
hello honker so I just like the oppa
pick up a few things I thought I might
just show you now I'll throw it in the
car
I got this it's the freshwater mist
scent and it smells so good it was Tyler
approved I always asked Tyler if he
likes the any fragrance I'm thinking
about just cuz you know he'll be
smelling it too right so if this smells
so good it's just so fresh and it's kind
of like I am liking since like this that
are really just light and clean and I
like my philosophy intergration
but I thought so I don't since that
one's more expensive and I don't want to
use it up to us like then I'll have this
that it's a little cheaper but still you
know really fresh sentence that's some
more I'll or lashes these are a little
more dramatic these are intense so and
they also sold something new that I
hadn't seen before in terms of false
eyelashes they had doubles so you had
like even thicker lashes like they had a
second strip almost attached to it so
that's kind of cool I got some of this
hemp's pimp's lotion because I was
reading about it and what was it in
style or something like Katy Perry likes
this lotion because it smells like
bananas and it does smell so good that's
it really fresh and yummy so I got a
little one of that cuz the big one was
like 27 bucks and I'm like I don't know
if I'll like it that much
essence has some new lip glosses so this
has a really unusual applicator if I had
my other hand I would show you but I'll
show you sometime in a video I'm sure
got this splash proof sealer eyeshadow
base so thought that might be good if I
use any of my loose shadows or quarters
or things like that and the other thing
I got oh next had a BOGO thing going on
I've got this High Definition I shadow
base because you know who knows maybe
that's an maybe I turn out to like this
even better than Palladio which I always
go on and on about and then I thought
this would be fun to review nude lip
gloss what do you think about that
mm-hmm and we continue on hey everybody
so look what I got yeah I was so excited
when I saw this at Sephora I did not
even know this really existed but the
idea here it's so cool
like I love the concept the question is
is whether or not the shadows and the
products are good quality to match up
with that but basically all these all
these shadows come out all those shadows
there are some lip colors there might be
some green shadows or liners there's
some blushes blushes maybe bronzers
highlighters whatever and there's this
little tool there that I guess let's
help you get them out of their slots
then you get this separate compact that
you can take out and check it out they
all just go right in there so they
magnetized in so I mean we've heard
about stuff from like Coastal Scents
they have the hot pods and whatnot but I
thought it was just such a neat concept
that you can use it all just as one big
pallet or what's really cool for me is
like when I go to work
and I am you know just using a few
shades and just have room in my makeup
bag for one little thing I can use that
and then otherwise it actually fits back
right in there and its own little spot
so I was so excited when I saw that said
I think I'm gonna have a good time
switching out the stuff and I'll
definitely review this and let you know
if the shadows serve if it's worth it
what'd you get
he's picking stuff out of his teeth he's
always got line of splicers in his mouth
I got a pair of Under Armour golf shorts
you like Under Armour here great I do I
do it fair yeah it's a little more
expensive than most stuff but it's
really good quality I've never had
anything wear out and I bought from
Under Armour so she is shoes shorts
shirts
well in case you can't tell one half of
this car is having a party in the other
half
oh good girl
you're very good yes
see she's had she had her soft paws for
a few months when we first got her and
now she's just got a regular claws and
she's good about using her a little
scratcher and not scratching on other
things so good cupcake Oh
Oh stretchy baby yes you say bye
everyone
bye everyone bye cupcake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
