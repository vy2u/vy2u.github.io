Adventures of Emily and Tyler nice
sunglasses there bubs thank you cute
we're headed up to Bloomington Normal
area in Illinois yeah it's actually a
city called normal I was expecting some
sort of reaction there but that's fine
anyways we are going to the Illinois
Broadcasters Association silver dome
Awards which is kind of like for the
state of Illinois these are the big
awards for people in news so I was
nominated for one this year I was
nominated for Best anchor so we'll see
what happens it would be a really big
deal if I'd to me if I did win but I'm
not getting my hopes in today said stay
positive and I'm like I'll just stay
negative and be surprised if something
amazing happens it's a lovely day
outside right now we had to leave our
sweet cupcake which Tyler always hates
she was acting out while she doing a
self-destructive running all around
bumping into stuff bumping into walls
walls and door frames crazy so I have a
feeling she is very calm when we're not
around but I think she totally shows off
for us when we're there so I love when
semis pass other semis not thanks
seriously liking all of them just get on
the same page and decide that there's a
standard suite they should all drive
they never have to pass each other have
any semi drivers out there watch my
videos they probably like hate me a
bunch of people asked during my last
video if we were from Texas who were in
Texas no said no in that video we were
in southern Illinois driving to st.
Louis and now we're in southern Illinois
driving to like central Illinois are you
pointing out our tour guide there are
many trees some grass and some crops and
plenty of so much semi so do you think
these do you want to make any bets or
predictions on whether or not I win this
thing
smart money is on you to win though
we're going up against the perennial
favorite that's right we're going up
against the Caesar shirt edge sort of
the dark horse
hi I would be the dark horse
I'd need to see the Oz before I knew
place you're not even gonna call it
valiant handicapped Haven handicaps
don't read too much into this I want to
just want a little confidence based
around Irwin you look very nice in that
shade of blue I frequently I'm gonna get
about 50 to 60 percent more compliments
when I wear blue really who's out who's
out there complimenting you a room like
men women what's the men to women ratio
I would say about all women maybe should
wear less blue then
oh you're so innocent I am taking I'm
taking predictions on whether or not I'm
going to win this thing
what do you say all predictions I had
boy 2005 you had to put like would you
bet a certain amount of money that I
will or but when I will bet you you
don't worry you'll bet me 50 dollars
that what thank you will win okay I
don't know I got Tyler here don't you
and I look forward to making another
video yeah what's the next one going to
be people want you your live name thank
you give me death people if it wants me
to and if so what would be disgusting
well I know some people want like your
favorite makeup products your
calculator love you too bye hi hi hello
so we have a lovely room that's very
nice what you just deluxe accommodation
would you show people around sure um so
this is a big window first off yeah they
won't know we're seeing a very nice
construction project I'm sure it's gonna
be lovely
Sam knew a lot of things about three
different spots that's exciting
did you notice how it said when we were
driving around it said normal conference
center because the town is called normal
folks the abnormal conference I know
that's what I'm thinking
a nice desk here that's where we can do
work and while we're here hey mr. gromek
chair nice touch flat-screen TV
kind of swivel nice bed of a door to our
neighbors to sweets I did figure out
who's over there
okay what's overhearing our breakfast
nook nice well isn't this lovely
close it oh well what do we have in the
closet
got it looks like a Tyler suit and some
options for me got a black dress and
some coral a colored things I'm trying
to say if I want to do like blazer type
jacket or sweater we'll see decisions
decisions how about the bathroom
bathrooms are very important when it
comes to hotels this is nice brightly
lit and my eye goes straight to the
makeup mirror noted here I've got all my
stuff nice little trim
nice-looking shower nice-looking
showerhead all right
hey guys all right we are all ready to
go I'm wearing a black dress it's kind
of short has just short sleeves I really
it was hard to come up with what to wear
because the person I was talking to you
was saying like don't work hawk tail
dresses but you know some people do our
dresses so I just wore something that I
thought I might way to work
and I thought that might work I got this
chunky like turquoise necklace that I
sometimes wear I think it came from
Claire's or Kohl's or something like
that here's Tyler Tyler what are you
wearing he's gonna have a suit on sue
the time and the shirt nice actually a
hand-me-down from all but when you do a
little black dress that's not too
complicated this is good so we're gonna
head down now hope we win and back I won
best anchor for medium market television
in Illinois so I'm super excited this
was really unexpected they called my
name and they ran a little clip of what
I entered to to get this and I was just
really shocked because one of the other
people in my category was so
experienced and has won this multiple
time so to actually when this I was so
pumped so yay for them he's desperately
trying to order pizza so I was texting
pup towards the end of the event and she
said you me and cupcake need to reenact
the moment so we'll have to do that okay
cupcake can do the presentation cupcake
could be the award cupcake could be miss
Ella Noi oh yeah I totally got my
picture taken with Miss Ellen Oi because
that's like they call your name and you
go over and Miss Illinois standing here
by a backdrop and you get your picture
taken and then you get your award
and we also one station of the year
jump w SI l did so that was super cool
because we're back to back on that so
it's just been a very good night guys
we're on our way back home now still so
excited not dancing around at the moment
weather update blue skies few clouds
inside call partly cloudy skies like
what do you guys think cats do when you
when you go away what do you think they
do and i think they sleep a lot more and
I think sometimes I feel like cupcake
needs more to but what do you think
that's yeah just picking out
you invited some her closest friends
hell she has bird friends she watches
so we're gonna continue on our way home
thank you so much I kind of tweeted last
night when I wanted Tyler tweeted two
people have said so many nice things on
Facebook and oh my gosh did I talk about
last night how I met a beauty
broadcasters okay I will tell the story
here real quick
we got sat down in our tables and they
were starting to bring around like
little I don't know fruit appetizer
things and this girl I wish I would have
gotten her name but I think she left a
comment on the beauty broadcast Facebook
page I need to check out but she was so
sweet and she comes up and she says I
know you from YouTube and it's so funny
because of all places you know I'm
surrounded by TV TV news people but it's
someone knows me from YouTube and she's
like I recognized Tyler and then I saw
you and she watches my videos and I was
so pumped I was like Tyler this makes my
night cupcake you like the award
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
