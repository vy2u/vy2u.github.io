and I wanted to show you guys what
cupcake has been obsessed with lately
and it is basically a sink running just
a slight trickle and she's just shall
bat her hand underneath it and she'll
try to like I think get her hand her
palm with her hand she'll try to get her
to fall what and then like lick the
water off or she'll just like splash
around it's so funny to watch what's
really cute is that she will do this
like when I'm getting when I'm in the
other bathroom and I am washing my face
we have two sinks in there so I'll be
washing my face at one and then I'll
turn the water on for her oh it's on
your head it's on your ear cupcake
she'll get the other one and it's like
okay I'm going to clean up for the night
too
if you likes to lay on that mat now
specifically this new mat that I got for
the makeup room I got it because it
matches the walls pretty perfectly well
I just saw myself in the little LCD
screen I'm like wow my lips are cracked
they're like really
they get real chapped I feel like when I
have a cold and I'm breathing out my
mouth not through much oh you did not
just pull that cupcake off of there
making trouble when you're not the
center of attention sometimes oh gosh
what is she yeah anyways as I was saying
I've had a cold for about a week now and
it's starting to taper off but I've got
the chapped lips but anyway I wore my
hair up in a bun today I did my blonde
from my bun tutorial actually and it's
so funny how light you guys see me
usually like in a bunch of different
hairdos when I'm doing my makeup videos
I just I like to vary it a lot but I
don't vary it quite as much for the news
I would say I vary it a lot more than
any other news anchor I've I watch here
locally and I'll do it inside ponytails
I'll do it in a high ponytail but I
don't do it like just totally off my
face like this all that often and so
today one of the guys is walking through
and he was like oh wow your hair looks
different today and he's and you can
totally tell like guys don't necessarily
know like what the proper reaction is
just like it's just strange you know
like like strange and I'm like different
strange any other words you want to use
he's like Oh looks good on you
you know kind of like that's the
afterthought I'm like I need to wear my
hair up like this a little more often
apparently it works so people get used
to it
by the way I've tried the crackle nail
polish actually this is it was actually
handy I got this pure ice crackle nail
polish in pink and I put it over a
silver polish from Sonia Kashuk and I
just don't know I don't know what I
think about this and it's said to put
two coats on it I'm say
how how has two coats gonna really work
with this you know like is that going to
just cover up whatever little cracks or
made the first time but so I think it
might have looked to actually a little
cooler with one coat but now it's just
got like these little fine cracks in it
and I'm just I mean I kind of think when
I glance at sometimes like wow that's
kind of cool that nail polish can do
that like it's cool that it can do it
but I don't know that I love looking at
it all the time on my nails so not sure
how long I'm gonna keep this around
maybe I would have liked a lighter color
or something like that but I feel like I
mean I guess when you first glance at it
you maybe just think I have pink nail
polish on but for me I'm like looking at
it and I'm thinking that's kind of messy
you know I have to give a shout out to
robin meade she came out with the CD of
course I also have her book here right
here in my bookshelf morning sunshine I
think it's a great great book for anyone
it really promotes like it helps you
think about self-confidence and not
worrying so much about like what other
people think of you and that kind of
thing so that's I think it's a good
message for everyone but I got her album
which recently came out and it's called
brand new day and it's got you know a
lot of original songs on it obviously a
lot of several sons that I know she
wrote but she's also got like right here
waiting which is a remake with buh-bye a
remake of dirty laundry which is kind of
funny because that's kind of that song
kind of pokes fun at the news business
but anyway um I got this on CD because I
just thought because I'm such a big
robin meade fan I need it on CD and I
also got it on my iPhone on on iTunes as
well so I actually think it's pretty
good these songs are pretty catchy it is
kind of like a country album so keep
that in mind but I love the the right
here waiting remakes you did with
buh-bye so I think that one's good I
like rain
I like the put my high heels on song
what else
morning Sunshine's good welcome home is
kind of a tribute to troops overseas
coming home so I mean it's it's a good
album and I just like it and I like the
thought that Robin is going out and
doing
something other than her news thing and
just really making a name for herself
you know with kind of a passion that she
has that his music so yeah just want to
tell you about that I got this it this
is available only at Target by the oh
yeah
I've got to tell you Tyler and I are
going to be when we get a chance it's
just been hard to find you know some
spare moments here where I'm not already
busy doing something or he's not here
kind of like today I would have shot it
with him but he wasn't here um we were
gonna do a video on our favorite snacks
some are healthy summer nota lis not
healthy and he has gotten on this thing
where he's trying like all these
different kinds of canned chili he
apparently thinks it's a great snack and
he is going to review what he thinks are
his best kinds are or are the best kind
so yep we will have that coming up in a
future Emma's the world anyway guys
thanks for watching see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
