on the road to vacation in Panama City
Florida we like the Spring Break we
never had that's what this trip is gonna
be all about I have a feeling but yeah
the reason why we're going Tyler has a
conference going on for his job so you
know I'm just tagging along so I'm gonna
have two days of hopefully assuming the
weather cooperates fun in the Sun and
just should I've never been to Florida
so I'm so excited and the beach no I
haven't said this in the ocean so this
will be a first for me
another fun aspect of this trip as we
are going through Birmingham which means
we will get to see Kaylee and so that
will be super duper fun you know I
brought my camera on this trip because
obviously I'm shooting a video on the go
but of course I have to be entertained
on this long car right so I have Tyler's
iPad and a keyboard here so I can
be keeping up with you know there's on
Facebook the latest video or whatever
anything you like to say to the people
the huddle house never been to one of
those before
we're down in Kentucky right now not
sure exactly where so tyler much of a
story with sunglasses these days I have
broken about three pairs of them so far
this maybe four I've lost you there I
stepped on one after they fell off my
head the others have just I just buy the
cheap ones usually and then $5 at the
last gasp did we stop that you'll notice
they have a lovely little detail here on
the side with a flag and it just like
looks like as blank backwards of the way
this little logo is that it says
American on it
they were however made in China I think
one of these days I'm just going to
actually go ahead and buy a quality pair
of sunglasses but for now for now I'm
just going to keep breaking five dollar
pairs just outside of Nashville I
believe and look at all the trees Wow
noise amazes me when we get into this
area just how hilly and how many trees
their eyes and an awesome bucks very
picturesque
he hasn't broken his glasses yet guys
don't work
we are now basically in Nashville as
soon as we get around this truck you can
see some of the skyline right over there
we went to Nashville probably a little
less than a year ago
and we had an awesome awesome time would
be the park where the early ballpark
where the Tennessee Titans play stay in
there
there's a nice view of
skyline's thank you this is cool it's
like we're taking everybody on the trip
with us
Alabama just standard Alabama the
beautiful as the sign said we're headed
for perving he's been incredibly windy I
had no idea these roads were so crazy
like hilly and why me I feel dizzy
Illinois does not have this stuff most
of the time it's like flat and straight
and so I'm just like not used to this
Space Needle alien spacecraft alien
space aliens just touched down this way
this is really tough to keep steady
somebody somebody can thrive great I
ain't driving straight this is gold this
is 3d gold Space Shuttle the MA
it's not a real bomb it's a manga
you're welcome everyone
we're getting dangerously close to
Florida we are we have been driving all
day through Alabama we stopped at
Birmingham it snow for 47 we got on the
road just a little bit after 6 2007 our
town for a lot right on the border
according to my map program so excited
we are so amazing this is just some kind
of Bay yeah we found some rain
are you doing Florida I'm gonna make it
yes I just it was really the brain is
just died down yeah what worse a mess
forsooth we relaxed with cleansing
breaths a little bit there I thought
they were gonna get lost right off the
road just swallowed up at the ocean and
never to be heard from again there was
some hyper planning of that I felt I
felt it too
we're very close to the ocean the real
ocean this time not some Chattahoochee
Bay attack you're watching everyone well
we made it here and this is the view
outside our hotel room it is awesome
this is the pool that's kind of right
outside and then past that there's like
a little bay area we are in Panama City
Florida and I guess further down the
coast there is some beach or how do I
get to that you know at some point
during the trip but Tyler has meetings
today so I'm going to probably be
spending a lot of time right out here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
