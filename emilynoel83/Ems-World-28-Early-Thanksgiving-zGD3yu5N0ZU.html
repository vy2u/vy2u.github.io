Thanksgiving a little early I guess I
just got a workout schedule wise I
actually will be working on Thanksgiving
doing the news so I thought I would
bring the camera along and document some
of the fun and silliness if you read my
blog if you're keeping up with my blog
posts lately you know I had a really
good week this past week so I am totally
ready for some rest and relaxation and
by the way I am wearing that lipstick
that new lipstick that I mentioned at
the end of my gift ideas video also did
my nails in the car on the way up I'm
wearing this wet and wild fast dry and
fuchsia Rama and I did two coats of that
plus top coat I was pretty impressed I
think Tyler was too have you been lately
Tyler last week or so he got my Cole
still hang around to just like to show
what I got at our stop at the gas
station this is the most delicious thing
it is a non-fat yogurt smoothie and you
could combine flavors in it and so I
chose banana and pina colada oh it's all
good
Tyler's favorite beverage you wouldn't
tell everybody about your theory on this
by the theory when you say it's better
than
oh yeah I think Melanie always better
than Mountain Dew it's subtle but you're
having mellow yellow' zero my sweet
angel my mom but little smokey kind of
glaze there's some kind of glaze huh
it's got sweet red pepper sauce we've
got peanut butter hummus its chickpeas
and peanut butter the sweet pine cone
which has not been devoured yet the
hubby said Georgia go to them lovely
centerpiece use that use that yes you
used to read it is that the thing on top
of the wreath cute and adorable little
turkey place cards this is pops cap fun
Oh cute her tail sweet dear it got legs
aren't you sweet I thought this looked
like a photo because you can see how the
background is blurred out a lot there's
fun you could see dad kids got no tail
be careful cuz we wax the steps your
little pup conveniently made the steps
lick the Motor Company and see their
slick or covered with cat hair together
Tablo pranking mama I think so swear oh
how cute with the little lights around
so you'll sit right here mm-hmm
and you'll also do your makeup here do
my makeup there I've got
I'm alley stuff in a couple of things
she is a Mallee nice Danielle the
children this is the only room that has
bright colors in it yeah it is my bright
colored refuge tones they're elegant
masculine colors changing that is the
malted crisp tart from baked
explorations and the top layer is called
diplomat cream which is like a bavarian
cream plus whipped cream together
lighter under that is milk chocolate
ganache caramelized rice krispies and
crushed up malted milk balls in a layer
like that that day and then this is a
brown-sugar crust
well poof is going to take
excuse me malted milk balls right here
and decorate it and like extra little
caramelized rice krispies and put as
many quality-control
it would be cool to have kind of a
concentration going on in the center and
then sort of waiting fo how many of
these will it take to make like the
serving size it would be about three and
then you could think well you know
cutting through that at those points I
would make a little mark through it I
would cover you know lightly and a piece
of this secret place close so that
wasn't the one you're the one I was
me I think you need to divide it into
nine equal pieces your hair looks really
shiny poof
thank you pop what products are you
using today I used Pantene Beautiful
Lengths shampoo and conditioner and just
rollers and some hairspray awesome how
did you think well these just struck me
as big owl eyes oh they are
and then each one's gonna be have it
slightly own character just like
everybody at the party just like
everyone here oh my god we're gonna make
like insert just a little owl popper and
then the Tufts insert the Tufts gently
and accurately right about thoughtfully
poised above the outer part of each eye
and each slide neverwood will have an
album place best malted crisp tart

with kind of a pumpkin glaze and also a
thing cheese frosting
dumpling it's my first time here because
