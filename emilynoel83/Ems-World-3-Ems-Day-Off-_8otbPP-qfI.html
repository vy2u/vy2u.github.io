have many ties Tyler's getting ready for
work oh and he's not feeling very well
today no I think I like like this one
see what's nice about having a day off
as I actually see you but when you're
awake before you go to work normally I
am long gone and you are seeing me on TV
do you usually watch me on the news
somebody asked that yes you do watch me
most mornings yes what's really cool is
that
I get to watch morning Express with
robin meade on days i'm not working on
headline news she's on headline news on
the weekdays so I usually don't get to
see this the reason why I took these
days off kayla was supposed to come down
I was looking forward to that but
unfortunately she had some last-minute
work obligations so that's two I had to
start his tie over I think you really
just wanted to be on camera doing it so
you're wearing a tie today are you going
to court that's cool this is a cool shot
my new nails everyone they are the
Revlon color allure nails in pink
Hawaiian because I was looking around
you know what was available at CVS the
other day and I thought I'm going to try
some colored nails instead of regular
ones so I kind of liked them I think the
color is beauty one here is the outfit
of the day I'm wearing one of these
little like longer flannel shirts that
has the tie around it can't remember if
this came from Target or maybe even
Walmart I don't quite remember
I usually wear it with black leggings
but I just thought I'd go with the jeans
for today and I believe my jeans came
from Wet Seal and then my lovely little
black moccasins and we're going to go do
some grocery shopping and just some
random errand running with this awesome
it is like 10:30 in the morning and I'm
just now emerging from the house that's
when you know it's a day off so I'm
going to I'm actually gonna be heading
to Target and I'm not moving right now
so don't worry but I'm gonna head to
Target I've been informed by many people
I'm going to say dozens of people that
elf is in their target and so I figured
if it's in everybody else's target maybe
it's in my target too so we will see
such a gray cloudy day outside the whole
weekend was like this too but at least
it's not raining yet anyway it's gotten
colder too it's way colder than I was
expecting
I walk boom there's our bright green
taxis
no but it's a just way more chilly than
it used to be I kind of was like
thinking spring was maybe here for a
while but now it's definitely not head
into target here but there are a couple
things I forgot to mention before I
meant to answer a couple questions about
the last m's world video that I did it
was the one where we went inside the TV
station
thank you guys by the way so much for
all the feedback it was like tons of
comments and just feedback on the video
so I really like that but anyway two of
the most asked questions were number one
what time do you go to bed at night and
I just totally should have mentioned
this but I usually go to bed like 6:30
or 7:00 to get up when I do so I wake up
around 1:30 to go to bed 6:30 or 7:00 so
yeah it's I mean it's tough it
definitely took some getting used to but
now that it's something that I do daily
except for days like today when I'm off
you know I it's it's something you can
definitely adjust to and then on the
weekends I kind of like on Friday so
I'll take a long nap and then I'll kind
of be ready to go back to a normal
person schedule for the rest of the
weekend the other question was are you
the only female that works there and I'm
definitely not but we have several
different shifts at the station so like
while I come in you know in the early
morning hours and we do have Paula who
does our graphics but she's in the
control room and I talked to her on
camera but she was over on the right
side of the control room there was like
zero lighting there you couldn't see a
thing so I'll have to catch Paul at like
in the hallway next time and show around
there but no we are the only females and
then on the evening shift there you know
numerous reporters anchors whatnot you
know producers that are coming in that
are female so yeah it's not just the
verdict they do have elf at my target
yeah just like you guys told me they had
a lot of the one-dollar stuff I'm gonna
say pretty much everything and then they
had
studio products there as well I mean it
was awesome like I saw it and I got so
excited and it was awesome because I go
in there and the store is so calm on a
Monday I mean I it takes me back to when
I used to anchor Saturdays and then I
had Sunday and Monday off and I would
you know go out and do my shopping and
stuff on Mondays and it is awesome
because there is like nobody there so I
was like standing there like comparing
stuff and looking everything over but I
will show you what I got the translucent
mattifying powder I wanted to try things
I had never tried before from ELF and
although I am going to need to
repurchase my contouring blush and
bronzer pretty soon but yeah this just
looks like the type of thing I could use
a lot for work just trying to reduce
shine reducing shine on my nose area is
always something I have to think about
what I'm doing the news so excited to
test that out I also got one of the
blushes this one is in blushing Rose so
it's kind of a deeper shade I feel like
a lot of blushes are just SuperDuper
light so I thought I would see if this
maybe is actually as pigmented as it
seems like it would be there in the
compact and then I got two of the single
eyeshadows one is it called wild wheat
and this I think has a little sparkle to
it but it's just kind of a light
highlight type shade and then I got a
matte color called pebble
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be Matt I
mean it's just like kind of a grayish
taupe shades look like at the ends of
the aisles and at Target I don't know if
everybody's Target stores like mine but
they have like discounted items I got
this for less than three dollars this
duo of
the Tresemme hair sprays and they're
like smaller sizes which is perfect
because I always take hairspray to work
with me you think I should just leave it
on my desk but I know for some reason
transported everyday and this would be
nice for that too I could just pop one
in my desk because it's a smaller size
and smaller to carry in my purse so
that's awesome
I got some gum to take care of those
cravings I've been having for sweet
stuff so
this looks like some good good quality
girls get out of Walmart and funny funny
thing have it I was in the area where
they have the sunless tanners and like
the sunscreen and tanning oil and all
that kind of stuff and there was this
guy around there looking at stuff like
where I was and I was looking at the
sunless tanners and whatever and he's
like do you tan and I'm like no you know
I just getting some sunless tanner he's
like well I just got a brand-new tanning
bed in my basement and then he lifts his
shirt up to expose like his entire
stomach midsection area and he's like it
just keeps burning me do you see this
and I think yeah that's too bad you know
I don't know quite what to tell you to
do and he's just like flabbergasted by
how he's sunburnt by his standing bed
and you know I mean it happens I've Dan
before it but he just you know
apparently never met a stranger and just
right in the middle of the aisle other
people are like probably thinking who
are these people but I've never watched
QVC I've watched it quite a bit
Lisa Mason is probably one of my
favorite hosts I don't order a whole lot
but I do just like to listen and hear
what they're talking about and whatever
and I just think she does a really
really good job
very likable it really knows her stuff
where the products are concerned so yeah
that's what's on follow me on Twitter
you know that that can sometimes be my
little outlet to complain about whatever
workout I'm doing at the time and I do a
lot of DVDs because just with my
schedule I feel like it's convenient for
me to just take some time in the late
afternoon hours before I shower and
stuff and do some workouts
we're just looking randomly at our
little DVD video game tower here but
I've tried a lot in the past I've done
the 10-minute solutions videos which are
you see there's a lot at Walmart I
really like the fitness ball workout if
you if you have one of those big fitness
balls that's good for that but I mean
you really need to do more than just the
10 minutes on the some of these dance
ones you need to do a few of the routine
like there's multiple routines in one of
these I think there's like five or
something on that yeah and so you need
to do several of them to really get at
work how I used to kind of think oh you
know okay there's my ten minutes but it
really wasn't doing anything for me so
that's something to think about
I've done like the Tae Bo stuff which is
really intense and I'd I mean I don't
necessarily always find it so fun but I
guess you don't always have to find
working out fun but another one that I
like probably my favorite dance workout
DVD if you like to do the dance stuff
the dance with Julianne cardio ballroom
I think this was purchased for me from
Best Buy as a Christmas gift because I
was like telling Tyler how I wanted this
because she was one of my favorites one
of my favorite pros on Dancing with the
Stars I just always thought she she was
so talented and I thought it would be
fun to kind of learn learn from her the
cha-cha is fun it really teaches you how
to work your hips and kind of you know
really learn the techniques of Latin
dance the jive is one of the most
challenging it really gets your heart
rate up sometimes if I was short on time
I would just do the cha-cha and the jive
routine and now I know the routines to
where I could just do them without the
DVD and just run through them a bunch of
times for like a super quick workout but
and then there's the passo it's the last
routine on there but she's very upbeat
even if you don't have dance experience
I think you will catch on to this DVD
okay but again that's cardio ballroom
dance with Julianne and then lately what
I've been doing are the Kim Kardashian
fit near jeans by Friday workouts and
these are really good they are probably
the most challenging workout DVDs that I
have she works with a couple of
different trainers on these I don't know
if you've heard of Jennifer Gilardi but
she is actually on one of those
10-minute solutions videos I talked
about before but she is kind of leading
you through this workout and Kim is kind
of like her student throughout the
workout and of course Kim is like still
dressed fabulously
and I mean there's three different ones
the first one that I did was the the
amazing ABS body sculpt and I just
ordered these online but I think they
sell them at cute on QVC now at a lower
price than what I got them for online so
I'll try to find a link for that for you
but this is upper body and abs really
tough workout and also you need to have
a step for these as well I got myself a
step from Walmart a Gold's Gym step for
about 30 bucks but I really like having
it because one of these one of these
entire workouts is a step workout and
that is butt-blasting cardio step and do
you kind of go through three different
step reach in skin leads you through
those but it's like it's a voiceover
she's voiced over it every teen she's
done in the past so that's a little
strange but still really fun I feel like
this one it gets your brain is thinking
so hard about like trying to keep up
with the workout that you're not quite
thinking about how tired you are so
those always help me when they're like
that and then the other one is ultimate
but body sculpt and so a couple of
routines here lots of squats lunges
things like that you also want to have
some light hand weights between anywhere
from two to five pounds probably would
be good for you especially for the arms
one I think that's pretty much the only
one that those are incorporated into but
these are really good workouts and
they're challenging and they recommend
that you do three a week and so if
you're the type like me that gets bored
really easily with the workout if you're
doing these and like you know you really
end up doing just one of these every
week so it's not like you're repeating
the same thing every single day day
after day so seems a little less
repetitive but really fun nonetheless
you will be you know they will cause you
to work up a sweat and they're
definitely put that workout it kicked my
butt it's this step workout of the three
or the Kim Kardashian workout and it's
like three separate step routines in one
and they kind of add on and it's really
hard but I mean you know it's working
something right I mean I felt it after I
did it for the first time like the
following day around the same time I was
like ah now I'm thinking why am i doing
this so doing this different stuff on my
day off
but the answer is probably because I
have time so Tyler's home hello hello so
you haven't been feeling very well at
all today
sore throat it's not fun your nose looks
a little red well I I ran some errands
for you today I went to the dry cleaning
place which was rather nice shirts
laughs good thing you went I enjoyed it
they were very nice to me there and you
had so many things that they offered to
take them out to the car for for me and
I said no I got it and then as I was
walking out the door I almost dropped
your suit so they I probably didn't need
their help so what are we gonna do I
don't know I am you Tom deep I haven't
had much all day how was court was good
things went smoothly yes that's good did
you get lots of compliments on your
outfit you get a single company miles
all day long that's just sad all right
well if you want to do a little give
give the folks a little sign-off mm-hmm
you asked me to do a sign-off last time
I don't know what to say thanks for
watching thanks for following em
throughout her day from all of us here
at ABC News here at Tyler in my
department begins have a great night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
