disclaimer that this is not Erin making

somebody wanted to know do we play
pranks on each other at work if so what

newsroom most most recently general term

David's book they used to have developed
tourism where my composition off button

fun of me for doing so
so I took drop what do you think about
American Idol
I don't know what it is about this year
but I'm totally addicted to American
Idol me too and I think it'll come down
to two women who Siobhan and Krystal we
oh really really cool I like him I like
his voice he's got a really good rock
voice but I don't think it's gonna
yeah it's coming I think he's got to
bring it I think like Simon said he's
really got a throw down you know the
next time I think this year is the year
of the woman
yeah like last year you two men this
year because he come down to it I feel
like Simon early on was a little more
harsh with them but now I feel like he's
giving a little more constructive
he's been very constructive now so I
think he's kind of wimped out a little
bit this year he's not as brutal as he
has been in the past
yeah I think Rama's actually been more
brutal this year and Simon indeed indeed
milady indeed milady thank you for your
prediction any files
