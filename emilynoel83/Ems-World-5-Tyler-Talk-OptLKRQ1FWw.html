on our way to go to lunch with my
friends Katie and Ryan from work and
also Katie's mom who is from West
Virginia and in town today so I probably
since a meet her for the first time I
probably shouldn't take the camera in
and bombard her with YouTube that
probably probably not the first thing
you should do in meeting someone
but anyway I am going to make a little
vlog out of this day and also this
makeup look that I have on I have deemed
it a work appropriate makeup look and
I've gotten a lot of questions or you
know what it what our good looks for you
know just the everyday makeup wear and
so I thought I would just do a tutorial
on it so that's coming soon it's also
another dreary day around town and gosh
we did the bumpy way didn't we sorry
guys I got some complaints about my
shoddy camerawork and I apologize but
this doesn't help but anyway I also on
my Beauty broadcast Facebook page which
passed for some questions for Tyler
because they did that whole thing with
Aaron who I work with and a lot of
people you know had questions for him
after his first video and then everybody
said hey I got some questions for Tyler
so I have taken some of those and I'm
going to ask Tyler so Tyler don't feel
pressured to look at the camera because
you are you are dry this is a question
that I get asked by people who watch me
on YouTube so much
and Ashley says being a mom I'm moist
thinking about my boys ages three and
one do you and Emily plan on having kids
in the future yes we do I don't know
when that's that's a night I mean we
don't have an exact know timeline but we
may be getting closer to its Jen from
Kelly aka pup aka my sister if you had
to choose between the ability to cut
become invisible or the power of flight
which would you choose
that is a good question
you would think on that for a second and
I'll come back to it okay
I don't wait through the pros and cons
what would be the stipulations you would
have for the power of flight
danger danger free no no
to be able to go pretty fast like
Superman fast I gonna be able to fly
coast-to-coast my ten to two minutes if
you could do that is that what you would
pick over being invisible I think so
because I think being invisible at FC
you know you hear stuff that people
don't want you to hear maybe maybe stuff
you don't want to hear you've got stuff
on your conscience and I can't tell
people it would be kind of tough to live
with
describe me in three words this is from
Rabia
the flow together three random words the
great three descriptive words
there's so many wonderful words just
three maybe if someone else was doing
the interviewing those words would be
different nobody's gonna see this
beautiful
I wanted
oh thank you that was so sweet
Thank You Ravi you just scored Tyler
some major points that it put that one
here's a question from Emily she says
have you ever said enough is enough
about Emily buying so much makeup no I
know it's really important thing to her
and just it doesn't bother me at all to
begin with no it's um
criticise or anything like that
yay I was just sitting here with my
purse over here on my lap it's kind of a
larger purse and I was realizing how
much I like to like compartmentalize my
stuff in my bag helps me find it a lot
easier and I've got this little like Qi
monkey
little mini makeup bag that came with
some lipgloss pop got me a while back
and it's really just a good way to keep
everything organized like here I put in
like little quick things I might reach
for sometimes makeup wise I've got this
lipstick there and some q-tips in some
nail glue like one of the many sizes in
case like if I'm wearing nails like I am
today and one of them would happen to
pop off I am prepared and they have also
got lip smacker in here in it's one of
the natural ones natural it's it's pink
guava interesting that's a shot of the
guava
what's guava like what does that taste
like
you think that Katie and her mom look
like look so much alike you got how she
is the way she is she burped her mom was
so funny and she could she had to drive
quite a ways to to visit Katie and I
guess she's here for a few days but it
was neat to meet her I need to get Katie
in a video sometime soon it's just hard
because she works on the weekends and
sort of like a different shift
throughout the week so I don't get to
see her as much as I'd like but we'll
get her in a video soon I didn't get to
answer a lot of those questions before
and I'm sure more might be posted so
will you answer some more of those at
another time you're not keeping any
secrets hey guys so I am back home and
I've just been cleaning cleaning my room
up putting away clothes and stuff like
that and I was also organizing some of
my jewelry and I thought I might show
you some of my favorite earrings maybe
I'll do necklaces and like other stuff
in these different Em's world videos
since they're not necessarily makeup
related and that's not really a make up
topic so I kind of feel like I can put
it in this kind of a video but I also
get some questions about my rings so I
will show you those my engagement ring
and my wedding ring here I'm thinking
about getting them actually like
soldered together so they always stay
straight because the diamonds don't go
all the way around this ring they're
just kind of in the front but it's kind
of neat it's kind of like a cute
detailed ring I did I had nothing to do
with the picking out of the engagement
ring Tyler just kind of did that all on
his own and I kind of liked that I liked
that it was you know he picked out
something that he thought was special
and that he really liked so yeah I love
it too so and I think it's kind of
pretty with just all the stones there
but I may get those like like I said
kind of put together so they're kind of
as one instead of twisting and that kind
of thing then on my other hand this was
the first ring that Tyler gave me
by the way this is white gold all of
these I believe that I have here are
white gold and diamonds but this is the
first ring he gave me and I think he
gave it to me when we were in high
school it's got the three stones there
and this is sort of I guess what you'd
call a promise ring although I don't
think he was really sure like it was
like so what is this and I think you
were he's like well like it's a promise
ring I guess but it's really pretty I've
always worn it um on my ring finger on
my right hand I really like that and
then this ring was a Christmas gift from
I think at some point while we were in
college and it's really pretty it has
three little diamonds there around it
and kind of like a cute wraparound sort
of design so that's sort of my everyday
ring thing if I like you don't want to
use some kind of more of a fun ring I
might you know take one or two of these
off but pretty much on a regular basis
these are the ones that your rings and
stuff I kind of store them all in these
like it's these little you can kind of
see through it but like clear tacklebox
type things so they all have different
sections on the inside and so you can
put them put them in there and kind of
divide them depending on color and all
that stuff and then this slides into
sort of a stackable thing where there's
more than one I think I may have showed
that in a video a long time ago but I
pulled out some that I was just kind of
putting away here and then I realized oh
I wear all of these kind of a lot so I
go for more like quantity and variety in
terms of my earrings then I guess
quality or like really expensive stuff a
lot of these things come from Claire's
these are really cute they're like a
gold earring but they've got these cute
little like wooden bead things on there
so that's one of my favorite earrings
what else do we have I love these studs
these came from New York and company and
they're really cute they're like little
little disco balls but they're all like
kind of like a turquoise colored stone
and just I wear these a lot just like
your classic I'm kind of somewhat jumbo
size stud and I also like having these
little studs in black kind of a black
onyx
looking stone they're very easy to wear
and match two different things these are
fun for like going out and stuff I love
how these kind of catch the light it's
like sort of a dangly one of the bigger
earrings that I have but they're really
really cute what else
oh these these came in like there's one
other set that came in this trio from
Claire's and these are just cute kind of
dangly silvery earrings I feel like I
can wear these on the air sometimes and
they just really they're pretty they
catch the light and they're just kind of
a fun shape there these are kind of a
formal type earring although I do wear
these to work as well it's like a little
chain and it's got that pretty little
like rhinestone circle dangle at the end
so I love wearing those um these are fun
these jumbo just like metal well silvery
looking studs they are these are
actually really really pretty and I like
how you know I have dark hair and I have
long hair but sometimes when they speak
through again they really just kind of
pick up on the light and just really
look good so I like those jumbo ones you
can find those almost anywhere I think I
got mine from Claire's again where most
of this stuff came from as did these
these are so fun I like wearing these
kind of silver and turquoise looking
hoop type dangle with I think it looks
great with coral clothes or like a crisp
white shirt and then you throw those on
it looks really good and then gold on I
have any of you wearing gold earrings
right now that I like but these are kind
of like they look like little feathers
really pretty and dangly and you know
earrings are fun to wear like kind of
when your hair is up and you can really
showcase them but then there's some of
these that are just had that really
pretty sparkle to wear it they kind of
peak through when your hair is down and
it looks really nice I tweeted about
these flip-flops that I got somewhat
recently they're by Under Armour and
they've got that great light kind of
squishy lack of a better word kind of
like foam in there and it's not really
like memory foam because it always sort
of Springs
even after you wear these for a long
time the cushion springs back up so it's
like every time you put your foot in it
it feels really nice and cushiony again
and I found him at Dick's Sporting Goods
and they're by Under Armour and they're
the armor form Custom Fit cushioning and
um I saw some there from other brands
and they looked good too but the only
difference with these was the the
cushioning really goes right out to the
edge it's not just under like the inner
part of the foot it's all over and
they're really really comfortable and
they've got a good soul with like some
nice traction on there and I mean
they're they're thick enough on the
bottom you don't feel like you're just
walking right on the pavement there but
they're just really comfortable it's one
of those things you just kind of feel
them and you think oh those would
probably feel good on your feet and then
you actually put them on and you're like
glued to them so I really really love
these sandals and I would definitely
recommend them to folks especially if
you're like me and you wear you know
less comfortable shoes throughout your
workday and then you come home and you
put these on and they're almost better
than like slippers I mean they're really
comfortable and good you know good comfy
shoe as you head into summer well thank
you guys so much for tuning in for this
m's world video I know it's kind of
another dreary day it seems like most
days that I do these the weather is just
not very pleasant out but I promise we
do have Sun where I live at times but
thanks again for tuning in I hope you
found this video fun and maybe a little
informative in some ways and I will
definitely keep doing more in the future
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
