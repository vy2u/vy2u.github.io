on our way to go to lunch with my
friends Katie and ryan from work and
also katie small who is from West
Virginia and in town today so I probably
since am eager for the first time I
probably shouldn't take the camera in
and bombard her with you youtube that
probably probably not the first thing
you should do in meeting someone now
remember to vote but anyway I am going
to make a little vlog out of this day
and also this makeup look that I have on
I have deemed it a work appropriate
makeup look and I've gotten a lot of
questions or you know what it what our
good looks for you know just the
everyday makeup where and so I thought I
would just do a tutorial on it so that's
coming soon it's also another dreary day
around town and gosh we took the bumpy
wait didn't we sorry guys I got some
complaints about my shotty camera work
and I apologize but this doesn't help
but anyway I also on my beauty broadcast
facebook page past for some questions
for Tyler because I did that whole thing
with Aaron who I work with and a lot of
people you know had questions for him
after his first video and then everybody
said hey I got some questions for Tyler
so I've taken some of those i'm going to
ask tyler similar
I don't feel pressured to look at the
camera because you are so you are dry
this is a question that I get asked by
people who watch me on youtube so much
and Ashley says being a mom I'm always
thinking about my boys ages 3 and 1 do
you and Emily plan on having kids in the
future yes we do I don't know when
that's that's what I'd say I mean we
don't have an exact no timeline but we
might be getting closer to question from
Kelly aka pup AKA my sister if you had
to choose between the ability to cut
become invisible or the power of flight
which would you choose
that is a good question
you want to think on that for a second
and I'll come back to it right moment
okay I don't wait through the pros and
cons well will be this stipulation you
would have for the power of flight
Danger Danger free no no
13 but I want to be able to go pretty
fast like super megafest am I going to
be able to fly
coast to coast my 10 22 minutes if you
could do that is that what you would
pick over being invisible I think so
because I think being invisible and FC
you know you hear stuff that people
don't want you to hear maybe and maybe
stuff you don't want to hear you've got
stuff on your stuff on the back and
then I can't tell people cuz I heard it
when I was convinced it would be kind of
tough to live with you're right
describe me in 3 words this is from
rabia
I have to flow together history random
words too worried three descriptive
words
hey there's so many wonderful words just
re- someone else was doing the
interviewing those words would be
different if nobody's been see this
beautiful
I want to do
funny oh thank you that was so sweet
thank you i'll be you just scored Tyler
some major points today with that one
here's a question from Emmaline she says
have you ever said enough is enough
about Emily buying so much makeup nope
I'm not I know it's really important
thing to her so I
and doesn't it doesn't bother me at all
to begin with that I know it's important
to know
criticize or anything like that
yay I was just sitting here with my
purse over here on my lap it's kind of a
larger purse and I was realizing how
much I like to like compartmentalize my
stuff in my bag it helps me find it a
lot easier and I've got this little like
tea mochi
Oh Minnie makeup bag that came with some
lip gloss pub got me a while back and
it's really just a good way to keep
everything organized like here I put in
like little quick things I might reach
for sometimes makeup-wise I've got this
lipstick there and some q-tip sent some
nail glue like one of the many sizes in
case like if I'm wearing nails like I am
today at one of them would happen to pop
off I am prepared and they have also got
a lip smacker in here in it's one of the
natural ones natural it's it's pink
guava interesting that's a shot of the
guava what's guava like what does that
taste like
you think that Katie and her mom looked
like looked so much alike mannerisms
mannerisms that you can see where Kizzy
got how she is the way she is she were
mom was so funny and she who is she had
to drive quite ways to to visit Katie
and I guess she's here for a few days
but it was neat to meet her I need to
get Katie in a video sometime soon it's
just hard because she works on the
weekends and sort of like a different
shift throughout the week so I don't get
to see her as much as I'd like but we'll
get her in a video soon I didn't get to
answer a lot of those questions before
and I'm sure more might be posted so
will you answer some more of those at
another time I will I'm an open book you
know keeping any secrets very few see
hey guys so I am back home and I've just
been cleaning cleaning my room up
putting away clothes and stuff like that
and I was also organizing some of my
jewelry and I thought I might show you
some of my favorite earrings maybe I'll
do necklaces and like other stuff in
these different m's world videos since
they're not necessarily makeup related
and that's not really a makeup topic so
I kind of feel like I can put it in this
kind of a video but I also get some
questions about my rings so i will show
you those my engagement ring and my
wedding ring here i'm thinking about
getting them actually like soldered
together so they always stay straight
because the diamonds don't go all the
way around this ring they're just kind
of in the front but it's kind of neat
it's kind of like a cute detailed ring I
did I had nothing to do with the picking
out of the engagement ring Tyler just
kind of did that all on his own and I
kind of like that I like that it was you
know he picked out something that he
thought was special and that he really
liked so and yeah I love it too so and I
think it's kind of pretty with just all
the stones there but i may get those
like like I said kind of put together so
they're kind of as one instead of
twisting and that kind of thing then on
my other hand this was the first ring
that Tyler gave me
by the way this is white gold all of
these i believe that i have here are
white gold and diamonds and but this was
the first ring he gave me and i think he
gave it to me when we were in high
school it's got the three stones there
and this is sort of i guess what you'd
call a promise ring although i don't
think he was really sure like it was
like so what is this and i think he was
like well like it's a promise ring i
guess but and its really pretty I've
always worn it um on my ring finger on
my right hand I really like that and
then this ring was a Christmas gift from
I think at some point while we were in
college and its really pretty it has
three little diamonds there around it
and kind of like a cute wraparound sort
of design so that's sort of my everyday
ring thing if I like you don't want to
use some kind of more of a fun ring I
might you know take one or two of these
off but pretty much on a regular basis
these are the ones that your rings and
stuff I kind of store them all in these
like it's these little you can kind of
see through it but like clear tackle box
type things so they all have different
sections on the inside and so you can
put them to put them in there and kind
of divide them depending on color and
all that stuff and then this slides into
sort of a stackable thing where there's
more than one I think I may have showed
that in a video a long time ago but I
pulled out some that I was just kind of
putting away here and then I realized oh
I where all of these kind of a lot so um
I go for more like quantity and variety
in terms of my earrings then I guess
quad here like really expensive stuff a
lot of these things come from Claire's
these are really cute they're like a
gold earring but they've got these cute
little like wooden bead things on there
so that's one of my favorite ear rings
what else we have I love these studs
these came from new york and company and
they're really cute they're like little
little disco balls but they're all like
kind of like a turquoise colored stone
and just I wear these a lot just like
your classic I'm kind of somewhat jumbo
sized stud and i also like having these
little studs in black kind of a black
onyx
looking stone they're very easy to wear
and match two different things these are
fun for like going out and stuff that I
love how these kind of catch the light
it's like sort of a dangly one of the
bigger earrings that I have but they're
really really cute what else oh these
these came in like there's one other set
that came in this trio from Claire's and
these are just cute kind of dangly
silvery ear rings I feel like I can wear
these on the air sometimes and they just
really they're pretty they catch the
light and they're just kind of a fun
shape there these are kind of a formal
type earring although I do wear these to
work as well it's like a little chain
and it's got that pretty little like
rhinestone circles angle at the end so I
love wearing those um these are fun
these jumbo just like metal well silvery
looking studs they are these are
actually really really pretty and I like
how you know I have dark hair and I have
long hair but sometimes when they speak
through again they really just kind of
pick up on the light and just really
look good so I like those jumbo and she
can find those almost anywhere i think i
got mine from Claire's again where most
of the stuff came from as did these
these are so fun I like wearing these
kind of silver and turquoise looking
hoop type dangle with I think it looks
great with coral clothes or like a crisp
white shirt and then you throw those on
it looks really good and then gold on I
have any wearing gold earrings right now
that i like but these are kind of like
they look like little feathers really
pretty and dangly and you know earrings
are fun to wear like kind of when your
hair's up and you can really showcase
them but then there's some of these that
are just had that really pretty sparkle
to where they kind of peek through when
your hair is down and it looks really
nice I tweeted about these flip-flops
that I got somewhat recently there by
under armour and they've got that great
light kind of squishy I for lack of a
better word I'm kind of like foam in
there and it's not really like memory
foam because it always sort of springs
back
even after you wear these for a long
time the cushion springs back up so it's
like every time you put your foot in it
it feels really nice and cushiony again
and I found him at Dick's Sporting Goods
and thereby under armour and there the
armor form custom-fit cushioning and I
saw some there from other brands and
they looked good too but the only
difference with these was the the
cushioning really goes right out to the
edge it's not just under like the inner
part of the foot it's all over and
they're really really comfortable and
they've got a good soul it like some
nice traction on there and I mean
they're they're thick enough on the
bottom you don't feel like you're just
walking right on the pavement there but
they're just really comfortable as one
of those things you just kind of feel
them and you think oh those would
probably feel good on your feet and then
you actually put them on and you're like
glued to them so i really really love
these sandals and i would definitely
recommend them to folks especially if
you're like me and you where you know
less comfortable shoes throughout your
work day and then you come home and you
put these on and they're almost better
than like slippers i mean they're really
comfortable and good you know good comfy
shoe as you head into summer thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this m's
world video I know it's kind of another
dreary day it seems like most days that
I do these the weather is just not very
pleasant out but I promise we do have
Sun where i live at times but thanks
again for tuning in i hope you found
this video fun and maybe a little
informative in some ways and i will
definitely keep doing more in the future
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
