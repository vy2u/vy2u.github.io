look at some houses right right we are
going to get because we are house
hunting now I don't know if everybody
knows that but we are looking around
quite a bit right now we're going to get
lunch with pup my sister and her husband
Jeff because they're coming through town
on their way back from Memphis and also
what else we're going to do Oh later in
this video
I'm going to address some of the random
things that people ask about in my
videos like what's that painting behind
you or what's that ticking noise in the
background of some of your videos or
who's that guy walking around in the
background videos so I think so here is
my outfit of the day today just wearing
some jeans and kind of a casual black
shirt here that I really like it's
really soft and kind of a stretchy
fabric and it has this neat little stud
detailing on it I got it from TJ Maxx
this scarf is like a super lightweight
scarf not really like a you know your
typical winter scarf but this has like a
black and white leopard print and I got
that for about five bucks or three bucks
from Dollar General my jeans I've just
had these for awhile just you know
typical blue jeans and then just some
slide in black shoes that are kind of
comfortable to walk around wearing this
cute watch that I got from Kohl's it
kind of has like a you know fake
leathery looking band on it there and
the twelve is kind of like had some sort
of rhinestone studs on it I really like
it I got it from Kohl's it wasn't very
expensive if I don't give a lot of
narration during the house hunt portion
of this video
it's just because I don't want our
real-estate agent Debbie to think I'm
crazy I don't know if she keeps up with
the m's world videos I'm just not sure
it's not really like the first thing I
say what I meet people hey check out my
you do the initial ask if she's in this
part of its world maybe so he went to
several houses checking them out we've
been on a little bit of a house hunt for
a few weeks now and one of the ones we
saw was one that we've looked at once
before and we were at first pretty
interested in but now we're not social
foodies
when we visited once before
the walls
yeah this is what you're getting for
your dining room
basically right in here
right here oh okay because of this light
here and they're just using it as the
whole living another little bit and
minor so this would be a main bedroom
this was decent size
I remember liking the storage aspects in
this one a lot they sent this up as an
office full bathroom space upstairs
mural here - another big closet storage
space off this big rock up it's got the
neat little window and the light then we
saw one that is currently occupied by a
really cute older lady
but we weren't totally nuts about all
the mint green carpet that was
everywhere in the entire house I love
this house there were my son lives what
the kitchen
you don't got me in here well I'm here
yeah here I'll be a before you oh you
got it now get across can open the door
no man it's work at the hospital no I
work at channel 3 Oh
we saw a house that we really really
liked and it really fits us and our
needs right now in a lot of ways so yeah
take a look this is kind of a neat
opening and then this would be like it
dining room area yeah I like how open
this is
right through here
well a porch swing back there too
oh look nice in the back oh my goodness
what is this a gigantic closet oh my
gosh that is big but more impressed I
already get your so much news right
things ever pace for a little duck
what's over here another bedroom I like
the size of the closet I think it's
definitely spacious for sure
yeah it does have a real high ceiling
cute little entryway jeffer here couple
of days studios the Civil Rights Museum
today is actually the 42nd anniversary
of Martin Luther King's death and you're
surveying the barbecue
and yeah we're going to something to see
if it's in fact
party went out is this a script Tyler's
here home is I'm avoiding it I've had
the future of but what will you have
much involvement with I think I'll just
be a very loving woman for the next era
Memphis cozy corner well there are a lot
of moments in my pictures where you may
see something random or there's
something in the background or there's
just something that is bringing repeated
comments and questions that you may see
in my videos from time to time so today
I am going to run down some of those and
basically let you know what's going on
in the background of my videos first
things is this paddle right here behind
me and that is actually from the
sorority I was in in college to Monmouth
College in Illinois and it was actually
founded Pi Beta Phi is that's what these
Greek letters stand for was actually
founded there at Monmouth and we get
these from our big sis in our sorority
so Shannon was mine and so she that
that's kind of like what is passed down
from big sister little sister always
kept around and I just like having it
here in my little makeup room another
thing I'll get asked about is sometimes
if there's a little like dead air time
in my videos maybe at that moment when
I'm not talking and I'm sitting here at
my desk doing tutorials you may hear a
little ticking noise and that is
actually the clock that is nearby above
my desk there it is yep that's my clock
sorry if you hear it ticking and if it
annoys you I apologize also when I'm
sitting here doing my makeup tutorials
and I'm doing my makeup you might see me
like looking down into this little
her to get really up close and it
doesn't have a compact attached so you
can really hold it close and look right
in it and what this is is actually a
powder from philosophy it's a mineral
powder called the supernatural and the
lid just has this little mirror on it so
it's actually one of these kind of like
puff style you know like powder
foundations honestly I don't really like
the product very much but it's really
kind of made itself worthwhile to me in
terms of that little mirror that I just
always keep out and it's just the first
thing I pick up whenever I use it I just
don't think the powder has a ton of
coverage and so anyway I do like the
weird thing that I do get questions on
is if I'm sitting here at this couch and
I am you know doing a video or something
you may see like a little corner like
about that much of this picture frame
behind me and what this actually is is a
picture of me and Tyler we are back at
home at my mom and dad's house and this
was just a photograph that was taken but
my sister who was amazing with
watercolors if you check out her website
you will see more on that but she made
this picture of us and it was a wedding
gift so it really looks exactly like us
she is really incredible at what she
does but yeah we're sitting there I'm
doing something a crossword puzzle I'm
not sure what Tyler is doing but I love
this picture I'm sure it will travel
with us wherever we go but that is the
picture that you see up above my head
when I'm on the couch and where I am now
is actually the world hallway that leads
to my apartment so we're in kind of a
building style apartment
we go in a little hallway and that our
apartment is back there but usually if
I'm taking pictures you know whatever
during my videos this is where I take
them right out here so thank you so much
for tuning in for this video everyone my
voice is really echo way out here but
thanks again and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
