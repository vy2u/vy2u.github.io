eye but right now we have high pressure
over the region beautiful blue skies

rosacea the kitty the kitty Hootie heat
oh hi sorry I said he will bring out

bring out the rosacea in my cheeks say
you'll notice little tiny red bumps and
also just redness along my cheeks
sometimes I have problems covering it
without with makeup it takes a lot of
concealer if people if someone thinks
they may have rosacea what I mean what
what sorts of things on their face
should they be aware of little tiny
bumps that aren't healed by creams that
say he'll eczema or acne I always
thought I had acne I never did have acne
they were just little bumps from rosacea
so when I went to the dermatologist the
dermatology was able to tell me that's
is why your acne medication isn't
working you don't have acne and it turns
out it was just rosacea stand i'm on a
cream as well as an oral antibiotic to
try to suppress the outbreaks is
something i always have but it'll get
better in time so and so on days when
you don't have to wear makeup for news
you could take it easy on the make it i
try to take it easy on the makeup and
let my pores breathe but also i'm very
susceptible to the Sun so i do have on
like a 30 SPF right now cause I'm so
fair-skinned good to trust old fellow

lips today let's take a look and kind of
its kind of obsessed with these revlon
colorburst lipsticks lately have a few
of them this one is incarnation that i
have on today so let's show you that see
if i can get it it's kind of like a
brighter pink i have baby pink too which
is a little bit you know less intense
this has a little more pigmentation a
little more brightness to it so i like
that and then over the top of that i
have lancome juicy tubes this is a mini
one juicy tubes smoothie in tickled pink
and it smells really good too question
for Tyler has been what are your
favorite PlayStation games to play I've
had girls and guys mhm message me about
this because I guess in some video at
some point in time you've mentioned
PlayStation 3 which plays its
PlayStation 3 right yeah station 3 which
also plays blu rays and dvds to do you
like it i do like him a lot awesome so
what are your favorite games well i
really don't have a whole lot of variety
i base my football games and just to
really a NCAA football 10 I've got it
online I guess it's called a dynasty
with about five or six guys I went to
college with so we play on that you can
you actually play them yeah occasionally
we end up playing each other's team cool
then I also play madden 10 which is more
or less the same game but not quite few
differences madness professional
football football in college football
and the game plays a little different
but yeah so I don't play a whole variety
game honestly since I started working I
don't have a whole lot of time and even
play these but those are the two I do
play um which one's better if you had to
nail it down to just one I don't know
hey they're both pretty similar um i'd
say probably pro because you know all
the guys so madden know all the players
are hard so the actual professional
players their names are used their
identities and you can get them with NC
double-a but you have to like download
something extra to get the names sure
and you're already there we have a wii
as well we haven't used a ton lately but
um you've enjoyed like the tennis not
pretty fun big bowling fan yeah those
are the wii sports games are pretty cool
too I had monopolies everyone yeah we
