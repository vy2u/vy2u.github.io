this video I'm not quite sure what we're
gonna do today I've got a few things I
know I want to talk about in this video
is my outfit of the day I'm wearing some
of my skinny jeans these came from wet
seal my flip-flops they're kind of like
a wedge style I got this great kind of
longer v-neck shirt from target in just
a gray color and then this cute vest
came from maurices I believe it just has
like four buttons here up the front and
just kind of a nice way to spice up your
average t-shirt and I've got this neat a
beaded bracelet here from that kohls has
some really really good buys on jewelry
and Michael's often has a little area
with discounted stuff and um like you'll
find different just different bracelets
earrings necklaces markdown like eighty
percent in this bracelet was one of them
and turquoise you know you always see a
lot as you head into summer out in the
stores and so to see this on a discount
was really cool now if you follow me on
if you're a facebook friend of mine or
if you follow me on twitter you know i
am trying to drink a lot more water
these days because it just i mean it's
one of those things that I've struggled
with I've said I'm going to do this a
lot and for some reason I just forget
like I just don't think to do it and so
I got myself a nice little water bottle
here this Rubbermaid bottle just picked
it up at dollar general and I thought
maybe if I have a special bottle to fill
up now and then you know it will make me
feel like you know more obligated to
keep drinking like once I finish it I
need to fill it up again so it's been
working for the past few days I I really
do think that there are a lot of good
effects to drinking water you just I
mean your skin always looks a little
more refreshed and vibrant and it's just
your body needs it so I have this like
it's like a 20 ounce bottle I think and
so I fill that up and then I struggle
with the need for sweets and I really am
trying to cut that out but a good way to
kind of give you fill that need for
yourself is to
use some of those little like these
little things from Crystal Light
individual things you can pop in your
water bottle to give it some flavor this
is a t1 green tea peach mango and I mean
these are just great for popping them in
there they're just an individual size
you can keep using your desk drawer at
work and just add them to your water
because you kind of feel like I don't
know you feel a little more satisfied
sometimes after you've had something
sweet like that and you don't really
feel the need to grab candy or other
things and I promise this segment isn't
sponsor me crystal light I does these
are things that I've been picking up
because I am looking for the sugar three
options and there is some good sugar
free candy out there i've tried
sugar-free candy on and off and have
been disappointed quite frequently
because i sometimes feel like it just
doesn't have it good flavor it tastes
funny or something but it's really
better on your teeth um you know if you
can not be taking in a lot of sugar and
I really like these cherry pomegranate
hard candy from Crystal Light they are
immunity I guess so there's vitamin C
different vitamins there to help you I
guess ward off disease and other viruses
and then what's really neat something I
hadn't seen before are the chewy ones
these are so good Crystal Light chewy
candy comes in four flavors in this bag
I found these at walmart there if they
look about the size you can see there of
like a starburst they are you know just
as Julius start a starburst if not even
more so and the strawberry and the
raspberry especially are delicious so if
you need that chewy candy taste these
are some good things to think of it we
are going to get some lunch do a little
shopping so I've had some questions
about our health situation many of you
saw our house hunt video and stuff is
moving along where that is concerned it
was house number three that we picked in
that video group so yeah Tyler you want
to update everyone on sure was the
latest we set a closing date finally
form a 10
so that's just a little over a week and
we'll get to get in there and start
painting and stuff like that will be
moved in by the end of the month at the
end of may which is first today so at
the end of the month because we've
already given noticed in our apartment
so we have to move it by the night it is
a rainy rainy day today actually it's
been a rainy couple of days with some
really loud thunder and lightning last
night kind of kept me from wanting to go
to bed I knew it was very loud what are
we listening to here today but they were
listening your the cardinals game on the
radio oh yeah you hot done yay mm-hmm
any message for the fellow Cardinals
fans out there any analysis on how the
season is going so far this year yeah
season is going great offense hasn't
been quite as hot as they were built to
be but the pitching been wonderful so
it's made up for it who's your favorite
Cardinal probably Albert Albert Pujols
whoo going to our friendly neighborhood
applebees awesome well we went to kohls
and one of my favorite things about
Cole's is the accessories area I think
they have a lot of great jewelry there
and there's actually a really at least
in my store they have a discounted
jewelry area where stuff has been marked
down like sometimes eighty percent off
and today I got some good bargains there
one of the things I got were these
purple earrings I really realized I
didn't have any purple tone jewelry and
I kind of like these dangly earrings
they were one of the things that were
sixty percent off so the originally
fourteen dollars down to five dollars
and sixty cents so I thought that was a
pretty good deal
I also got this really nice kind of
longer gold necklace and it has this
these little okay charm details every so
often on the chain i just thought was
very basic and it's long but it's not
too long you know and this was twenty
four dollars and eighty percent off down
to four dollars and eighty cents so
that's a great deal there as well and
then i got these really cute earrings on
there i have kind of like a longer
version of these these are just a little
bit shorter but i still think they're
really cute i think i get some good out
of them for work these are sixty percent
off 560 down from fourteen dollars
they're also found some new sunglasses i
really like i love these kind of
sunglasses and this is the only pair
like this that i have but these were
marked down maybe like thirty percent i
think so anyway I saved my receipt says
I saved a total of forty six dollars and
forty cents on all these you know these
few items here that I got so I think
that's really cool and with my work I
think it's more about quantity instead
of quality really what comes to
accessories I have to be you know
anchoring on the air five days a week
and I want my outfits to look a little
different you know from day to day and
accessories are a good way to do that
it's a cheap
to switch up your loans so I think Tyler
might be slightly annoyed with me
because lately we've been going into
stores and I asked what do I ask Tyler
what do you think of this romper is
around four Robertson rompers are hot I
like them I got one romper I like it
I'll show it to you and a little bit but
I think they're cute don't you I'm not
entirely familiar you're not totally
sold on on the rubber concept it's kind
of a foreign concept to me really i'm
not exactly sure what all constitutes a
room well it's shorts and it connected
connected well then it's shorts on the
bottom so like connected to any style of
you know it can be a halter top or tube
top you know what do you guys think of
them I think some of them are really
cute and then there are others like I
tried on a couple at target the other
day and I was like I don't know about
this world for you know you really I
think they're hitting miss sometimes
with how they look the jury's still out
excuse me what the jury is still out ok
ok guys here is the romper that i got
from Target the other day and I kind of
and thinking I like the tube top rubbers
a lot this has a little tie here and its
kind of gathered up here at the top it's
got sort of this I don't know what kind
of print I'm really even talking about
here but it's gathered again at the top
of the shorts so this little part can
kind of blouse over a little bit and I
think I like that feature it just looks
very kind of flowy and casual and I
really like them so if you guys know of
a good place to get your rompers at a
good price just share in a comment it's
the shooters job desc question Oh what
do you got there strawberry shortcake
yeah but that's good I know that's good
you know why cuz you copycatting me and
got it yourself mine is already gone cuz
I gave you the idea when I ordered
priority Newman Tyler goes um yeah i'll
happily have that too i was going to
order that I don't think I thought
happened what did you say I don't
remember well it does that's what I
wanted to get I know it's i highly
recommend the strawberry shortcake from
Dairy Queen do you yes the sponge cake
or whatever that's down in there is
highly absorbent so what are you
shooting hmm the dish the dish zoomed in
over there yes delightful huh cameraman

gonna be the ultimate bite here YUM
I know it's funny no really in this
video I talked about things you can you
know eat if you're having a sweet tooth
craving this not so much but actually
I've heard that they like if you get a
strawberry on your ice cream as opposed
to like hot fudge or caramel it's a
better choice good to know you know its
