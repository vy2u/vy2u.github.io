this video I'm not quite sure what we're
gonna do today I've got a few things I
know I want to talk about in this video
is my outfit of the day I'm wearing some
of my skinny jeans these came from Wet
Seal my flip-flops they're kind of like
a wedge style I got this great kind of
longer v-neck shirt from Target in just
a gray color and then this cute vest
came from maurices I believe it just has
like four buttons here up the front and
it's just kind of a nice way to spice up
your average t-shirt and I've got this
neat beaded bracelet here from Kohl's
has some really really good buys on
jewelry and Michael's often has a little
area with discounted stuff and um like
you'll find different just different
bracelets earrings necklaces markdown
like 80% in this bracelet was one of
them and turquoise you know you always
see a lot as you head into summer out in
the stores and so to see this on a
discount was really cool now if you
follow me on if you're a facebook friend
of mine or if you follow me on twitter
you know i am trying to drink a lot more
water these days because just i mean
it's one of those things that I've
struggled with I've said I'm gonna do
this a lot and for some reason I just
forget like I just don't think to do it
and so I got myself a nice little water
bottle here this Rubbermaid bottle just
picked it up at Dollar General and I
thought maybe if I have a special bottle
to fill up now and then you know it will
make me feel like you know more
obligated to keep drinking like once I
finish it I need to fill it up again
so it's been working for the past few
days I really do think that there are a
lot of good effects to drinking water
you just I mean your skin always looks a
little more refreshed and vibrant and
it's just your body needs it so I have
this like it's like a 20 ounce bottle I
think and so I fill that up and then I
struggle with the need for sweets
and I really am trying to cut that out
but a good way to kind of give fill that
need for yourself is to use some of
those little like these little things
from crystal white individual things you
can pop in your water bottle to give it
some flavor this is a t1 green tea peach
mango and I mean these are just great
for popping them in there they're just
an individual size you could keep these
in your desk drawer at work and just add
them to your water because you kind of
feel like I don't know you feel a little
more satisfied sometimes after you've
had something sweet like that and you
don't really feel the need to grab candy
or other things and I promise this
segment isn't sponsored by crystals
these are the things that I've been
picking up because I am looking for the
sugar 3 options and there is some good
sugar-free candy out there I've tried
sugar-free candy on and off and have
been disappointed quite frequently
because I sometimes feel like it just
doesn't have a good flavor it tastes
funny or something but it's really
better on your teeth um you know if you
can not be taking in a lot of sugar and
I really like these cherry pomegranate
hard candies for Crystal Light they are
immunity I guess so there's vitamin C
and different vitamins there to help you
I guess ward off disease another viruses
and then what's really neat something I
hadn't seen before are the QE ones these
aren't so good crystal light chewy candy
comes in four flavors in this bag I
found these at Walmart there if they
look about the size you can see they're
of like a starburst they are you know
just as chewy as star as starbursts if
not even more so and the strawberry and
the raspberry especially aren't
delicious so if you need that chewy
candy taste these are some good things
to think of it we are going to get some
lunch do a little shopping so I've had
some questions about our health
situation many of you saw our house hunt
video and stuff is moving along where
that is
concerned it was house number three that
we picked in that video group so yeah
Tyler you want to update everyone on
sure was the latest we set a closing
date finally for May 10th so that's just
a little over a week and we get to get
in there and start painting and stuff
like that will be moved in by the end of
the month
yeah the end of May which is first today
so at the end of the month because we've
already given notice in our apartment so
we have to move it is a rainy rainy day
today actually it's been a rainy couple
of days we had some really loud thunder
and lightning last night kind of kept me
for a morning to go to bed I knew it was
very loud what are we listening to any
message for the fellow Cardinals fans
out there any analysis on how the season
is going so far this year yeah hasn't
been quite as who's your favorite
Cardinal probably Albert Albert Pujols
Oh going to our friendly neighborhood
Applebee's well we went to Cole's and
one of my favorite things about Cole's
is the accessories area I think they
have a lot of great jewelry there and
there's actually a really at least in my
store they have a discounted jewelry
area where stuff has been marked down
like sometimes 80% off and today I got
some good bargains there one of the
things I got were these purple earrings
I really realized I didn't have any
purple toned jewelry and I kind of like
these dangly earrings they were one of
the things that were 60% off so the
originally $14 down to $5 and 60s
so I thought that was a pretty good deal
I also got this really nice kind of
longer gold necklace and it has this
these little charm details every so
often on the chain and I just thought
was very basic and it's it's long but
it's not too long you know and this was
$24 and it's 80% off down to four
dollars and 80 cents so that's a great
deal there as well and then I got these
really cute earrings
um they're I have kind of like a longer
version of these these are just a little
bit shorter but I still think they're
really cute I think I get some good out
of them for work
these are 60% off 560 down from $14
there I also found some new sunglasses I
really like I love these kind of
sunglasses and this is the only pair
like this that I have but these were
marked down maybe like 30 percent I
think so
anyway I saved my receipt says I saved a
total of 46 dollars and 40 cents on all
these you know these few items here that
I got so I think that's really cool and
with my work I think it's more about
quantity instead of quality really what
comes to accessories I have to be you
know anchoring on the air five days a
week and I want my outfits to look a
little different you know from day to
day and accessories are a good way to do
that it's a cheap
to switch up your loans so I think Tyler
might be slightly annoyed with me
because lately we've been going into
stores and I asked what do I ask Tyler
what do you think of this prompt or is
it around for rompers are hot I like
them I got one romper I like it I'll
show it to you in a little bit but I
think they're cute don't you I'm not
entirely familiar you're not totally
sold on on their own more concept it's
kind of a foreign concept to me really
I'm not exactly sure what all
constitutes a room well it's shorts and
it connected connected well but its
shorts on the bottom so like connected
to any style of you know it could be a
halter top or tube top you know what do
you guys think of them I think some of
them are really cute and then there are
others like I've tried on a couple at
Target the other day and I was like I
don't know about this realm for you know
kind of you really I think they're
hidden miss sometimes excuse me what the
jury's still out
ok ok guys here is the romper that I got
from Target the other day and I kind of
I'm thinking I like the tube top rum
pers a lot this has a little tie here
and it's kind of gathered up here at the
top it's got sort of this I don't know
what kind of print I'm really even
talking about here but it's gathered
again at the top of the shorts so this
little part can kind of blouse over a
little bit and I think I like that
feature it just looks very kind of flowy
and casual and I really like them so if
you guys know of a good place to get
your rompers at a good price just share
in a comment
it's the shooters jobs question Oh what
do you got there strawberry shortcake
yeah but that's good I know that's good
do you know why cuz you copycatted me
and got it yourself mine is already gone
because I gave you the idea when I
ordered 13 and then Tyler goes yeah
that's what I wanted to get I know as I
highly recommend the Strawberry
Shortcake from Dairy Queen do you yes
the sponge cake or whatever that's down
in there is highly absorbent so what are
you shooting the dish zoomed in over
there yes
cameraman skills are second to none
oh really we'll see about that you watch
it back yes we will yes here we go this
is gonna be the ultimate bite here yeah
I know it's funny no in this video I
talked about things you can you know eat
if you're having a sweet tooth craving
not so much but hmm actually I've heard
that they like if you get a strawberry
on your ice cream as opposed to like hot
fudge or caramel it's a better choice
good to know you know it's fruit exactly
in the truck how you like in your truck
I love it really I couldn't against
their Dairy Queen their outdoor Dairy
Queen guess who's finishing my Sunday
listening to his favorite Cassius
what is your favorite Ke$ha song
oh you act like you don't know you're
also telling a blank on that Sunday
there's a lot of work going on on the
campus of SIU because they're building
an awesome new football stadium here so
you can kind of see the skeleton I guess
of the bleachers down on one side the
bleachers all you're gonna wrap around
some huge we can't wait to go to a
football game says home of the solution
to some of the thing over there are you
excited but it's gonna be awesome
they're just I use big is that they're
big Cole else is gone there's the old
football back inside of the old football
stadium
from there is the sign while we're on
