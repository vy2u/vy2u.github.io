brother-in-law Preston's graduation I am
here with Tyler who is driving us and
Sara and we're like practically out of
breath because we've been trying to get
ready so quickly and there went all the
books but Sara what are you doing I am
finishing my makeup I didn't get to
finish my eyes or do any highlighting or
finishing touches because we're running
late we're running late but she's got
the mirror set up here has her makeup
with her international airbrush role so
we're going to be seeing a couple of
ceremonies for Preston today right Tyler
yeah he's gonna be commissioned as an
officer in the army yes graduating shot
I have Sarah
in the mirror what kind of shadow are
using sir I am using my wet and wild
icon in kitchen does it have a pretty
purple color
now Sarah in case you weren't aware I
posted this on my Twitter and my be
broadcast Facebook page that sarah has a
youtube channel as well it's fantastic
and I highly recommend that you visit it
and subscribe
I do too Tyler does not yet have his own
personal YouTube channel but he does
make frequent appearances so you know
what's really cool is that I was
tweeting pictures yesterday along the
trip and I found out that I have some
viewers in Youngstown and in this
general area here so saying
so shout out to Youngstown and the rest
of the Ohioans is that what it is of
Highlands Ohio ageing Ohio regions
which I'm about to enter upon which I am
about to enter so help me God
State University start an Ericsson
please conformed and render lieutenant
Julie's first salute all right Preston
Joel D Li what did you think of the
person via ceremony before this it was
interesting there are some tears
I thought Preston was gonna cry is a
highly emotional young man so when
depressurizes been amazed there were
fresh but they had like chicken strips
and really good sandwiches
okay the cake was very good
I was I was impressed
you did what do you think about the
mascot here that's awesome I think
that's why they keep it so cold in the
gym to the Penguins been terrified of
birds
you don't like birds many come and
terrified of all birds anybody I would
rather encounter a bear
for this well I thought we were gonna
eat I don't think we're gonna need to
eat right away because we just had some
really awesome or freshmen so no we can
go to like right eight or something
you want to tell everybody what we just
did Sarah
we just went to Rite Aid for the first
time Sarah and me and Sylvia Sylvia is
Preston's new wife his first wife Mary
Mary we got a bunch of fun stuff because
wet-and-wild was on buy one get one free
that's really exciting I got this Idol
eyes cream shadow pencil I got that too
and I don't think I put it I think I put
eyeshadow over it and it's just this
really pretty champagne e iridescent
color it goes on really easily
yeah J like it's kind of a lot like the
NYX jumbo pencil mm-hmm but only they
don't have this kind of pretty color no
we're at the hotel by the way yes and
then I got the wet and wild I come on I
shadow and Lagoon this is the only one I
didn't have because I have all the other
singles and that's this last one it's
this really pretty like iridescent
bright blue color really pretty yeah
okay the cameras pretty had their silk
wash really great colors right there so
I'll have to a little bit goes a long
way with the rates I'll have to use that
fairy and then Emily recommended this
lipstick in 547 B and it's just a really
nude color yeah yeah really sheer so
pretty here I also bought the jeans
because they had Jane where she was
really exciting and I think it's like
the mineral brush yeah
good for putting him in omega or powders
or purpose or high purpose but it's like
dents pretty kind of it's not super soft
so it's probably really good to put
stuff on then you don't want to like
work anymore right then I got the smooth
flow stubble reducing daily moisturizer
will reduce it yes so if you're gonna
experiment experiment and do a review
but I did the series channel for that
I'll put a link right in here but it's
the white color so it's gonna be really
exciting you know it's like ball there's
just ginormous big ol chap stick and put
it on like this I like it
we all got that we did it was it was fun
they basically bought them out on those
yep they were they were pretty excited
for it said yeah people at the store
even though we were like and the last
thing I got was another Jane thing and
izing eyeshadow in Sun gloss and this is
the icing over the dream chatter it's
really your destined light so I think
that's gonna be a really fun thing yes
this is a recommendation from Sarah so
this is the dry shampoo that you can it
says waterless oil and odor remover with
mineral clay
so you should be able to spray this on
your on your roots right right yeah and
then just use it like if you skip a day
between washing or freshen it up so I
also got this which described where was
it inspired from and Sarah's toes if you
want to share or you don't want to see
my feet they're both the wet and wild
singles and one is matte and the other
one is shimmery and I use this one as
like a base colors and then I use this
over it I'm kind of on the lid and then
I use like a different color for the
crease and the darker one is nutty it's
really three and then the light I'm just
like white like cream-colored one is
blue way so there they are side by side
from Germany what does it smell like I
like this smell it's exotic you kind of
morning and you kind of want to eat it
I think the viewers are going to as well
okay like a purple was this what you ran
over and you were walking
so you have three shades like a whitish
and then a brown and then a color right
don't think it's picking it up yeah it's
really pretty to end an eyeliner smudger
what color is a is a black the first
time maybe I have to with that together
I know it's what I get those two things
together and you have leftovers crab
cake separated yeah it looks good Ruby
Tuesday awesome we don't hold back we
should should we say hi to Amy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
