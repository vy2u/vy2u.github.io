so far I was just thinking this morning
as I was going through my makeup routine
which as you know is crazy early in the
morning because I incur a morning
newscast so I was just kind of going
through the motions putting everything
on and I was thinking man you know I
feel like I reach that every day and
then I look in the drawer and there's
like like say it's a concerted concealer
or something and there's like a bunch of
others in there you know what I mean but
I could be reaching for those but I just
start reaching for the same thing or
maybe I start doing the same thing with
my lips for a period of days in a row or
the same thing with my eyes and it's
kind of like like what I call a makeup
rut you know you kind of just get into
the pattern of doing something over and
over again and you have other things in
your collection you could be using but
you're just getting into that pattern
and I think time you know maybe a lack
of time drives us to just kind of do the
same things over and over again and it's
also a challenge if you have a really
large collection like I do trying to use
everything you have and then on the
other end of the spectrum if you have a
small collection and you may feel like
oh I have no choice but to use the same
stuff over and over but I do have some
tips in this video that can help I hope
everybody get the best use out of their
makeup and really keep from you know
just doing the same exact thing day
after day so hope you like this video I
have a lot of examples to show so I'm
not just sitting here talking to you the
whole time my first tip is actually to
plan ahead a little bit the day before
like if you get into habit I don't know
how many people actually do this but I
try to do this because I get ready so
early and I try to leave myself with as
few decisions as possible in the early
morning hours but you know try to think
a little bit the day before you know
what might I wear tomorrow and therefore
it you know maybe sit out just a couple
keys that pieces you know for your
makeup like I want to use this eyeshadow
palette and you know these couple liners
and this lip color and that way you have
fewer decisions to make in the morning
but you're already setting yourself up
to use something different than what you
just do on a daily basis so that's my
first tip my next tip is something that
I've been doing lately and it's not I
don't know if it's necessarily a new
idea I'm sure other people do this kind
of thing
- but like I said I have a big
collection and so I've been doing
something called a weekly bucket and so
I have this little bucket here and at
the start of each week I put in a
handful of things that I want to make
sure I use that week maybe they've been
in my collection for a little while I
feel like I haven't been reaching for
them but this little bucket is like my
reminder hey use these things too so
it's not like my entire face of makeup
but it's just a few key things that I
want to use like for example I have my
nature looks mascara from covergirl that
I've barely used and I need to use that
Neutrogena
custom glow like blush and bronzer I've
also had this cool looking palette that
just kind of got you know swept away and
my eaten up by my makeup collection this
is the pop for green eyes the Physicians
Formula shimmer strips so that's
beautiful I'll probably wear an outfit
that would look great with that
I got a cream liner from elf here and
let's see this is my ELF studio
concealer that I wanted to make sure I
reviewed at some point so for me this is
also like hey this is stuff you want to
review soon you need to try it I got
these mark shimmer down lip glosses that
I want to test out because lots of
people ask me about Avon rub or a
covergirl lipstick in there - so just
some ideas you know things that I have
gone through and thought hey I haven't
used that and it takes a little time you
know maybe just a few minutes to gather
that together we can keep that out and
then you're more likely than you
actually make sure you use those things
another thing that can really help you
make the most out of your makeup that
you have and this is another thing that
applies to those with a big collection
or a small collection and it comes down
to reorganizing like if you will change
the way you've got something set up just
change your layout a little bit you know
you might be more likely to reach for
certain things over other things and and
it keeps things from getting too buried
or eaten as I sit by your makeup
collection so also storage containers
you know finding new little storage
containers can really jump start a new a
new makeup organization
concept I tried to make this little list
not too much about having to go out and
buy something new because a lot of
people say oh that's easy just buy
something new and you're out of your
makeup breath but for those who don't
want to spend a lot of money or any
money you know I didn't want to give you
too many things that are like you must
buy this but just an idea like these are
cute little storage containers from
Target just you know finding a couple
different things for real cheap I think
this was 99 cents it's a little plastic
dish you could put you know a bunch of
lip glosses in here a bunch of those
things that don't necessarily fit or
just like small size in your makeup
collection that are like I you know it
keeps getting buried I can't find them
put them out maybe display them in there
and a silverware organizer I know it's
not the most stylish looking thing ever
of course you can put lovely little
beads on it like I've done on my pull
out drawers but these go great in
drawers and can be good for your
mascaras liners anything long and
something else that I've done just in
terms of my eyeshadows that it's helped
me get more wear out of certain things I
used to divide them up all by brand and
you know in that sense I would only
think about the brand not so much the
shade I needed oh I'm gonna use Revlon
today let me use wet and wild today you
know and I would just go to that brand
and not thanks so much out of the box
you know what I mean cuz I've got a lot
of different brands of makeup so I have
taken my you know eyeshadow collection
again this might apply more for big
collection people but like I've divided
them by shades I've got my highlights
I've got my mid-tone neutrals and my
deeper neutrals you know in three
different sections there and I've done
the same
elsewhere in my collection I've split it
up by like greens Purple's blues and
that sort of thing so it rather than
looking for one brand I look through and
I see all my different brands mixed in
so that's helped a lot and I will have
more on this coming up in a collection
video that's coming so be looking for
that it's going to be probably multiple
multiple bar another tip is using new
tools and brushes you know it's often
times we get brush sets and we reach for
certain brushes over and over again but
what about those other things that don't
get used for example in my preemie Sigma
premium kit there was this brush and I
was
using it a whole lot it's like this big
kind of egg-shaped brush and I just sort
of shied away from it because I wasn't
used to it but really it's really nice
for powders and bronzers and stuff like
that so I love the way it contours to my
face but I had to use it for a while to
get to get there to get to that point on
the SS 217 this ones that that's a
little bit pinched in at the top I mean
I came to love this shadow brush and at
first I thought I can't use a crease
brush that's that big and now I feel
like it blends out my shadow better than
anything and so that's just an idea this
little eyelash curler that I got from
Sephora a long time ago it just curls
like your outer lashes so you can get a
real like turned up cat eye kind of
effect on your lashes I love this little
guy but I haven't been using it for a
while and so kind of looking at your
tools your brushes it can change the way
your makeup actually turns out to look
on your face and it just gives you a
change in the routine and another idea
that I have is I'm calling it the
seven-day pallet challenge using a
pallet and trying to use that pallet for
like a week and get a different look out
of it every day I have done that with my
elf palette here this is this is the 36
this is like the 32 palette I believe
but there's a lot of shades in there
this is actually a really good palette
and you know I just kind of said hey I'm
gonna use this in a different way for
like 7 days out of the week or if you
have a bunch of palettes just say I'm
gonna use a different palette that I
have every day of the week or something
like that but you join something like
that can force you to be creative and
come up with new makeup looks for
multiple uses in the products you have
so instead of just using one thing the
same way every time think about how it
could be used differently and this is
great for people who are trying to
stretch a smaller collection so for
example one thing I've come to love is
using my ELF contouring blush and
bronzer but taking the bronzer and using
it as a really natural crease shade it
works so well and I actually did it in
one of my eye tutorials I I used it that
way and it looks really natural and it
makes just the perfect crease shape
because it's kind of matte and it just
looks great um another thing you can do
I like this shape from Mac it's called
nylon and it's kind of a she
we shade it has like a little bit of
like a warm maybe I don't know just a
hint of like a golden a glow to it and I
like putting this I put it on like the
Cupid's bow right here see that little
glow I've got going on or we just take a
little on my finger and I rent it right
here on top of my cheekbone you know use
this as kind of a multi-purpose
highlight that can help for travel too
if you're trying to condense things or
like Physicians Formula shimmer strips I
talked about this a lot but this can
make a great eyeshadow palette as well
tip that I have is to seek inspiration
try to look two different things maybe
it's a magazine maybe it's going online
and looking at different blogs and
videos which I think we all do if you're
here you know maybe that's what you're
doing but also just look for things
around you you know I see I have this
gorgeous old flower arrangement in front
of me right now
it's pink flowers it's green leaves and
it's just gorgeous wow that could be
beautiful on the eyes that could be an
eye lip combo you know something like
that you know what I mean so look at the
world around you think about it in
almost a makeup sense and you will get
inspired by beauty that's all around you
not just in those typical places so I
also asked on my Beauty broadcast
Facebook page today which is a great
place to go to kind of connect with
other makeup lovers if you're like me
and you maybe don't have a ton of
friends that are just gaga over makeup
but you go on here and you find all
these different people that love what
you love so it's fun to chat with people
get product recommendations get second
opinions on stuff and this and that but
today I asked you ever feel like you're
in a makeup right how do you stay out of
it or get out of that kind of situation
and I got a ton of comments on this so I
wanted to share them and Natasha says
watch YouTube I think that's a good one
Oh Colleen says don't be afraid that you
can't pull something off there's only
limits the only limits are the ones that
you place on yourself so get inspired
and don't hold back I think that's great
advice a lot of us think you know I
can't do the red lip I'm not gonna try
it you know what's why not try it you
know somebody will probably be like oh
you look great like that you'll be like
really that's so
y'all had a really good idea she said
what I do and think about if you if you
really want to try this but what I do is
reach blindly into one of my makeup
drawers and pull out a single eyeshadow
or a lipstick then I make myself do a
look around that color how cool is that
a lot of times it's something I rarely
use and I've ended up having a lot of
fun creating a wearable face out of it I
love that idea you just you know you set
the tone for your makeup just by picking
out one thing so I hope this helps you
guys kind of come up with some new ideas
for your makeup I know even though we
have YouTube and we have all these other
things to look at sometimes when it
comes right down to it you're in a hurry
and you start to do the same thing over
and over again so I hope these tips help
you whether you have a big collection or
a little collection or whatever so
anyway thanks for watching have a great
day and I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
