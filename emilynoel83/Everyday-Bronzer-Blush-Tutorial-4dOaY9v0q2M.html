weekend this video has been requested by
a lot of people to do a tutorial on how
to apply blush and bronzers so right now
I've got on some the maybelline mineral
power foundation and earlier in the day
I had swept on like a little bit of
bronzer so there's really not much on my
face it'll be sort of like we're
starting fresh with it but the first
thing that you need to make sure you
have is a fluffy powder brush this is
this was one that I just got from her
I've had for a while from Walmart and
the bristles are kind of tapered from
the outside to the inside but it's just
really soft you can see it's pretty big
so the first thing I would do like after
I put my foundation on whether it's
mineral or whatever I would go to some
bronzer and this one is like a matte
bronzer it's Bonnie Belle power bronze
in golden tan available at most in
drugstore and get a little bit on your
brush here just kind of tap it not too
much I have a really light touch with
bronzer and work around the forehead
onto the top of the cheeks down on the
chin so I'm starting here and keep in
mind this is a matte bronzer here and
you want to make sure you blend down
your jaw line like here's my jaw line
and I'm gonna blend downward a little
bit that way you make sure you're not
creating a mask on yourself and make
sure you also go down the bridge of your
nose and he
as well okay because you're thinking
about when you're talking about bronzer
it's like you're applying a tan to
yourself so you want to make sure you're
hitting the areas that the Sun would
really touch you so this is kind of like
this matte bronzer step is that I use is
just kind of going all over the face and
getting it to a just a slightly darker
skin tone then I take something that's a
little deeper and a little more shimmery
and I'm probably I don't have to get
another one soon it's it's the
wet-and-wild bronzer in Bali bronze and
this is what it looks like it's kind of
a deep shimmery shade and you have to
have a really light touch with this
because a lot of will get a lot of color
payoff but get a little on the brush and
then Willie don't go necessarily all
over the face with this just concentrate
on really those areas that the sun's
gonna hit so your temples and just kind
of blend it out and I've used mineral
bronzer sometimes too which are good I
like Maybelline's mineral powder one I'm
just not using it in this demonstration
and then think this has shimmer in it
where would you like to share it all on
top of your cheekbones a little bit okay
and then I just continue to work it down
it's good to kind of blend down
especially if you're you have a top
where you're yeah your decollete area
shows a little bit you want to make sure
you blend down there okay so those are
the two steps of bronzer that I use I
usually use them at one and kind of go
all over the face and then a shimmery
one that I will just highlight certain
areas okay then for blush I'm going to
use my blush brush which is this is a I
think it's a discontinued Revlon
but it's about this size on my face and
I generally use two shades of blush the
two that I've been using for a while now
our covergirl cheekers in plumberry glow
okay that's this one it's a nine it's a
pretty bright pink shade actually and
then the other shade is covergirl
cheekers in golden pink okay and this is
just kind of a nice deep contour shade
so first I'm going to take my lighter
shade get some on the brush here and a
smile and work it into the apples of my
cheeks only okay apples and just up just
a little bit not all over my face by any
means so I smile and work it up here but
mainly concentrate right there on the
apples okay
a bit of shimmer to it
it's really kind of working in circular
motions always good for blending okay
but I'm going to take the golden pink
shade the darker one and this is gonna
be used as a contour shade I've heard
from a lot of makeup artists that said
you really need to use two shades of
blush especially if you're looking for
any kind of contoured look
and when I say contour I don't mean like
let's make a streak on the side of our
face but it's just a matter of enhancing
your cheekbones really so I'm gonna dip
into this with a pretty light touch here
I'm not gonna I'm not by any means like
swirling this around in here I'm just
tapping on to it and then what you're
looking for you may want to make a face
like this helps you see where you're
going for you I'm pretty sure I know
where my part is I've done this enough
but you're kind of going right just
under the cheekbone area here and
blending kind of circular let's see now
you've gotten a little more a little
more
standout cheekbone there and if you want
while you have you know most of the
color has worked off of your brush after
you've done this when you pretty much
got a bear brush left kind of just
circular motion down throughout the
lower part of your jaw line that what
that will do is just you know make sure
you don't have any sort of a harsh line
there so just repeat that on the other
side
I'm just going to do it back and forth
10 motion here and you can always go
back for more blush so don't over overdo
the first time you get it on there and
then just kind of after you've most of
it's worked off your brush kind of
circular motion down the side of your
cheeks and so now you've got your blush
going on and then when you really want
to make sure your your whole look is
flawless when you're all done I
recommend going over with some sort of
mineral veil like from bare minerals
even if you didn't use mineral makeup
that's a really great touch you can also
use the finishing powder from Maybelline
mineral power but since today it's kind
of a we're really kind of going for that
bronze look I'm gonna use a just sort of
a general shimmer powder that I have
it's not super shimmery but they call it
an illuminating powder it's wet and wild
mega glow and cat want pink and this is
me you can see the color a little better
I think those would be really pretty eye
shadow shades too but where I'm gonna do
is take my big brush again just kind of
sweep it Pat it all over all the colors
and then just kind of go over my entire
face with it
okay all right and then that kind of
just makes your whole look you can see I
didn't use very much but I feel like it
makes the whole look look a little more
finished and blended together and
everything so
oh one more step I think you guys would
probably remember me saying that I
didn't like elfs bronzing powder very
low I have it in warm tan I think it
part of it was the brush I was using it
with too I just I was using the elf
allover face brush or whatever and I
just thought that this is very loosely
milled and I feel like when you put a
brush in it at some times it's too much
you know you wouldn't and and I don't
really use this on my face but I have
found a use when I'm all done with my
doing my bronzer on my face and I just
want a little more glow up here I just
take my big powder brush dip it in there
and then you can use this as sort of a
bronzer around your collarbone area and
all up in here and even your shoulders a
little bit you know you can just make
you look a little more finished and
ready to go and doesn't take a lot of
room blending is just you know you're
taking whatever fluffy brush you got and
kind of working it over that area and
that kind of just helps to finish the
look so I have found a use for the elf
bronzer so if you guys have one too and
you thought and maybe I don't really
like this on my face it is kind of nice
for just kind of a shimmery glow on the
rest of your body too so I hope this has
helped you guys just get some ideas
maybe for application of bronzer and
blush and how matte and shimmer can work
together and how two shades of blush can
really work together to give you a
natural but finished look
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
