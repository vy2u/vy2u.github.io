in for this video I know I've been doing
a lot of dramatic fun look slightly a
lot of them that are great for going out
on the town and going to a party or
whatever but this look is more of a work
appropriate look a just everyday look
that does bring some attention to your
eyes but at the same time it's not it's
not too dramatic it's very natural and
neutral and if that is the kind of look
you're going for definitely stick around
and keep all right guys step one we're
going to put down a creamy kind of
shadow stick base to grab our eye shadow
and I'm gonna use my NYX jumbo pencil in
iced mocha so you can see that's kind of
a pretty like deep bronzy brown kind of
color and I'm just gonna apply this all
over my eyelid my little mirror right
here okay I'm just going all over the
lid you know this doesn't have to really
have any rhyme or reason to it right now
because we're gonna sort of blend it
with our finger a little bit too but I'm
also going up and kind of filling in the
outer part of the crease as well with
this and then I'm also gonna go lightly
around the eye
along the lash line and it is a jumbo
pencil so you you know you it is gonna
be a little bit thicker line but it's
also you know lighter color than a liner
typically is as well okay so once you've
done that kind of just take your finger
and blend out this creamy texture we've
got going then I'm gonna take my
Physicians Formula bag collection
eyeshadow trio and it was I don't know
fifth color shut up and this trio is
called baked sands and I'm first gonna
use this shade at the medium shade of
the trio and I'm going to use a small
brush actually I'm going to use Milo
Cornell 1/4 brush pack some of that on
there and this is just for control and
just because I want to really just kind
of paint that right on I'm just patting
that shadow right on top of that a
creamy pencil that I put on there so
just patting that right on and we are
getting kind of a nice sort of fun
metallic e finish out of this too so
that's neat
so just go over that and then you may
want to use your your brush down like
this and actually just get the product
right there on the tip and then use that
to go over that inside look there and
then used it using that same approach
with this darker shade here just get the
tip right on the product and use that to
go over the outer half there and so it's
kind of looking like liner only it's a
little more smudgy just a little more
you know kind of a smoky feel to it
and then we're just gonna take that up
and use that same brush I love it when a
one brush can kind of serve multiple
purposes and get some of that darkest
Brown on the outer half of the lid okay
and then I'm going to take a my Sonia
Kashuk medium eyeshadow brush with the
dark brown shade and we're just gonna
use that to get that darkest Brown right
up in here so you can see this is kind
of shaping up to be sort of a little bit
deeper Brown the look I usually go with
really light shades on the lid but now
I'm going with something a little bit
darker okay so now that you've done that
really a little bit goes a long way on
that I'm just gonna take my Sephora
rounded crease brush it is bare and just
buff over everything just to kind of
blend it all together and then take this
lightest day this cream color and use
that as our highlight for the eyeliner
I'm going to take a brown liquid liner
I'm using my femme Couture mineral
eyeliner in brown and this is just
really nice and smooth and I'm just
going to use that to apply a fine line
from inner to outer corner here
I'm not really doing anything fancy with
it I just want that added sort of
appearance of thickness around the lash
line for what I do my my mascara next
just to brighten up this inner corner a
little bit kind of around our tear duct
area I'm going to take that lightest
shade and my one quarter brush you can
just put a little bit of that in there
just to brighten things up a bit
and then if you want your lower part of
the liner a little more defined you can
use your Coastal Scents tackle on liner
brush use the darkest shade of brown
there and just kind of go over that just
about half way to leave some of that
pretty bronzy sparkle um
right in there towards the middle now
you'll remember we first went around our
eye with that jumbo pencil and so our
last step here is to just kind of clean
that area up just a little just take
away any excess that you know didn't
really end up you know being needed for
the look and a q-tip is just perfect for
them next I'm going to curl my eyelashes
then I'm going to apply two coats of my
Rimmel sexy curves mascara on the top
and one on the bottom
hey everyone here is my finished look I
hope you like it I went ahead and added
some little of the half lashes they're
the salon perfect three oh ones and
there the lashes that just cover like
the outer half of your eyes so you just
have like a little extra fullness there
at the outer corners usually when I use
lashes it's for more a more of a
dramatic effect but I think those little
half lashes are just perfect for an
everyday look just to give some
attention to your eyes and putting the
focus on your eyes but yet not looking
you know like you're ready to go out in
part here's something and another thing
if you can't find those half lashes you
can also find a full strip and you know
cut them shorter and also kind of cut
the lashes at a bit of an angle so you
do get that lengthened out look at the
ends um so that's really nice but anyway
um I hope you enjoyed the kind of bronzy
tones on the eyes and on my lips I'm
wearing my NYC ultra last lip color in
caramel so that's just kind of a warm
you know bronzy kind of light brown
shade actually and then over the top of
that I'm wearing this lip gloss that I
love so much it's the elf mineral lip
gloss in trendsetter
and so that's kind of a nice neutral
shade to go over top of this and yeah
this is just a great look for everyday
if you were going to work or I mean it
could totally carry over if you wanted
to use more of the darker tone of that
eyeshadow trio to kind of um smoke it
out a little bit to more of an outer V
or you could do more lower liner if you
like that look or the waterline so
there's a lot more you can do with this
but I wanted to give you since I've been
doing so many dramatic looks I wanted to
give you a more natural option so thanks
so much for watching this video and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
