this video I've been asked a lot lately
ever since I recommended these pallets
in my top 10 wet and wild products video
I've been asked if I will do a tutorial
using one of these ultimate expressions
pallets so I chose to do one in Paradise
Cove today as you can see it's got some
purple tones some topes and things like
that and it turned out to be a really
nice natural look you can achieve it
very quickly and easily so if you want
to see how I pulled it together for this
look alright guys the first thing I did
was applied a primer to this I I just
use my blushes shadow magnet you can
really use anything you want to just
kind of rotate whatever primers I have
and then I'm going to grab my ultimate
extra expressions palette in paradise
coves you can see this has some nice
neutral shades and sort of some purple a
tones as well so we're just going to dig
right in and go for this shade right
here in the corner it sort of has a hint
of purple to it kind of a nice light
shimmery shade and I'm going to use my
elf I shadow brush and just apply that
all over my lid you'll see the color
just shows up instantly even for this
really light shade so they're not super
sheer ok so we just got that all over
our lid then I'm going to take my Sonia
Kashuk I think if this is called a
medium shadow brush you can see it's
just kind of flat like that and I'm
going to dip into this plum shade right
up at the top there and it's some sort
of mat for the most part but it may have
a little bit of a pearl effect to it but
nothing major so I've got it on the tip
of the brush and then I'm going to kind
of stick the brush in like I'm going to
wedge it into my crease
and just sort of run it back and forth
vision in basically using a brush like
this in your crease kind of ensures that
you're getting that color exactly where
you want it sits you're placing that
color directly in the crease and then
just using motions like this you're able
to flick it up a little bit and diffuse
it outward
next I'm going to take my fine crease
brush from essence of beauty and I'm
going to go for this shade down here at
the bottom which is sort of like a deep
brownish taupe right here and it does
have a little shimmer to it and so I'm
just going to get my brush in that and
use that to deepen this whole area up
deepen up the outer half of the crease
kind of do the outer v phase right here
so as you can see I'm just concentrating
that color toward the the outer third of
my crease and just kind of swirling it
building the color as high as you want
to then I'm going to take my fluffy yet
rounded crease brush from Sephora and
you'll notice the burgundy shade there
that's second from the top right there
get a little bit of that on your brush
and just dust over the border of that
purple and the brownish taupe shade
there just to warm it up a bit and then
lastly the last thing we're going to do
is I'm going to go for this shade right
here either these shades are nice
highlights but this one none just keeps
a little bit of color up in that area as
well a little more of a golden e tone
and so I'm just gonna go over that whole
area right all the way up to my eyebrow
and that's the shadow then for liner I'm
going to use my Revlon Colorstay liquid
I pin and I'm just going to go from
inner to outer corner here on my upper
lash line so this is pretty easy to
control
however if you want is intensive a line
as you get with the traditional Revlon
liquid liner you may have to go back
over your lines just a little bit
what I'm going to end up doing is
actually thickening this out just a
little bit in creating somewhat of a
young winged effect here I guess you'd
say think grab any black eyeliner you
have on hand I'm going to use my own
almay eyeliner it's I think it's a
16-hour eyeliner it claims to be and
then I'm just going to connect up to the
corner there and we're going to try to
make it look sort of seamless as we
blend it down onto the lower lash line
here and I'm only going to go about
halfway with this just like that and
then to top that off we're going to go
back to that deepest brownie taupe shade
that I was talking about right here in
the bottom and just grab your angled
liner brush and we're gonna top off that
oops just hit myself in the nose anyways
and we're going to top off that black
liner and just continue on in with this
powder shade it'll just make it a little
bit softer
just blend it right in there with your
lash line then I'm going to curl my
lashes with my elf eyelash curler hold
it there for about 15 seconds or so then
I'm going to use a new mascara it's the
l'oreal extra volume collagen mascara
and i'm really liking this so far this
is what the brush looks like and just go
ahead and put on a coat or two of that
and then i'll join you with the finished
look alright everyone here is my
finished look it's very natural easy to
achieve a great everyday look but what's
nice about these ultimate expressions
palettes is how much versatility there
is to them you get a lot of variety not
only in terms of the dark shades but
also the light shades and there are
several different palettes to choose
from I use the one today that had sort
of the purples and mauve kind of tones
to it but Stan castle is more with
browns and there's even another one call
I'm not actually sure what it's called
that it's got more blues and some greens
and things like that so if you're
looking for a variety this is a nice
palette to have and you will definitely
get a lot of good out of it so thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
