for this eye tutorial this is gonna be a
look using brown and pink tones to
create a really natural eye that you can
really wear anywhere and to put the look
together I pulled out my Too Faced world
domination tour palette here I have
already done one look out of this using
these kind of more vivid purple and
green shades but I'm gonna come over
here to this side this time and use the
Browns and pinks and there's also a lot
more that this fox does in terms of the
lip glosses and the all-over face
products highlighters and bronzers so
I'll show you at the end of the video
how I use those as well and another
thing that I'm gonna be using in this
tutorial is a brush roll from Coastal
Scents so I'll kind of show you what
that's all about here in a second it's
basically like it looks like a little
purse and it opens up and it rolls out
to a full full brush set here so I'm
gonna be using some of the I mean I
already use the face brushes to do what
I what I did on my face but I'm gonna be
going through and using some of the eye
brushes as well in this look so if
you're wondering where those brushes
come from it is from this Coastal Scents
brush roll little purse looking thing
that can can easily contain all your
brushes so I'm in the process of
reviewing it I will probably post a
final review on what I think of this but
it's super cute and I'm enjoying having
all my brushes in one place and not
having to waste your time when I'm like
searching for the right brush so anyway
guys um I hope you enjoy this tutorial
and keep on you guys step one is to
apply some sort of eyeshadow base to
your eyelid and I'm going to use my
L'Oreal hip cream shadow paint and
secretive and it this is just kind of a
creamy white shade and it's just another
option for those typical primers that
you use if you'd rather you know use
something with a little a little more
punch to it a little more shimmer you
can see how these just kind of paint
right on to your eyelid and will really
you know grab all the color that you put
on so I'm gonna taking it up you know
right there to my crease almost
just kind of patting it and that'll take
away any excess product there then I'm
gonna use my eyeshadow brush to apply
this pink shade in the palette just kind
of a nice shimmery pink and so I'm just
gonna load some of that up on my brush
and Pat that on over our cream and it's
just gonna come across very very subtle
just a very subtle light pink just apply
as much as you want if you want to pack
on that color a little more for some
added shimmer be my guest
there we go so once you've got that on
there we're gonna start thinking about
what to do in the crease and for that
I'm going to use sort of a skinnier you
know really slim eyeshadow brush and I'm
gonna use this nice brown here and it
doesn't have a ton of shimmer to it
necessarily but I mean it does have sort
of a pearly effect so it's really pretty
and I'm gonna get some of that on my
shadow brush and just sort of use the
brush to get the color right in the
crease and you know kind of on the
working up practically onto the brow
bone there
just creating a nice warm shadow and
it's really natural because this brown I
feel like really plays off of some of
the natural tones in your skin so does
the pink so this is a really Browns and
Pink's are a really natural way to you
know still get definition on your eyes
but not go overboard with it so as you
can see I've just kind of applied that
all over that crease area and then I'm
going to take a small small little
define crease brush and but first I am
gonna take my Sephora rounded crease
brush and just kind of buff out the edge
of that then I'm gonna go to my smaller
brush and go to this sparkly black shade
here in the palette and I'm only using
this to really really just deepen up the
outer corner just a little bit more so
just go right to the very outer portion
of the crease and get it right in there
and then just kind of swirl it out and
up
then for our highlight shade I'm gonna
use this kind of golden a sparkly shade
and I'm going to use this sort of blunt
dodo foot eyeshadow brush and just pack
some of that color on it and just apply
that all the way up to the eyebrow now
it's time for liner I'm going to use my
Revlon Colorstay a liquid eye pin and
black and blackest black I believe is
the proper name for it there and I'm
going to just draw a line right close to
my lash line
trying to get it as close in as possible
and sort of widening it as you get to
the outer outer part
next I'm going to take my all my pet
black pencil liner and just connect up
to that outer outer end of the liquid
liner and go in just about halfway with
that just like that and then I'm going
to take the liner brush here the angled
liner brush and I'm going to dip into
the black at first just to top off the
black that's here and sort of set that
and then we're going to continue the
rest of the way in with the brown
it's a nice rich warm brown I really
like it okay and then the last step for
our liner I'm gonna take this flat brush
that it's actually just a little bit
instead of being cut super super sharp
across it's got a little bit of softness
to it at the end and I'm gonna dip into
that pink shape that we first put all
over our lid pack some of that on the
tip of this brush and then we're gonna
use it to create this sort of shimmery
effect right underneath the rest of our
liner next I'm gonna apply a coat of my
Too Faced lash injection mascara to my
top and bottom lashes and then I'll join
you with the finished guys here is my
subtle pink and brown look on the eyes
it's really simple and a really basic
look that I think can really be
appropriate for any occasion and just so
you know this all does come out of the
two-faced world domination tour box
pallet sort of things so the eyeshadow
that I was showing you actually lifts
out of this part of the box and then I
also use the highlighter and bronzer
that come out of the side it's like a
peachy highlighter and then those are
the bronzers I used the darker part of
the bronzer to sort of contour my cheeks
there and I use the highlighter pretty
much all over and also what comes out of
the box is some lip colors here that I
still have the little film on them
but what I used was thinking it off
ie I combined the two oh my goodness it
completely lifts that okay alright what
I used was a combination of these two
pings here I use the there's one that's
more like glossy like a glossy pink and
one that's more shimmery and then I used
this very shimmery nude shade right in
the middle so anyway guys that's how I
achieve this look using various products
and they're really all pretty typical
products so you can find these from
other brands and bring them in and use
them for this look but I kind of like
the effect of using the shimmery shadow
also kind of underneath the regular
liner so just a different technique
there for you to try some time when you
get a chance and uh thank you guys so
much for watching this video
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
