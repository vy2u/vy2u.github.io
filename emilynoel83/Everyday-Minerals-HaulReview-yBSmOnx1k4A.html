this video you're probably seeing Tyler
here and thinking that there's some good
news
coming in this video and there is my
channel got accepted into the YouTube
Partner Program so so we're excited
about that still going to keep doing
videos like I always have but I just
wanted to explain that if you notice the
little different appearance to the
channel and the banners and whatnot but
you know what's going on
so Tyler any any thoughts yeah something
cool it's cool so anyway thank you guys
for those of you who kind of prompted me
to do this because I really just hadn't
put much thought into it yet but some
people said hey you shouldn't you should
try to do that and so um that was really
what motivated me to do this so to
everybody who left me a nice message or
comment about that thank you
so alright on that note let's I'll get
back to his football game and I'm going
to go ahead and review some stuff so
we're gonna start Cameron okay alrighty
now let's see getting down to business
here um I wanted to share with you kind
of a whole flash review of my everyday
mineral stuff that I got in and I had
you might have seen a video that I did
in the past where I showed you the
little sample set where they come about
this big and I kind of went through the
ones that I picked out there and I think
you got like five samples and it was
free on the website so I want to start
out by saying if you never tried
everyday minerals I would suggest going
through and getting the sample kit you
can pick out whatever colors you want
and it'll be a good indication of you
know what you're going to wind up with
and it's a really nice thing because a
lot of people struggle
even just in a drugstore you know they
can't try the item so they don't know if
the foundation matches their skin or
whatever and especially online that's
even harder so I really like that they
offer samples I think it shows that
they're confident in their product that
they're putting out and I find that
everyday minerals is like affordability
wise I mean it's I think per item I
don't know the exact price per item but
for my kit that I got I got what was
called the personal custom kit
full-sized and it is $34 but you get six
things and look it's compared to the
sample size they're big and I just
really like the samples that I was
trying and I just thought wow I think
that this is a mineral makeup that I
like well enough and that has good
enough coverage to where I could wear
this for the news you know
interchangeably if I don't always want
to wear a liquid foundation this is
something that doesn't always it doesn't
come off shimmery on me and at least
with the formulas that I get and I just
love it so much so I'm gonna go through
and tell you what I got and I'll also
say that check out WWF read a minerals
calm so you can look through their all
their shades because there's different
color families and you'll hear me refer
to the ones I got but there's a lot to
look through there so anyway the first
thing they'll tell you about I got two
foundations in my six piece kit okay I
got in an intensive foundation which is
their more full coverage it's the best
coverage that they offer and I got that
in medium beige neutral and that is in
the in the beige family and it described
it on the website as for light tan
complexions yellow to pink undertones
and then I got the matte which is one
step up in like one step less coverage
than the intensive in sandy me
and that's just a hair darker then this
one is and I just wanted something to
wear you know I can maybe blend the two
or what I've been doing is using the
intensive all over and then using a
little bit of the sandy medium just on
top to warm it up just a little bit
because that color that I got in
intensive is an exact match for my skin
but the other I just kind of put on top
but anyway warm sandy medium is
described as light to medium complexions
pink or peachy undertones and that is in
the warm family so I really like those
like I said intensive is more coverage
matte is less and they have a semi matte
and the original glow which is I think
may give you a little more of like the
bare minerals you know I I feel like
bare minerals is not a purely matte
matte matte finish the intensive and the
matte really are and that's part of why
I said I can wear this on camera and not
look shiny and stuff so for blush I
picked out I had a blush in Sunday
brunch in my samples that I loved and I
think it's great and it it takes so
little to use it I was like well I'll
probably still have my sample for a
while so I went ahead and tried a new
color and it's called game show and it
this is probably a little more colorful
than it's showing up as right here but
it is described it's a matte blush and
it's new it shows up as new on the
website and it's soft
Ruby matte shade it says a cousin of
apple blush I know Apple I've heard a
lot of people talk about is they really
really like that blush color so this is
a really soft but I mean it doesn't take
a lot for the color to show up at all so
I by the way I barely have any makeup on
right I think I just put on one of the
foundations and a little bit of bronzer
because I've been cutting their hurry
today trying to get stuff done so um
anyway that was a game-show blush and
they have so many cool looking blushes I
really want to try the next thing I got
it was also under the blush category on
the website is the everyday bronzer and
this is in the Lucent category so that
means
maybe that same matte-finish although
this is by no means very shimmering it
may have a little shimmer to it it says
luminescent medium shade of brown
bronzer contour or you can use it to
adjust your foundation shade so if you
thought your foundation was a little
light maybe you could mix in a little
bit of this but I really like the
bronzer I only have like I think one
mineral bronzer that was light actually
my mineral power one I like it a lot and
it's gonna be good come winter time but
it is a little bit light and I just
think this is that that bronzer contour
so well because you don't want to
obviously contour it with a really
shimmery shade and that this bronze is
from everyday minerals is not all that
shimmery
so the next thing I got was a concealer
like I said six items so this will be
the one two three four this would be the
five fifth item out of six and I got the
abbot's perk me up concealer and what
this is is a it's a new item also on the
website and it describes it as a blend
of sunlight concealer which is a light
light yellow concealer map around your
eye and peach color corrector ideal for
covering up dark circles so you have to
probably heard about both yellows and
peachy tones to correct your under-eye
circles for example I have a Bobby Brown
concealer kit and they have something
called a corrector that is in salmony
shade and then a creamy concealer it's
more yellowy based so both shades work
well to get rid of the discoloration
around your eyes and this is so good I
use this usually if I'm out going on the
air I will use that actual concealer
like a cleaning concealer like from
Bobbi Brown but then I found that this
is really really nice to set that
because it's got that same peachy it's
really light and then that yellowy
quality so I just I love it so much I'm
really glad I stumbled upon it and what
a unique thing you know to kind of blend
the two the the peachy aspect and the
yellow I mean
for under-eye so I actually think I have
that on just that right now I have only
I did not put any other concealer under
my eyes today but that stuff so works
good and then the last thing I got was
the finishing powder and I got what was
called start to finish and so that means
you it says you could put it on as an
even base for your minerals and it's
this was one of them that was meant to
control oil because I really don't want
any shine on my face and it says it's
soft bronze but as you can see it's
really really light um it's got maybe
just a slight bit of color to it it's
not like white white like mineral veil
but yeah this does control shine I can't
say enough good stuff about this kit I
hope everybody gets on the website and
checks out at least a few of the
products if you don't get a kit get you
know try one I saw like blushes are like
four dollars or foundations might be
around five or so I'm not sure exactly
so check out everyday minerals calm I
was so so pleased with this kit and I
just think this is my favorite mineral
makeup thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
