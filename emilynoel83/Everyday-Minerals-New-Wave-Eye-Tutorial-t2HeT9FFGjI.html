today is from the everyday minerals new
wave collection from time to time
everyday minerals will send me some new
sets of their colors to try out and do
tutorials on and this is one of probably
my favorite ones that they have sent it
is something that can go very dramatic
and very colorful using several of their
loose shadows so we've got some really
fun shades to play with we're going to
be using them in a little different way
than I usually do rather than going
light on the lid and then darken the
crease we're kind of going dark on the
lid and fading up to a really pretty
purple shade so it's all about blending
I'm going to be kind of talking about
some important techniques that you
should know for applying a loose shadow
to your eye and then blending it out so
if you're a little confused by that
whole process you might want to stick
around through the duration of this
video and see how that goes and i'll
also let you know what i used on my lips
face and everything else so thanks for
tuning in and keep on this thing is to
apply a primer to your eyelid I used my
Too Faced shadow insurance it's going to
help the shadow stay longer and also
cling to your eyelid then i'm using a
shade called vintage denim and this is a
shimmer shade although it's kind of
different than your typical shimmer
there's not a lot of like sparkly filler
in this the shade just has a little bit
more of a sheen than a typical matte
color might have so don't be afraid of
the word shimmer really with this
particular shadow I've tapped some into
the lid and I'm going to use a flat
brush this one's from everyday minerals
you can see just how flat that is and
it's kind of small to a very good size
for packing shadow all over the lid and
that's we're actually going to be doing
what this darkest shade is going all
over the eyelid with it so you're just
going to look down into a mirror if that
helps you and just kind of start lightly
packing it on and what we're going to do
is is sort of build it up you don't want
to really get your brush just covered
with product and then try to take it on
your eyelid because chances are some of
this loose shadow is going to fall off
it's going to get on your cheek and
instead of looking like you have a
pretty Navy I look you're going to look
like you have a black eye so just Pat it
on go all the way to your inner corner
just like that
and all over the lid doesn't take a lot
of the shade to work as you can see with
one application we've got in a pretty
nice depth of color there these are
extremely pigmented shades I mean they
work like a like a pigment which is just
basically the pure color of a makeup
just working for you in itself and just
patting that along really being careful
to get very close to our lash line
sometimes it's easy to pack a color on
your lid but kind of neglect the area
that's right next to your lash line
because we're not using a separate liner
so you want that to be very dark and
once you've pack that on we're going to
just kind of do a reverse technique with
this get more of the shade on your brush
and then we're just going to flip the
brush over and allow that to be kind of
our crease color and so I'm it where I
would have used the brush like this I
put shadow on that side and I'm just
going to flip it over like that and then
I'm going to really target the crease
and just pull up and out a little bit
you can see how our other side the blue
has faded up a little bit into that
pretty purpley pink magenta to type
shade so just really get it in there and
just pull out now one of the everyday
minerals brushes that I love is this
sort of more fluffy angled brush it's
terrific for buffing out the edges of
these colors and now that it's already
packed on our lid now we can start
thinking about the back and forth
blending type motions before we really
wanted to stick to a padding or packing
on effect there because we don't want
that loose color to go everywhere now
that it's on we can do some blending so
it's just important to know the
difference between what you can and
can't do with a loose shadow so here we
are just going over the edge this is
just a bare brush and just buffing that
out to where you can't quite as easily
see the sort of line the ending point to
that blue shade now we're going to go to
one of the most unique and probably my
favorite shade in this set and it is a
pearl shade called rock anthem this is
what it looks like
absolutely gorgeous and you can see
white when they say pearl it just does
have that little bit of a sheen to it
it's purpley it's pinkish it blends very
well with this other shade and I thought
at first I was thinking maybe I'll go
all over the lid with that color but
then I kind of like almost using it as
that shade just as your lashes come up
and it's got this nice little halo of
that purpley color around it I really
like the effect there we're going to be
using the larger brush here that angled
brush that I used to buff out the blue
so just pick up some of that shade on
there even though this isn't a
traditional brush that you would pack
color on with we are first going to sort
of just do a padding approach here going
around the border of the blue we're
going to just Pat on this purple tone
see how that the line is just really
getting blurred between the two it's
exactly what we want and you can go so
intense with this color I mean this
could be absolutely and then just stand
out knock your eyes out magenta if you
want it to be what I like is using it
more for a subtle effect a very unique
look a look that you don't see on people
a lot which is really just using it in a
nice subtle manner blending it right off
the Navy I'm really enjoying that now
I'd suggest kind of cleaning your brush
off and going over the outer border of
that it's all about once you get the
color on and packed on really buffing
out the corner and then our final shade
in the kit is going to be our highlight
shade and this shade you want to use it
very sheer because it's not necessarily
one of those completely light light
shades it is oops just pulled out the
wrong one it's a shimmer shade called
French films and it's a light purple
very light lilac shade and that's why
you kind of want to be sheer with it
the area right under your brow so i'm
using my sephora rounded crease brush
picking up some of the shade and you can
see I've got some on there I've got some
in the lid and then just really padding
just making sure that i have a very
sheer amount on my brush and just using
that as the border i'm using this brush
a lot more carefully than I would in
most cases if I had am a pressed shadow
on there so just go over the border it's
going to give the look kind of a
finished look from top from from bottom
to top sort of and then next grab your
favorite liner brush I'm going to use my
Coastal Scents taklon liner brush it's
got a very precise edge to it and I'm
bringing out vintage denim again so the
dark blue that we put all over our lid
is actually going to act as our liner on
the lower lash line so just grab that
brush whatever brush you prefer for
liner and I just basically put some more
in the lid like this and then took my
brush tap tap tap tap tap and continue
to tap so you don't have too much on the
brush and what you do have on the brush
is actually on it not just falling off
and here we're going to get right in
that lash line with that shade and as
you can see this kind of these kinds of
shadows just make a perfect liner just
because it's a loose shadow and you
might not typically think of using it as
a liner it can definitely go that
direction for you and what I would
suggest as you get out to the outer edge
is to come back to your flat brush use
it just for the tip and kind of use that
to go over what you've just put on there
it's just going to going to soften it up
a little bit and actually help blend the
corner of your liner with the shade that
isn't he that is in our crease in on our
lid which is the same shade so it's not
going to be hard okay then the only
other sort of non powder liner step that
we're going to do is we're going to do
is some blue on our water line this is
really going to make the whites of your
eyes
pop and because we're using a navy shade
i'm using the Avon smooth minerals
eyeliner and the shade is indigo I
believe yeah so dark deep blue and just
slightly pull down on your on your
eyelid and you're going to line the
waterline with this I don't often do a
water line look but i just thought it
kind of fit with this somewhat more edgy
look that I'm doing here with the
everyday minerals just like that just
get that all over the water line and
then if you want to kind of touch up any
areas I sometimes draw it in just a
little bit right in here on the inner
corner but touch up any way you feel you
need to now the lashes are what kind of
take this from being a really edgy look
to being a little more feminine a little
more flirty so i'm using my steel a
major lash mascara which i'm loving for
its build ability and it's lengthening
and so I'm going to curl my lashes put
that on and then I'll join you with the
finished look and let you know what's on
my lips
alright guys welcome back this is the
finished look as you can see just dark
blue blended right up to the purple a
shade and using a little bit of color in
our water line just to really help our
eyes pop instead of that sort of closed
in feeling I sometimes fear that that
gives us this collection is really
different it I took a different twist on
this than I do with most everyday
minerals looks but the face kind of
coordinates is well on my lips I use the
everyday minerals tinted or natural lip
gloss which is more like a tinted lip
balm in pink lemonade so that's a very
very light kind of matte pink shade and
then I just went over the top of that
with the cover girl wets licks in 22
which is kind of a shimmery pink so
that's what gives me that little bit of
shine going on there and then on my face
I use the everyday minerals everyday
bronzer I also use my regular everyday
minerals foundation but I use the
everyday bronzer and the salon fun blush
which is sort of has almost a little bit
of a cool kind of like lavender tone to
it a little bit so it all really plays
together nicely on your face and I'm
just really pleased with the look I
think it's fun for every day but I think
this would be a great night time look as
well so thanks so much for watching guys
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
