tell you about my everyday mineral
sample kit that I got in what it is is
five different oil guys like this
they're so cute you get three
foundations a blush and a concealer and
you get to like make your kit you get to
pick all those colors that you get and
you get them completely free you just
pay for shipping which i think was like
six dollars or so and you get these
great little samples which is enough for
quite a few applications especially on
like the concealer and stuff and I think
it's really great and the best part
about it is that this is really high
quality stuff and so what you get I mean
here they also give you this chart of
all their colors so if it gives you any
idea of where your choices range there's
there's tons but just starting with the
foundations because you get to pick
three foundations so they have different
color families they've got warm golden
cool beige buff and olive and so I got
mine from several of those different
color families just to let you know and
then you can also pick varying coverage
levels on the foundations which i think
is kind of a unique thing for minerals
and I really like it you can get
intensive matte semi matte or original
glow I think it's called and so I chose
three different coverage levels and
three different families on the
foundation and they all actually wound
up looking a lot alike maybe one it's a
little bit warmer or one is a little bit
lighter slightly than the others but
they work well together and you could of
course mix them too but maybe when you
see what ones I got if you're kind of
confused looking through kind of
overwhelmed maybe by all those colors if
your coloring is a little like mine
which I feel like I am really washed out
by the slide over here but if your
coloring is it all like mine you might
have kind of a starting point there so
the first one I got was I got the
intense
foundation in beige neutral and that's
in the buff family and so what you get
here you're really not gonna get a whole
really great idea of the color so I'm
going to tell you more about what the
texture is like this looks more like
itty bitty pebbles like you know how
some powders look really really fine
when you shake them out this and I think
that's part of the intensive quality
that this has if any of you are familiar
with bisque from bareMinerals
you know that that's a different texture
a totally different texture than mineral
veil it's almost like it's got little
itty bitty pebbles of the minerals
rather than being completely finely
milled and that does have something to
do with the coverage you get so
intensive which is the more coverage the
most coverage you can get with this is a
little more like that it have a little
more creamy feel on your face the
coverage is really great you wouldn't
even need to use the concealer you get
when you use the intensive kind and
that's probably my favorite just seeing
is that's the only drawback sometimes of
minerals for me is when I go to work I'm
understand bright lights I'm under you
know being needing to be outdoors being
on camera you really don't want your
flaws to show through and so that's why
I want some good coverage and the only
hard thing about these little guys is
when you tap it into your lid and you
put your brush in it's tiny but you're
the regular size of course wouldn't be
this small so you wouldn't have to worry
about that so you could always like tap
this into a different one that's bigger
and use it that way but yeah the
intensive foundation and base neutral
love that that's probably my my favorite
out of them all is that kind but the
others do have their place you know it's
going to need intensive coverage Matt
was the next one up from that and I got
it in golden medium which is in the
Olive family this really isn't giving
you any idea of what color it is but you
can see my description and then you can
check out the chart on everyday mineral
come for yourself and see about where
they fit in but the Matt okay this is
still has that little bit of sort of
heavily texture but not the extent of
the intensive it is it's just what you
would think of for matte powder coverage
this is probably still maybe more
coverage than my bare minerals I think I
think the matte is more coverage than
bare minerals I'm pretty sure like I
haven't been using that long but I've
Houston for a couple of applications I
don't have it on right now I actually
used liquid foundation today so but
still this is these to the intensive or
the matte you're gonna get really nice
coverage with either of those intensive
even more so and intensive I would say
can stand alone it's a concealer too now
for the semi matte which you can get
full descriptions of what these types
are on the website as well if I'm not
describing them completely accurately I
mean I'm think I'm pretty close but an
original glow it was the one I did not
try and that's like supposedly like a
dewy look which I was just looking for
something that I could feel comfortable
wearing to work and I can't really do
the dewy look under bright light so you
look shiny
so on this color is medium beige neutral
it's under the beige family it is try
compare this is probably the most peachy
of all the ones that I have a little
more peachy a little bit lighter maybe
and this is just this appears to be the
same texture consistency whatever as my
bare minerals is same as also like my
Maybelline mineral stuff is so and
aren't they so cute I can't get over it
I just like to hold them they're so cute
so those are the foundations anyway so
I'm really happy with them like I said
for me for my purposes intense
is a good one for work for everyday be
Matt or the semi Matt would be good
choices too now the other thing you get
is a blush and this one is in Sunday
brunch and what this is is a nice pinky
peach you won't be able to see it very
well here I wish I could show it better
maybe I can like do a swatch it's a nice
pinky peach then that's what it is if
there's more pink to it maybe even than
peach and it's so pretty
it's like the prettiest blush that I
have honestly it goes on so well and you
it's not like SuperDuper sheer either
you get quite a bit of color out of it
really packs a punch so you don't need a
whole lot but yeah it's the color of
Sunday brunch and it's absolutely
beautiful I would love to try the other
blush some of the other blush colors too
because I found a feeling this is just a
really high-quality minerals and I think
all the blushes probably like there are
some really pretty color some more
orange II kind of peaches and some more
deeper plum colors I just bet I bet
they're really great but I because I
love this like I mean that's kind of
going out on a limb by saying by saying
this is one of the prettiest blushes I
have so definitely raise the views on
that and then the last thing you get is
a concealer and they do a great job on
the website of explaining what the
different concealer colors can do for
you there are some that correct redness
there are others that are just like
super good coverage some for dark skin
some for really light skin the one I got
was just called it's called sunlight and
it's what you think it's like a light
just the slide attentive golden e color
to it but it's just very light and they
recommend it for under-eye and that's
where the main area where I need the
concealer and this works well I don't
know if it really
is even necessary over the intensive
foundation but it helps I mean it's good
but you may not even necessarily need it
if you've got that great coverage
foundation but this is really nice just
to brighten you up brighten up the
corners or around here and yes it does
work if you've got to conceal other
little areas too any broken capillaries
around your nose or anything like that
works great I'm running out of time so I
got to start wrapping this up but
basically these five little adorable
samples from everyday minerals I love
them I would suggest everybody try the
sample kit free samples great stuff off
their website WWF read a minerals calm
