getting a sneak peak in this video
you're seeing it here first some new
shades from everyday minerals I know you
guys know that that is one of my
favorite mineral makeup brands it is
probably my favorite make mineral makeup
brand and I'm gonna be showing you in
this video to new face color so cheek
color and an all over face color and for
new eyeshadow shades two of which are
liners that can go totally multi-purpose
you're gonna get a look that I call soft
yet and can be very dramatic it's as
much as dramatic as you want to make it
and also three new lip shades so I hope
you guys stay tuned to see how I use
these colors and everyday minerals is a
brand that I've been using for quite
some time and it is an honor to get to
sort of show you what's ahead for the
line and preview some products and
hopefully you get excited about this
great look for fall great for
back-to-school and totally customizable
to what you're comfortable with in terms
of makeup so if you want to see more on
the products and my little review as we
go along keep on wise let me bring you
up to speed on what I've done so far on
my face first I applied the abbot's perk
me up concealer now these are not new
products here that I'm first talking
about these are just ones that I already
haven't used pretty regularly and so I
use that it's kind of a nice like peachy
golden concealer blend and so it's
really great for under the eye area to
kind of neutralize any discoloration you
may have there or really anywhere on
your face because it has really nice
coverage and then I applied one of my
favorite everyday minerals foundations
it's the matte formula and sandy medium
and so basically intensive is probably
my very favorite coverage because it is
the most coverage but honestly if you're
using their flat top brush with these
products I know I've talked about this
brush before it is so soft so dense it
feels like heaven on your face and even
with some of their lesser coverage
formulations like the the original glow
or the semi matte or anything like that
you'll find this brush will give you
even better coverage even when the
formulation is not as in
then I applied another product that I oh
this is one I already had on a hand and
it's the everyday bronzer you'll find
this in the blush section of the website
and this is just great just an all-over
bronzer shade it has you know a minimal
amount of if any shimmer I don't even I
mean I can't really pick up on it but
there is maybe a little teeny bit of
something there a little bit of a glow
but you know it's not it's not like
you're putting shimmer all over your
face so I can't really tell that I even
have shimmer on it just is a nice nice
natural bronze color okay moving on I'm
going to grab my angle blush brush this
is another everyday minerals brush I
love their brushes so much they're so
cute all right they look like the whole
flat top and this one if you already
have that flat top one this is very much
like it it feels like it it's just
shaped differently so if you love that
soft dense rich feel you're gonna like
that as well so I'm gonna use a cheek
color now and this is one of the new
shades in the collection it's called
sand cherry and as you can see it's kind
of like I mean tones of like apricot and
and it's got like kind of a golden tea
finish to it and a little bit of sparkle
that I love and so I'm gonna get a
little bit I don't know if you can see
better how that looks there maybe not
but I'm gonna again get some on my brush
regardless and put it on for you here
and this is just going to make you look
instantly luminous it does as you can
see that kind of that shimmer is coming
through a little bit and I love it I
mean I usually it takes a little bit for
me to like a product that really has
some shimmer in it just if it's a face
product just because I worry about it
and you know maybe going overboard on
that making you look oily instead of
just that that pretty dewy look but it's
nice when you're going over like a matte
formulation of foundation you know
you're really not building shimmer upon
shimmer you're just applying it like
this so I really think this is pretty
it's so fresh so not obvious
as a blush but yet it is bringing some
life to your cheeks the next new thing I
want to show you in terms of face
products is this Lucent powder and this
is in dusty miller and by Lucent powder
i mean this is the sort of tone it's
basically almost a skin tone light peach
looking powder and by Lucent it is
basically transparent it has does have a
little hint of shimmer very natural a
very nice way to basically dust over
your whole makeup look and give it kind
of a flawless appearance a very radiant
appearance and so I'm just gonna go
ahead and use my ankle brush again and
kind of just pop this all over my face
just lightly umm little bits gonna go a
long way in terms of this product
because like I said it does have a
little bit of shimmer to it but it's
it's I mean gonna give you that glow
that really very few products can give
because while you're adding the shimmer
you're not adding a thick shimmer this
is a very light product it's you know
it's just really really fun to use and
it can top off any makeup look you know
no matter what you're using this with
now for the eye color so we're gonna be
working with a lot of loose shadows /
pigments so I'm going to use an
eyeshadow base that provides a little
bit more of a sticky finish and it's not
super sticky but it's just a little more
tacky than some others because and it
will really grab those shadows make them
stand out and make them stay on your
eyes so I'm using my be lush a DOE
magnet in light and just get a little
bit of that on my finger and excuse the
lack of nails being done I also had a
little unusual experience with some
sunless tanner and so it got a little
bit on my nails there but anyway we'll
look past that right friends okay got
all that on my lid then I'm gonna go to
my first shade which is called wood
sorrel and
this is a gorgeous light periwinkle blue
it's mostly matte it does have actually
a little bit of a pearlescent quality to
it but I mean it really comes off on the
eye rather
that and a little bit darker than it
appears it appears very baby blue in
this container but you'll see when I put
it on my eye it's just a little bit
deeper but this is a gorgeous shape for
all over the lid and it makes me want to
use blues more after trying this out so
I'm gonna use my everyday mineral shadow
brush it's just a nice flat brush for
eye shadow and pack some of that color
on there and we will just pack this on
our lid see what I mean about that it
just comes off a little bit deeper than
what it does right there in the
container and the more you layer it on
the more you'll see a little more of the
shimmer just be aware of that so I've
got like I guess you've got a couple
coats on there right now and I love the
color that's coming through and then
just to kind of continue to finish that
look and by the way the way I'm using
this this is loose in that little shaker
in case you'd never use mineral shadows
before I just kind of shake or tap it in
the lid so I'm working with you know a
very small amount a little bit goes a
long way and then I'm gonna just kind of
press my brush onto all that shadow and
since it's loose you really want to kind
of press press the brush on top of it so
it really packs on there and then what
we're gonna do with that
now that we've just packed a little more
on our brush kind of work it up a little
bit higher so we can continue this blue
just up just a bit kind of into that
crease just like so and this would be a
gorgeous way to honestly if you just
wanted something quick and wanted to
play with a new color this is such a
wearable blue you could just wear it
like this one shadow shade and put on
some mascara and that would be really
fresh and beautiful but to show you kind
of the scope of what these colors can do
I'm obviously going to continue and show
you a little bit more but anyway that
shade was wood sorrel and then I'm going
to use a highlight
shade and this is Queen Anne's lace and
this is gonna be just your you know kind
of standard light pearly champagne
shimmery shade um it's not you know too
heavy it's not going to go on real thick
I've tapped a little bit of that into my
lid and I'm going to use my Sephora
rounded crease brush for this because
I'm not really wanting to pack it on but
I'm just wanting to apply that all the
way up to the brow bone here to give
ourselves a little added luminosity
there and then I'm going to take the
smallest brush I own four eyes this is
actually from Coastal Scents it's the C
148 mini contour it's really not
contouring anything but I packed some of
that light shade on there and this is
just perfect the perfect brush for kind
of getting the shadow right there on
your your a tear duct area getting that
added brightness right in the corner of
your eye it's really great for that so
just apply that all over like I said
this is a kind of sheer shade this is
this shade could honestly transform a
lot of your shadows from matte to
something a little more shimmery or
something a little more luminous you
know what I mean because it's not one of
those thick Oh super opaque shadows but
there we go we've kind of just given us
giving ourselves a little light right
there in the corner of the eye and this
once again could be a stopping point if
you wish but if you want to deepen this
up and add a little more drama I'm going
to go ahead and use and it's an eyeliner
shade called sweet woodruff
and this shade is kind of hard to
describe it's obviously very dark it
does have a little shimmer and it does
have a hint of what I believe are some
tones of royal blue and purple so that
is a gorgeous gorgeous formulation for
an eyeliner but since this had a little
more shimmer to it I mean not tons but
it but just a hint I thought this would
be something I could work in to make a
deeper Isla eyes shadow shade so this
will just basically show you how just
because some of these shades forever
minerals are labeled eyeliner they can
still be your deeper shadow shade
because they're extremely extremely
pigmented and you're gonna really like
them for that so I'm gonna go back to my
everyday minerals shadow brush I'm got
the product right there in the lid just
a tiny bit and I'm not even gonna use
all of that I'm gonna get a little bit
on my brush packing it on it's very
important when you're using dark shades
like this to really press it into your
brush you don't want flying all over
your face so I'm gonna just I'm just
tapping that lightly into my crease okay
just with sort of that kind of wedging
it in motion just like that and I'm
gently lifting my brush with every
stroke okay see how we're getting depth
that is visible even when our eye is
open that's what some people struggle
with they've been doing a look and their
eye has been closed the entire time
they've done the look and then they open
up and they're frustrated because they
can't see the color anymore this is the
benefit to doing your makeup kind of
looking down into a mirror or keeping
your eye open somewhat because then you
can tell you know okay what are people
gonna actually see from this look when I
my eyes are open okay so I'm just I have
not gone back and put anything more
there really on the brush I'm just
continuing to blend out what I've
already done it's amazing how a tiny
tiny amount of shadow goes a long way
and that's basically what we're going to
do with that as you can see I've just
concentrated it first in the crease
because that's naturally where the
deepest color would be in that sort of
shadowed area already right there and
then just kind of blending it up it's so
easy to manipulate even for a dark loose
shadow which I would say would be one of
the most challenging things to work with
these are very easy to use
I'm taking my Sephora rounded crease
brush just bare just to buff out the
edges even more keeping the look soft um
then the other liner shade that I have
this is the fourth new kind of shadows
here is weeping willow like I said it's
an eyeliner shade it comes off more
matte than sweet woodruff does and it
does have some tones of like it seems
like a matte charcoal to me and it may
also like in the packaging I feel like
there's some blue in it too but
basically this is just your classic dark
you know it kind of shade and it's not
gonna come across with a lot of sparkle
I'm using Coastal Scents tackle on liner
brush just gives me a really really
defined line I've got a little bit of
that just a tiny amount here in my cap
I'm gonna press my brush into it packing
it on my brush and I'm just going to
line the upper lash line with this if
you wanted to add like a mixing medium
and get more of a liquid appearance to
this you definitely could for me I'm
just using it keeping the look you know
soft like I said it's a soft yet intense
look which was a fun kind of new concept
for me to play with and just this is so
easy to use guys if you are a scared of
liner and have had bad luck applying
liquid and bad luck even with pencil
taking an intense pigmented powder like
this and just using a liner brush with
it it gives you a much softer line and
it's much more foolproof apply it on the
lower lash line as well and that's where
it's gonna be even more visible since we
haven't been messing with any other
darker shades down there and I'm kind of
using that brush to blend the corner
there as you can see you could get an
even more intense smoky look if you use
less of the light shades and more of
just the liner shade like all over the
lid can you imagine I mean you could get
a super intense look I feel like this
look is sort of intense but yet it's
still kind of the middle ground for what
these shadows could do okay
I'm taking it in most of the way and
then I'm gonna go back to the Queen
Anne's lace shade and because I do want
to keep that light showing right here
using my tiny tiny brush
and just going over that again to make
sure I keep the little light here next
thing we're gonna do is curl our lashes
for the lashes in this look I'm not
using any false lashes but I wanted a
look that would kind of you know really
compliment the softness of this look so
not necessarily a mascara that's gonna
make my lashes look really thick and
chunky but something more so that's
gonna define every lash and just add to
the softness of the look so for that I'm
using my be lush HD mascara in carbon
black I've used this in some videos
before and the brush is that small so
it's going to really highlight every
lash make it very easy for you to get to
every lash I really like it for just I
mean like it's high definition it's
defining every lash that you got it is
nice in terms of lengthening as well and
also if you put it on your lower lash
line you're not gonna get like smudging
everywhere it actually holds up pretty
well there too so I just get a little
bit of that on you can see how it's just
highlighting whatever it touches I'm
gonna probably do one more coat on each
and then I'll join you with the finish
we buddy here is the finished look this
is an awesome awesome look for fall as
we're kind of rounding out summertime
it's playing off of some of the natural
luminosity in your skin with those face
shades that really you know bring out
some added radiance it kind of shows
that even though you know we're out of
summer you can still definitely play
your face up with a little bit of
shimmer in some key places and the eye
look is basically what I call soft yet
intense because you can use those liner
shades and they're so multi-purpose to
use them as a shadow as well so I hope
you enjoyed this little preview of some
of the new everyday minerals colors I
think they're super fun to play with
totally appropriate for all ages really
you can as you can see as I kind of
showed you during the eyeshadow look
there's some different stopping points
really you know you could use you don't
need to go necessarily with the darker
colors but this is just sort of showing
you how you can do that if you choose
and I do want to tell you real quick
what's on my lips there are some new
like natural lip glosses and they're
basically like a tinted lip balm I
really like them I like the pink
lemonade which is just a nice nude pink
that's what I've got on right now but I
added to it umm monster-movie which is
sort of like a I mean it comes off it's
like a deep berry Brown sort of shade
but I just put that on my fingers and I
like applied it just to deepen up that
pink lemonade just a little bit just to
give a little more dimension for it and
I really like that combo there and then
there's one other one that's new and
it's called soccer practice and this is
just going to be like kind of your
classic really nude really natural lip
but these make your lips look fuller
when you put them on I don't know I just
feel like there's they're not overly
glossy there's a nice little Sheen to
them they actually have decent staying
power and this the scent is just kind of
like a natural scent like it's very
natural like there's no like strawberry
Kiwi thrown into this stuff and thank
you guys so much for tuning in for this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
