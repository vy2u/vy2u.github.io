video this is something I'm really
excited about because if you've been a
loyal viewer of mine you know that I
really like everyday minerals products
and so what I'm going to be doing today
is passing along some of the latest
products for the winter collection and
that includes some eye products and a
cheek color and with the eyes we have a
gorgeous natural toned look here but
it's incorporating a lot of gorgeous
sparkle and shimmer in it as well so it
really makes you think holidays when you
look at these shades so if you want to
see how I pulled it all together keep on
watching
the first thing I did was applied my Too
Faced shadow insurance all over my lid
and then I'm going to take this loose
shadow in cardamom and this is a really
really pretty shimmery sort of like
light taupe is what it sort of comes off
as so I'm just going to tap a little bit
of that into the lid here and I'm going
to use my customer my Coastal Scents my
everyday minerals flat brush here and
just pick some of that shadow up this
has a little bit of a beige beige ish
look to it too and I'm just gonna pack
that on all over the lid and you can see
instantly the really really fine shimmer
coming off of that next we're gonna go
to a shade that we can do all over this
brow bone area works is a really pretty
highlight in that shade is allspice and
so here we're looking at a shade that's
a little lighter than what we just used
a little more just um you know classic
pearly highlight shade and this also has
some sparkle in it as well so when we're
talking you know the winter collection
and holidays this is really um
appropriate I think to have that shimmer
there and so I'm just using a fluffy
sort of a rounded crease brush from
Sephora and I'm just using that to get
that light sheer shimmer all over from
my eyelid sort of crease area to the
brow next I'm going to be working with
sort of a medium shade to give us kind
of a wash of color all over our crease
and that shade is nutmeg and this looks
a little bit lighter kind of in the
container than it does when you actually
use it but this is gonna be kind of a
medium medium beige II or slash very
light brown to be more accurate probably
and I'm gonna be using my little
everyday minerals eye brush that's sort
of like it's like a crease brush but
it's very stiff and it has the same sort
of texture as the everyday mineral space
brushes do so it's really really nice
for blending I'm going to pick up some
of this shade here and just get that in
the crease area
just a nice light natural wash of color
and then we'll go in with something
deeper in a second this is really pretty
for that natural you know like not
overdone look I could see this with just
some nice dark lashes and red lips at
this point and this would make a really
pretty holiday look nutmeg really
doesn't have much shimmer to it not so
much like the other two we just used but
this next shade is really unique in that
it's deeper and it has a lot of nice
sparkle to it and this is my favorite
shade of the bunch it's called juniper
and so with juniper you're looking at a
deeper taupe shade with some pretty kind
of khaki golden sparkle to it it just is
very very unique and very workable for
you know pretty much any any look you're
doing on throughout the rest of your
face this would still be nice it has a
little bit of like a khaki green tone to
it but it's it's still those topes earth
tones really really wearable colors and
so I'm going to pick some of that up
with that same brush I just used to tap
off the excess and this is going to be a
nice deep shade for our crease and you
can see the sparkle just coming out of
this this is so pretty and what I love
about the sparkle and everyday mineral
shades is that it's not a big glitter
sort of Sparkle it's very fine and soft
and just very appropriate for this look
for the holidays as well you can see how
smooth of a blend we're getting that's
why I like to do kind of a wash of a
medium shade first and then go in with
my darker shade because that blend comes
off very smooth your camera or your the
video really isn't deceiving it too much
here this is a very neutral taupe II
earth tone kind of look but that's nice
because when you get these shades
they're very all-purpose and you'll be
able to use them in a lot of different
ways next for liner I'm going to go with
like a deep Navy liner for this look I'm
going to be using my Smashbox
in cream eyeliner in blue steel so it's
kind of got a little bit of a metallic
quality to it but it is just kind of a
deep navy blue liner I'm using my
Smashbox number 21 brush for this and
I'm just gonna go from inner to outer
corner here at the outer edge I'm just
kind of making it a little bit thicker
and then I'm I'm starting to blend down
to the lower lash line as well here just
like so and this isn't going to be
carried all the way underneath but you
can see how we're getting a really
pretty kind of natural look right there
what we aren't going to do is kind of
top off what we put on the lower lash
line and and go further in with the
juniper shade so you might want to shake
a lift a little bit of that back on to
your little pallet I guess your lid and
I'm using my Coastal Scents tackle on
liner brush a really nice stiff eyeliner
brush to go in and kind of get that
sparkle going right underneath there
it's taupey it's it's it's natural
nobody's gonna be really be able to
point to it and see that you've got like
thick eyeliner down underneath or
anything but it just is a really pretty
and very unique shade the next thing I'm
going to do is apply my covergirl exact
highlights and black pearl I'm just
gonna put a coat of that on the top and
the bottom I'm also going to kind of get
my brows in order here and then I'll
join you with the finished look
alright guys I'm back with the finished
look I love this look especially as we
head into the holidays because it gives
you that kind of classic glamorous look
especially if you pair it with kind of
like a brighter lip like I did I was
gonna go with red and then I thought
well we'll do something a little
different I went with my Rimmel lasting
finish lipstick and amethyst shimmer
which is actually a really pretty kind
of like magenta pink with some with the
definite blue undertone to it and so I
put that on and I just think it finishes
the look really well I like how these
shades are so wearable so natural but
they have a great sparkle to them that
makes them kind of glamorous and what
really finishes this look off and gives
it that you know warm kind of holiday
look is the cheek color for the winter
collection and it is called wild vines
blush and this shade there you go you
can kind of see there it's a really
pretty um kind of a rosy blush it's not
shimmery so you're gonna get a lot of
full color out of this it reminds me a
little bit of Sunday brunch
okay I've found my little Sunday brunch
sample I'm kind of comparing the two
here they are very very similar in their
intensity which I really like they're so
pigmented and you get some good color
off of them Sunday brunch just has a
little more orange to it and this is a
little more on the pink side so anyway
guys thank you so much for tuning in and
watching this video I hope you enjoy it
you know I'm a big fan of everyday
minerals so I'm really excited to pass
along what's new thanks for watching
guys have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
