this eye tutorial
I'm calling this look every day sexy
it's something that is a really pretty
eye look but it's not over-the-top and I
think it's totally appropriate for day
to day wear it can take you into the
night as well and look completely
appropriate there also so I'm gonna be
using my a a warm palette because I've
had lots of requests to do more looks
with that because I really have
recommended that palette and I need to
do more looks using it so this is a
really simple look to achieve but I
think what makes it so wearable is the
fact that it is so blended out and it's
it's got a little smoky edge to it but
not the extreme smoky look that I've
done with some other looks in the past
so I hope you enjoy this video and keep
on the step one is to go ahead and put a
primer on your eyelid I used my Too
Faced shadow insurance primer already
and then I'm going to take my 88 warm
palette and I'm going to kind of be
focused down in this corner where the
sort of grays and blacks are and I'm
gonna be using this shade right here to
go all over my lid it's one over and one
up on the left hand side of your palette
so I'm going to use my Sigma SS 239
brush so this is very comparable to the
elf eyeshadow brush you don't have to
use these exact products to get this
look but if this is just going to kind
of give you an idea of what I'm working
with so as you can see I'm just kind of
packing that on all over the lid to give
us kind of that medium gray shade I
think what kind of makes this look
pretty and unique from some other things
that I've done is that the shade on the
lid is light but it's not like white you
know what I mean so I'm going to be
going back to that shade and then kind
of just flipping my brush over and
pushing that shade right up into the
crease and kind of just building this
sort of circle of color around the eye
area there so your edges might be a
little uneven this is a pretty light
shade kind of forgiving so I'm going to
use my SS 224 brush
and just buff out that edge so now we've
got that nice base shade that's gonna
make other shades we put on top of it
blend a little easier and by the way
I've got my little hotel on here my hair
is drying right now what I'm gonna go
ahead and do at this point now is go to
a high light shade and I'm gonna be
using one that has four shades down and
four shades over from the left-hand side
of the palette and that is this shade
right here it's kind of a golden II um
like kind of buttercream shimmery shade
I use this a lot as a highlight here
because I like the kind of golden finish
it it leaves and I'm just gonna put that
right take it right up to my brow and
just kind of buff between the two so
we've got our nice kind of base level of
color on there then I'm gonna use my SS
252 brush a nice flat brush and we're
gonna go to one of the darker shades in
this palette right here in the lower
corner it's kind of a slightly shimmery
charcoal grayish black shade so just get
your brush in that and this kind of a
little bit goes a long way with this
shade so be aware of that don't load too
much liner brush got about that much on
and I'm just going to kind of wedge this
in my crease and start to deepen it up a
little bit and I like to use just a
little bit of this color at first just
to kind of see where I'm at and then you
know build it up that's kind of the
safest way to use this shadow so just go
right into the crease
and then you might decide you want a
little bit more I'm not really building
an actual outer V like I would normally
I'm just kind of laying the color down
and maybe concentrating a little bit
more on the outer half of the crease but
not really trying to necessarily create
a bold outer V with this look it's all
gonna look very blended ideally okay so
kind of pay attention to your other eye
you knows make sure you're building it
up to the same intensity and and shape
and then once again use a bear brush the
Sigma SS 224 is good
for it's just kind of sweeping over that
color and making it look very seamless
there and we may go back with that dark
shade once again once we do our liner
but this is kind of where we're going to
stay for now we are gonna go ahead and
do a very fine liquid line with a little
subtle wing here on the side I'm going
to be using my la girl fine line it's
one of those liners that I recently
reviewed and this is just a great way to
get a nice natural line and I'm just
gonna start on the inner corner and
you'll get a very very fine line with
this once you've got your line you want
to think about winging it out and you
can do that by just sort of going from
the corner of your eye and gearing it up
right towards the outer edge of your
eyebrow there like you're kind of
pointing up to it and then connect over
from the base part of your liner there
and then just to fill it in you've got
kind of a subtle wing there is kind of
pointing up leaving your eyes having
kind of a lifted look to them and so
that's the top lash line for the bottom
I'm going to use my Sigma SS 266 so a
nice little at sharpen liner brush there
and I'm going to be using this matte
black shade that's three shades over in
the warm palette from the lower
left-hand side so get a little bit of
that on your brush and we're just gonna
do here is not necessarily you know true
we're not really blending you can't
really blend this texture with a liquid
that is dried there on your eye but you
can kind of work up to it and and sort
of match up to that so you're kind of
connecting I guess and then just smudge
this in with your lower lashes I'm gonna
go to the inner corner and you're gonna
see that we're going to smudge this out
even more so you don't have to be too
super precise here
it's like so and next using the sort of
pencil brush the SS 219 I'm going to go
in and just use that to further smudge
this shade out give it an even softer
line than it already has
I really like how that brush does that
and then we want to accent the look a
little bit more I'm gonna be going in
with this mini contour brush from
Coastal Scents that I like so much and
I'm gonna go with a very very light
shade in this palette it is to over from
the left hand side it's so very very ooh
I just stuck my fingernail in one of
those colors oops I said anyway it's a
very very light shimmery silver so get
some of that on that little brush or
like a q-tip and we're just gonna blend
it in there and blend it right over the
top of this as well now my
recommendation once you've done your
liner and everything is to go back and
look at the shape you've got going on
here and you may want to even deepen
things up a little bit more I'm going
back to the matte black shade with the
pencil brush getting just a little bit
on there and then sort of deepening
things even more here on the outer
corner for a lot of people this is
easier to do than to just go straight
into it and try to build the outer V
with shadow sometimes you're just going
off of your liner can kind of help
everything so just put a little bit
deeper shape color down there mainly on
the outer corner and then take a big
fluffy bear brush and buff it out it's
just kind of you're seeing that pattern
here it's the application and then the
blending that really makes this look
work okay the next thing I'm going to do
is curl my eyelashes and I'm kind of
revisiting mascara that I thought was
pretty good at first and I'm enjoying
more and more how it kind of fans the
lashes out and it's covergirl LashBlast
and
I also like how it really doesn't smudge
I have recommended this to people who
say they have big smudging problems with
their mascara but they don't want to use
waterproof and so this is a really good
one for that so I'm going to apply a
couple coats to the top and some on the
bottom and I'll join you with the
finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
very very easy to wear look for a
day-to-day basis but a very pretty and
feminine look as well we go using a
little bit of the outer V technique but
in a very very subtle way and on my lips
also I kind of kept them pretty natural
I use one of my favorites tinted lip
balms from Palladio the shade is golden
pink I think I showed bronzy pink in one
of my last videos but this is golden
pink it's got a little bit more of a
pinky tone to it and then to really
accent that and give a little extra
gloss I use my NYX diamond sparkle lip
gloss or NYX or whatever you prefer in
rose sparkle so that's the kind of shade
that is so I just put that over the top
and all over my face I use Maybelline
mineral power makeup I use the mineral
power bronzer but kept that pretty light
and I used a the Maybelline mineral
powder blush in sort of a peachy shade
so I hope you enjoy the look guides also
I got this little scarf it has some
little friend John it has like a heart
pattern and you know some loll various
patterns on it and I got it for about 5
bucks at Walmart so thanks so much for
tuning in for this video and have a
great day everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
