this fun I tutorial sorry about my hair
by the way it's so kind of wet I'm
actually getting ready to go judge a
local pageant later this evening so i
wanted to do kind of a fun I look and
what I did was incorporated a really
great teal shade on this look and then
just kind of deepened it up with you
know sort of some tones of black it's
really a super simple look to do so if
you want to see how I pulled it all
together keep on watching think you're
going to do is prime your eye I'm going
to use my Smashbox photo finish lid
primer and this is a actually a really
good primer I like it a lot because it
totally neutralizes the natural
discoloration you might have on your
eyelid so you put some boobs put some on
there and just blend it up all over and
you're going to get just a really smooth
and neutral surface to start out your
eye look the next thing I'm going to do
is grab one of my glam couture shadows
and this one is in Cancun it's a super
fun kind of deep teal shade and i'm
going to use what is actually a
concealer brush from my Coastal Scents a
big brush kit the reptile brush kit that
looks like it's got like black snake
skin on the outside of the package and
I'm just going to get some of that on
this packet on this flat brush any flat
brush will do I just think this one
helps me have a lot of control and tap
off the excess because the little bit
goes a long way with this shadow and
just start packing that shade all over
your lid
and I like to kind of build it up i'm
starting with just a little bit here and
then i'm going to grab a little bit more
once you've got it on your lid also kind
of try to build it up into your crease
just a little bit just kind of gently
pulling that shade upward and outward
just like that next we want to kind of
brighten things up just a little bit on
the inner corner so I'm taking my
covergirl single and champagne just any
light shimmery shade will do i'm just
taking this smaller kind of practically
like a detail brush that's from that
same Coastal Scents kit and just working
that in right around the inner corner
and right down below just to brighten it
up a little bit kind of lighten the
color almost making it seem like we did
two different shades here I mean like
it's of the blue color but really it's
just one and we're just lightening it
slick so okay next we do want to get
some of that blue working in underneath
our eyes so take any kind of liner brush
you like to use this is once again from
that same Coastal Scents kit and it's a
lot an angled brush and with it in this
kind of a you know what packing it on
like this it really comes on kind of
nice and deep so I'm just applying that
all the way underneath here
it's like that and then you can kind of
go back and smudge over that next we're
going to go in our crease with sort of a
soft black shade this is glam couture
shadow and frosted black so it's just a
little bit more on the charcoal gray
side so I'm going to take my essence of
beauty medium crease brush and just get
a little bit of that on there and just
kind of go all throughout my crease with
this shade this is a great shade just to
give you that kind of soft smokey look
to your shadows if instead of using just
straight black if you kind of struggle
with blending like a matte black shade
this is really easy to work with so just
kind of one that all the way from outer
to inner corner of your crease just like
that and then i'm going to use go one
step further with it just to get a
little bit of added depth right there in
the outer corner and i'm going to use
one of my favorite glam couture shadows
called night in vegas and it's just
sparkly black and not a whole lot of the
sparkle comes through but it is super
super pigmented and so i'm going to get
some of that on my fine crease brush and
go right in here and they in the corner
and just kind of swirl that out just a
little bit really defining the outer
part of the look and then i'm going to
take one of fun this is new to me i
haven't tried these these particular
glam couture shadows before but they're
the dimensional shadows and this one is
kind of like a soft pink imam shade and
so i'm going to use my sephora rounded
crease brush a little bit fluffier brush
get a little bit on there and i'm just
going to blend this along the outer
border of the entire look here so just
kind of right here right on the edge of
that black let's go back for a little
more just softening that edge
creating a little bit of a warmer look
okay and then for our ultimate highlight
shade I'm going back to our covergirl
single in champagne nice light shimmery
kind of cream color and use that right
up to the eyebrow just like that for our
eyeliner on my upper lash line on using
my NYC liquid liner in black and a sort
of a demo of this has been requested i
blogged about how much i love this super
cheap liquid eyeliner so just to show
you how it works you'll get to see in
this tutorial it's got a very fine brush
tip and i'm going to take this all the
way from the inner corner here all the
way across to the outer corner
ok so just it's I mean it's really
really smooth I'm going back to get a
little more on the brush because i am
going to be weighing it out and doing a
little bit extra here on the outside so
kind of take it straight out instead of
following where your i might go down
like that you're going to go straight
out then go from the very corner of your
eye and kind of draw up to make that V
and then just fill it in
just so so easy this is so black and
rich now on our lower lashline you'll
recall we went with that kind of deep
blue shadow or that deep teal and so I'm
just going to go over that with my la
pencil liner in black and basically just
to it'll kind of just make a little more
sense i mean i just kind of like how it
it follows right along and blends in
with that upper upper lashline really
easily there so just kind of blend that
right at the corner and continue
blending kind of smudging all the way
along your lower lashline there sorry
I'm just going to set that line with
some of this night in Vegas shade using
my angled liner brush and you might be
surprised and it may not come through
very well on here but some of that teal
is still kind of showing through so
that's nice and then if you want to kind
of readjust your highlight shade going
right around our tear duct area just
take any kind of small brush you like or
a q-tip and just get a light shade on
there and just go right around it like
that next I'm going to apply a couple of
coats of covergirl fantastic lash
mascara on top a coat of Maybelline
flash discovery on the bottom just get
that really nice definition on those
really fine lashes and then I'm going to
use my let's see where did it go my mod
la andrea mod lash lashes number 21 they
look like that so a pretty natural lash
but just to add a little thickness there
so once I get that done I'll join you
with the finish guys here's the finished
look very very simple to put together
and a big part of why it's so easy is
because these shadows even though even
though they're really inexpensive they
are so easy to blend so you're going to
get through the look pretty quickly if
you're trying this on your own and there
is such a wide range of colors from this
brand and if you look back or search
like glam couture in my videos you will
find several other looks I'd done with
these kinds of Shadows so they're really
fun to use and there's it's just such a
nice fun wide range but if I would
recommend one shade in particular to
this just nice to have in your
collection this shade called night in
Vegas is gorgeous it's got that gold
sparkle in it and it will just work well
with any luck just for deepening up your
crease and creating some contrast and so
is frosted black that's just going to be
a little less intense than night in
Vegas a--'s and frosted black um there
in two different kind of categories on
the website and this comes a little big
in a little bigger size but it's more
just like a straight-up shimmer without
the glitter in it but anyway I hope you
enjoy this look
my lips I went ahead and lined and
filled in my lips with my Rimmel
exaggerated lip liner in East End snob
which is just a really light kind of
nude pink and then I went over that with
mac lipstick and angel just a nice soft
white pink there and then to top it all
off just to give a little bit gloss I
used my NYX lip gloss in baby rose so
this is just really light and shimmery
it's almost clear if you used it alone
so anyway that's how I got the look guys
I hope you enjoy it a little bronzer and
maybe some peach color blush to this and
you will have a great look so thanks so
much for tuning in have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
