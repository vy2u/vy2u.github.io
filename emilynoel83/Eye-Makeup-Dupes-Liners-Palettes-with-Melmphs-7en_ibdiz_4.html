this video on one of my favorite makeup
related topics and that is dupes if
you're not familiar with what a dupe is
it's basically like a drugstore
alternative to a high-end product so
you're finding something that looks the
same performs the same but has a lower
price to Aaron a lot of dupes videos
already but I'm especially excited about
this one because it's a collaboration
with Melissa her channel is Mel and P HS
or I just sometimes think of it as milfs
but she's awesome and she's got a lot of
insight as well where makeups concerned
she's very entertaining funny fun to
watch and she likes dupes too so where
dupes are concerned the more the merrier
right so if you watch this video and you
want to stroll on over to her video that
would be awesome
for this video the focus is on AI
products and I've got a bunch of
eyeliners that's sort of a territory I
haven't really touched yet where dupes
are concerns so I've got a bunch of
eyeliner dupes and you might be thinking
oh matching a black liner to another
black liner good job but it's really
about the formula the staying power
I really have a high standard where
eyeliner is concerned and I'm really
frustrated with liners that don't do
what they say they're going to do so I
can say with confidence that I found
dupes that really perform as well as the
high-end kind so I've already duped most
of the Mac shadows that I own I already
have a video on that a link to that
below as well so you can see what some
of those alternatives are from the
drugstore so with this video I thought
I'd do something different I thought I'd
take some of the most popular palettes
like naked one too some Too Faced
palettes and different ones and come up
with some comparable drugstore palettes
not duping each individual shade in the
palette with a single shadow but finding
another palette that really can perform
the same way as those other ones I'm
gonna try to zip through these kind of
quickly but you're going to see pictures
of the products and pictures of the
swatch too but as far as just a classic
black pencil liner Urban Decay 24/7
glide on pencil in Xero is kind of a
standard I know a lot of people are
familiar with this pencil it does glide
on very easily and hazard
nice staying power but from the
drugstore actually a whole line of
eyeliners you're going to see a lot more
of these that really compare to the
urban decay are the NYX
slide-on liners these are also in a
pencil form you do have to sharpen them
just like you have to sharpen these but
the texture is so much the same you can
really if you swatch it you know rep
right across it get some moisture in
contact with it it really lasts a long
time now if you're a fan of the
automatic liners that twist up instead
of being something you have to sharpen
I've got some alternatives there as well
for great black eyeliners these
particularly are really nice eyeliners
in the waterline one of my best of all
time eyeliners in the water line is the
malli ever color automatic waterproof
liner in onyx it's a mouthful of a name
there find it to be creamy but it's not
as creamy maybe as these that I
mentioned the urban decay and the NYX so
they're for that little bit of dryness I
think helps it adhere better to your
waterline and it just seems to really
last a long long time it seems to
outlast everything but I found something
else that's really really comparable and
it's the Milani liquid eye it's the
liquid like it says eyeliner pencil in
black and so don't get me wrong this is
not a liquid eyeliner this is a pencil
but they're saying it basically glides
on as easy as liquid and it really seems
to last a long long time in the
waterline so I think that's a great
option another great drugstore automatic
pencil but lasts almost as well as the
Malley and the Milani is the Maybelline
master drama midnight master a
wonderfully intense rich black liner if
you can't find the Milani I would
definitely go for this I've recommended
this countless times I'm really really
impressed by that line rich dark
chocolate brown that's a great kind of
liner to have in your collection a
really nice one color wise great
pigmentation based perfect eyes
waterproof liner in perfect espresso I
would definitely debate the waterproof
claim on this one but color wise it's a
gorgeous rich dark brown
and one from the drugstore that you can
get that is going to really have better
staying power look at when that happens
is the next slide on liner in brown
perfection same richness and color
better staying power everything into
some deeper yet very wearable eyeliner
colors it's nice to have a navy blue
using navy blue liners I think can
really make the whites of your eyes look
a little bit brighter it can also be
really flattering on brown eyes love
using a nice navy blue and a really
great liner is from Tarte it's the
emphasize aqua gel eyeliner I'm not even
sure if they still make these but I
remember using this and thinking oh hey
the lights on like buttah it works so
well I mean it's just very easy to use
and a gorgeous you know true Navy
and a really nice one comparable from
the drugstore is the Neutrogena
nourishing eye liner the shade is
Twilight blue Ashley really enjoy these
Neutrogena eyeliners and Inc they're
very easy to use you can smudge them out
too they have that nice little like
smudger tip and a little built-in
sharpener in the bottom if you like
those great mossie kind of olive green
colors a really pretty one from Urban
Decay is called mil vu maybe you're
familiar with this color it really does
have a nice semi metallic finish to it
but still a lot of nice green intensity
and a dead on color dupe for this and a
dupe for that nice creamy formula and
staying power is that Milani liquid eye
again we mentioned this in the black
shade earlier but this is the one just
called green and it's not that bright
you know kelly green it is more that
olive green just like mildewed from
Urban Decay did I mention the Urban
Decay 24/7 pencils are a lot like the
next slide on liners because I got a
couple more recommendations for you here
this one is the Urban Decay 24/7 an
electric this is great for that trend
that you see a lot where people are sort
of popping their lower lashline with a
little bit of a bright teal color or
it's kind of like a light turquoise I
think it's really really pretty day
great drugstore shade that mimics that
tone exactly is the next slide on liner
in Azure it's going to give you that
very same look same staying power
gorgeous color for summer
purple fans I've got a great purple idea
for you here this is the Urban Decay
24/7 pencil in ransom it's kind of a
unique purple it's not just flat purple
color but it's got a little bit of a
unique Sheen to it so I was actually
really surprised to find something like
this in the next slide on liner in
purple blaze another gorgeous purple
color and something to keep in mind with
these more colorful shades like the blue
I just talked about or this one
these can be great they're so creamy you
know go all over your lid and use it as
like a colorful base and then top it off
with something else you know these are
really pretty versatile shades too one
more thing I just really want to give a
shout out to one single eyeliner that I
kind of rediscovered in my collection as
I was looking for dupes and I couldn't
find anything that I had high-end that
was exactly like this one but I think
this blue is stunning it's if you like
something that's a little more bluish
than Navy try the Maybelline master
drama in sapphire strength it is a
knockout blue or an inner rim brightener
I know I've mentioned this before but I
thought I'd give it a shout out again if
you missed it it's the Tarte emphasized
inner rim brightener love this love the
staying power I really can't say
anything bad about it plus you don't
have to sharpen it so I mean this is
just a great solid awesome product but
if you want to save some money from the
drugstore its Rimmel scandaleyes in news
the same kind of brightening effect
impressive staying power for something
you're gonna put on the waterline as
well I've had so many tweets of people
saying I tried that Rimmel scandaleyes
and loved it so this has become a
must-have for a lot of people I don't
have tons of high-end cream and liquid
liners but I did find a real similarity
in a couple that I have here
it's the Tarte Amazonian clay liner in
black and I have it from the color the
wild collection so it's got this cute
little leopard print top to it but this
is this is a kind of standard liner that
they do have in their collection all the
time just different packaging but it's a
very very rich and creamy liner that
sets to a very long wearing sort of
state
a really nice one from the drugstore
that I feel like texture-wise seems
exactly the same is the l'oreal
infallible lacquer liner and it's in
blackest black one really wears
wonderfully throughout the day so I
would highly recommend that all right
now it's palette time I don't know if
anybody's heard of these before naked
naked palettes everybody loves these
things and you know if you have them
chances are they're a must have in your
collection but to this day I get tweets
from people saying have you found
another palette that's just like it that
I could you know get and spend less
money on and I actually have found
something that I think you're really
gonna love that has overlap from both of
those naked palettes in one palette my
friends this is from forever 21 yes
forever 21 I spent less than $10 on this
thing and it has some amazingly textured
eyeshadows I'm serious it's one thing to
dupe a product and just dupe a color and
come up with the comparable color but
these textures surprised me so much is I
mean like the surprise of wet and wild
being as good as it is these are amazing
too palette has a lot of pearly shimmery
shades it has several metallic shades it
has I would say three totally matte
colors it has like a matte light brown a
matte warm Brown and a matte black now
I'm not saying every single color in
here is an Urban Decay Naked dupe of
some kind but I find that a lot of them
really are comparable and if you're
talking about getting a similar look you
could wear this and tell everybody you
used an urban decay pout they probably
believe you I'm trying to encourage
lying here but this is really good stuff
great blend ability got this on a whim I
ordered it online I didn't know that it
was going to be as good as it was but
talk about being pleasantly surprised
this is Ossining the balance of light
medium and dark shades and this is
really good and to allow you to have
some variety and the kind of looks you
put together but if you've seen in the
pictures that I'm showing you know there
are some actual matches for some of
those naked palettes so I just really
wanted to give this a
chin is a very affordable way to get the
looks that you get from The Naked
palette this tastes boudoir eyes this is
a really pretty palette that came out I
think it came out a little bit before
Valentine's Day and this in this palette
you're talking about a mix of some light
pinks things getting a little bit purple
taupe Grande the Knicks of butt-naked
eyes I tell you has a surprising amount
of similarities with not only the peachy
light shades but also some of the deeper
colors and plus you're getting some
really large shadows in this NYX palette
as well a really big mirror and as NYX
likes to throw in with a lot of their
products you're getting like a separate
little face tray underneath as well with
four blushes a couple highlights and a
bronze I think you're gonna find some
shades in here where you maybe have to
work a little harder to make the color
come off just like the boudoir eyes but
at the same time there are also some
shades in here that do have the same
color payoff and are a little less flaky
so that's good to know as well one of my
favorite all-time Too Faced palettes is
probably the natural at night I love all
of the Browns in here some really rich
colors they throw in some sort of olive
green type shades it's beautiful I love
working with this you know what I also
love my wet and wild comfort zone
palette I never really stop to think
that these two actually have a lot of
over some shades you know like matte
shades in here that aren't in here in
terms of really similar color families
here I mean there's so much that's the
same and I find what I don't maybe like
about this Too Faced palette I do like
better in the wet and wild for example
these shades called night light and full
moon there's some of those ultra
shimmery shades and if you know Too
Faced well you know they have some
shadows that tend to be a little bit
flaky like glitter comes out everywhere
this gorgeous eyelid shade here in the
wet and wild palette doesn't do that it
just gives you rich kind of pinky peach
color that I love the crease shade right
here in the wet and wild palette is just
like Night Fever that deepest olive
grain down there in the
and if you want to get this shade called
moonstone it's sort of a greenish yellow
guess what mix some of these shades I
find that I can get that color when I
combine this light green and the brown I
get this kind of muddy mossy green
called moonstone that's in this pail
amazing how similar things are when you
really start comparing the tart called
with the wild palette
okay this was kind of a limited-edition
thing that came out a while back I have
a blog review on this sub Aleve but here
you're getting some neutrals some kind
of bronzy Browns over here some Navy
shades and I was blown away when I took
a closer look at my little elf eye
enhancing eyeshadows to find that the
color selection given in this was so
much the same as what's in here and this
is called brown eyes one and here you
are getting that intense matte blue I
mean just kind of a random color for
both of these to really match up on
you've also got kind of bronzy brown
that's similar a deep Mavi kind of
burgundy shade similar here to this one
over you know that the price comparison
of you know a Tarte palette to an elf
palette is going to be a pretty extreme
so I was happy to find that my goodness
I'm out of breath I thought I said I was
gonna go through that quickly but that
seemed like it took a really long time
but I hope you liked the dupes and these
are fun videos for me to do I'm sure
I'll have another one coming out before
too long but it's just really fun to to
find those low-cost alternatives to some
great high-end products that are out
there so don't forget to check out
Melissa's video I'm sure she's got some
great dupes to share with you as well
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
