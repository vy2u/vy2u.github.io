far as how I do my eye makeup and so I
thought it would just kind of walk you
through it on what I would do on an
average today um enjoying the way I do
if I'm going to work or if I want to
just you know put some effort into it
this is what I would do so I may make a
tutorial like really really step by step
but I thought for now I'll just kind of
walk you through what some of the
products are since my eyes are already
done today and you can kind of just look
at from there and it's really not that
hard so the first thing I do and I do my
whole face first and then I take an eye
primer
this one is a Mary Kay signature eye
primer and it's a really really smooth
formula I know some people like the
urban decay primer which is fine
I've never tried that actually like to
try it sometime but this is just what
I'm using up right now I put that all
over the my whole eyelid and then I
smooth on a light champagne
cream-colored eyeshadow on my entire lid
and a couple options that you have for
that
Smashbox I don't know exactly smashing
cocktail hour is this trio and I use
this creamy creamy white colored shade
here and another option is the covergirl
in champagne it's the single eye shadow
in champagne and put that all over your
eyelid and because it helps the other
colors blend into it and it just gives
you a nice smooth bright kind of light
color there on the lid and I use one of
my mary kay brushes there's a lot of
brushes similar to this just your basic
eyeshadow brush for that okay so once
you've gotten that put all over your
eyelid then I take a much darker shadow
by contrast I use makeup forever diamond
shadow and it's in this I don't know if
the camera will really pick this up but
this is a kind of sparkly black shade
and so I use a
little sponge tip applicator for that
and I put it right in the corner right
here so I get a little bit of that in
there and get it really close to the
lash line and probably I would say that
you put it on the outer third of my
eyelid and so that kind of gives you
that story really um kind of makes your
eyes appear a lot bigger when you when
you work that into the outer corners and
then the next step I would do is to take
some deep rich dark
I mean you could use a smoky gray color
but what's been working for me lately is
a really deep plum and a dark brown and
that's also a lot of another different
Smashbox kit called smoky eyes that
comes out of their expertise kit and I
use a like a typical blending brushes
it's also from the Mary Kay group and I
pretty much - the purple shade all
within the crease and I work the brown
up just a little bit further out on the
side okay so what that does is that
really then enlarges glow your eyes look
and and then if I want some more
intensity I will go back with a very
small contour brush and I will take my
black shadow and put it you know like
right in here and just kind of add a
little bit more and it's very buildable
so that's what I do basically for shadow
then to finish it off this is what I
have used for years it's the covergirl
it's eye enhancers in golden sunset and
I use this middle shade which is like a
coppery a sort of a coppery color and I
use my eye shadow brush and I put that
on all the way up to my eyebrow and it
just warms it all up it's thought I mean
it's pretty transparent but it does warm
up
your whole eye and it's amazing what
that does to not go with like stark
white up there but to actually use sort
of a warm shade it really helps so
there's the shadow now for eyeliner
first step I use a liquid liner on top
this is color stay in black I've like
blackest black and I run that all the
way from the air corner of my eye to the
outside sometimes you can stretch it up
and wing it a little bit but this is
just all the way across pretty much
basic how I would do it and you know it
takes a little practice with this kind
but yo you'll get a steady in a pan and
it'll work for you and then on the
bottom I use Colorstay again I use the
pencil this time on the bottom I go all
the way around here I do not typically
line my waterline I have at times but
it's just not traditionally something I
do every day I think it makes my eyes
seem a little closed in and this makes
it what could just make them look a
little bigger if I just line them like
usual right underneath okay so after
that I curl my eyelashes and I use my
ELF eyelash curler which I love I think
it's great not costing you a dollar and
then I used I have a lot of different
mascaras that mess around with right now
but I'm going to show you two of the
best that I believe in they're not
expensive at all and I've tried some
really high-end mascaras but I still
stick with these covergirl fantastic
lash is very volumizing very lengthening
and multiple coats does not I mean it
can do multiple coats with no problem
some mascaras leave you with summer-like
funky looking ends because they can't it
can't build on itself very well this can
it's really a great great thing and if
you haven't tried it it's like probably
under five bucks to try that out another
really really good one is hip high
intensity pigments the L'Oreal brand
mascara they just have like one kind of
Scarah and it's got a little bit bigger
brush but it is really really
lengthening also I mean it this you can
do two or two or three coats with this
and you know it builds on itself very
well but like I said I'm kind of working
with a line mascara I feel like I have
to try mascara for a while before I can
actually get a really good understanding
of how well it works on me because
sometimes you know mascaras aren't the
greatest as soon as you use them because
there's so much formula in there but
then once you keep using it it gets a
little better so anyway um just in
review basically what I do is our no
average day for my eye makeup I put a
base on I use a light shadow all across
the lid I use a very very dark shadow
like black shadow in the corner I use a
deep plum or deep brown to create that
smoky look in the crease and out in that
outer V sort of shape and then I use a
liquid liner on top a pencil line on the
bottom both black and a really good
mascara and also that a good trick is
using sort of a warm coppery shade up
here not you know a dark shade that'll
don't you know make your skin look kind
of muddy but like a real fresh sheer
coppery shade up top here really warms
up the entire face so if you have any
questions please let me know thanks for
