today so I want to show you a look
that's pretty easy to do it's kind of
sorry maybe show you the wrong either
it's a very neutral look that can go
with just about anything you are wearing
or you know it's just good for any
occasion I think and it's using this
Revlon Colorstay eye palette in nude
elements and just to run you through the
shades real quick the top one is like a
kind of shimmery ivory shade then we've
got kind of a deeper champagne color a
medium brown and then this bottom shade
it looks pretty dark here but it's
actually kind of like a I would call it
like a charcoal Navy shade so the first
thing I'm going to do is apply sorry my
NYX jumbo eye shadow pencil and iced
mocha it's kind of a golden brown shade
and I'm just gonna apply this all over
my eyelid and after you apply something
like this you know I'm kind of getting
it just a little bit up into the crease
but after you apply like a pencil or
cream if you're not applying it with a
brush it's a good idea to just kind of
go over it with your finger and just
kind of Pat it in and it just takes away
any excess moisture because while you do
want a little bit of tackiness there to
hang onto the shadow you don't want it
to be greasy or anything like that
that's what really lends to the creasing
that a lot of people complain about when
they use creams so you really just have
to try to get the effect you want it's a
fine line but remove as much moisture as
you can so first I'm going to take my
eye shadow brush and this happens to be
from ELF by the way and I'm gonna take
actually the second shade there it's
kind of like a deep champagne color and
I'm just going to apply this all over my
eyelid
I'm really trying to stay in the in the
shot here just apply that all over the
top and I'm gonna kind of want to just
totally overlap the creme that I just
put on okay so that was fairly easy and
then we're going to take the top shade
here the really light color and just dip
the tip of your brush into that because
we're just going to apply this right in
the corner thank you this is a good look
if you're kind of it's kind of a good
daytime look because if you're doing
this in the morning having these light
shades right around the inner corner as
you can see we're just taking it right
around the tear duct area here it's a
very good strategy for making the eyes
look more wide awake
okay so there's where we're at right now
and next we're going to move on to this
medium brown color and I'm going to take
my larger crease brush I'm just going to
dip it into that brown shade and we're
just going to kind of do a wash of color
just up you know get it hitting in the
crease but kind of going up making this
this little halo of deeper color right
around the eye here
and just blend it out you'll find these
colors are kind of shimmery so you're
not getting a real like deep smoky look
even though you're doing maybe like the
similar layout on your eye to what you
would do for a smoky eye and you can
really just you know when there's not
too much color left on your brush just
take it up blend it kind of according to
the shape of your eyebrow I would say
and just make sure that's all blended
out and that's kind of the basis for our
crease shade but we are gonna try to use
this Navy color here so I'm gonna use a
smaller crease brush this is from the
essence of beauty line at CVS and just
get a little bit of that deeper shade on
your brush and really just concentrate
here on the outer corner of the eye
outer outer part of the lid and then
start working it into the crease okay so
you can kind of see how we're creating a
little more depth there you can use the
more use of the shade the more this look
goes from day to night in my opinion so
I'm going to use a little bit more you
step into that crease okay and there
your eye shadow part is basically a
finished isn't it's really easy um
actually I forgot I want to do a
highlight I'm just gonna use that same
shade that I put all over the lid the
second shade down and this makes a good
highlight shade I mean you could use
that white color but this is just a
little less stark I think and just apply
that all over and there's your shadow so
now we're going to move on to liner and
the liner I'm getting used today on my
top lash line is the elf waterproof
liquid eyeliner in black and this is
pretty long wearing it doesn't irritate
my eye line put it on
couple of different liquid liners that
aren't exactly very friendly for me
anyway and it's the sally-girl liquid
liners and the there's one of their kind
that I try I think it's her Jane that
just didn't didn't feel good as soon as
they went on so basically what I'm going
to do here is look down I look into a
little mirror this is actually my
philosophy supernatural that comes with
this little mirror and I'm just going to
look down into it and start at the
inside I start at the very inner corner
and I just kind of overlap every stroke
that I do so I did that stroke I'm gonna
go right on top of that and I'm gonna
widen it out as I near the outer corner
and by that point I usually need to get
back into the liner and for this we're
gonna do a little bit of a winged out
look so you want to widen it as you go
to the edge and a lot of this varies you
know we all have different shape eyes so
be aware that not everybody's winged
liner will or should look the same and
just keep an eye on what you did on your
other eye because symmetry is very
important here and you can see what I
did I kind of drew it out from where I
why did I drew it straight out and then
I went from the very very corner and
connected and so you can see we've got
this little outline basically of what
we're going for here you see that
finished product outline okay and now
I'm gonna go in for some more liner and
we're just gonna fill that in so we're
just making a little connection you know
we are kind of altering the shape of the
eye
we went from because our eyes go like
this kind of on top you know it's like a
half I should draw a little diagram but
you get what I'm saying it's not like
our eye goes like this when it goes out
it goes like this
so basically we're taking the the center
of our eye the
my point of that roundness there and we
are just taking it straight out from
there and so now I'm just gonna fill
that in that little area we created here
and there we are there's our little
little point there with our liner okay
so next I got to wrap this up kind of
quickly here I'm going to take my
perfect point liner from covergirl and
midnight blue we're going to take this
in a line all the way underneath enter
the outer corner you'll find when you
overlap that frosty white shade the blue
shows up a little more okay and then
we're going to apply on top of that that
charcoal kind of Navy shade of the
Revlon palette here so just go over all
of that and then to better blend with
the black take a black shadow I'm using
my make up forevers shadow it's kind of
a sparkly black shade sorry don't
remember the name and just use that in
the corner to kind of blend in there and
next we're going to curl our lashes
which I would hold for in reality about
15 seconds and then I'm going to pull up
my a coat of volume exact mascara I
actually like this better than the lash
blast
sorry lash blast fans but I'll probably
go back and do two coats of that but
that's the look thanks for watching me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
