show you all how you can do an entire i
look using only one eye shadow brush I
know we all watch the tutorials and mine
included and it's like oh you got to get
out this brush now and do this and then
get this brush and do this and I have
found a brush that I think is so
multi-purpose that you could really use
this to do just about everything you
need it to do on your eye and it is the
sea 150 angle fluff brush from Coastal
Scents alright this is about the size of
it see how it um is about the width of
your eyelid but its angle then that has
some special functions for us so I'm
just going to show you more than
anything just how you can use this brush
to get a full I look going on and I'm
going to be using my amused pearl
eyeshadow palette and it's going to be
kind of using the blue shades that are
here so i just thought i would i would
use that this is something new that i
have and just show you a way to use
those colors and also use the brush so
just in case you're wondering on my face
right now i have on cg smoothers tinted
moisturizer in light to medium and then
everything else on my face is bare
minerals bare minerals foundation botan
bisque is my concealer
soft focus cui as my blush and bear
radiance as my kind of like finishing
powder and on my lips I have on NYX
round lipstick and harmonica it's a
really light pink and then I deepened it
up a little bit with the l'oreal colour
reef lip gloss in soft one so let's get
started I'm going to put as sort of a
base I'm going to use my NYC eye shadow
wand in glass slipper and just going to
put this all over my lid just to give um
the eye shadow a little something to
hold on to this shadow this needs this
amuse um palette is really good I really
like it I've done a few things just like
practicing with it and it's number two
it's been used pearl eyeshadow palette
so it's got two four six one two three
four five six
got 12 colors in it so it's really a fun
play with so first I'm going to take
this is going to be the brush I'm using
again the entire time it's the Coastal
Scents ankle fluff brush you can get it
off of Coastal Scents calm and I'm going
to first uh oops awesome I applicators
then I'm going to first dip it into the
light blue shade and I'm just going to
put that all over my lid and as you can
see I'm just kind of using this i'm
using the angle tip of it when I need to
get more in towards the corner of my eye
but then for the rest of my eyelid I can
just use the full length of the brush
just to get that light blue shade all
over and then I'm going to take the a
deeper blue here in the center of the
palette get into that and then I'm going
to put the tip the smaller tip of the of
the angle brush this this tip right here
I'm going to put that in my crease and
just do sort of a windshield wiper
stroke back and forth from the corner of
my eye to about three quarters the
weigh-in on my eye ok so now you've got
your color in your crease just like that
a darker color and then I med I'm going
to actually use this green shade here on
the end it's a light curly green just
dip into that and I'm just going to kind
of expand on what I just did and go out
just a little bit one layer further and
again I'm using the same brush for all
of this ok so now you got the base
amount of your color on there but you
want something a little bit deeper in
your corner and for that I'm going to
use this charcoal color this this one
right here so I'm going to use the tip
okay see the angle right here I'm just
going to take that tip dip it into the
shadow so the tip is all the only part
of the brush that has shadow on it and I
can easily get right into the outer
corner of my eye with this
and I can work that up into the crease
just slightly but suddenly I you know
have transformed this blood into you
know like my mini crease brush that I
usually use for a step like this
and then you can blend it out using the
entire brush so there's your shadow look
right there it you've gotten shadow
everywhere you need it using every
normal part of it I mean I haven't oh
I'm also going to use it as a highlight
I'm going to use this kind of golden a
champagne shade at the end just get it
all over the entire part of the brush
and just use it as a highlighter shade
right under my brow bone not so much of
a highlight is just kind of continuing
with the pearly effect their but isn't
that neat how you can use one brush and
use every function for it so just to
finish off the look I'm going to use my
Jordana evening liner in the color is
sterling blue and I'm just going to go
ahead and get a little closer to my
mirror here and line my upper lash line
with it all the way to the inside would
be in your corner
and on out
staying very close to the lash line and
then I'm going to just go around the
lower lash line as well with this color
alright and I think we've got that now
we got our that we got our line around
there and again this isn't like a navy
blue liner that i'm using it's like a
true blue blue color and there's one
more use for this brush I'm going to use
just the tip dip it into the white
crocheted that's right here just use the
variant the angled tip and I'm going to
just go around my tear duct area here
just to kind of brighten that up and
bring some light to that area okay
alright and then I'm going to the last
step that I always use curl my eyelashes
for 15 seconds see how quickly we did
this I mean we whipped out a look with
color in the crease on the lids at the
highlighter oops got something food and
we did it all with one brush so it
really goes to show you that if you've
got a the proper brush a good brush like
that like the angle fluff brush from
Coastal Scents you can pull off anything
you need to do with your look so I'm
just applying this is a maybelline's
define a lash volume and i usually do
two to three coats on this because it is
um I always do I always blink and get it
underneath but this is a decent mascara
because it doesn't clump but at the same
time it's not as much volume really as
you can get with some other times but i
like to try a new think so
so there's soap number two but just to
give you a closer look at what I've done
here um you know this isn't so much
about the light blue shadow that I've
done here but it's more so just about
the fact that I've taken one brush to do
at all it's the Coastal Scents ankle
fluff brush it's really easy to use you
can get on ww Coastal Scents calm and
you can pull off just about any look you
would want with it not that you don't
need other brushes but I really think if
you're trying to streamline the brushes
that you have having an angle brush like
that is really good thing so thank you
