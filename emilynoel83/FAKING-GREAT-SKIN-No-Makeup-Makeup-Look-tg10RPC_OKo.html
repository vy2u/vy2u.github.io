makeup makeup look and I always feel
silly about that concept because I think
you know okay it's no makeup makeup but
here I am sitting here showing you 12 to
15 steps on how to pull it all together
and it just seems crazy but that is I
think the best description that I can
give you for the look that we're coming
out with here and it's something that's
really all about the skin looking really
fresh and perfected and not a lot else
she's kind of going with what God gave
us here and making it as pretty as
possible and I was traveling over this
past weekend I was back at my parents
house and there were several days where
I did this kind of a look primarily with
the skin products and I would catch a
glance at myself in a mirror maybe and I
remember thinking wow maybe less is more
did I just say that but it's truly one
of those looks in a practical sense that
does not take a lot of time to pull
together it doesn't take a lot of
careful strategy but I think it looks
super fresh so here is what I did to get
this look good morning guys you're the
first ones I'm talking to today so get
the raspy out with you all I am going to
be using a little combo of products
today for the all-over base on my skin
and it's the it cosmetics CC cream and
also a little bit of the illumination
version let's say you have the regular
and you don't have the illumination you
could maybe mix in like a little bit
maybe not a total half-and-half split
but a little bit of a liquid highlight
would probably give you a very similar
effect I just have both of these I like
both of these so I'm trying to work them
in so I'm going to do almost a whole
pump of the regular and then an equal
amount of the illumination I have both
of these in the shade medium by the way
and I'm just kind of blending those
around here and then I'm going to patch
these all over my skin and I'll blend it
out more fully with a brush
and I love how those products go on
basically feeling like moisturizers you
know I had just a little light
moisturizer on underneath but when you
blend them out then you really start to
see oh they cover too and I just like
the effect of having that little bit of
the illumination I mean I'll wear the
illumination version on its own I've
done that in a video not too long ago
but it's just kind of fun to see how you
can switch it up and if we're kind of
going for no makeup makeup I think just
having that slight bit of glow by the
way I've got like a sheet mark on my
forehead just ignore that but just for
the subtle glow for the maybe I'm not
even wearing anything on my skin type
look I think it's nice to kind of sneak
in the illumination version so I've got
that base that's looking really nice and
natural right now and I'm going to pull
in a concealer that's really going to
work it's going to cover everything I
need to cover but as it wears throughout
the day it's not going to have an
obvious makeup look and that is the tarp
shape tape definitely my favorite
concealer of the moment it's in light to
me I've got a kind of oversized doe foot
applicator here and it doesn't take a
lot of this product but I always try to
get the most right on that inner part
there on the sides of my nose you may or
may not have the most discoloration
right there but I also take it around
the sides of my nose a little bit on top
because sometimes some redness develops
there and just like so and then this is
just my little brush that came with that
random little Mally eyeshadow palette
and I was like you know it's too big for
eyeshadow for me but it works just
swimmingly for concealer
concealer step is done full coverage and
fabulous but not looking like makeup and
it could be my rename channel full
coverage and fabulous I'm going to take
my Too Faced primed and poreless powder
which I just mentioned in my powders
that don't look like powder video this
is a translucent kind of
one-size-fits-all powder here that you
know it doesn't have a ton of color that
translates onto the skin you're not
going to apply this and look white but
yet it really does mattify perfect
smooth and not look like powdery
particles on your skin I absolutely love
it on the under eye with the elf small
tapered brush so I'm just going to pick
up a little bit of product there and
just dab this as some under eye setting
powder
and then the only other spot that I'm
going to really apply powder or need
powder on my face today is right around
the t-zone so I will take this on the
nose around the mouth and chin and a
little bit right up here across my
forehead next up I am going to use my
ELF contouring blush and bronzer duo
remember when they first only came out
with one shade this is that one I think
it's called Saint Lucia and it's got
that kind of peachy a little bit
shimmery golden peach type of blush and
then the bronzer over here so I'm going
to do a little contouring with this
first and I'm going to pick up some of
that product with my Sigma small contour
brush I like this product because I feel
like it's deep enough to do its job but
it's not so dark that it's a struggle to
work with or you know it looks unnatural
it really just looks like these shadows
could naturally occur on my skin
then for just a little more color
overall on the skin I'm going to use
that same shade but with the elf
complexion brush and just pick up some
of that shade really lightly using a
larger brush will make it a little more
foolproof and this is just a really easy
way to give your whole skin tone a boost
just liven up everything but it's not
really going to look makeup II you know
once you're done so just keep it light
it's kind of hit the tops of the nose
the cheeks just that natural sunkissed
type look I am going to use this for a
soft crease contour on my eye area so
I'm using my Sigma e25 brush dipping
into that color a little bit and yeah
we're just going to utilize this shade
as eyeshadow it's really that crease
shade that I think a lot of people tend
to want to reach for that nice soft
brown just a little natural shadow and
just to make sure it's really not
standing out and looking like a big
eyeshadow look is happening here I'm
really blending over that as well
for the brows I need a little fill in in
some places I'm using my L'Oreal brow
stylist definer in the shade brunette so
one of those really really fine pencils
get that in the spots where I needed I
spill I spill in I fill in a little bit
in the front of the brow excuse you and
then I just lightly go over the rest and
hit any areas where it's looking a
little uneven the thing about this
pencil and the thing about application
of a brow product that I don't think a
lot of people talk about is the amount
of pressure applied I'm really I feel
like I'm holding the pencil very lightly
I'm not really gripping it super tight
and the amount of pressure applied to
the skin is super light for me and I
think that keeps it looking natural and
not looking like oh you just drew
something on with a pencil you know
and then I think a little clear brow gel
on top even if you don't normally use it
I do think this is an important thing I
normally only think about the hold that
it gives but it does actually give a
little natural shine back to the hairs
that sometimes gets taken away when
you're putting pencil all over so this
is just a clear one from wet and wild
use whatever you have and can find
I love the NYX control freak by the way
and but just going over them seems to
give a little more life back to that
hair and then going back to the eyes
what I want is just a subtle sheen
across the lids that almost it doesn't
look makeup II but it just looks like
dewy a little bit and I need it to have
good staying power because I'm not going
to be setting it with anything so I
think the right product for this job is
going to be the Maybelline Color tattoo
concentrated crayon in bronze truffle
when I did this overall look a few times
while I was traveling I either really
did up my eyes or I only curled my
lashes and put on mascara so I hadn't
really done this like little
middle-of-the-road barely-there eye with
it but I'm just going to lightly get a
little bit of this across the lid yeah
it's a subtle shine you could go with
something lighter or more champagne E
but I think it might look even more
makeup E perhaps I'm taking it a little
bit around that inner corner to pick up
a little light there and then you could
blend it with your finger or this Real
Techniques shading brush I tell you it's
a godsend for creme shadow dabbing over
cream shadow with that it seems to pick
up excess and anytime I work that dang
brush in like I swear the cream shadow
wears better for me because I've just
eliminated some excess
then I'm going to line my waterline I'm
using the Rimmel scandaleyes and nude
just sweep that in there for that
wide-awake look nobody can put their
finger on that for you guys oh and I
forgot to do the blush I'm going to go
ahead and jump back in and do that I
meant to do it right after I contoured
the crease there on my eye but I am
using the blush that comes in here it's
likely glowy
don't get too much on the brush
I personally am choosing to skip the
eyeliner I'm going straight to curling
lashes and I'm going to apply covergirl
super sizer I'm going to go ahead and
use that on top and bottom I have
realized it really does last pretty well
on the bottom lashes for me anyway
and by the end I wasn't sure if I'd want
this or not but I think I do it's my
Knicks bright idea stick the Chardonnay
shimmer shade just a super natural or
just glowy shade I pick up a little on
my ELF small stipple brush it really
seems to catch the light nicely and then
work whatever else is on your brush kind
of upward then I'm going to do kind of a
natural color but has a lot of shine in
it type lip color the flower beauty
hydra silk in the shade rose petal
I didn't bring a ton of lip products
with me when I was traveling so this one
I ended up reaching for a lot when the
rest of my face was just kind of light
and natural because I just thought it
fit and I'm going to finish the look
with a couple myths of my hard candy
sheer envy hydrating primer mist
I for one am very happy with this I see
myself with this look and I think the
skin just looks really fresh it's
achieving that look that's in my
imagination of what really good perfect
skin would look like you know it would
be totally even and it would have this
globe that seemed like it was just
coming from within and not placed there
so I love it I hope you guys enjoyed
this look too I think you could
certainly use it for a lot of different
occasions as always feel free to
incorporate the products you already
have there are a lot of things that
aren't exactly what I use but they can
perform similar functions for you so
keep that in mind and thank you so so
much for watching I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
