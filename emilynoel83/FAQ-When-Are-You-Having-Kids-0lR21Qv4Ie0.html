this video I thought would be just kind
of a fun opportunity to focus on
something non makeup related and talk
about some of those random questions
that I get asked from time to time and
paying attention to some different
questions on Twitter and Facebook
YouTube Instagram and this question
comes from oh pretty much all of those
places and the question is when are you
going to have kids so I thought since
this one was one of the most common
questions that's where we started
definitely something Tyler and I have
thought about a lot but our life has
been very jam-packed I guess you might
say ever since we got married he spent
three years in law school right after we
got married and then around that time I
go into my news job with like crazy get
up in the middle of the night kind of
hours for the Morning News and
overlapping with that was YouTube and
just this past year has actually been my
first year away from the news entirely
and working for myself being my own boss
so to speak and so that's been a whole
adjustment in itself so things are just
really been rolling along and on the top
of go kids it's definitely something
that comes up a lot something that we
know we want in our future but I think
for us you know it's just a matter of
when sometimes people can't encourage
you to go down that path but maybe it's
the stubborn person in me but I always
want to feel like that was a decision by
me and Tyler not something that someone
like convinced or persuaded us to do you
know what I mean anyway that's probably
a longer answer than what you wanted but
I think I just heard Tyler come in he
just got home from work so I hey Bob
what do you wanna have kids I don't know
how about September that's coming right
up
how about the 17th that's a very
specific come on at some point
it's out it's finally out of the bag we
can tell people everybody your face is
so red we found this out in January you
have no idea how hard this has been for
me to keep this a secret I mean he knows
how hard this has been
I know I mean I've been one to just
shout it out like we're having a baby
things we've had to do where it's like
you know it would have been really easy
to talk about it things people have said
to each of us that could have led it
right out of our mouths but they do say
like they I mean the bump calm the
authority I would baby you're supposed
to like you know keep it kind of under
wraps until you get through the birth
trimester and so it was kind of a magic
number and and we just hit 13 baby is
the size of a beach I can't believe it I
don't have like a lot of um going on
right now I mean I think I can sense a
small bump but I'll keep you updated on
that in the future probably do some
pictures or something and we'll do like
some vlogs and stuff periodically on the
vlog channel its beauty vlog cast but
things have been going fairly well so
far like symptoms but they say that's
totally normal
I've been going through this pretty
smoothly so far I mean I'm really glad
to get to say that I haven't skipped a
beat really video wise as far as like
all the Express videos and going up the
daily stuff and I will keep coming at
you but I've been more tired than usual
I've been like falling asleep on the
couch at like 8 o'clock at night and
just throughout the day feeling more
lethargic I guess but I'm still I'm just
so excited you know so far away though
it's still like there's still like 6
months
I know that seems like a really long
ways away right
I'm pretty much ready for it to happen
what's good dance movement it's not like
baby coming out of the womb
know how fast it comes up I'm gonna be
catching I've been informed that I'm
going to be catching the child to our
doctor and the wonderful people at our
doctor's office that we visit a lot of
them watch my videos I know their
problems from this right now
thanks guys all that stuff I was talking
about about being ready and thinking
about it and stuff we honestly have
thought about it you know yeah on and
off over time and but I really do feel
like we got to a point where we're like
yeah both of us Tyler is the best you
guys and he he knows so intimately like
what I've been doing in this past year
my first year adjusting to a really
different way of life where work is
concerned for me and he's just been so
darn supportive and I feel like we've
totally been in it together and I love
you so much and you I mean I love you
he's the best you guys and I'm gonna cry
because I before we ever found out she
just randomly one day we're at just at
Fazoli's and she was telling me
something that was stressing her out and
she started almost started crying in
fazil that never happens and I was like
okay something's going on there and then
on Valentine's Day we watched that
spider oh my god and if you guys have
seen Cider House Rules that's the movie
where what's Tobey Maguire's in it and
he's visiting this orphanage it's set
back in the 40s he's on me like
orphanage deck with this little kid and
a couple had just gone in and basically
passed him up as a kid that they were
thinking about adopting and the kid goes
why doesn't anyone want me and I am just
cries she wept
i wailed like it was hard drive you know
what's really fun is you look back on
like the Instagram pictures I've posted
over the past few months and then I'm
thinking like you know I had this secret
and nobody knew or example and I'm like
- I met all the way in LA I was pregnant
then yeah and when we did all those
Emily awards videos that was a lot of
work and I was pregnant and how about
that one picture where a bunch of people
asked me if I lost weight suckers
pregnant go figure I was pregnant then
when you were craving those fruity
pebbles all man and that guy would
cupcake and I had to hide in the closet
fearing for our lives because there was
a tornado warning I thought the house
was gonna blow away pregnant also you
should probably know that my super
romantic Valentine's Day gift was a
pregnancy pillow which Tyler enjoys as
well I deserved a picture I sleep on
that on occasion we just having a baby
that's what's up here's the soon-to-be
big sister she had to go to the vet
today so she's a bit cross with Mama
okay with me I had nothing to do with it
but we'll see you guys later thank you
for watching we love you guys and we'll
talk to you again soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
