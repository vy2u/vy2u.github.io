tuning in for this video I've really
been looking forward to doing this ever
since I did my full tutorial on my TV
news makeup routine in case you don't
know I do anchor for a morning broadcast
at our local ABC affiliate and so I went
through step by step exactly how I do my
makeup for an average day at work for
the news and it really prompted a lot of
questions not just makeup related but
really about the TV news industry as a
whole and so I thought a lot of these
questions would really you know if I
answered one of them yeah you know for
one person and then I'd see another
question be like oh I should have told
them about that so I'm just gonna like
do a whole video basically with your
questions so it's kind of like you guys
are interviewing me for a change
but anyway at this first question that
came about a lot was there's no makeup
artist on set a lot of people seem to be
really baffled by that and I'll admit
you know I thought basically anybody I
saw on TV somebody you know a
professional did their makeup but that's
really not the case at a lot of local
stations and I can't speak for all of
them there's gonna be some where you
know some random small station where my
makeup artist is there and doing that
kind of thing but a lot of small TV
affiliates chances are it's the anchor
that's doing that for themselves or the
reporter that's doing it themselves you
know you look at the larger markets the
larger affiliates the actual networks
you know ABC NBC CNN all those those
those places I'm sure have makeup
artists but yeah it's just gonna vary
from the size of the place that you're
at and it is something that anybody who
is on TV does need to become decently
well-versed on how to use makeup and how
to use it in that special way you know
not just the everyday way but how am I
gonna look under bright lights and and
whatnot which I of course went into in
my other video so I'm not going to talk
about that too much at length but know
my station does not have a makeup artist
what else here Oh lots of questions
about education and what kind of
education do you need to become a
reporter
or an anchor I want to make a couple
statements here just sort of blanket
statements for anyone who is interested
first off no matter what age you are if
you're watching this and you're in
junior high okay
watch a lot of news watch your local
news watch national news I mean I
watched The Weather Channel all the time
I was really into weather - as a little
kid and even if you don't necessarily
think it's good even watch you know a
station that you don't think does a very
good job because you learn not only from
the people that you watch that do good
things but you also learn for people who
are not necessarily doing things as well
as you'd like you know you're watching
it the interaction between two anchors
why was that not smooth or why did that
not work right or why does this person
seem more pleasant to watch than this
person you know you kind of you start
asking yourself these yourself these
questions as a viewer and then you start
to realize what people want and then
once you get into that career you start
to have a feel for it you know you got
to be able to relate to the viewer and I
think it really helps to be a viewer
first if that makes any sense so yeah
definitely just start watching the news
and that's not only going to help you
learn about the performance aspect of it
but it's going to just help you learn
about the topics that you often see in
the news a lot of people think about
that news is just only about crime or
big court cases or this and that
well local news there's a lot of really
local stories you're gonna be seeing you
know stuff about city council meetings
and the ordinance about keeping your
lawn mowed
you know - this high all the time so you
know like random little stories like
that are gonna come up all the time and
you're not gonna think about those
before you get into it unless you're a
big news watcher and then you're gonna
realize you've got some of that stuff
coming so anyway totally you know watch
the news get some examples and that's
really gonna help you get a feel for
what is out there what sorts of things
you need to start learning about and
read the newspaper a lot - and read you
know go to news sites online reading
that
just going you're just gonna get
yourself better informed and more
well-rounded and going into you know
high school and college it's really all
about being well-rounded I would say you
know you just need to worry about
communications classes and you know
speech classes and that's it but that's
totally not because you go in as a
reporter and you're gonna be granted
there's a lot you're going to learn on
the job and there's a lot that you can
only learn on the job but you're going
to be bombarded with all kinds of topics
you may be you know get in a position
where you need to do a lot of health
stories or a lot of crime stories or
court stories or you know human interest
stories things like that and it's going
to be a really really broad field
sometimes that you have to work in and
so be aware that any of those random
little classes that you take and you
might not think you may be thinking how
is it relevant it really will
chances are it could be relevant if you
become a news reporter or a news anchor
it's so helpful to have a little
knowledge about a lot of things so and
but yeah definitely in terms of a major
or something you're going to concentrate
and look for those media related classes
communication take all the speech you
can take took classes like advanced
public speaking and I think I had
something called small group
communication then I had a lot of like
broadcast related things to that I did I
did stuff with Web Design which was
really useful too so just take as much
as you can't and riding riding is so
important it really helps if you've got
a love for riding but even if you don't
this is a it kind of helps to get a
little bit of you know knowledge about
that a lot actually so I mean journalism
classes things like that it's all going
to be very valuable but just remember to
you know spread your net wide and look
at a lot of classes lots of different
classes in high school and lots in
college so it's all going to benefit you
has this always been your career choice
I kind of thought you know when I was a
really good
kid I was fascinated by the news but I
think it seems so huge at the time like
when I was in like second or third grade
the news anchors that I watched I mean I
just thought they were just way up here
that's like you know it just seemed like
kind of one of those impossible things
when you're a little kid there they are
these celebrities you know you guys
probably remember that from watching the
news when you're a little too and then
as you grow up you're kinda like oh okay
I can kind of maybe see that but now I
had always I have so many interests I
mean I thought teaching would be fun and
I still kind of think teaching would be
cool just my goodness there were so many
things that have been interested me over
time of whether was interesting to me as
well not just the news time but the
weather side but eventually it all just
kind of funneled into you know doing the
news and I just thought you know I like
writing I like being creative and one
ever since I did an internship which is
a big part of the education aspect that
I forgot to mention but when you get in
college if you can intern at a real TV
station not just your campus one but get
out of the college scene for you know
over the course of the summer and take a
summer internship at one of your local
stations then you're gonna really get a
grip on what its gonna be like when
you're working there and I loved my
internship and I really got to do a lot
with it I was basically reporting just
like the other reporters and it was
awesome such a great time but that kind
of solidified my choice for me you know
for a career after I did that
um do you wear your own clothes why not
yeah I it's all my own wardrobe like it
kind of goes along with the whole makeup
artist thing you know small stations
you're not gonna have you probably of
any sort of wardrobe there for you I
mean it's I suppose again there's always
exceptions to that but at my station
yeah I'm wearing my own clothes every
day that I go to work so do people
recognize you like in public yes
sometimes it's funny I mean it'll be
rare that you I can never predict when
somebody's gonna come up and be like
you're on the news aren't you you know
and
sometimes you know people just kind of
look at me like I'm familiar they'll be
like you look familiar and then like oh
yeah so yeah it happens from time to
time I mean I I'm always surprised at
the different kinds of you know people
sometimes they'll be so it they'll be
like you look like my granddaughter or
something like that and so it's really
fun you know if you do watch you know
channel 3 or that's the station I'm
honor I mean if you recognize me from
here you know talk to me I'd be happy to
talk to you so you don't have to feel
weird about coming up to me but it is it
is fun and and I still don't get used to
just being recognized in public but it
does happen what else what else I love
this question what happens when you mess
up like when you're live on the air my
goodness and if it happens I tell you
what you know you're gonna be reading
along and you're gonna have a little
goof up and sometimes and you know when
it's appropriate I think it's good to
just you know not necessarily laugh it
off if you do something that is
definitely out and out funny and you
just keep trying to cover it up people
can see through that okay they're
laughing at you at home you might as
well just laugh at yourself you know you
got to kind of learn to laugh at
yourself in some situations other
situations laughter is totally
inappropriate you just need to move on
and pretend like it didn't happen and
there are a lot of times when you can
pretend like you didn't mess up and
nobody will ever know but like I said if
there's something obvious and it is
humorous I mean don't just sit there and
try to like stifle your you know just
just let it go that's part of me being
on a morning newscast that can be get
away with being a little more laid back
and fun but anyway yeah you mess up you
just gotta move on though you got to get
past it eventually because I tell you
you can get in that laugh attack mode
where you just want to laugh and you've
got to get through it you know I mean
sometimes we'll come back from a
commercial break and we'll have laughed
about something and it's just like okay
I've got a straight face now so I don't
know it's just it my baby it comes with
practice I
but I've seen people get caught off
guard of all agents have started
laughing and for you know no apparent
reason that we know of as viewers but
yeah it happens you just got to keep on
moving though um what else how do you
handle your weird schedule
um yeah like I said I do a morning
newscast I go to bed you know in the mid
evening and I wake up in the middle of
the day it seems like I wake up at like
yeah between 1:30 and 2:00 in the
morning and really I mean it's just a
matter of how bad you want to do the
work that you're doing
I do you enjoy your work enough to be on
a weird schedule and for me I do I
really like what I do I love being you
know the face that people wake up to in
the morning and to get their day going
and to you know make it not seem so bad
that ok hi it's 5:30 in the morning you
know to maybe put a smile on someone's
face I really really like that and I
just I love doing the news interacting
with the people I work with and it's
just really fun and so I guess how do I
handle it I basically just like what I
do so and also you know I've got people
that are accommodating to my schedule
and you know Tyler doesn't make me
that's my husband um he doesn't make me
feel like bad about being on a little
bit different schedule and he's on or
whatever you know I I think everybody
realizes you know this is what this is
what I want to do and it's working for
me so um yeah you just kind of have to
make yourself adjust and you you do look
forward to the weekend though because
then that's when I can kind of get back
to a normal person schedule but then
come Sunday night I have to switch back
so it's really not that bad you get used
to it you you know you rise to the
occasion for whatever you have to do I'm
sure we've all been in situations where
we thought oh how this is going to be
awful but you know it turns out to be
just another one of those things in your
life so yeah it's not that bad um let's
see the next question here how did guys
do makeup well the guys do it a lot
quicker than the girls do
I've seen guys at my state of course I'm
taking mental notes all the time whether
they realize it or not I've seen guys at
my station just use concealer I've seen
them just use powder or just like
foundation I mean it's not like they're
doing the full-out makeup routine like
all of us do if I were to recommend
something to guys in makeup which I have
gotten emails from guys in broadcasting
wondering I would recommend a concealer
that's which is a cream product and
probably using that around any just you
know off colored parts of your face or
your under eye area and then just using
a powder to keep the shine from forming
all over your face if you do that you're
probably gonna be overall pretty good
of course there's airbrush you know some
makeup artists that are working in HD
will do the airbrushing and stuff like
that which is like I'm fine fine mist
foundation and that probably works great
for them in that situation but if you're
a guy and you got to do it yourself yeah
that's what I'd suggest it's probably
some concealer and some powder and but
yeah I've seen it done probably you know
a lot of different ways have seen
nothing done at times and just a blot
with a with a Kleenex every now and then
but you know everybody does need to use
makeup I think at least some powder to
keep the shine from happening because
even if you don't have oily skin those
lights are gonna make you sweat at some
point so you need to get rid of the
shine kind of with that but let's see
what else here what kind of stories do
you like to do when I report which you
know technically like part of my
schedule is I'm anchoring and then I do
some sort of story generally in my other
the other half of my day and I really
like the variety of general assignment
reporting where you kind of don't
necessarily know what you're going to
get I do a lot of consumer related
stories which deal
with anything from scams to saving money
and things like that those are always
fun but and honestly you know every
reporter likes to get the exciting story
you know there's been a shooting and you
know somebody's on the run and there's
this and that and I mean those are great
stories they they're exciting but it's
not hard to make them exciting either I
kind of like getting the story that
seems like it's going nowhere and
somehow making it interesting
I like the offbeat kind of different
stories where it's like something really
you know random I also like really
emotional stories you know we have a
feature called the unsung hero every
week and a lot of people don't like
doing these stories because I guess it
takes a little bit of planning because
you definitely if it's an unsung hero
story is kind of like somebody who's
done a really great deed or something
like that and you kind of have to you
can't just really throw that together
you have to figure out you know what
you're gonna do but I really like the
way most of my unsung hero stories have
turned out because they've tended to be
pretty emotional I did a story one of my
favorite stories that I've done here
recently was on a woman who was caring
for her husband who had Alzheimer's
disease and she was an older woman and
she was caring for him so he could stay
in the home rather than having to go to
a nursing home he was most comfortable
and you know in his home and so she
would was able to care for him and
really improve his quality of life for
what he preferred there and it was so
sweet it was like the sweetest story
ever and it like makes me kind of want
to cry what I think about it but um you
know those stories were they're really
just like touch you you know those are
great so I love doing those kind of
stories well guys that pretty much does
it for my list of my frequently asked
questions I'm sorry if I rambled way too
much I just
I have a lot to say on the topic I can't
really help it but um thank you so much
for tuning in for this video I hope this
cleared some things up for you and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
