getting ready to actually touch up my
makeup a little bit and then I thought
hey this is the perfect opportunity to
actually shoot a video on it before I do
that and kind of show it in a little
tutorial just a super quick four-step
way to touch up your makeup blot blot
girl clips and if you can do all those
your face is going to look a lot fresher
it's not like a transformative thing
it's not like you're gonna you know have
a dramatic night out look at the end of
this these little four steps but it's
it's not that at all it's just
freshening up the face that you started
with first thing I do involves one of my
favorite makeup tools the q-tip very
inexpensive that can do a lot of great
things for you and I am always looking
at my eye area the area under my eye I
feel like I'm constantly trying
different products so certain days when
I'm trying something new I don't know
what I'm going to look like by the time
I get to the end of the day some things
we're better than others you'll notice
you know you have little lines or little
creases you know under your eye mate and
what I like to do with my q-tip is just
blot over those areas I'm not doing a
lot of vigorous rubbing because too much
back-and-forth rubbing whether it's
under your eye or around your face is
going to just actually take away more
product maybe then you want so I just do
some blotting under here and I find that
that can actually fairly easily take
away any problem areas and now I've got
a clean under eye area then you want to
think about your face and what you can
use to blot all over your face one
option is the blotting tissues these are
Palladio rice paper oil absorbing
blotting tissues they have a little bit
of rice powder on them it's very oil
absorb very easy you don't need a mirror
necessarily to even do that
sometimes you may want to blot with a
press powder one of my favorites is
L'Oreal True Match I think it's just a
really great powder that doesn't seem to
look real cakey this is what you might
use maybe if you're touching up before
getting a photo taken or something where
you really want to look flawless that's
an option as well as something I would
put in the same boat for looking
flawless is mallies poreless face
defender which is what I'm going to use
right now what I
use most often it's like a clear product
here that can kind of give your skin
that nice satin finish even things out
all over again and also diminish the
look of your pores which sometimes I
don't know about you but I feel like as
I wear my makeup longer at the end of
the day I can see my pores more than I
could when I started so I just put my
sponge there twist so I know I'm picking
some up and then I just go blotting this
all over again I'm not rubbing back and
forth but I'm just blotting this all
over my face and then I notice you know
this helps with the shine this helps
with evenness and then by the time I've
used that I feel like I've got a much
fresher face next step think about your
lashes if you don't have false eyelashes
on I always carry an eyelash curler with
me so I can quickly and gently being
very careful if you can just give your
eyelashes one little curl on each side
it's amazing the lift you can get and
it's really surprising how much they can
sag down throughout the day if you're
wearing false eyelashes like I am today
one of the things I do if I'm ever on
the go and I want to give them a boost
because they do come down to put your
fingers right in front of your eyes
blink down on to your fingers and you're
instantly you've lifted your lashes back
up so easy that glue is flexible and it
can be worked with like them
last tip pertains to your lips just
touch up whatever your lip product might
be this one's pretty self-explanatory by
the way today I am using um Mac's
lipstick in cream cup I was wearing just
a light pink lip today so I just keep
usually if I'm on the go one lip product
with me whether that's a lipstick or a
gloss or a jumbo pencil or something and
is step four the touch-up routine block
lot pearl lips block lot perhaps one
more thing one of the biggest things
that can affect your makeup staying
power is touching your face so if you
can help it don't lean your hand on your
face when you're at your desk and don't
you know rub your eyes or just sometimes
it's easy to forget like oh I've got a
full face of makeup on here but by not
doing that not only are you keeping
those germs that are on your hands off
of your face but you're also keeping
your makeup from wearing off unevenly by
just the fact of your fingers touching
your cheek you know that can make your
makeup wear off faster there than it
does somewhere else thank you so much
for watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
