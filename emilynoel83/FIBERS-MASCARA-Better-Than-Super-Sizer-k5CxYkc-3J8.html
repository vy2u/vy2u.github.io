covergirl super sizer fibers mascara I
mentioned this on Instagram and a lot of
you were surprised and so was I that
they've come out with a new version of
the super sizer that many of us know and
love packaging wise you know same size
same color but the print on the original
is in green and it's purple on the super
sizer fibers just a very brief backstory
on the super sizer mascara this is like
my Holy Grail favorite mascara I love
the way it builds length it seems to
really easily separate my lashes it also
holds a curl with my lashes which is
kind of a rare thing for a lot of
mascaras to do and I don't feel like it
smudges off or flakes off throughout the
day so it's really like checking all the
boxes as far as the brush I've heard you
know some people really like it some
people not so much it basically has a
couple of completely flat sides that are
just there to hold a little bit of
product I don't find that they're ever
overloaded with product but they're flat
in order to like allow you to lay some
of that down and then twist the brush
and comb through it with the little comb
aside so to Komi sides to flat side and
in my opinion that brush paired with
this formula it seems to just be the
right equation you know it works really
well this is kind of rich and creamy but
it's not like wet and inky and really
liquidy like some mascaras might be now
who knows how you actually pin down
these claims but on the original super
sizer it says 400% corner-to-corner
volume and yes I bought a new super
sizer because I was just running out of
my old one and I'm thinking I can't
compare and almost used up mascara to a
brand new one so I went and got new here
so I could be kind of on the same
playing field but again quarter to
quarter volume for full fanned out
lashes now the super sizer fibers also
has that 400% claim but it's focusing
more on volume and especially length so
if you're not familiar with fibers and a
mascara
they are like itty-bitty teeny tiny
short like hair tight particles that
will kind of be within that mascara
formula and as they apply they kind of
attach on to the ends of your lashes and
extend up
for even more length sometimes you may
not even be aware that the mascara
you're using has these particles and
then I find with others I can definitely
tell that they're in there maybe they're
longer or there's just more of them and
you can pull out the brush and
practically just see them hanging off of
your brush but this mascara I don't
think those fibers are extremely obvious
and the formula appears to be you can
just tell by looking at the brush it
seems to be a little thicker than the
original the outside of that and it's
the same brush it's the same size of
tube it's the same recommendation for
application with getting that flat side
in and then twirling the brush up so
which one is better did they make a big
improvement with this because I already
thought the original built great length
and separation and curl and all those
things I mentioned what I would say I've
noticed is that this new one builds the
length a little bit faster but I feel
like both can take me to the same point
because even though this original one
may not contain those little fibers it
still builds on itself really well
assuming you are applying your next coat
and not letting the first coat get
completely dry you know just giving it a
few seconds and then going back and
applying more it really does build off
of itself nicely that's never been a
complaint of mine I think it does it it
still looks natural and with the new one
I think the key differences would be I'm
getting the length a little bit faster
I'm noticing pretty much the same look
of separation maybe just a teeny bit
less it seems to hold the curl of my
lashes the very same way as the other
one but one thing I noticed was a little
bit of under-eye you just looked a
little bit grayish down here where I had
applied it on the lower lashes the other
day so I've got one on each eye does
anybody have any guesses on which is
which I'm going to jump into the
application now and let you know the
regular super sizer is on this eye I
don't feel like I put too much thought
into the whole technique of like
twisting the wand and you know going up
through my lashes that way it's kind of
become a no-brainer technique for me at
this point so I just know that if I feel
like I need a little more product I just
kind of go to the flat side and then
continue combing combing coming up
through with the comb side and I applied
two coats of this to my lashes I felt
like I had good separation really good
length and honestly with this being
brand new it's probably going to get
even better
as a little bit of the product gets used
up out of the tube and I would expect
maybe the same would happen for this
other one as well so here's the super
sizer fibers mascara on my left eye I
felt like I noticed more length like
instantly with this mascara however when
it was all said and done with the
application two coats of this it didn't
really surpass the length of the
original on my other eyes so I found
that interesting that it didn't really
in the end seem to go above and beyond
but it did do the job just a little bit
faster for length so I'm feeling pretty
good about them both seeing as they both
can hold a curl for me all day I was
keeping a really close eye on that the
other day only cons to this would be a
little under-eye smudging but I probably
wouldn't make a habit of using this on
the lower lash line day to day I would
usually use my clump crusher water
resistant and I just felt like as I
applied I get a little bit better just
lash separation the look of more lashes
because they're being so nicely
separated with the original and with
this I think maybe just the thickness of
the formula it doesn't seem to be doing
quite as good a job with that but it's a
very close call so if you're browsing
the stores and you're curious about the
fibers version of this mascara you think
you might want to pick it up I don't
think you'll be disappointed but I also
don't think you're going to see a
massive difference with the original and
if you don't choose to try it I don't
think you're missing out on anything
major because they just are so close and
the end result seems so similar with
them both so thank you guys so much for
watching this review I hope it was
helpful please let me know your
experiences in the comments section
below I will talk to you guys again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
