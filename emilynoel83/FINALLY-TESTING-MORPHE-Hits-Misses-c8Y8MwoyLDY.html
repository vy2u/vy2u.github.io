am moisturized
I'm ready to go and I'm going to be
doing a probably we should call it
nearly full face of morphe I say nearly
full face because they don't really have
products like a foundation or a
concealer but they've got a lot of
palettes I've got a random little
assortment of other things that they
make and I have brushes too and I can be
using those brushes pretty much every
step of the way I think
but why morphe well I feel like ever
since the brand has come in to oldest
stores I've gotten steadily more
questions about it and I've said in the
past like I feel like it's way way hyped
up and I have tried a little palette
here they're like back in the day like
quite a while ago I honestly wasn't like
floored by it but I thought yes you know
it's fine I just kind of felt
overwhelmed for a period there with just
coupon codes from various people like
everybody was trying to sell morphia
felt like and I just thought well
there's probably enough content out
there about it who needs to know from me
but maybe that whole phase has prompted
some people to actually care what I
think about it and ask me a lot of
questions about it got to brush sets
because I thought that would give me a
really good sense of the quality of face
brushes and eye brushes I've got their
continuous setting mist I have various
cheek products eye palettes so we're
just gonna jump in and get going with
this I will start with actually a brush
that I think will be similar to maybe a
Sigma P 80 for my foundation and this
comes out of the face brush set I'll
link to those below but they don't give
like the brush names on the actual brush
but if you go to altas website it lists
what they are specifically and let's see
what would be interesting to use right
now I think I'm gonna use my covergirl
trublend Matt made foundation I at first
started using this in the m20 shade
realized it was too light and I've moved
to M 30 actually which is honey I just
need to drink coffee here my coffee is
the perfect level of warmth right now so
I really got to soak that up let's do
one full pump and as I normally do I
just kind of you know patch the product
around
I have had really good staying power
with this foundation I wore it in some
pretty sweaty conditions you know and or
well now I got to tell you guys I was
expecting to be seeing Luke Combs this
week in concert and guess what bub was a
month off we do have tickets but they're
for July July 20th no big deal I'm just
really looking forward to it
and I randomly like went online and got
a special ticket and I was gonna see if
I could figure out what it entailed and
I'm like um bub did you realize this was
July oh crap so this brush um I feel
like it's a little smaller maybe than a
Sigma P ad but it's getting the job done
pretty much just as well I mean the cut
of the brush seems to be super even I'm
not seeing any stray hairs it's very
very soft it's just one of those dense
buffing type foundation brushes and I
think it did a good job there with the
foundation and this foundation I would
not call full coverage by the way if
anyone's wondering and I think it's a
strong medium coverage just putting that
out there if you've got absolutely
perfect skin you might put it on be like
oh wow this is full coverage but if
you've got some stuff like some some
issues the prep it but but you're gonna
realize it's not full coverage what did
I just do there for concealer actually
I'm gonna be using this one from
colour-pop it's the no filter concealer
I've got a bunch of new color pop stuff
including the foundation and I'm still
trying to like figure it out on most
youtubers timelines I realize the video
would have already been posted now but I
honestly I haven't quite figured it out
yet the first few times I've worn the
products concealer and foundation I'm
talking about
like I thought maybe they were drying me
out I tried to really like prep and
moisturize my under eye area today
in hopes of maybe reversing that a
little bit I may have gone a little
light with it it's light 14 brushes
saving up just a little loose you know a
little bit floppy for concealer
as you can see kind of for my dark
circles this concealer right now wasn't
really a miracle-worker I can still see
my melasma through it I'll just add a
little bit more see if I can build it up
because I didn't apply a lot I think
part of this is that I have a pretty
light shade I also wonder what would
happen if I take the foundation brush
that's better coverage there we go
but yeah as I was saying I will have you
know a full thing on tons of new color
pop and maybe older color pop to in a
video I'm just not ready to like give a
verdict on it yet and I think it
deserves more than just a first
impression I think I'm going to pick up
a little bit of Maybelline fit me and
actually use this brush that I was
starting used for concealer for a little
under eye setting powder it's kind of
reminding me of my ELF small tapered
brush I feel like I'm cheating a little
bit on that brush thank yous that brush
daily this is nice this is maybe a
little fuller but definitely the same
shape not really baking the under eye I
am just setting it lightly I have really
no complaints about the quality of these
brushes though they feel soft they feel
nice like it's a pretty design it's
almost like this rose gold ferrule and
then kind of like an old gold bronze
type look light bronze to the handles
which i think is pretty and it came in a
really generously sized pouch like I was
actually able to fit the setting mist in
there and this is a product to try for
another time but I have their sponge as
well I just wanted to focus in on the
brush kits so I could really tell you
how the brush kits work but yeah I've
been hauling some more feet around here
let's use this product here this is
something called bran tour and it's
bronzer plus contour in celebutante they
had this in a lot of different shades
and I think they described it as a
radiant bronzer and then a matte contour
shade and you could mix them you know
you could get sort of your own custom
type color you can use just each side
it's a nice little compact with a mirror
and I do like this packaging it's very
clean it's very just simple and I think
I'll use this larger kind of egg-shaped
powder brush I'll go into that contour
side and it's a really sunny kind of
color there you know what I mean I think
it looks really pretty like around my
hairline see that was that showing up to
anybody don't mind me just give him
myself a little JLo forehead here this
morning I want to kind of go into both
and just I always do this I always bring
that bronze
down the neck and onto the chest any
bronzer that I use any contour shade you
probably see this happening I might just
fast-forward through it and you're like
what is she doing but that's what's up
then take a little bit more of that and
we will just put it here in the hollow
of the cheek and see what happens
actually I'm going a little higher than
the hollow of the cheek I feel like this
is kind of playing okay with my skin
right now because I've got a decent
amount of a sort of tan I've got some
color in my skin right now going on but
I think for a lot of people just of my
general skin tone or lighter you might
find even just the contour side of this
pretty warm then I think I'll go over
here to this bronzer side which that's a
pretty light you know bronzer with a
sheen and I've got a little bit of that
on my brush and I'm just gonna sweep
that over like the tops of the cheeks
where the sun's gonna naturally hit
bronze goddess I would say that's a
pretty decent product the texture of the
powders you know they're pigmented like
look there's a lot of color coming off
of that contour shade there are so many
bronzers and contours on the market but
there aren't a lot that are kind of
combining the two steps into one sort of
easy compact so I think that's kind of
cool
now another thing that I got which I
feel like is a little overkill just for
me in my needs but I'll show you it's
the 8 L loaf I highlight and contour
palette there are some in here like this
shade I don't feel like I'm gonna use a
lot this color is extremely warm there
are maybe a couple of contour shades
that I would use and then you've got
these highlights over here I never
really use a fan brush for highlighting
but we're gonna go for it today I think
I'm gonna use this supernova color this
peachy one that does anything for us one
day I was really heavily using the
Stardust and I'm like why isn't that
showing up very much turns out it's kind
of a pinky tone color like it doesn't
really look just white it's actually
pink
a little more I feel out of my element
using this fan brush right where's my
moto highlight and blow brush I feel
like it's going on though I'm getting a
little highlight I'm not really fussing
too much about like the quality of this
palette
I just think maybe you know it's it's a
little more like suiting up makeup
artist needs and it's more than what I
need and you guys have heard me talk
about how much I love my lorac Pro
contour palette and that gives you a
little variety but it's not quite this
much and I feel like still every shade
in that palette I end up using and here
I feel like there's a lot of real estate
that I wouldn't really end up using and
I don't love like that yellowy highlight
and the one that actually turns out to
look really pink I'm just kind of about
I guess we're doing highlight before
blush today I have a blush palette it's
blushing babes I guess it's called and I
got the one called pop of blush so
they've got different shades you can
choose from and this adds the colors
sexy which is like a really soft peach
with kind of a satin finish fearless
appears to be like a matte pink and then
Witte seems to be a peachy Coral a shade
with a lot of golden shimmer in it I'm
gonna use their little angled brush for
this and I'm gonna go into that pink
which I was using this the other day and
I thought this was a really fresh little
color here
and I'm kind of wanting to fall into a
new blush brush also and this is a
pretty good one too it's angled kind of
so it could easily you know become your
contour brush as well I love a little
fresh pink pop on the cheeks it's nice
let's also layer up a little bit of the
lighter color there's a lot of fallout
happening here a lot of like dustiness
I'm not super mad at it but I'm just
letting you know I'm just kind of
layering over it I feel like I've made
the pink just a little more peach now
and this will be a blush for another day
because I think it kind of needs to be
used all in itself it's a really it's a
distinct color on its own look closely
at it and I think you'll see there's a
lot going on with Whitty over there so I
have this can of setting spray and it
says defend your artistry a micro-fine
mist sets liquid or powder makeup with a
radiant finish hold the bottle 8 to 10
inches away from face close your eyes
and apply the mist all over your face ok
I can't get used to it when you press
the thing down there's a little like
thing that it hits that you wait for and
you're like oh what's it gonna start
going it's a really fine mist I do feel
like lightly hydrated now on top of
everything I definitely haven't used
this enough to get a really good feel
for the staying power I feel like I have
to use the heck out of like a setting
spray to really understand it it took me
a long time with like Milani make it
last to figure that out because I think
you ought to use it enough to where
you've put it through the test of
different foundations and is it kind of
like good no matter what or is it only
good when you use certain products
underneath so I'm gonna keep at it but
my initial thought is that yes it made
me look a little more dewy right away
after I put it on I feel like I sprayed
on a decent amount I'm gonna do my brows
real quick and then I'll join you for
the eyes this is the morphe eyelid
primer it says translucent on it and I
have used this and I feel like it works
pretty darn well it's a nice consistency
it has that kind of beige ela that
Milani eyeshadow primer also has it's
really smooth I like that it applies
very easily across the lids and doesn't
seem to pull at certain areas I don't
feel like I have to work real hard to
get it all smooth
out and it kind of leaves the right
amount of tackiness like it's not a
sticky sticky eye primer but it leaves
just enough going on there you know to
help us shadow really cling in and and I
think do its best so I don't really have
any complaints about this eye primer by
the way before we get into the eyes
let's just talk prices here for a second
because those brush kits that I got the
complexion gold kit is $25 you're
getting 5 brushes and a pouch there so
about 5 dollars each I slay brush
collection this next Y might be using as
$18 the continuous setting miss was 15
the blush trio was $12 the sculpting
palette was 25 the Brawn tour was 12 I
mean I feel like it's kind of falling in
line with you know right at or a little
above drugstore prices for some of their
larger palettes though I'm seeing like
$23 $29 jaclyn hill palettes $38 so some
of those are a little bit all over the
place but and there are better bargains
you can get on brushes from what I've
used in these little like pouch
collections I've realized there are some
really good brushes they don't feel like
they're grossly overpriced okay I've got
a few palettes here I want to just talk
about for a minute this one the Jaclyn
hill palette this you know has been
talked about a lot here on YouTube and a
lovely viewer of mine named Jill
actually gave this to me so thank you so
much Jill I've had my hands on it for a
while and this is the color scheme if
you haven't seen it I feel like it's a
good group of basics I think it's a
great quality palette
you know the shades work well I had this
one break over here this purple but oh
my god I'm not holding that against it
or anything you just got a little messy
there's a good balance of like dark and
light happening here I would say the one
thing I come away with like outside of
this little corner here I feel like
we've got just a lot of like the
gradient effect to light to dark a lot
of pretty shades but a la shades that
are kind of similar a lot of pretty
neutral looks to be had again you've got
this splash over here that feels a
little bit funky to me I'm not like
trying to pick on the palette because I
think overall it's like a good just
really basic benchmark palette but why
not have like a few different colors
that aren't just like for really bold
bright ones that maybe like a couple
pastel colors here and there
like a really rich plum or something
like that sprinkle in even more things
that prompt me to do some different
ideas with my look and from what I've
seen I don't own them but the palettes
that are in that vault that she's put
out those seem to be sprinkled in with a
little bit different like ideas and
color schemes and I have this 24 G this
is called the Grand glam look at the
size of these shades like these are
giant okay these are giant eye shadows
this is a ton of shadow I can't remember
what I paid for this $29 but I mean this
is a lot of eye shadow and if you love
this warm verging on rosy and warm brown
color scream like this is a lot of
product these pans are like the size of
typical blush pants let's say I like the
way most of them applied and the last
few times I've used it and then there's
this dare to create palette this is the
39a this is bigger than both of those I
mean you got a damn Trapper Keeper here
and what's missing need some highlight
kind of colors right even this shade up
here that's kind of catching the light
like that's a bronze they've given you
this row of neutral mattes you've got
beautiful colors there's actually a
pretty spectrum in here but I can't get
past the fact that the palette is this
big and there's no like couple of light
shades it's like they're gonna say okay
we expect you to carry around this you
know what you're gonna have to find your
own highlight shades and take them on
top of this big ol thing this is massive
and the fact that it doesn't have that
is really taking away a lot of my
enjoyment for this palette there was so
much room in here for there to at least
be something to highlight your eyes with
like a matte one a shimmery one I could
settle for just two I am gonna use this
today actually because I do want to use
some of the colors in here that I
haven't used yet and I'll just go to my
24g and I'll use some of these shades
for my highlight one other thing about
morphe packaging like I don't think it's
unattractive packaging at all and I feel
like it is pretty solid but I would love
with palettes this size I would love it
if there was instead of just a magnetic
closure that's really not super strong I
would love it if there was actually a
clasp closure because I would feel a lot
more secure about it because these are
big palettes like the top of one of
these comes open there's a lot to
potentially get screwed up and
there I'm sorry I just feel like I've
gone on and on into sort of review mode
on these but what I'm going to do is
take this it's so big I'm gonna use this
brush that comes in my little brush
pouch here and I'm just gonna dip into
this guy this seems like a good shade to
start with and I'm gonna put that in my
crease it feels funny not using my Sigma
e25 here this is a little different cut
as you can see it's not pinched at the
top of the ferrule but it still does a
fine job of getting my color here
my experience with these more heat
palates has been yes I'm getting good
eye looks I just sometimes have some
questions about the way everything was
all put in there in the shade selection
and the amount of space and real estate
you know in a palette that they devote
to eyeshadow and just the choices that
were made and so many of their palettes
like you look on ulties website they
give you a boatload of high shadows and
even some really generous sizes but the
color schemes and like the color
families are just so like in the same
and if they're going to release a bunch
of products like I love how fun this one
is actually color scheme wise but again
the highlighter type shade is missing
next I think I'll go to this orange e
color right up here keeping the same
brush will intensify that crease a
little more pretty shade
okay there's another brush in here
that's about the same size as what I've
been using it's maybe I don't know it
feels a little bit softer and I'm just
going to use that to kind of blend over
the edges not that I have any real harsh
edges going on here but just kind of
buff over that and then um
one small gripe that I have with this
little brush set is that I wish there
was something really really flat like
this is sort of the packet on type brush
I feel like it's a little thick and I've
just gotten really used to liking a
super flat brush to do that job but this
this can work and we're gonna make it
work today I'm going to use some green
I'm gonna take first off this kind of
gold any olive sorry it's it's huge I
feel like the shimmers go on best with a
little bit of a swipe across the lid
which doesn't surprise me because that's
how a lot of shimmers these days seem to
go on living their best life is with a
bit of a swipe
that's an interesting color now do you
remember when there was a morphe palette
with kathleenlights and that was a
little smaller palette and I like that
when I remember there's like a random
kind of green in there I just I felt
like there was a nice little splash of
different things happening in it just
throwing that out there if anyone has a
memory of that because that was one of
the few more few things that I used
before more recent products and let's go
to this screen I'm kind of intrigued by
that one whew
I like that and I kind of like that I
set this up a little orangie in the
crease because it looks kind of cool
that green okay
and then finally I think we'll go on
with this deepest olive this brush is
doing okay actually like it's got some
thickness to it like I said but it it
can still pack on some shadow
that is a swampy green lid that like
that is some serious olive now I want to
tell you guys something I'm really
excited about I got this brush
separately on ulties website this was
not in the little pouch and it's the M
506 and I was looking for something that
could be the same as my mua makeup
academy 315 and i think i found its
long-lost sister here because this one I
have people telling me like I can't find
that anyway when I want a really small
like outer corner brush and I just
thought this looked similar on the
website you can never really tell
size-wise what you're getting but I'm so
glad that it's the same and it's like
the same kind of amount of movement in
the bristles it's same cut really so
this would be a great alternative to
that anyway I need to blend a little bit
having pretty good experiences with the
brushes I just want to pop something a
little different in the outer corner
this Brown almost looks to the point of
being plumb that might be a little
different
I want a little darkness that's cool
I just feel like it's such a shame that
there aren't a few light shades in this
palette because it is really a pretty
palette that had so many options
otherwise and I know I could just grab
out like a single or I could open up
another one of my zillion eye palettes
but it's just the principle of it like
you got a palette this huge and you're
not gonna give people one thing like it
just leaves me wondering who signed off
on that idea
I love this brush though I'm so glad I
found something that's hopefully a
little more accessible for people than
that other one that maybe you could find
at a CVS maybe you couldn't kind of want
to just take it a little bit more of a
warm shade and just sort of finish off
this transitioning area here
I think that looks cool I'm happy with
that now I'm gonna go into this big ol
daddy here and I will use this shimmery
shade those shimmers though and I was
realizing this the other day they don't
apply as nicely with a brush like this
like they're stronger in a packed on
capacity but obviously I don't really
want to pack it on right under my brow
bone so it's just gonna be what it will
be the brushes you haven't seen me is in
the kit yet there is one that would be
good for like a gel liner that actually
looks really good it's very small I have
not used that yet I also have not yet
used this one but this could be good you
know like under the eye for stamping on
a little bit of powder shadow as a liner
and then I was really glad I got this
because I lost my previous pencil brush
but there's a nice little pencil brush
and I was using that the other day and
it worked really well I think I will
also you try to use that brush a little
bit maybe take some of this light shade
see how well it'll pop around my inner
corners for a little bright it's kind of
a golden e color again this is the grand
glam 24 G with the eye shadows that are
like the size of actual cookies then
let's take this nice rich milk chocolate
brown and just smudge a little bit of
that under the eye
it's such a mossy green that's the name
of this green that I couldn't quite put
my finger on mossy he's such an earthy I
look in general I really like it and I'm
just kind of smudging that one shade
that I put under here until there's
nothing really left on my I keep the
focus sort of on the upper part of the
eye I'm gonna put my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight in my lower
inner rim as I like to do often when
it's not a really like dark and smoky
look and use the extra wake up today I'm
gonna finish off my eyes with a little
liner probably some lashes mascara and
put on a lip color because I don't have
a morphe lip color and then I'll rejoin
you show you the finished look and just
some final thoughts okay okay I actually
decided to forgo the extra lashes and I
just used my covergirl supersize here
two coats of that because I kind of felt
happy with it and I thought look at my
eyes a break from the lashes on my lips
I kind of thought this color might play
nicely with this sort of mossy warm look
it's the em cosmetics true gloss and
caramel glaze this I thought wasn't
really one of my favorites of the bunch
but for certain looks I don't know
certain things you're pairing it with I
think it can work pretty well would you
like me to take this off it's just
distracting anyone morphe more three
more feet and I think I have had a
pretty good experience with the brushes
I liked that they had some kits
available on ulties website and for the
most part I really liked what was in the
kits this brush this was the five piece
face brush set I'm not in love with a
fan brush for highlighter a lot of
people might be but just generally
speaking I think it was a good little
assortment here I would have maybe like
something that could have been even more
effective at concealer like just a
little bit smaller brush perhaps but
still realistically I'm probably gonna
take a lot of my brushes that I already
have and kind of put them into this mix
and I think these are good I think I'm
gonna be using this blush brush a lot I
think this will be in my foundation
rotation this for powder - I kind of
like that egg shape and I thought it
applied bronzer really really nicely
that was a good face brush kit what I
might like even more however are the eye
brushes which is kind of rare like I'm
sort of surprised that I was able to
just jump into a completely different
set of eye brushes than what I'm
- using and I did feel really
comfortable with them you've got that
kind of flat brush which I could have
liked it to be even more flat and
precise like toward the tip mainly like
the nice thing about a really flat brush
is that it can just like get exactly
where you want it to go I still feel
like I had control with this it was just
different from what I'm used to this
little guy I did use that a little bit
off-camera just under my wing there and
that was pretty good
if you're into cream and gel liner I
think this would be outstanding it looks
like a really fine cut to that love the
pencil brush and I really like these two
kind of blending brushes this one
getting shadow in the crease was awesome
and this even softer one was really nice
just blending out the edges and then
this little gem of fine just
individually on the M 506 for an outer
corner color I thought was really good
and I was glad to finally you know find
something that was similar to that mu a
brush that is very hard to come up with
another high point for me was the eye
primer I thought that was actually
really good it's performed well for me
every time I've used it other little
products here the bran tour like this
was a good product I don't know that
it's a total necessity like everyone
must have this but I thought it was kind
of a creative concept to have the
shimmer and the matte side by side I did
like the color on my skin I do like my
blush trio also I really like a pink
blush like that I'm excited to get more
use out of this one but today I just
kind of layered up those two and I think
it's really pretty on the cheeks and I
like that they had a lot of different
color options on the blushes the whole
palette here maybe in a makeup artist
realm this would be really useful just
for me I like I felt like the Bron tour
was probably adequate in terms of a
bronzey contour type shade the only
thing that was missing would be the
highlight so I had to use highlight from
here and I wasn't in love with it I
didn't think all those highlighter
textures were just amazing this mist
to be continued I'm gonna keep using
this and test this out and see how
effective it is actually for helping the
staying power of my makeup but it's
something to get used to you know this
aerosol can to spray it at your face
kind of forget like how much control you
feel like you have over the pump style
sprays so it's different but I'm gonna
keep trying that the eyeshadow palettes
I got these three that I kind of brought
up here I can't say I've had like a bad
experience where
I did a look and it completely bombed
you know I failed experience with the
palates I feel like I've been able to
make any of them work for me you know
there may be some shadows that you need
to pack on a little more heavily there
might be some shades that just require a
little different technique but I mean
that's just I shadow that's what you'll
find with any product so I don't really
hold that as a strike against these I
just kind of wish there was more
creativity or just a few more perhaps
risks taken or just different ideas
thrown into pallets that are this large
you know there's so much space there are
so many things you can do I feel like if
you look through a big lineup of morphe
palettes like on their website they're
sort of the word that kind of comes into
my mind is generic you almost wonder if
they just put into a computer like
neutral eyeshadows and it generated this
palette that was just full of all one
tonne of taupey eyeshadow or all one
tonne of warm eyeshadow and boom that's
what you're getting and no individual
went in and said well why don't we mess
this up a little bit and put in you know
a few little odd balls it seems to me
that they're turning out quite a few
products and I think they should put
some things out that take a few more
risks look the Jacqueline Hill palette I
think this is a really good palette and
I think it's a good selection of basic
shades especially if you like a lot of
like more mattes they've really got that
covered in here when I look at big
pallets my mind goes back to a lorac
mega Pro palette like the mega Pro 2 or
just different ones that they've put out
it was a really specially put together
assortment of shades that never look too
narak all the shades had important
reasons for being there and you would
stumble across color combinations that
would prompt you to go in all kinds of
different directions and it might just
be because oh here's this like weird
kind of minty greenish gold different
takes on things and I feel like brands
could challenge themselves a little more
by not just doing straight up gradients
of neutrals and actually throw in some
stuff that can prompt people to go in
really different directions and not just
for the purpose of you know here's your
brights that like those
off-the-beaten-path kind of colors is
anybody feeling me on this and then
talking about these other two here the
dare to create
and the grande glam I mean these are
massive pallets I think the grande glam
I mean if you're into those colors
you're getting loads of them if you like
Rosie if you like warm I've done several
really pretty looks with this so I can't
complain really quality wise I just
think it's funny that those shadows are
so huge and the dare to create I think
they've got a really good thing going
here with all these different colors I
just wish they could have thrown us a
bone and given us a couple light shades
feel free to disagree with me this is
just my two cents on the matter I'm
coming at this from just one person's
perspective my brain to you and I feel
like there's kind of a reason that goes
beyond just like oh I feel like more of
he's been so hyped up it's been so
talked about nobody really needs my
opinion on it I feel like there's been a
little something underneath all that too
and it's with a lot of these pallets
which I'm a very like into pallets type
of person but there haven't been a lot
of pallets that they've put out where
I've been like oh my gosh I need that
they haven't given me that feeling and I
think it's just because I'm starting to
be a little bit more into something
that's gonna offer me something a little
unique you know but yeah let's get the
conversation going in the comments
section what should I try from Morphy
that I haven't yet tried what are your
favorites and least favorites I don't
have any coupon codes so don't go
looking for those but I will have the
products that I've used linked below if
you want more info and yeah that's it
