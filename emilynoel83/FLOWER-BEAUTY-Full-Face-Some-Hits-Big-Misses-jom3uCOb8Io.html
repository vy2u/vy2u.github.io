morning to you this is first thing in
the morning here as I shoot this and
it's going to be a full faced look today
using nothing but flower beauty so this
is a line that first was kind of born at
Walmart but where I live it's been like
phased out of that store and now it's in
Ulta online so once I realized that they
were in old I started you know buying
and trying some more things
and lately I've compiled enough to
experiment with some full face looks so
I thought I'd do a look for you today in
this video sort of like a one brand
tutorial type deal and we can come away
with some ideas on what we like and
don't like for me I think I've got some
definite hits from this line but I also
have some pretty strong misses as well
so grab your coffee or whatever beverage
you're enjoying it this time of day or
night and let's get started I have
moisturized myself I have made sure to
not over moisturize my self because I
have had some really not-so-good
situations with this light illusion
foundation from flower it says luminous
makeup nude skin feel well I do really
have a nude skin filled by you know even
just a few hours in wearing this because
it just doesn't have good staying power
on me I'm not saying in dude skin feel
all over my face but it actually looks
like it's worn from like say the center
of my face region which is probably
where I take the most effort to set it
and I'm not an especially oily person
but this is a really dewy looking
foundation when I put it on at first I
want to like fall in love with it but it
just can't hang on my skin all day so I
have it in the shade ivory l/2 and it
says it does have SPF 18 in it but yeah
it's a luminous foundation it has a pump
by the way it seems to have good
coverage on the skin so it's sort of a
disappointment that it just does not
consistently has not worn well on me I
don't know what the deal is so going in
as I mentioned I'm trying not to use
like anything super heavy I used to
really lightweight moisturizer today
just to see if that might be part of the
problem is my skincare underneath I'm
also using this flower Beauty sponge
I've had this on hand for a while and
only just recently started using it but
look how big it puffs up and it's super
soft it's like a little more
mellow and it does have a flat side can
you say that part of that's flat right
there just a little cut of it and then
it's just very big everywhere else so I
bet start to getting this blended in
before it so you see what I mean like
the coverage on this is decent it's
evening out skin tone it seems to be
working with some redness I wouldn't
call it full coverage but you know it's
an it's an adequate medium coverage for
sure the thing I don't love about this
sponge is that I feel like it's hard to
get into certain pinpointed areas with
it like it's just it's just so big all
around I find it hard to get any one
part of this like to my eye area you
know whereas with a real techniques
sponge or a NYX sponge there's a it's
cut in such a way that you are going to
be able to get around smaller contours
of the face that's my one gripe there
although it is SuperDuper soft I mean it
kind of feels like a real techniques
sponge just just a different cut and I
do like the color well I like fading
into tones of the beige okay so here I
am with that and now I'm feeling like no
I want I want a little more coverage I
want to see if I can do a bit more with
this where I notice just you know a
little discoloration this is a step I
don't normally take and I'm kind of
wondering if maybe this could help it
last longer for me I mean staying power
is a huge factor when it comes to
foundation like that's the basis of your
look it needs to last and it's to last
in a good way you know just simply being
there just being able to see it that's
one thing but it needs to stay and look
natural and look one with the skin that
helped out the coverage a little bit but
do you see the finish of this there's a
little bit of a luminosity quite a bit
of a luminosity to this I would say all
right so that's liya lusion foundation
gorgeous packaging love that there's a
pump but you know I had a great
experience there the newer thing to me
from this line probably the newest thing
because it took me the longest to get in
it had been out of stock is this light
illusion full coverage concealer and I
have this in the shade L 3/4 light your
standard doe foot applicator liquidy
concealer it does feel very thin as you
put it on there and I'm going
also put it around my nose redness there
you know and then I'm gonna kind of
start dabbing with this sponge although
this sponge gets real out of control for
me because it is so big but this
concealer is very spreadable I feel like
then easy to go around a large surface
area now I'm gonna bring a smaller brush
to do the dirty work here if you can see
there's kind of a yellow tone in this as
well but I like the coverage on it you
know
like this and this alone did a pretty
good job on the under-eye circles when I
first used this I kind of liked this
concealer right off the bat I found it
easy to work with and I think it'll
definitely get into my rotation you know
I think it's on the verge of maybe even
being just a little light I've really
gotten a bit more picky about concealer
tone once I realized when I was using
the makeup revolution once how like
going down one shade like made such a
difference for coverage on my skin and I
think if my skin tone deepens anymore
than this which it probably will you
know throughout spring and summer I'll
really want to follow that change in my
skin tone because when your concealers
too light it takes under eye darkness it
takes discoloration and it just merely
changes the tone of it but it doesn't
take it away and so a good skin tone
match is important and sometimes using a
corrector is important too but this is
really good coverage now here's another
thing I've been playing with a little
but here this is the miracle matte
translucent finishing powder so flower
beauty packages they're loose powders I
remember buying one from Walmart that
was just like this they package them
it's pretty but it's huge you know like
this is gonna have to live and some
special like special accommodations here
in the beauty room because it definitely
won't be fitting in my powder drawer and
it's tough to open because you don't
want to open with a big pop because this
powder is light as air and it will just
go push there's some powder here not
sure if you can see it but it's very
light it's that really light kind of
texture of a Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
you know finishing powder
it's just SuperDuper light and to me
it's not really baking friendly I need a
little more weight to the powder than
this because I've tried baking with this
I have not loved the results I thought
it made my under-eye area just in a
packed on sense applying this powder it
makes it look drier there and also it
has not enhanced my staying power really
all elsewhere on the face either I'm
gonna go ahead and apply a little
because I think you're gonna be able to
see that at least at the onset it does
do so so like airborne I feel like I'm
inhaling it but when you put it on it
does function to mattify it just doesn't
really enhance
power at all it's hard to really make it
cling to the brush because I just feel
like I'm stirring up it's everywhere I
do it for the love of the beauty
broadcast family
setting my t-zone with it even though
this product has proven itself that's
not really like keeping me matte for the
long haul for a temporary quick Matt
nose few hours of madness maybe
now here's another powder I have I have
the light illusion perfecting powders so
the light illusion products so far have
been the foundation and the concealer
and now this so the way this is packaged
you've got your pan of product here you
flip it up and there's a mirror and also
a sponge did I say that I have this in
beige l4 it says buildable coverage and
blurring pigments you know how sometimes
I try a powder and I describe it as
feeling like really really creamy for
example the LA Colors mineral powder
that one really jumps into my mind these
days is just being a super smooth powder
goes on not really looking powdery at
all it's just creamy you know for me on
this
it doesn't feel dry and chalky but it's
not that level of kind of like ooh this
is a buttery really rich texture I also
don't think it's quite as smooth feeling
as like L'Oreal True Match pressed
powder which is another great one it's
just kind of an average powder for me
and I'm going to just kind of lightly
apply this elsewhere on the face
when I'm trying to pick up on now is if
it's really helping the coverage or the
look of my makeup now that I'm putting
it on top because it claims to be a
perfecting powder it claims to be
blurring and I think it does help my
coverage of the foundation a little bit
when I put this on top again not sure
it's really enhancing the staying power
because every time I've worn that
foundation I've also worn this alright
coming up next I need a bronzer and I'm
going to use the one from this beauty
flash palette and that is going to be
the only thing that I use from this
palette today because I've got some
other products I want to tell you about
and this I actually used the whole
palette in my video about if I lost all
my makeup the ten things I would buy
first this was a big factor in that
video because it multitasks for me and
did so many things in one so if you want
to see the kind of look at creates check
that video but for now I'm just gonna
use the bronzer because I don't have
another one and I really do like the
bronzer in here it's one of my favorite
parts of this palette it does have a
little shimmer feel like it looks really
natural on my skin yeah it's not
invisible I feel like it actually does
kind of have an effect on the overall
glow of my face
not the kind of bronzer that would
double as a heavy contour see the amount
of warmth and there's not like orangie
but you know I'll put a little bit on
here not making a real distinct effort
though to carve out a cheekbone now I
can always tell in person a little bit
more than my camera shows after I put on
bronzer and also highlight I can see it
a little bit more in person than
sometimes the lighting wants to give off
now a different kind of blush that I
want to talk about in this video is the
felt flat flowerpots powder blush
flowerpots powder blush in Wild Rose I
also have some other shades of this and
I find them to be really really nice
very pigmented this one seems to be like
matte these are pigmented serious
blushes and I remembered flower when
they had some products that initially
launched with the line when they came to
Walmart I remembered I shadows and
blushes being a really strong point so
again I think they've got some good
quality here also speaking of drew
Barrymore who is the creator of this
line does anybody watch Santa Clarita
Diet on Netflix I believe it is now I
really liked your Barrymore and I love
um Timothy Olyphant
I don't know if I'm saying his name
right but when he was on justified oh my
gosh you've got to see justified if you
haven't seen that like it's great but I
missed him and so I realize he's on here
and I'm like I don't really care what
the content of this show is I just think
he's a really good actor and the show
has I don't even want to begin to give
away what the show is about if you
haven't seen it all I think you should
just bust into it without a lot of
preconceived notions but there's some
weirdness happening there but it's
highly intriguing it's hard to look away
and the humor suddenly just saw the
lines in it the drew has and that he has
it's just like like it's well-written
just a little quick stuff that you think
you might not even catch it it's just
like so funny so anyway we've finished
both seasons of that if you feel like
you're seeing me just go back and get in
back again I am building it up little by
little because it's the kind of blush
where you know you should be aware if
you go in full-on don't tap off the
excess you're gonna have a lot on your
cheeks but look how fresh this shade can
look just lightly I'm just lightly
building it up I might go a little more
and then call it a day here
I feel fresh I feel alive here's what
we're gonna use for highlight today I
got the Galactic glow holographic
palette so it's pretty it looks
holographic on the outside but I don't
think there's anything truly hollow
about the different shades in here but
it says take on a celestial inspired
glow with our new galactic lo
holographic face palette loaded with 3d
refractive pearls and prismatic pigments
as that imparts the most otherworldly
Sheen so we've got a golden II shade
here this color has a little bit of blue
tone to it I'm not the biggest fan of
that tone on my skin so I'm going to
steer a little bit clear of that this
one is almost like it's white but I
sense some silver coming through this
shade a little bit and then here this
color actually has some pink glow I
think I'm going to go into the pinky
glow because the texture of this one
seems maybe just a little softer
you see that you see the little bit of
Sheen that that's giving on this cheek
that this one doesn't have one of these
cheeks is not like the other
it's kind of fun to take a pink
highlighter over blush but then the the
finished effect on the top of the cheek
isn't always like awesome so I'm gonna
take a little bit of this now which
seems a little flaky I have used it
before and I thought it's a little
everywhere but that's a little bit more
intense just as a cheekbone highlight
looks a little dewy there
I'm really not blown away by it guys I
think we as consumers have a ton of
highlighter options these days and this
is falling a little short for me it's
feeling the textures of some of these a
little bit powdery a little bit light
here's why it's hard I'm coming on the
heels of discovering a really great
honest hacia palette that sugar glow
palette which I know it's not brand new
but it's new to me and I think that is
so good and I really like the tones in
it I really love the textures and so I
try this I'm like yeah it's not as
creamy it's not really as consistent and
pigmented so I do not have a brow
product from flower beauty's so I'm
gonna go ahead and use my ELF this is
just my little like elf two-dollar brow
pencil in deep brown and I'm gonna put
that on and then we'll do an eye look
okay gang brows are done I also threw on
some of this eye primer this is the
flower in your prime ultimate eye primer
and I do really like the texture of this
when you squeeze it out it just looks
white it's a little thinner than Milani
eyeshadow primer and it's not super
sticky but I have had good results with
it and I feel like it's not too heavy on
the eyes but this is the palette that
I'm gonna be using the shimmer and shade
eyeshadow palette and the tone is called
warm natural although I really with a
couple of exceptions over here on this
side I feel like it's a really cool
palette like this is going to end up I
think what I do today probably looking
like a pretty cool I look there's a lot
of plum in here kind of dusty colors
really a lot of metallic type finishes
or shades with just a little pearl in
them we've got what seem to be a couple
of pure mattes right here like with this
brownish color and then a matte kind of
black berry plummy shade and then all
the rest seems to have some level of
shimmer so I'm gonna start off doing is
get this shade here this matte and
there's fallout I stick my brush in that
one but this matte kind of plummy gray
and I'm going to work this into my
crease first with my Sigma e25 the color
payoff is nice it applied very smoothly
but it kind of gets really really soft
and loose when you stick your brush in
it be advised people who had a problem
with honest hacia subculture need
apply for this
it does blend really smoothly like it
kind of hangs together like it sort of
spreads across the surface area pretty
nicely now on the lid I'm kind of
intrigued by this shade right over here
this is kind of like a really soft lilac
shimmer I'm gonna start to bring this
around my inner corner and just up on to
the lid a little bit just about that far
in
it looks like it should be wildly
shimmery and I'm just the look of the
product and the pan but it's not it's
not out of control here on my eyes
now I think I'm going to take this shade
right here which is a sort of
pearlescent dark plum and I'm going to
begin patting that on the outer part of
my lid here
I want to really make an effort to work
in more like cool looks like this I mean
it cool is in tone of course I want all
my looks to be cool but I've just
noticed in response to different pallets
I've reviewed a lot of people saying
yeah I want more more cool toned
eyeshadows because everything's if it's
not fully warm it's got a huge splash of
warm in there and it's things a lot of
y'all say you don't you feel like you
wouldn't use I'm gonna try to do more
like this however I still do want to
bring you that tutorial with the Phoenix
Rising palette which is warm as all
get-out but I mean I do love that
so this shade sheer doubt is not like
super shiny I don't know if you're
picking up on it it's this shade right
here you know it's it actually seems to
perform almost matte I'm gonna go back
to the shade that I first put in my
crease and kind of buff around even more
this is with my Sigma II 36 brush I also
called wispy white
and then just gonna take a bear brush
and blend the edges maybe just do a
little pop of that shade on the end so
you're a little brow bone glow
I kind of want to take a dab of this
shade that has a little bit of sparkle
in it it's a little dab of that for the
outer corner and just see how much it
darkens it because I haven't used that
color before like I see what they mean
there are a few shades in here like this
is kind of a deep copper color right
there and then these couple at the end I
can see that there's a splash of warm in
this palette but it's not like I would
have described the entire thing as warm
because it's mostly cool it's mostly a
cool plum palette with just a few warm
touches
I'm just dabbing a bit more of the
shimmery shade and over the top because
you know in the process of blending you
let you lose some shine there but yeah
I'm gonna cool it there on that I'm
going to do some liner and mascara now
just some black liquid liner this is my
Milani stay put and matte kind of drop
the ball not getting those products from
flower but I'll throw those on and be
right back okay guys here's what's
happened I line my upper lash line did a
little bit of a wing with this Milani
liner
I used my wet and wild ultimate brow
highlight in my lower inner rim and for
mascara I used it cosmetics super hero
today
the only thing I kind of added shadow
wise was I took this deepest color right
here the one that looks like it has a
little sparkle in it and I just used an
angled liner brush and kind of carried
that up under the wing and that was that
now for lips I was kind of thinking like
maybe a little bit of a cool pinky lip
today I find myself kind of gravitating
a little bit more toward pinks this time
of year so I'm gonna use the mix and
matte lip duo so we've got a lipstick on
one end and then we've got like kind of
a creamy sort of metallic finish gloss
on the other another one of these shades
that I liked was honey nude and I found
myself kind of wanting to top the look
with an actual gloss gloss at the end
the color and everything was really
pretty but it's just that this end can
kind of come off looking a little dry at
times so we'll see how this particular
shade performs this is called tickled
pink
it's like exactly the color I was going
for so that's good it's a very full
colored matte lipstick and I also wanted
to throw out that you may have seen it
turn up in a vlog like the last vlog I
did I hit a really hot pink lip and I
was wearing pink orchid the matte
lipstick like just super hot pink and
the staying power was fabulous and it
actually wore really evenly and nice so
anyway with this product you've got the
matte lipstick on one end and then
you've got this kind of shimmery
glossiness on the other except it's not
really overly shiny but it adds a little
glow to the lips see that I think I'm
gonna keep it somewhat confined to the
center the lips this really does
coordinate nicely with the pink shade
yeah I like that color I don't feel like
they look too dry or anything so here we
go just right for a trip to the dentist
that is what I'm doing today got a
checkup
and then Belle has her first appointment
so they're like just bring her in while
you do your cleaning and she can sit
there and watch and then we'll just you
know take care of her real quick I'm
like okay she's really excited about it
though and but what do we think about
all this flower Beauty stuff well the
light illusion foundation is a no for me
I mean I've worn this I've seen
consistently not good staying power even
though I kind of like the way it looks
going on there's just better stuff out
there for me and also the sponge is just
a little it's soft as heck but it's too
big the concealer I like I will continue
to kind of have that in my mix of
concealers that I want to use I think if
you are exceptionally dark and really
have some bluish tone circles that you
need to correct I would bring in a
corrector first but all in all it's just
a standard liquid concealer it's pretty
good I don't know that's quite the
amount of coverage that my makeup
revolution can seal and define has that
it's definitely in the ballpark my
powders not impressed with either one
this is a major pass for me this loose
powder it's so hard to control it just
goes everywhere even when you just dab a
brush into it lightly the light illusion
perfecting powder yes it helped the
overall finished look but I think a lot
of powders would I don't think that's
really unique to this product love these
flower blushes they're definitely giving
the Milani rose bushes that have a
little flower imprint definitely given
them some competition not a fan of this
highlighter palette
let me know if there's a better like
lighter product I could try from this
line the eyeshadow palette was really
fine like I like this look that I ended
up with but the textures of these
shadows like if you weren't prepared to
be like really really careful with your
shadow application you could kind of get
into a big mess of fallout if you
weren't extra aware to tap off all that
excess I thought was funny that they
called this warm natural when it's
really like I think very cool and plumy
I enjoy the look but I'm not blown away
to the tune of 1699 which is what
they're charging for this I don't think
the quality is quite there
now the lip is kind of cooled this mix
in matte lip duo I mean I think the tone
was exactly what I was after it's kind
of fun to have one product that gives
you that option of adding some more
Sheen and shine to your look I think
they do a great matte lipstick this
whole line isn't necessarily matte son
will say cream on the bottom for example
but I found the mattes in particular to
have really great staying power but
probably my most favorite lip product
that flower he makes are these um Hydra
silk lip butters these are so good I've
talked about these before the shade rose
petal is a major favorite it's kind of
like that neutral nude with a little
ping I really think anybody could wear
this shade but they're so smooth they're
so super creamy they remind me a lot of
the Revlon Ultra HD lipsticks which I
love and the potential to have a pretty
glossy finish on your lips too so
they're very very comfortable oh I like
the eye primer too I think that's good
and you're gonna see me using that quite
a bit so thank you guys so much for your
time a little springtime look with some
cool some cool tones let me know what
other brands you'd like to see featured
in this way and I will see you again
real soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
