another week-long makeup related
challenge here on my channel I know a
lot of you enjoyed the singles cruise
and thank you so much to David for
inspiring that challenge and it really
has got me thinking about different
things that I can do like that that
prompt me to dive into different
products in my collection things you
maybe haven't seen me using a whole lot
and just really putting me on the spot
to draw something out and make a look
with it so while I Shadow singles in
that video you know that really
spotlight and how underused they are in
my collection
I really thought the same thing about a
lot of my different quads and trios both
from the drugstore and high-end brands
you know palettes take over and we start
using those for every single look it
seems like so my first thought was I'm
just gonna dump all of my eyeshadow
quads and trios that I don't feel like
I've touched in a long time into a bag
and each day I'll just draw one out and
then I saw it you know I had a lot of
neutrals I thought what if I pull out
the same kind of look every day so if
you want to try that go for it but for a
little bit more entertainment value for
this series and to keep the looks from
all seeming exactly the same I decided
to divide things up for 5 days so 5
different bags that I'll be drawing from
one contains all of the eyeshadow quads
that I would classify as neutrals then
on another day of this challenge I will
draw from my high-end bag so anything
you know kind of outside of that
drugstore price range is in there I also
have a bag full of any colorful quads
and trios that have not been getting
enough love lately I put together a bag
of smokey type quads so just really deep
dark color selection with those and then
I think this last one is going to be
really fun I have a bag full of duds
so quads and trios that I know aren't
very pigmented just are not the best
quality at all and it's going to be my
challenge to make one of those work on
the last day of this so I'm really
excited this is going to be fun I so
enjoyed the singles cruise and I hope
that through this challenge you might be
inspired to try the same thing at home
or just get some inspiration maybe for
some different eye looks hopefully I can
do some interesting things this week
here's the rules I'm going to lay out
for this you have to use every shade in
the quad or trio that you draw out and
just like the single screws you can pull
in any
basis that you want to use like cream
shadow basis you can pull in any liners
any mascaras any false lashes that's all
up to you so I think it's going to be a
really fun week and thank you so much
for watching okay so here we are
starting out on day one I'm gonna start
with my neutral shadows so you know just
kind of let me get warmed up I'll shake
it all up here grab the first thing I
touch and it is from a pond ooh I bet
you guys haven't seen me use this one
and it is a very basic neutral quad here
so we've got mocha latte this is a true
color eyeshadow quad they actually feel
really really smooth to the touch
especially the mattes there's only one
shade with a little bit of shimmer and
that's that kind of bronzy color right
there but this is super basic so it is
the epitome of neutral so my first step
for my neutral quad look I covered my
lids with Milani eyeshadow primer and
then I use my Sigma e25 brush to apply
that medium brown in my crease just to
get a little base color going there I
blended that out and I applied the light
color which might just have a teeny bit
of Sheen I use that up under my brow and
then I decided to use a lot of this rich
dark brown which is really pigmented and
it applies really nicely
I wanted that shade to go all over my
lid into the crease a little bit shape
the outer V just a bit and then I
blended over any harsh edges that I had
there and I went back with the light
shade to just brighten up a bit right
around the innermost corner then I moved
on to my eyeliner I used my Jordana
color Envy black liquid liner in the
shade black Envy just went across my
upper lash line with a little bit of a
wing at the end on my lower inner rim I
used this new makeup geek liner in the
shade nude I just pop that in there for
a little added brightness and then I
smudge the dark brown on the outer part
of my lower lash line and with a pencil
brush I used that bronzy shade with a
little bit of shimmer all across the
rest of my lash line and I decided to
use a really wispy white brush my Sigma
e30 6 with that same shade kind of as a
transition just above my crease and I
curled my lashes I used my covergirl
super sizer mascara on my top lashes and
I use covergirl clump crusher water is
stent on my lower lashes and I chose to
pop on some false lashes as well these
are the salon perfect 615 and the
finished look i think is very wearable
for everyday you know where the false
lashes are skipped the false lashes but
these kinds of colors I think are really
workable for any person any skin tone
and this happened to be I think a really
good really underrated type quad every
shade applied really nicely I think I
might have liked to have seen just a
little bit more intensity out of that
bronzy color it's still pretty but
definitely I think the strength was in
these colors right here and I just
wanted to let you know what else I put
on my face because I started with
Foundation and all that on it everyday
I'll let you know what blush and
highlight and lip color I added in so in
the spirit of throwing back the old
stuff I got this coralista blush out
from benefit and I applied that then a
product I don't think I've talked about
a whole lot my Laura Mercier matte
radiance baked powder I used that for
kind of a subtle highlight but there's
still some glow happening on the cheeks
and then on the lips I went for this
bright kind of pinky coral with the
tarte lipsurgence lip tint in the color
called
elite so that's all over my lips I
really like that color it's kind of a
fresh shade so thanks for watching this
look and I will see you tomorrow 50s day
morning everybody
shaking up my high end shadow bag I'm
just going to draw in and pull out the
first thing and iTouch which is it's a
pallet from the balm and this actually
this is kind of interesting because it's
got three shadows in it it also includes
a blush so I guess that's the blush I'll
be using today as well but it is the
Hawaii face palette it's from that
little auto balm line so see how it
actually looks like a driver's license
it's so cute so it looks like it's going
to be a cool topi deep plum type of look
today and then there's that blush as
usual the balms blushes don't disappoint
that one kind of reminds me of the in
stain blush in the shade called lace a
really bright cool pink so to start off
this look I thought it would be nice to
have kind of a metallic base for that
taupe to exaggerate the shine of the
color even more so I used cruising chic
from ELF it's one of their smudge pots
and I use my small shadow brush with
this lid shade from the little mini
palate and I'd add that all over my lids
really packed it on and I also used this
matte highlighter shade just around my
inner corner to brighten up a bit there
I cleaned off my brush a little bit and
went into this deep dark plum and I
worked that right into the crease
without really getting any of that
shadow on the lid I just wanted the lids
to be their own kind of pop for this
look and I wedged it in there and then I
was careful to just blend around the
edge of that shade with a bear brush
instead of getting on to my lid and
muddying up the two shades I also used
the matte highlight up under my brow and
then I went across my upper lash line
with the Too Faced sketch marker in a
black I just went straight across the
lash line didn't winged anything out and
on my lower lash line I used a dark plum
liner any plum will do but I use the
Smashbox always sharp in 3d orchid and
just applied that to my lower inner rim
and smudged it downward a bit and then I
smudge the matte plum just on top of
that sort of soften that look a little
bit on my upper lashes for mascara after
curling them I used the Laura Geller
style lash intense lengthening mascara
which is okay it's good but not great
for me and then I use my covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant on my lower
lashes and I decided to go without any
falsies today and I really enjoyed the
finished look actually I think this is a
super wearable everyday look with a hint
of smokiness the way I did the lower
lash line but you could definitely
change that if you want to I am wearing
the blush and it's so brightening these
kinds of like bright pink shades they
give such a look of health to the face
and I love that but a very little bit
goes a long way so even though these
this is kind of a mini palette with what
seemed like smaller sized shadows you
definitely have a lot of bang for your
buck with each one and then for my lips
I decided to go kind of nude today I
used this mini studded kits lipstick
from Kat Von D and this is in the shade
what was it I think it was noble yeah so
I applied that all over the lips it's
kind of a pinky nude and then I used my
Too Faced perfect lips in perfect spice
just to kind of add a little definition
a teeny bit of depth on the outside so
that is the Tuesday look I will
you guys tomorrow happy Wednesday
everybody today is colorful day every
quarter trio in this bag has at least
one or two shades that are pretty
colorful in it and since it's in my
rules that I have to use every shade in
the quarter trio I definitely am going
to make this a colorful look so I'm just
going to reach in and grab the first one
I grab it's a Revlon one and this
awesome I'm happy about this this is the
shade wild it's got this bright kind of
matte teal bright orange and then you've
got your shimmery white and like a
shimmery beige as well the shimmers do
have kind of a light weight sort of
flaky texture but those mats I tell you
what very surprising I remember thinking
that the first time I got this as far as
Revlon shadow quads go you know they're
not necessarily the best in the
drugstore but those mats are fantastic
stayed up late watching the Olympics so
the eyes were a little tired here but
but on my Milani eyeshadow primer then I
started off with the sort of beige
Ishimura shade all over my lids really
does not have a lot of impact but lay
that down is kind of a base color then
applied a little bit of the lighter
shade more on the inner part of my lid
and then things get interesting with
this matte orange I just took to the
crease with that with my e25 brush and I
knew I wanted this all over the top part
of the eye and just really sheared out
so that's why I used kind of a medium to
large-sized scree spreche for this step
and I got that really buffed out over
each eye I also just used a sponge tip
to dab a little bit more of that orange
right on the outer part of the lid just
- I don't know create a little bit more
of a flow with that color and then I
also brighten things up a bit more on
the inner part by adding some more of
the white shadows so finishing off the
top part of the eye I applied some black
liquid liner Jordana Keller Envy all
across the upper lash line with a little
bit of a wing at the outside and then
we're kind of color blocking this look
so I've got the blue on the bottom I'm
using this Milani shadow eyes the shade
is called aquatic style and I applied
that to my inner rim as well as the
entire lower lash line as a base and
then I use my little bit deeper teal
shadow with a smudge brush most
on the outer part of the lower lash line
and then I kind of faded in with
whatever's was left on my brush toward
the inside and I just think that gave a
really cool effect but then I curled my
lashes I applied my flower Beauty zoom
in ultimate mascara to my upper and
lower lashes and then I put on my huda
beauty Samantha false lashes to add a
little extra Flair and I think the
finished look is so fun it's definitely
dramatic from a great distance you might
not see you know all the colorful detail
but once you look up close you can tell
yeah there's definitely some brightness
happening there I was really pleased
with the way it turned out considering
you know I haven't always had the best
experience with Revlon shadows so I will
see you tomorrow for a smokey look hey
guys long time no see here for Thursday
this is the new Tuesday Wednesday fourth
day of this challenge and I have my bag
today of smokey eye shadows so I'm just
going to draw in and grab the silent
treatment from wet and wild but there's
a classic that I have not picked up in
so long and I absolutely love this trio
I think you know this is phenomenal
quality there's a really dark shade in
here that is going to make a great
smokey eye and I think this is going to
be able to pull off a Carrie Underwood
smokey eye Samri inspired on Carrie
Underwood's makeup because when I saw
her live at the Grand Ole Opry I'm just
about a week ago I could really tell
like what her makeup was doing in person
it's kind of crazy she had a super dark
like it's kind of her signature thing
smokey eye like it was just dark dark
dark all the way around so I think I can
probably pull that off with this trio
definitely one of my favorites from wet
and wild you've got a peach that really
dark shade and then this pretty taupe
okay Carrie Underwood smokey eye first
thing I did I used a base on my lids as
the balm batter up a stick in the shade
nightgame and I applied that all over my
lids and blended that out with my Real
Techniques shading brush and just got a
nice smooth dark base on there so with
my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush I
padded that color all over the lid a
little bit into the crease and this look
didn't have like a huge shape the look
that kind of inspired me didn't
have some huge outer-v to it so I just
kind of kept it to the shape of my eye
and then I blended a lot around the
outer edges just to soften that up as
much as possible but it's a really dark
shade then I used the light peachy shade
under the brow and just kind of on the
edge of my look to help further soften
things out a little bit and I want to
cross my upper lash line with my Too
Faced Sketch marker in black and then on
my lower inner rim I use Maybelline
master precise skinny in defining black
on the inner rim and also smudged it
down below then I used a little bit more
of my darkest shade in silent treatment
just to kind of blend over that and then
I pulled for the taupe in this trio just
to kind of further soften things up as I
went inward and then I curled my lashes
I applied covergirl super sizer to my
upper lashes clump crusher
water-resistant to the lower lashes
Salon perfect 6:15 czar the false lashes
that I use just kind of nice little
routine there and the finished look is
super deep and dark and I'm very very
happy with it actually this is a look I
might try to bust out more often this is
one of my new makeup geek blushes that I
ordered it's in the shade puppy love so
it's a matte sort of like soft rosy
shade and then carry under what I find
doesn't do a huge glow to her skin a lot
of times she looks really matte so I
just used my Laura Geller baked french
vanilla highlight on top of the cheeks
and then the lip is very very nude I
used Mac Smith lipstick and I blended
with that just kind of on my lips around
the outside
I used my ELF praline and an interesting
thing about Carrie Underwood smokey eyes
you know she will often do a really dark
eye look like this but the whites of her
eyes that her eyes still look extremely
bright and wide open and I do think the
false lashes help with that even though
the lashes may not be standing out as
much as they normally would just because
they've got this dark backdrop something
about that really does still you know
kind of lift open the eyes and keep you
looking wide awake despite a lot of
darkness so just a little tip there
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you for my last look tomorrow
all right guys TGIF I've got my last bag
but this may be the hardest day
because everything in here is something
I feel is a dud it's a quad or a trio
that lacks pigmentation it might just be
flaky the colors don't show up the
texture seems off with the product but
something I still had in my collection
so I'm going to try to make it work I
might add in certain bases or liners or
do whatever I have to do to dress these
up and make them look good so I'm going
to go ahead and dip in here and by the
way the reason why I'm just grabbing the
first thing I touch and not really
rummaging around is because I don't want
to feel around and like identify the way
a certain thing feels and know what I'm
getting you know because I am pretty
familiar with most of these things so
I'm just gonna grab it and oh lovely
this is that no this is not a good one
this is from Maybelline it's called
sandstone shimmer get everything in this
quad was pigmented I would love this
because I gets a really pretty and kind
of unique color selection but seriously
look at that
gold where are you did you come out to
play today I mean the only saving grace
if the squad might be this dark shade
right here but I'm going to have to use
all the colors and make it work well I
think the best way to get impact out of
a shade outside of just using an
eyeshadow primer is to use a
coordinating colored base so I'm using
this caviar stick from Laura Mercier and
copper all over both of the lids used a
little brush to kind of blend that out a
bit but it really should help this gold
pop a bit more and that is what I found
I used just used the sponge tip
applicator with that shade and it was so
so weak without any kind of base so this
helped a lot and then I continued on the
outer part of the lid patting on that
burgundy shade which was also pretty
weak and flaky but you'll notice it
stands out much more on top of this base
and I decided to use a fluffy brush with
that Burgundy and just blended that up
into my crease blend it around the edges
and use the white up under the brow
which again kind of a sheer shade but I
don't mind it being sheer in this
capacity as a brow bone highlight and
then I just wanted to deepen up my outer
corner with some of that dark brown
which is actually a decent shadow and I
had three
way back to my essence of beauty fine
crease brush to just apply that right to
the outer part of my crease across the
upper lash line I tried a brown liquid
liner this is the Too Faced sketch
marker in deep espresso and so I just
went all the way across and winged it
out and then on the lower lash line I
used this deep Brown from soap &amp;amp; Glory
and just got that in my inner rim and
also smudged a little bit below to top
that off I used my smudge brush with a
little bit of the brown shadow and then
decided I needed a little bit more base
color so I brought in the caviar stick
for the rest of the lower lash line and
then kind of faded gold back into
Burgundy just to give a little bit of a
shimmery pop down there I curled my
lashes I applied my super sizer mascara
to my top lashes my covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant to the lower
lashes and then I popped on these false
lashes from kiss which are kind of
fluttery and pretty but not too too
intense and I really hope I did you guys
proud with the finished look it's very
fall-like I really like that about it
and I just did the best I could with the
shadows given again if you weren't using
a base you would just have a lot of
flakiness and frustration and I did
still feel like I was packing on the
color quite a bit on top of the base but
you know the finished result is totally
workable still not a product that would
wholeheartedly recommend but if some of
you are sitting around with Maybelline
sandstone shimmer and you want an idea
of how to use it there you go
I used this great blush from NARS that
I've had for quite some time it's Dolce
Vita and I just think that's a really
pretty kind of berry reddish blush and
then I used my Laura Geller gilded honey
highlight that's what's giving you the
nice glow on top of the cheeks and then
on the lips
I use some Charlotte Tilbury Bond girl
and plus I blended in a little bit of my
ELF matte lip color in praline which i
think was kind of a mixer shade from
yesterday's look and it made it a little
bit deeper brownish just a little dark
so thank you guys so much for watching
this five day challenge I really
encourage you to try something similar
at home if you feel like you've got a
bunch of quads and trios that have just
not been getting enough love lately just
toss them into a bag you know pull one
out and force yourself to kind of be
creative and come up with some sort of
look with it
and for me just thinking back to all
these looks most of the shadows I pulled
out I actually did like you know that
Avon neutral quad was really nice from
day one
I enjoyed the auto bomb palette that I
used from the bomb and then we got into
that colorful day with the Revlon
Colorstay quad and I actually really
enjoyed the way that one turned out I
knew silent-treatment there's a classic
you know again things that are great but
I haven't been reaching for and then the
sandstone shimmer I mean that might have
ended up being one of my favorite looks
just as I really like the tones but not
the easiest to work with but we made it
go so you rediscover some things you get
surprised about some things and it's
kind of refreshing you know in a makeup
world where there's always something new
coming out so thank you guys again so
much I love that you're always so
supportive of different ideas original
video ideas and you make doing things
like this fun so thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
