foundations that don't look like
foundation and by that I mean I think we
all have a vision in our head when we
think of a cakey thick foundation just
we have a vision of what that would look
like on our skin right
and I think all of these foundations
that I'm going to recommend in this
video have a tendency toward looking
really natural they all have the
capability of being worn in a very
lightweight manner but can be built up
for a little more coverage if you like
it that way I've got a variety of
formats to talk about a variety of price
ranges as well but I just feel like it's
that time of year where if you are
thinking about kind of switching up your
makeup routine going with something that
just feels less like makeup on your skin
and looks less like makeup these would
be some good ones to think about and
just a couple of factors real quick that
I think it can help your foundation not
look like foundation would be to keep it
light figure out you know through a
little trial and error for yourself what
is the bare minimum of this product that
I can get by with on my face and still
get coverage that I want but keep it
really really light and I think that
helps sustain power so much as well it
might be a little counter into it if you
think oh gosh I'm going to got a big day
today I'm going to apply extra
foundation that way it lasts longer but
really I think it's more likely to wear
in a patchy type way if you apply a
really thick amount trust me I have
experienced that time and time again on
myself and going for a really thin even
application is really the way to go
there also um keep powder minimal you
could totally you know screw the whole
idea of a natural-looking foundation
that doesn't look like foundation by
loading on a ton of powder on top so I
just go for powder where I think I
really need it so a little light weight
powder in the t-zone and keep in mind
you may be putting a bunch of other
powder products on your face anyway like
a powder blush maybe a powder bronzer or
a powder contour or about or highlight
so try to keep just face powders that
can sometimes look a little bit cakey on
top of foundation keep those really
light also for pretty much anything I'm
recommending here today if you want
maximum coverage go with a dense type
found a
and brush I love my Sigma f80 I'm also
holding the F 84 here I think those do a
nice job of kind of getting the most
bang for your buck just coverage wise
out of these but if you want to keep it
light or at least make it more of a slow
build with these foundations in terms of
coverage a dampened blender sponge
whether it's this Real Techniques sponge
a classic Beauty Blender or some other
knockoff that you really like a dampened
sponge I think can kind of shear out the
foundation I think you can still build
to a nice coverage level but you might
feel like you have a little more control
in that process with a sponge as I go
through these foundations I'm going to
go probably from lightest to most
coverage so just keep that in mind first
one I want to recommend for a foundation
that doesn't look like foundation is
this Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup this is probably of everything I
mentioned this is the one that goes
furthest back in terms of my use and
I've always liked this foundation but I
find it really tends to work its way in
during you know the hotter months and
it's just a thin lightweight foundation
looks really natural on the skin I wear
it in the shade natural beige I'm
actually wearing it today with just a
little concealer in certain places where
I need it and a light amount of powder
where I think I need it this does
contain broad-spectrum SPF 20 thin
lightweight coverage once you've got it
on you got it all blended in it really
doesn't look like a bunch of foundation
sitting on your skin so I think this is
a great option I know a lot of people
with sensitive skin have had good luck
with this foundation now if you're
wanting a little more luminosity and I
think these two that I'm going to talk
about have the potential to be like the
thinnest lightest weight that I'm going
to talk about but they can also build to
a pretty impressive coverage level too
I'd mentioned these in my cushion video
but it's my L'Oreal Lumi cushion and I
also find it to be very very similar to
the Lancome miracle cushion so both of
these on my skin I think have a very
similar effect they're going to be a
little more glowy than the Neutrogena
but I think it's a natural glow these I
think are very wearable they're really
easy you know you can pop a brush like
one of these more dense brushes into it
for your application and
that coverage just instantly or I think
you can build it up a bit more slowly
with a Beautyblender that works really
nicely too and definitely check out my
cushioned video for a lot of details but
basically this is how these work there
is a cushion inside that it's completely
it's kind of like a sponge that's been
totally saturated with foundation some
people love this concept some people say
just give me the bottle of foundation
maybe they see it as a better value or a
little bit more sanitary approach to do
it that way if you're working with clean
brushes and sponges and you're just
using this for yourself it's probably
not too big of a deal I've just found it
really interesting how these can be the
thinnest of the thin foundations you
know you can apply them in just an
incredibly light weight but at the same
time if you choose to build up more it
still looks natural so this is the
Lancome here as well I mean if it comes
right down to it I would just go for
this one because it's less expensive but
if you're a fan of Lancome products and
you know you're just thinking about
curious about whether or not this is
good I think it's awesome but they both
perform very very similarly for me but
like I said a little more glow to them
than the Neutrogena but not in a
speckles of glitter type of way it's
very natural next up I've got a couple
of liquid foundations that I think give
me a very similar effect on the skin
they're kind of similar formulas one's a
little more thin than the other so first
I want to mention the Shea Moisture
weightless Shea serum foundation I love
this stuff I think this is a really
amazing coverage for a foundation that
is so thin and lightweight and I've got
this in the shade nude and it does have
a nice little pump style dispenser here
again fuller coverage with a brush
lighter coverage with a damp sponge and
talking about skin types with these
foundations I don't think any skin type
should really be alienated from trying
any of these because if you are going
with the mentality of keeping it like
keeping it as thin as possible I could
see an oily skin person wearing this and
maybe just making a bit more of a point
to set the t-zone
and a drier skin person could wear these
and maybe just leave them as is no
setting powder and really enjoy the look
of them too but I
you feel like the shea moisture offers
that little extra moisture to the skin
it's not tacky and sticky on there but
it's just a really fascinating effect
like I said thin thin thin lightweight
but yet coverage and a little added
moisture it's really cool and then
another foundation that I feel like I
get a really similar look from although
it might not be quite as thin is this
Fiona Styles luminous finish foundation
concentrate and this I have in the shade
zero for packaging on this stuff this
line is so cool I got to say but it's
interesting because this particular cap
like it only fits on a certain way due
to this little notch right here so I've
spent some time messing with that but
really pretty bottle got the pump
dispenser as well reason why I love pump
so much is when you do figure out okay
this is my ideal thin lightweight amount
of foundation for my natural look you
know you can keep repeating it and be
consistent with it every time and this
while it says luminous finish again it's
not an outrageously luminous finish it's
not something that you put on your skin
and you don't look like skin it just
looks like healthy skin really similar
coverage to my Shea Moisture and it's
still thin and lightweight while just
being a teeny bit thicker than this but
with both of these I feel like I can get
nearly full coverage and we're talking
about really natural doesn't look like
foundation foundations that's saying a
lot for something to be able to achieve
that so I've been enjoying this so much
and you know play around with the
different methods of applying it I feel
like I like the dampened Beauty Blender
with this most just for the most natural
finish and then a couple other things I
want to throw out there and the elf
moisturizing foundation Stix these I
think maybe the most like overlooked
underrated if you're an elf snob and
you're hearing me pull out elf right now
and you're rolling your eyes or they go
I'm never going to use elf stuff this
would be the elf item that might
surprise you the most for what great
quality it does have these stick
foundations can pack a lot of coverage
that's why I'm mentioning these last in
the scope of what I'm talking about but
they can also be really sheared out and
just look so nice and natural I remember
trying these when they
initially launched this would have been
at least several years ago and I
remember them having kind of an odd
scent and it really did sort of turn me
off from wanting to use them all the
time so I more recently repurchase them
there is no scent I'm holding to because
there is one that I use that's kind of a
little bit my skin tone or maybe just
verging on a little lighter and that's
the shade called nude and I've also got
shade I can contour with and this is in
the color almond and it's actually kind
of like cream bronzer I feel because
it's a little warmer maybe than a lot of
contour shades I might use but I love
blending these in with a Beauty Blender
I think that's the great way to thin it
out and get a really natural look if you
want these to be your primary source of
coverage what I would first do for
myself is take like a peachy corrector
and get that under-eye area taken care
of and then just apply these over the
larger parts of my skin where I want
them to be so like I really want
coverage here boom-boom-boom maybe I'll
take it down the nose and on the
forehead and then dab over it for
coverage I really like to apply the
lighter part first get it fully blended
in and then if I want to do the darker
tone I can blend that in afterward a
little bit of depth in the cheekbone if
I'm feeling like it that day you don't
have to use this is kind of like the
accessory like little extra and I just
love the effect that these give I don't
feel like these have any like artificial
luminosity in them but it's just all
about the texture the way they blend out
I feel like they look very very natural
and skin like so hopefully this video
gives you some ideas if you're thinking
about kind of reworking your foundation
routine for the warmer months you know
what works well what really doesn't look
like foundation but just looks like you
have really great skin these I think are
some awesome options again lightest
weight being somewhere between these two
this is a little bit buildable but I
think it stays pretty lightweight anyway
you go as far as the healthy skin
foundation
these can be just incredibly light
because it's such a thin liquid that's
in these compacts but they can be built
up quite a bit getting a little more
coverage out of these liquids and then
you know the sticks are kind of the wild
card that could be combined with any
foundation worn
oan they can be very full coverage they
can also be very thinned out coverage so
thank you guys so much for spending time
with me today I really appreciate it and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
