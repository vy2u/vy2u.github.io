going to talk about a little bit of a
skin issue that I have been dealing with
really probably over the past couple of
years and it basically amounts to some
major skin discoloration I'm talking
about melasma this has also been called
mask of pregnancy but I think this video
will be useful for anybody who deals
with any sort of skin discoloration
maybe it's sunspots or redness or just
any issues that they really need to
cover a video is going to show you a
couple of different full coverage
strategies to cover those problem areas
not just lighten them not just kind of
go over them and lessen the appearance
but actually completely cover up the
problem that's what I've been on a
mission to accomplish lately with my
melasma and I mean I've been testing a
lot of different products seeing what
works best what doesn't what actually
looks good and lasts a long time
throughout the day like so many factors
and so after a lot of trial and error I
feel ready to bring you my strategy I do
want to talk a little bit about melasma
aka mask of pregnancy this may be
something you are familiar with or maybe
you're not I was kind of surprised to
find out after I did a little research
that some like 45 to 50 million people
around the world deal with this it's
primarily women and it can be brought
about for different reasons for me I've
dealt with it from a hormonal standpoint
I guess it started creeping up on me in
the past couple of years and it began
when I was on birth control pills it
didn't happen the entire time I've been
on the pill but just like I said within
the past couple of years I started to
notice some kind of dark beige can
looking spots and they were showing up I
remember at first on this eye like right
on top of my cheekbone here kind of
under my eye I started to see that and
at first I didn't even know what it was
I just thought it was like a sunspot and
so I you know just went ahead and
covered that up like I would cover my
under eye circles and it was pretty
light and not super noticeable
over time it's spread a little bit it's
deepened some and that's been happening
during my pregnancy that's the like
internal hormonal change that can bring
this on in some people really notice
that coming on especially probably in
the second trimester of pregnancy and
now into the third like these dark
almost patchy looking areas right there
on top of my cheekbones and this is not
the only place women can deal with
melasma some people I've heard about
having this on their upper lip their
chin down the sides of their cheeks
forehead it can really show up anywhere
but for me it's been kind of confined to
the area on the tops of my cheekbones
very much the area you want to have the
reverse effect on you know you want to
brighten and highlight that area that's
where I'm dealing with my darkness heard
melasma can have some genetic ties and
that makes sense to me because my mom
dealt with this throughout her
pregnancies and she said it faded after
giving birth I don't know fingers
crossed maybe that'll happen for me too
whatever the case may be it has been
something that I've been working to
cover up and it's something that I've
actually you know felt kind of
self-conscious about doing YouTube
videos I mean from time to time I show
my bare face and I'm doing a makeup
application and I remember in a video
not too long ago you could see some of
the spots that I was you know in the
process of covering up and somebody made
a comment in the comments section like
you look like you've been punched in the
eye maybe you need to work out some
personal problems or something and I
just remembered feeling so like like it
kind of knocked the wind enemies for a
second and I just thought oh my gosh I
feel well first off I feel really
self-conscious now and I also feel
really misunderstood you know because
this is this is something that I think
it's common yet it's not common I think
while there are a lot of women dealing
with melasma there are a lot of people
who have no idea what it is and would
not know it if they saw it you know like
I said going throughout pregnancy it's
gotten a little more intense and by the
way this is nothing I can feel this is
nothing that has any sort of sensation
on my skin it's purely just you know the
coloring that my skin is taking on in
that area and I guess that comment kind
of got stuck in my head and it may be a
little bit scared to bear it all you
know I felt weird I felt
Efren and now I guess I've kind of
gotten over that too long ago on beauty
broadcast live someone was asking about
skin changes due to pregnancy and I just
started talking about the fact that
melasma has been the thing that I've
been dealing with and you know some
people have breakouts some people get
dry skin and elsewhere on their bodies
you know maybe stretch marks and all
kinds of other symptoms I haven't even
really dealt with any morning sickness
but this has been my symptom of
pregnancy and I'm not complaining about
it this is such a blessing to be in this
state I wouldn't change it for anything
but yet I am a total makeup nerd and I
am compelled to find the best way to
cover it up and deal with it and I feel
just kind of empowered knowing that I
can you know deal with this
discoloration that's on my face since
talking about it a lot of people kind of
came out of the woodwork and said hey
I'd love to see a video on how you cover
this up you know I'm dealing with the
very same issue and it was so many more
people than I even realized so I thought
heck you know I'll swallow my
insecurities I'll be vulnerable I'll
show my stripes as I lovingly call them
and show some of the ways that I've been
working on to cover them up wasn't
really my goal to make this video some
big huge personal story but I just
wanted you to know where I'm coming from
why I'm dealing with this and what I've
been doing about as far as the makeup
side of things and dealing with this
there are some tips that I've learned
that I'd like to share just some kind of
do's and don'ts first off heavy layers
of product is not the answer like you
may be tempted to just keep piling on
and building and building and building
with whatever existing makeup you have
that may be used to work for you but now
it doesn't really cover so much so you
just keep adding more and more that
seems to create its own set of problems
you know it will exaggerate the look of
lines maybe if you're covering melasma
in the same area I am we have tend to
have some fine lines around our eye area
and just too much product too many thick
layers of makeup it's not a good look
so you want to steer clear of that and I
have a strategy to help with that but
also don't go to light in tone to
overcorrect can be tempting to just go
with a really light
skintone product thinking that's really
going to cover it up but what I find
ends up happening with melasma dark
spots your lighter skin tone concealers
may lighten your problem but they won't
cover it up it will simply take on a
different tone so that goes for
foundations or concealers don't go to
line another note that I made for myself
I was working on this last night and but
be careful not to over blend your
concealers or your foundations in the
areas where you're covering up your
melasma sometimes you can be totally on
the right track to getting it covered up
but you kind of rub your brush over the
area too much or too frequently and then
what do you know you're seeing through
to the problem again this pertains to
the order you apply your products in I
like to start with the foundation and
then go in with my concealers or any
kind of brightening products another tip
is just always wear SPF sun exposure can
really deepen your melasma if I haven't
been diligent enough to like reapply
sunscreen on my face if I'm out being
outdoors for a long time can get darker
it can look more intense with sun
exposure so just keep that in mind now I
want to show you some products and
strategies for actually covering up the
melasma and the first one is using a
really full-coverage foundation
so I've moisturize my skin I have a
primer on you can really do whatever you
prefer where that's concerned but for
foundation I'm using the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum cover and it's
camouflage makeup for face and body it
does have SPF 15 in it but this is
definitely a different texture from
regular double which being a face and
body foundation I find that it really
does slip over the skin very easily it
spreads really easy but I have this in
zero five creamy tan I usually use about
a pearl sized amount of this product and
one key is to not use too much and I
just start out by spreading it all over
my face just really roughly this is what
I do with a lot of foundations like make
sure and really target it on those areas
that I need it most and then just kind
of spread the remnants elsewhere and
this foundation
to feel like it can come off a little
bit heavier looking on the skin
sometimes like hours into the wear of
the day I feel like I can see it more
but that's not usually an issue if I'm
really conscious of not using more than
that small pearl sized amount so I've
spread that everywhere and then this is
my sigma f84 brush it's an angled kabuki
brush over those areas where I'm dealing
with the melasma I am not really
hardcore buffing this in but I'm more so
just stippling over it
that pressing motion really will still
blend the foundation into the skin and
then other areas I'm a little more
vigorous with it because there's not
quite that unevenness that I'm battling
elsewhere just blending in all over the
rest of my face you don't want to let
this sit too long before you start
blending it in because it will set and
it is very long wearing but just really
get that the rest of it up into your
hairline everywhere it needs to go as
you can see that totally covered up the
melasma and that's just a foundation
that I've used there it's really the
only foundation that I've found so far
that I can just pick up put on and it
really covers the issue I don't feel
like I've got any thick layers on my
face I've just got one layer of really
good coverage one additional step that I
do like to do not for coverage but just
for brightening I'll bring in a
brightening type concealer and this is
the maybelline instant age rewind and
fair there are tons of brightening
concealers out there any of those could
work but if I want that more highlighted
effect and also to get right in here you
know I'm not really needing heavy
coverage for dark under-eye circles but
I do like the added brightness and then
you can go on and take this up on top of
your cheekbones a bit and then I'm just
using my p84 which is the baby version
of that foundation brush I was using and
this just allows me to get right in
there
get right around the eye and I can you
can see how it's making that even
brighter than the foundation was able to
because the foundation was all about
just pure coverage I mean you need to be
really careful about is as you're going
over any
melasma areas again stipple do not rub
back and forth or you will start to rub
that coverage away that you had to begin
with so just be very careful and use a
patting motion you could go ahead and
follow this up with any face steps that
you like I don't find that this
particular foundation even needs much
powder over either but if you like a
little setting powder maybe over your
t-zone you know you get really oily you
go ahead and do that
do your bronzer and your blush now if
you want to just spot conceal your
problem areas here are some tips and
tricks and a tutorial for dealing with
that all right so on this day that I'm
shooting this I've already applied my
moisturizer and primer and also a light
to medium coverage foundation I have on
the Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup I think this is pretty
representative of the effect that I get
on my skin when I apply the average
foundation all over it's not super full
coverage and as you can see I can still
see those marks of melasma still coming
through so I wanted to share this spot
concealing method if you do want you
know a lighter weight coverage all over
the rest of your face or maybe you're
just loaded down with different
foundations you want to use up and you'd
really rather just target you know your
area of melasma maybe it's just a really
small area like I said mine started
about this big and it was not a huge
deal to cover up and I wouldn't have
needed to really rely on full coverage
all over just to take care of that if
your melasma takes up a really large
surface area of your skin this may be a
little bit more of a tedious process
compared to just you know taking a full
coverage foundation and getting that all
over I just wanted to give you a
different strategy some different things
to think about and whether you are
dealing with really dark circles just
general sunspots or dark patches of
melasma like I have I think a peachy
salmony toned concealer is the best
thing to cover this stuff up because I
don't feel like it simply lightens the
problem area it actually camouflages is
so I've got a few recommendations for
this kind of concealer first off benefit
erase paste I have this in number two
medium
great example of the tone that I'm
talking about and this is probably of
the three I'm going to recommend this is
the most like moisturizing this has a
lot of hydration in it if you're
especially dry in your under-eye area
this may be something that you want to
you know work in as you're concealing
about these three that I'm going to
recommend it's the very similar tone and
coverage level but different
consistencies and this other one is
Bobby Brown's corrector and the shade is
called bisque and this is still you know
a nice creamy concealer but it's not
quite as heavy on the skin as erase
paste and finally for a slightly lower
cost option there's something from pixie
this is a brand available at Target
called the correction concentrate and
brightening peach reminds me a lot of
bisque I mean as you can see as we
compare all these color tones this is
the kind of peach I'm talking about if
it's a lot lighter than this it's
probably not going to do the corrective
job we're after all of these concealers
have a decent amount of creaminess so
what I like to do is apply them actually
with my finger and I just start going
over the area that I'm trying to cover
up here I also because these work so
well around the eye area and any
darkness I go ahead and work this right
up to the lower lash line you know that
inner dark crevice that we all get right
in here's I've got that kind of roughly
layered on I start dabbing in with my
finger and the warmth of my finger helps
the product start to melt right into the
skin and you'll notice I'm just patting
I'm not really rubbing I'm not pulling
at the skin at all it's very buildable
I'm not getting much on my finger
whenever I tap back into this I just get
a tiny tiny amount of product on here it
does not take much and just keep
building it up and there you go you've
got one side of the face completely
concealed and then this side you can
still see the problem and I'm going to
go on and show you one other thing that
I like to do to top this off and that is
to apply a very lightweight amount of a
setting powder I'm using my bare
minerals summer bisque this is a
full-coverage type of concealer powder
and
I use Smashbox number ten brush but any
brush that you think is like maybe a
really jumbo brush for the eye area
like something too large for your crease
you can definitely use it with this
powder and I think it helps me get just
the right amount of product it doesn't
pack on too much like maybe a flat brush
would but it just gives me that light
dusting and I just go over the entire
under eye area lightly with something
like this have tried comparable products
from elf elf makes some mineral setting
powders that work nicely they don't
really add so much coverage but I think
what you really want to do primarily is
just kind of modify that area and just
make it look extra perfect I hope this
video gives you some tips and tricks for
any discoloration you might be dealing
with whether it's melasma like me
sunspots hyperpigmentation redness my
hope that just having some strategies in
your hip pocket to deal with this
whenever you might want to or need to
you'll help you feel a little more
empowered and just a little more
confidence so let me know if you have
any questions or if you have any tips of
your own to share that would be awesome
let us all know in the comments section
and I'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
