tuning in I am doing this video because
I'm honestly like I'm a little bit
ticked because I was talking about this
it girl palette from Ulta right and I
had been totally stocking QVC's website
to see if they were going to do a most
wished for palette again this year last
year it looked like this and it had like
all these little pull out things and it
was just loaded with it cosmetics
goodness everywhere you turn
and I just gouged one there I thought
are they gonna do that again this year I
was waiting for it waiting for it and I
thought well maybe I guess not and then
just this past week they put out the it
girl Beauty book yes I still stand by my
recommendation of this palette from Ulta
which contains 10 hi shad O's and a
blush but this thing is really gonna be
major major multitasking here it's an
actual just fold-out Beauty book the
packaging design I think is better than
years past but it's a little different
in terms of what you're getting but I
created my whole face with it with the
addition of only three other products so
let's take a look
hey guys gonna jump into that beauty
book in a second but I'm going to start
off just getting my coverage on my face
with a foundation or a foundation II
type product I'm gonna use my CC cream
here and medium this is just kind of
like in the spirit of it cosmetic also
this is saving me the step of using a
separate moisturizer too so it's
coverage and moisturizer in one so you
know when I think about multitasking I
just really get on a roll and then this
is just my um tarte brush from that
holiday so the one that i really liked
is the one from sephora get this all
blended right quick
now I'm going to open the beauty book to
the first page if you will and I've got
my correctors up here I've got fair -
light medium and tan rich and these are
the bye-bye under-eye correctors so I'm
going to start off by mostly using the
fair - light shade and I'm gonna just
start dabbing this around like my
darkest areas it's really an amazing
thing that they've got that included in
a palette like this but real quick mid
blend here I do want to show you
something I have the bye-bye under-eye
full size corrector in medium and it is
a little different tone I feel like I
discussed this last year with the
palette but this is the full size
corrector right here and then this is
the medium that's included in this
palette so the actual corrector seems to
have a little more peach and in the
palette it's a bit more yellow and I
still find these to be corrective in the
palette but as you know it's just a
slightly different tone and I am going
to blend in a little bit of the medium
just in certain areas where I know I've
got a few like little dark spots or just
a little melasma still when you kind of
tackle that with a slightly deeper shade
it's amazing how much better it can
conceal and camouflage and then I'm also
gonna use the light shade like in areas
where I might want to brighten a bit
more and then I'm just taking this other
tart brush and I'm gonna blend that out
it's very easy to blend like it's a nice
consistency that's not identical to
benefit erased paste but it's I would
say it's in the ballpark you know if you
feel like a lot of concealers you use
maybe liquid concealers that you grab
for tend to have a big dry down on you
and that's too much for your skin to
handle this is definitely gonna feel
creamier than stuff like that there is a
nice richness to these concealers and I
wouldn't be concerned about them drying
out either in this format because my
concealers that were in last year's
palette are doing just fine since there
is no bronzer in this particular palette
I found that I can use this tan
rich color of corrector and yep I can
contour with that and take it just a
little bit around my hairline up here
seriously it's so easy you don't have to
be careful with it and then you just
take a small like contour brush get that
all blended in
and you know if I wanted to get
SuperDuper serious about the
multitasking nature of this palette I
could probably just moisturize first and
even skip the CC cream and really go
headfirst into these correctors and just
use that like foundation because I could
probably be satisfied with the coverage
I would get just doing it that way the
next thing I'm going to do is use the
bye-bye pores pressed the translucent
powder here quite a big pan just dab
over my under-eye and you know I find
that it kind of sets that area without
too much thickness of product you know
like this eye that I've just set in
comparison to the feel of this one this
one still feels just a bit tacky this
feels a little more smooth I did notice
a difference between the texture of the
bye-bye pores pressed in this palette
and the one in last year's last year's
just like a little more soft I'm not
saying I can't like swatch some of this
up on my finger and you can still see
the powder but look at this in last
year's palette if I take a swatch of it
like a lot comes off it just seems like
a softer powder it's like maybe it's
just pressed a little harder in this one
or maybe they've changed the formula a
little bit since I'm not sure I think I
still end up with the same effect but
just so you know to get the amount that
I'm wanting or to get the effect that
I'm wanting on my skin I'll take my
brush in here and kind of a little bit
and I'm not feeling like I really need
to powder up the skin big-time
everywhere but I do hit my t-zone in the
under eye then we've got a cream
highlight here which is really really
gorgeous and it's very easy to just dab
this right on the top of your cheek here
I kind of like to just use my finger
actually with it like it's very very
easy to blend and it doesn't stay too
tacky on the skin I mean you could use a
boatload of it and you could probably
succeed in making it feel tacky but just
a little bit like look super dewy and
pretty and do I need that much of it
like look how much space they devoted to
it I would have taken maybe some larger
sized correctors instead of having quite
that large of a thing of cream highlight
but that's just me this shade they
actually say is called inner light and
it's very like subtle but it is glowing
your
it's not gonna look all cakey but a
little trick that I learned the other
day if you want a powder highlight there
is one in this palette it's over in the
eyeshadows and it's the shade called
kindness so I'm going to use a little
bit of that for you right now just to
show that this works
especially when you go on top of the
cream it really clings there and I was
just kind of like working on this side
of the palette at first and I realized
oh I haven't done my blush yet I
normally would do blush before highlight
but that's fine there's a blush in here
a really big one an ombre blush called
naturally pretty and in comparison to
the one that they're giving you in the
Ulta palette this is a little less coral
and a little more on the pink side so
I'm gonna swirl that and I'm just
tapping into it by the way kind of
toward the bottom
it's blush top to bottom I wouldn't
consider the top part of that even
though that looks lighter I wouldn't
call that a highlight but you can you
know apply it however you wish if you
work in a little bit more of the top
part you might get a little more glow in
your blush and a little bit lighter
shade but I think that's very pretty I
think that was a good choice to include
and color wise in this palette so there
we are our CC cream and only face stuff
from this palette we were able to use
you know the translucent powder the
cream highlight all of the correctors
and various ways the blush and eyeshadow
that can be a powder highlight if that's
what you prefer now at this point I
would go in and do my brows and there
isn't anything specifically labeled brow
but I am pretty sure that I can get away
with using this color called delight in
my brows and maybe at times I could use
the dark brown superhero liner the only
tough part about this palette is if you
are do you'll see how pretty the sky
looks back there oh my gosh I love that
and have the only tricky thing about
this palette is if you do do beauty
videos it's in your window hold it up to
your camera you got this kind of
flopping out but in a general sense like
it lays out very nicely just across your
lap or on your table or dress or
whatever but I'm going to use to light
here with my angled brow brush
and yeah I think the shade can work for
me
one outside product that I feel I just
really want to pull in here because I
always use eye primer my Milani
eyeshadow primer
now in the little booklet it says we've
got superhero eyeshadows and we've got
naturally pretty eyeshadows the
superhero ones are the eye foundation
that's up top and then these are labeled
superhero liners here at the bottom the
really dark brown and the black and then
everything in the middle are different
naturally pretty eyeshadows so we've got
one two three four mats and then a
couple of more metallic ones and then I
would say this one this one and this one
down here are more of a just a soft
shimmer but just a little thing that I
noticed here I really expected that big
heart the one in the center and treasure
would be like the exact same feel and
just texture because here in person they
just look like the same level of
metallic but treasure is a lot stronger
shape than big heart this is treasure
this is big heart in a concentrated
swatch they might look similar but I
just can't make big heart apply like
really full-on on the eyes and so I was
kind of bummed about that because it's
sort of this Mavi burgundy color and I
love that kind of shade and I was
disappointed that it was a little bit on
the weak side however when I used it
instead as a shadow that I could just
buff out like on the outer edge at the
look it looked really really pretty that
way so I don't know kind of a bad news
good news situation with that color I
suppose and on the whole I think we've
got some really nice shades to work with
so I am first going to use a little bit
of loyal which is this matte kind of
peachy beige it's one of those colors
that like at a glance you think oh
that's really light but look how at
least on my skin tone it functions is a
really nice natural crease color I'm
going to work in some delight that's the
shade I was using in my brows
if you're familiar with the naturally
pretty eyes shadow formula they are I
think some of the easiest shadows to
blend if you're like me and you kind of
get to this no-man's land part of the
inner part of your crease I'm gonna go
back and forth with the eye Foundation
as my friend David would probably advise
here because this is almost like
skintone powder and kind of use that
back and forth with your shadows to help
that area look nice and buff down and
then I'm going to use a little bit of
that and a little dab of the shimmery
shade as a highlight under the brow and
I want to use some treasure which is
this pretty like bronzy shade and I get
some of that going on my lid
this could be a quick one shadow look
actually just using this shade buy one
shadow look I mean putting it on your
lid grabbing a different brush that's
gonna diffuse it up into your crease a
little bit that would work fine I think
and then let's use a little bit of
kindness we all need a little bit of
kindness I'm gonna put that around my
inner corner that is a really nice shape
like there's a reason why that totally
popped on my cheeks and I was using it
as a highlight then I haven't used
passion yet and passion is this nice
navy blue and back in the day in case
you didn't get enough reminiscing in my
last video that I did wow that's really
pigmented I remember in my early days
how Smashbox had put out like these kits
for different eye colors and there were
a lot of brands at the time seeming to
be kind of obsessed about putting out
certain certain shadow products catering
to your eye color and the thing that
they put out for brown eyes tended to
incorporate blue or Navy and navy liners
and like a dark blue shadow maybe and I
always thought yeah those that color
works really well on me but these days
it's not often a shade that I work into
my eye looks there's no real reason why
not though I mean this palette that's
give you that nice wearable dark navy I
like it because it's deep without
loosing its actual color because that's
the problem sometimes with some palettes
like I noticed this in one at arts
holiday palettes they put in some really
really deep colors and they were so dark
they just looked dark on the eyes you
couldn't see like it was a blue or teal
or whatever dabbing just a bit more
bronze on the lid because when I blended
it I sort of blended some away I was
talking about what the center shade here
called big heart
this Mavi shimmer doesn't pack on as
well as I would like on the lid but it
makes a really pretty kind of blended
out type of shade around like my outer V
in this area here just a little splash
of mauve it's pretty it's so pretty like
that my friends I do believe I'm
creating a bit of a smoky eye here I'm
gonna go into this superhero liner this
is the one called superhero this other
one the dark brown is called sole I'm
just gonna take that dark liner until I
got this palette it had been quite some
time since I had lined my eyes with
powder I just try to keep it in really
really close to my lash line and it's
nice and intense it's really pretty easy
makes your lash line look a little
thicker like it just a quick step you
can take and frankly I think you could
line with that navy blue as well or even
this like kind of shimmery plummy gray
then I think I will use a little bit of
this generous shade right here I'll get
a little bit of that smudging this is
just my e21 smudge brush from sigma
smudge a little bit of that down here
and something I haven't really addressed
yet is the fact that this palette does
not contain brushes or applicators and
the one last year did however it was
kind of a non-factor for me I thought
they were just kind of taking up space I
wasn't really using them it was just
like okay let's throw in some
applicators but it wasn't like any sort
of brush that it cosmetics actually
makes you know they kind of pride
themselves on really nice soft wonderful
brushes and then they just throw in some
cheapos into a palette not that they're
entirely unusable but really you know it
wasn't totally necessary like I think a
lot of people that get something like
this sort of understand that they're
gonna probably reach for some of their
own brushes and then I'm going to
continue on with the bronze I'm gonna
just pop a little bit of that here blend
it in with that other shades just gonna
look kind of dark and murky but that's
okay
then I'm going to curl my lashes and I'm
going to just apply a little bit of
voluminous lash arid ice real quick
now for lips right here you're getting
six different shades of the blurred
lines lipstick
you've got naturally pretty which is
just this nice like kind of your lips
but better type shade kisses is sort of
a bubble gummy pink and I thought that
was kind of a funny choice for this
palette it girl is a really pretty red
cozy is gonna be your neutral sort of
peachy nude live is kind of that classic
every woman's kind of berry Rose type
shade and then fairytale is a cool sort
of mauve pink I applied these with my
own lip brush you could use your fingers
for maybe some of the more natural
shades but I think the brighter or
deeper shades what brush will definitely
benefit you for the precision I've
always thought this blurred lines
formula is really really good I know lip
butters were really hot like maybe a few
years back and it's like the essence of
a lip butter you know it makes me think
of that lip balm II type feel but yet
the lipstick color intensity and it's
not gonna be mad it's not gonna be
drying whatsoever they feel like an
actual like treatment type product on
the lips and I am actually wearing right
now a combo of
live which is the shade I sort of
described as a rosy berry and a little
bit of it girl the red mixed into that
obviously when you've got a pallet of
lip colors you can create whatever
combos you want I think they could have
maybe benefited from having like a deep
neutral or just one other more neutral
II nude shade in here but overall I do
like having the lip colors in here if
it's a palette like this that's going to
definitely have division between each
panel then if you want thrown some lip
colors that's fine by me but the
finished look I'm really happy with it
considering all I added in was my CC
cream my eyeshadow primer and my mascara
and this and this is the entire look
comparing it to last year's palette it's
not exactly like it I think it's
definitely a better packaging design I
think you're getting a little less in
terms of product variety that was some
things you're getting bigger sizes of
products in here and I'm not one who's
looking for them to put out like the
exact same thing maybe with just a
slightly different shade variation year
after year I like to see a brand
actually switch it up and do something
different
but keep that concept of having a
multitasking palette I remember when I
first reviewed this and so many people
kind of complain
you know the outer packaging of this
looked like any drugstore palette you
can pick up from Walgreens you know but
the quality of what was inside was real
it cosmetic stuff this did have the nice
mirror in it and this one this year you
fold it all the way out and there is a
mirror on this side but it's kind of one
of those situations where either you're
gonna have to fold the palette somewhat
back together on itself in order to hold
it otherwise it's just gonna kind of
hang down and you're gonna hold it right
in front of your face which I guess is
not unheard of you know it's not out of
the question it could work but truly I
think it's pretty well thought out that
this is gonna fold in on itself and no
part of it is gonna be butted up right
next to other product and they do give
you little sheets by the way over each
part if you just wanted to keep it
protected from the palette itself but
the messiest part of this by far I think
is gonna be your eyeshadows and that's
the part that has the mirror right on
top of it and then it's gonna fold just
like that and with this on top with a
nice magnetic closure I mean so compact
a few things to give me pause I mean I
love that the correctors are in here I
think it's very unique to find coverage
products in a palette like this right
but like I pointed out last year the
tones are a little bit different from
just the full-size pot if you've tried
that and like you compare medium to
medium like I did this medium is more
yellow toned I questioned a little bit
also the texture of the by by pores
pressed it still gets the job done it's
just a little less soft feeling that it
was in last year's palette and happy
with the blush and the lip colors I'm
also really pleased with the eyeshadows
here I think this is a very easy to wear
everyday type selection of shades I
don't feel like it cosmetics is putting
this out thinking here's your holiday
glamorous eye palette I think they're
putting this out from the thought that
this is something that can take you
through the entire year for any
circumstance for any person you might
give this to and it did come in a cute
little like silver gift box with a bow
already around it the regular cost for
this is around 50 bucks on QVC but when
I purchased it was marked down to 44 and
I actually think that's a great bargain
for what you're getting here and it is
that beautiful exterior the same thing
that's going on on the outside of the
Ulta palette with just like a cluster a
collage of all these little gemstones
and
very very pretty I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with this Ulta palette
but if you're really in the mood for
some multitasking if you like the idea
of the coverage products the highlighter
bye-bye pours powder the lip products
and all that I mean this is gonna take
you a little bit further I think it's
stretching your dollar a little bit more
here so I was editing my video yesterday
and I realized it got to the end and I
didn't sign off I didn't say bye bye see
you later thanks for watching anything
and I just went and recorded you know
the intro the first part that you see
when you click on this video like I
didn't wrap it up and anyway so I'm back
to do that now I think I covered
everything of substance on this palette
already I thought I'll show you another
look with it so I used everything in the
palette like I did yesterday but I used
some different shades like on the eyes
and I worked in actual liquid liner and
some black pencil and my lower inner rim
to make it a little more dramatic in the
crease I used this shade called the
glory which is kind of a mauve a
lavender real dusty murky kind of shade
but it's beautiful in the crease and
then I went just above that a little bit
with loyal this color right here and
I've got this taupe on my lid that's
called respect and then superhero the
liner shade actually blended out in my
outer corner to get that nice and dark
and then I took that same black onto my
lower lash line and more of glory just
really smudged out there so I kind of
feel like I've got quite a smoky eye
going on with this look and I'm really
liking it so a little more dramatic
twist on it I've got the blush on as
well for a highlight I only used the
color called kindness from the eye
shadow and I feel like I'm getting a lot
of shine out of that and then my lip
color I used a combo of naturally pretty
and cozy so when you layer those two and
you get a slight more like soft pink
look to the lips as opposed to just like
a peachy nude lip and I have my lashes
on as well so I hope you like this look
just one more idea I guess for what to
do with this palette really enjoying it
I think it's gonna be awesome for travel
I think I'm totally going to throw this
in my travel bag for Thanksgiving and
yeah thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
