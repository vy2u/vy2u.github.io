being here in this video it's gonna be
all scented stuff it's a huge trend in
makeup right now it seems products that
have some sort of smell to them and you
might be thinking yes I'm really into
that or if you click this and you're
like no I don't really enjoy that kind
of thing stay with me because maybe you
can take this as a warning you know for
all the things that if you don't like
scent maybe you want to stay away from
but we've got rose stuff and peach and
chocolate and coconut just all kinds of
stuff happening here and with some of
the things like it's really a part of
the way the product is marketed you know
like they're trying to sell something
that has a fun scent and then in other
cases it's more of like a sneaky scent
that comes through that you may not have
even known was part of the product so
I'm going to point all that out this
video really covers a lot of new things
too that I wanted to talk about in a
video like new covergirl palettes that
have come out and definitely stay tuned
to the end because I'll be trying on the
Mac Oh sweetie
lip colors that I have so it's gonna be
fun I'm excited about this there's some
things that I've pulled out for the
purpose of this video that I really
haven't used in a while so we'll have
some rediscovered moments as well so
this is the first thing I'm gonna pop on
to moisturize with it's the Milani prep
and Brighton rose oil I really like this
stuff I think it definitely has an
accurate rose scent but the oil is nice
and thin so I'm not really scared about
using it you know how some oil they're
just really like goop and across the
skin but this gives a nice level of
hydration I think and they also have the
Camellia one if you're interested in
that but I think the rose scent in this
is really lovely and I think rose done
accurately and lightly in a product can
be really nice next we're gonna bring on
some peach I'm using my Too Faced primed
and peachy face primer and it's been a
while since I've used this that says
cooling matte skin perfecting primer and
I really have used a decent amount of
this product over time it's just been a
little while for me so I'm gonna smooth
some of this on it has a great texture
and if you're familiar with anything
from Too Faced from their peach
collection it's that classic peachy
sweet peach type scent that they're
working into so many things in their
line and I kind of wish the brand so
they're copying that would get a little
more creative
isn't there some other scent out there
worth creating like I don't know grape
or strawberry apple pie I don't know and
then I'm going to use my peach perfect
comfort mat foundation in light beige
and this is really the only scented
foundation that I have well maybe I
should back that up there are some
foundations that have you know a scent
to them a make up each scent that you
can't really put your finger on but in
terms of something that I could really
identify this is the one and I do love
this foundation now again I haven't used
it in a while because there's just been
a lot of other things to try but I'm
gonna do about pump of that hopefully
the shade works out for me today as I
recall this one has really nice coverage
on the skin and I'm just using my Real
Techniques buffing brush to blend that
all and I think the shade looks pretty
good actually
yep we may just have a bit of a
rediscovery put in here with this I
really love the coverage it's not the
fullest of the full coverage but it's
approaching full coverage you know and I
feel like I can sort of work the product
in certain ways across certain areas and
have a lot of great coverage you know
just by kind of pressing it in as
opposed to really buffing if you're
looking for something that's matte and
you also happen to like the scent of
peach now guys for the life of me I
could not find a scented concealer I'm
sorry to let you down there but I just I
don't have one I couldn't find one that
I could pick up real quick and it's
really funny because for all the things
that smell like peaches and then you
have peachy correctors out there for all
those correctors that are like light
purple and green and stuff like that
you'd think somebody would come out and
make those be like fruit scented or
whatever but I'm gonna go ahead and use
my tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
again I say again because this was my
last video I was talking about this if
you want a full review and I should put
a little asterisk buy new because this
is more like a repackaged product like
ivory promoted and released in a 30
color shade range and they also put out
this little brush that I'm using which I
find to be really nice I just have a
little bit of a struggle reaching right
into my inner corner with that brush
sometimes I get it sometimes I don't but
overall it's a great little blending
tool for this because you don't over
blend the product like you maintain so
much good coverage with it
so as much as I like the peach since and
we could go back and pull in a couple of
peachy powders I want to break things up
a bit with some banana now banana is a
scent I would really like to encourage
in the world I'd like to see more of
this this is from the two-faced line
that limited edition candy Johnson
collection that came out and she put out
this banana pudding powder so it's just
like a little yellow tone pressed powder
it has some little flecks of like purple
and green and I think different sort of
color corrective shades but overall it's
just like this really pale yellow
setting powder you can use maybe a lot
of you have this lurking around in your
collection I apologize because I don't
think it's anything you can get any more
right now but I'm just gonna go ahead
and set the face with that the banana
scent is quite subtle with it but I'll
give them credit for trying and I'd like
to see more
and it is kind of making me want that
banana cream pudding like with the
vanilla wafers in it next I want to tell
you about a product that I think has a
little bit more of a sneaky scent in
there it's the bye-bye pores bronzer
from it cosmetics I have it in the shade
beach and maybe I've missed something
but I don't feel like this was
necessarily plugged as a big-time
scented product but it definitely has
kind of a coconutty a little bit like
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
but maybe not quite as strong yeah
definitely not that strong there's a
little tropical scent going on there so
I'm going to pick some up with my ELF
complexion brush here and I do like the
shade I like the tone of this it's a
nice light kind of medium bronzer not
too light not too dark
trying to decide if it's fully met I
think it pretty much is I mean it's got
when you look really closely at it it
makes you wonder a little bit but I just
don't see a lot of sheen on my face when
I use this
to me I think this is a very pleasant
level of scent for a product you open up
the compact and it's not like it knocks
you over with scent but as you're using
it you know you can pick up a little bit
of something going on there and I think
for the masses to enjoy it I think
that's a good level to the end now I've
also got the two different face compacts
here from cover girls new stuff so
they've got the chocoholic contour
palette and the peach punch highlighter
palette which also seems to contain
something like you know a soft bronzer a
blush and a highlight this contour white
as you can see in comparison to what's
in the peach I think it's a little
cooler and deeper and then we have two
tones of highlight one a little more
pinky and one more golden so I'm gonna
bounce around sort of between the two
let's talk about this chocolate one
first mmm they didn't do the chocolate
scent quite as well as Too Faced did I'm
not really saying it's not strong enough
it's just maybe not quite sweet enough
they're trying but again I wish instead
of just straight-out copying stuff I
wish there are so many beautiful scents
in the world you know that we could draw
inspiration from and have in these
products but I'm gonna take a little bit
of this bronzer and it seems like a
little goes a really long way because
you just tap into it there's a lot of
product it is fairly dark I think you
really need to watch yourself I'm going
to build up this little area here the
whole of the cheek very carefully
because you guys in another video I did
I was pointing out how when I turned my
head like you could see that my contour
look kind of funny and I had used this
chocoholic bronzer here from covergirl
and this is like really deep it's very
shimmery and a little goes a really long
way and I think I didn't even realize at
first how much I had picked up on my
brush and you've got to be very careful
of that stuff and same with this one
like every time I put my brush and I'm
like whoa back it up
so I already had a little something
going there from the hit cosmetics but I
just wanted to show you like for a
deeper contoured effect what that would
do pounce over to this peach palette now
and we'll use the blush from that so
that's right here in the middle mmm okay
that's a pretty good pretty good peach
scent I must say it's not too strong
it's sweet I would definitely be able to
identify it as peach I think even if
nobody told me what this was supposed to
smell like and they also just like I
have that individual bronzer I didn't
pick these up but I think they had a few
shades of individual peach blush pretty
shade I like that this seems to be a
matte blush by the way I really like the
tone the depth
yeah I'm on board with that one guys I
like it and the bronzer in here seems a
lot softer a lot more approachable
although a bit more on the orangie side
than the one in here now I don't know
which highlight should I use I think I'm
gonna go for the one in the peach
palette the highlights in here actually
seem like they have a certain amount of
depth to them
overall this might be a palette that
works a little bit better for a deeper
skin tone because look at those like
there's a decent amount of color in
those highlighter options here and if
you're really looking for just a bright
pop on the you know top of your
cheekbone on my skin tone or a more fair
skin tone I don't think those would do
the best job of highlighting but this
one and the peach palette seems a little
bit brighter and it does have kind of a
peachy pink tone we'll pick some up
there nice that's really pretty I love
how they've managed to incorporate a
soft amount of peach without darkening
up the tone too much really pretty ooh I
really like that cheek that I got going
on here it's you know the color the cone
of the highlight loving that so for
setting sprays there are quite a few
cents out there in setting sprays if you
think about the Mario Badescu line if
you think about different like rose
scented myths that are out there but
Smashbox is primer waters I have raved
about these but I think they came out
with three really good cents with their
coconut the serene greens and also the
centering citrus which is what I'm going
to use today I love the cents I think
they're really refreshing I like setting
makeup or most often I like kind of
refreshing my makeup midday with
something like this so they have nice
sprayers ooh that citrus makes me feel
like I'm at a hotel I have used a lot of
hotel products shampoos and conditioners
that smell exactly like that but I
really like this look I'm very pleased
with the coverage from the peach
foundation that banana pudding powder
you know it did well for me that's not
something that you're gonna really find
in the stores anymore I like that new
buy buy pours bronzer from it cosmetics
I think that Beach shade is it is really
appropriate for my you know skin tone
and have the two covergirl products that
I tried I think that
each for lighter skin tones I think
you'll find that a little more workable
I know I didn't show myself using the
bronzer in there but it's more of a
traditional bronzer you know it's got
some warmth to it the chocolate one has
deeper highlights and a pretty deep rich
contour shade as well now for brows
who's gonna put out a chocolate brow
product that would be two-faced I've got
my chocolate brownie here cocoa powder
brow pencil I have it in soft brown I
haven't used this in a little while
I feel like initially there was sort of
a scent on this and I don't know if my
mind is playing tricks on me right now I
don't know if I'm going crazy with all
the fumes no but I think there is a
little bit of a chocolate scent going on
but I do like this pencil it's sort of a
like thin rectangular shape almost and
as you use it you know some of the edge
wears down a bit from certain parts but
like I said I've got this in soft brown
and I'm just going to fill things in a
little oh just an update we finished
watching that show on Netflix what's it
called evil genius we finished watching
that it's like a four part Netflix
documentary it's really good it's very
compelling and the dude who put this
together I mean just the
stick-to-itiveness that he had to
continue
I don't know trying to dig things up
what this case was I think pretty
admirable but I would recommend it if
you like any sort of like crime real
life I love things that are based on a
true story I always have
I also fall into a few lifetime movies
now Lifetime movies draw you in you're
just casually flipping through and
you're like oh a new movie just started
wonder what this one's about there's
always a crazy woman in him though like
there's somebody getting obsessed
usually changing a lot about her
identity due to a very troubled past I
want you guys to be honest with me and
tell me how many times you've fallen
into a Lifetime movie rabbit hole but
what's the difference between the
Lifetime channel and the movies they
play and then there's Lifetime movie
network is it called the next channel
what's the difference like that it seems
to be the same
caliber of content both and I'm not
saying they're like the best movies ever
but they just sometimes they just have
on occasion suck me in a little bit even
though I could pretty much predict how
it's gonna turn out what the woman's
problem is how it's all gonna go like II
I still somehow get tied in okay there's
a spoolie on the other end I don't know
if you notice that but I'm just kind of
going through with that gives a nice
little natural fill in there and gimme
brow did you know that they came out
with a few new shades like I have 4.5
here and I'm gonna add a little bit of
that not that it's scented is it no but
it holds the brows in place really
really well and I was recently sent this
box of it and they had like a few new
colors so if you never found your right
shade you might check it out again it
holds really well it's nice and a pinch
too without even filling in with any
other product you can just use that
now this Marc Jacobs coconut undercover
eye primer I don't think really sorry we
had a small situation here it came out a
little funky for a second but no this
does not have any sort of coconut scent
so it's so just take this opportunity to
clarify that I thought that might be the
only one that I own that had a shot of
having a scent I don't personally love
the idea of using a scented eye primer
anyway so that's fine we'll just do this
then I have two different covergirl
through naked palettes I've got the
peach punch and I've got the chocoholic
and then they also have not in the
scented family they put out a true naked
sunsets palette I don't know there's
been so much peach in this video I think
I might go for the chocoholic there
seems to be sort of a nice matte and
shimmer balance in here you got these
two shimmers on the end this color right
here is pretty glitzy and then this one
over here my one concern is that it's
going to turn a little muddy and some of
these deep shades aren't really going to
differentiate themselves from one
another but we'll see I'm gonna start
off with this shade a little bit of that
going in my crease just a soft brown
generally speaking I have enjoyed the
texture of these covergirl palettes that
they've put out like you know in this
format they've had the Roses the goldens
the just the nudes or whatever they've
been pretty decent palettes actually
it's pretty comparable to what
Maybelline is doing right now in their
city mini palettes and scent wise like I
was pointing out with the bronzer
palette like you got to search a little
bit for that chocolate so it's not
really knocking me over and it's not
SuperDuper accurate either
I think Too Faced really nailed that in
their chocolate bar palettes you know
and their chocolate Soleil bronzer too
and then what if we took a little bit of
this kind of whiny color out in some of
that see if we can make it kind of shoo
I'm picking up on that that's pigmented
enough to stand out
I am so excited you guys I'm going to
see Luke combs in concert next week oh
that actually got that as part of my
Mother's Day gift I know some even kind
of thought oh did he only get her the
Shane Dawson t-shirt for Mother's Day no
he got me amazing loot combs tickets so
we're gonna go to that like next
Wednesday then you rolled in with your
hair and the wind maybe with hell
morning I enjoy Scientists song so much
even gal knows the words like she she
knows what I'm talking about and some of
his new songs that he just released are
so good too I mean really good let's see
here I'm not really sure where to go
with this I think I'll do some of this
light cream color get that going on the
inner part of the lid and give one of
these darker shades a little something
to overlap with you know what about like
a really good well there are a lot of
eyeshadow palettes that smell like
vanilla but like some really yummy candy
type sense this shade is just grabbing
me maybe not so much on camera you can't
tell but in person like I want to see
what that's made of is it just gonna be
murky is any sort of this Mavi
kind of plumbing is gonna actually show
with it is it gonna build up well let's
see
slightly letdown y'all that is why you
can't judge everything by a swatch some
things swatch beautifully some things
don't swatches impressively but then
apply fine on the eyes with a brush
you've got to wait and see how it all
goes on the eyes because that's what's
important right and this honestly looks
stunning when i swatched it but it's
just kind of shearing out to a murky
place yeah it's not like anybody would
glance at this eyelid can be like well
that looks horrible on your lid there
but it just it's not delivering on what
you see in the palette and I know I'll
be told that I need to put that shade on
a special base and wet my brush and do
all that stuff but you know what I'm
paying for eyeshadow I also part of me
thinks it should be good as is like just
from the palette without a bunch of
special instructions I don't know I'm
just pretty murky I think I'm gonna use
some of this shade on the end because
that gave off a little interesting color
and I'll layer that up on the outside
because I think that's pretty you know
that shade showing me something there
and I get that this is gonna be kind of
a smoky dark palette but I just I do
like shades to be kind of true to the
color you think you're getting or the
texture that I like though lower
lashline we're something we haven't used
here let's see this all of you shade now
this is an olive green that's verging on
a little too dark to actually show up as
green I predict we're not going to be
able to see a lot of green out of this
shade I'm going to make the effort at
least and put it on my lower lash line
it's hardly identifiable as green
I feel like there's a really good
concept going on with the shades that
were placed in here but we just needed a
little better execution of them and the
interesting thing is most of them I
accept this shade didn't build up real
well you know that color I was trying to
work with there but most of them
pigmentation wise they're good it's just
like maybe the tone is just kind of
slightly off to where it's a little too
dark and it just doesn't show enough I
think I'll do a little actual black
liner in the lower inner rim with this
this is my Marc Jacobs blacker smudge
that into the mix perhaps
and no this is not scented I could not
find a scented eyeliner in my stash and
then I'm just kind of taking my smudger
brush didn't really add anything else to
it and going over the liner and just
making it more part of the look you know
a little smoky eye action and then on
the upper lash line I'm just gonna go
across with my makeup revolution
Renaissance flick
and now that the eye look is done I'm
just adding a little bit more of this
cream color stir right in here sometimes
you'll lose a little bit of that in
blending
and then maybe just a bit more of this
whiny color right out here sometimes it
takes getting your liner on and even
some lashes on before you really feel
like you've perfected the shape of your
eyeshadow you know you just kind of have
to start seeing how the finished look
comes together and adjust as you go
don't feel like just because oh I need
to follow these certain steps that I
thought so and so do in their video like
you can you can adjust gotta be flexible
I think the biggest part about doing
makeup is being flexible and knowing
when you need to make a change in your
own look like you know as you're doing
stuff it's really just a series of
little decisions you do I even put a
highlight shade on my brow bone I guess
I'll do that okay a little bit of that
white creamy shade that's really your
only option there is nothing even close
to being a highlight other than that in
this palette I'm confident that that
eyeliner is dry now and I'm gonna use my
voluminous lash base and if you saw this
creeping in in one of my videos last
week or week before that you know this
has a sneaky scent this actually is
infused with rose oil I think it is and
you can definitely pick up on a major
floral scent in this product and I
didn't find it to be irritating to my
eyes but I just found it to be very
surprising oh it's strong it smells very
much like perfume a pleasant scented
perfume I believe I may have mentioned
the fact that I thought this smelled
kind of like my mom but in an eyelash
primer that's a really surprising place
to find that scent especially because
they didn't push the scent hard like I
didn't market this as a majorly
scented product at all they just
suggested that rose oil is one of the
ingredients and then boom it's probably
one of the most heavily scented things
in this whole video are you shocked
where are you shook let me know in the
comments section but you do want to let
it dry it does sanding instructions want
it get all the way dry before you start
layering up your nice black mascaras on
it my experience with this was that it
didn't it may have given me a little
extra length but
didn't aid so much in the separation of
flashes like if you typically like what
lash paradise does for you
I wouldn't add this in because it's not
the same kind of fluffy fluttery full
lash look but in doing my research for
this video and trying to come up with as
many scented products as I possibly
could I found an article online talking
about the Maybelline total temptation
mascara which I've used this before
it didn't really knock my socks off I
don't think I hated it but in the
article was saying that this smells a
little bit like coconut and I thought
what I don't remember that I had to
purchase it again to find out I've got
it in blackest black they mentioned that
like coconut oil is maybe one of the
ingredients in it there's some coconut
fruit extract I'm not sure what that
amounts to it seems to be a brush that I
would generally really like I kind of
like those full fluffy and natural
bristle brushes oh oh no I just hit my
nose yeah when you're getting too into
your scented products being a little too
aggressive with it
um now I've successfully wiped off my
makeup in that spot okay a little bit of
this powder okay perfect that'll work
thank you Ben Anna it's really faint and
I don't know that I would really be able
to pick that out of the lineup like yep
that's coconut it's just a light fresh
sort of scent it's sort of an unusual
scent I think to find in a mascara
because usually mascaras are the most
like makeup II scented thing you know
there's just kind of a chemically sort
of nothing super wonderful going on
there but this has just a nice sort of
Pleasant light fresh scent putting it on
now over the primer that's not a bad
lash look they're actually this may
perform better with this primer than
actual lash paradise does pretty good
length maybe we need some more savoury
options as far as scented makeup goes we
need more things smelling like bacon in
ribs loaded baked potato chicken strips
ranch buffalo wings cold beer onion
rings I'll stop there I'm just talking
about the things that I'm hungry for not
really what I want to see put into make
but I'm not saying I wouldn't buy it if
it did this could be a great moment for
beauty brands to collaborate with
restaurant chains things got a little
sloppy there at the end but work through
it I'll do a little bit of this on the
lower lashes too just a little because I
don't know if I can trust this mascara
there yet it applied nicely it didn't
like overload them I'm all for a nice
full fluttery lower lash but I don't
like an overloaded look at my mascara
right here lower lash I leave those
kinds of responsibilities to the upper
lashes now I'm gonna put on my false
lashes that smell like rhubarb pie just
kidding I don't have any scented false
lashes the finished effect from those
two mascaras together is decent but not
great you know it again I feel like I
could have achieved maybe a little bit
more separated like seeing more lashes
look not using the primer first because
I think it chunks some things together
and I don't really have enough lashes to
be able to afford any of them teaming up
now you guys I was sent seven colors of
Mac's
Oh sweetie collection it they were in an
adorable box
with cookies that look like donuts and
those are pretty good once you put him
in the microwave a little bit to soften
up but I thought I would do a quick like
rapid-fire Tryon of these for you now I
don't have the info sheet up here that
said what these are all supposed to
smell like maybe they okay I think
they're named as such it will be obvious
so there are more shades than just this
in the line but from what I have I think
I'll try to just sort of go dark to
light or light to dark actually the
exact opposite of what I just said first
off we have coconut macaroon and I
believe they were describing this as
like a whipped sort of lip gloss oh it's
a nice feeling texture oh and man that
is scented yeah we are we have a grand
finale of scent coming with these
products here oh that is that is pungent
in a good way I like it oh I went to
like lick it oh there's a little it's a
little sweetness but what's making this
special I think lies mostly in the scent
even though there's a slight sweetness
to the tail
but this is a shimmery like light peachy
nude color coconut macaroon now we have
I think it's caramel sugar there might
be another word to that title but it's
being covered up it's a little bit
deeper than what I just used in more
bronzy oh my word that is caramel corn
in the mall when I was a kid walking
through and walking past that snack
stand caramel corn oh I hope I like the
color because I love the scent yeah I
get where they're coming from with
whipped because it's not like really
goopy when you touch your lips together
it's not like one of those lip glosses
it's like connecting one lip to the next
it's a very light feeling and I haven't
been wearing these like around the house
I can't really comment on the staying
power
so far both of the ones that I've put on
I've had kind of this metallic nature to
them I feel like that could be pretty
from a distance but I don't want people
like getting up close and analyzing the
look seeing some lines but like from a
distance it catches the light
beautifully don't you think Ellen the
scent is just on fire I love that scent
like they captured heat somehow in that
scent and the hot like kind of caramel
corn in a mall I captured the mall
insanely accurate sense it has not been
since my career as a lip smacker
connoisseur that I've encountered since
this strong and accurate okay let's try
the pink this is strawberry mousse
something fruity Wow
I I'm blown away I'm blown away by these
scents this one seems to be less of a
foiled thing oh this has a little bit of
a gold shimmer in it you don't see it as
much in the tube it's got a little
golden sheen I honestly don't feel like
I found a color I'm in love with but the
scents are amazing this you know white
pink Barbie pink bubblegum the other
thing too is when you go to lick your
lips with your tongue product doesn't
really come off on your tongue I guess
I'm doing it gently but whatever let's
do the brighter pink now this is
raspberry pavlova definite berry scent a
little bit of a bite to this one
like a little tartness
oh my gosh
I actually kind of love this color
really bright like it's blowing off my
face is it not I'm a little concerned
with a bright shade about it staying on
my lips though because it's such a
lightweight product there's not a lot of
tackiness in these at all I'm wondering
how that would go
couple of orange shades here let's go
for this one first this is banana
muffins Oh show me a good banana scent
here completely 100% banana bread banana
muffins sure Wow oh man
now I'm just gonna say I don't think
this particular color is my Chan
but it might be somebody's there's one
thing I'd like to say don't let anyone
in any comments sections of anywhere
tell you you can't wear bright color I
don't care how old you are if you enjoy
it if it brings you joy if you
personally feel like yeah that's a good
look on me I like that if you're having
fun with it
makeup should be fun makeup shouldn't be
people setting all kinds of rules for
you so I just like to take this moment
to encourage you if you like a certain
color do what you love and don't let
people set make up rules for you I hate
makeup rules okay off soapbox
that is banana muffins right there got a
little part of the lash stuck to it the
packaging on this is quite cute too
they've got the sprinkles all the way
all over the tube and onto the cap now
this would be like a little deeper yeah
just a little more depth to it a little
more Corley with this shade creamy peach
pie okay definitely it doesn't really
smell like two-faced peach stuff I'm
actually not pulling a lot of peach from
this at all no
I mean it's okay it's not blowing me
away like some of the other sense or by
the way the applicator here is just your
standard traditional doe foot and I feel
like almost every shade even colors like
this one that didn't necessarily appear
to have any sort of metallic nature to
them there ends up being just at least a
hint of a pearl on the lips oh I do like
that color a lot might be one of the
best colors I wish it smelled like one
of the other things that last one here
this is death by chocolate a nice way to
end things this looks like a maroon at a
glance but it has a definite golden
sheen like the shimmers go of sort of
golden direction ooh really chocolatey
definitely like rich yeah
they got that one hmm this one is it
goes on my lips it seems to have less of
that lightweight mousse texture and a
little more like liquid quality to it I
would feel like this would be a really
risky move to go wearing a shade like
this and then like go to an event eat
and drink could get sloppy but man that
is pretty golden a sheen is not showing
much but you do see it in the tube can't
take anything away from that color that
was beautifully done all right guys this
was probably a really long video what
with that whole entire try on there
which I thought was gonna be like
rapid-fire but I of course had to
comment on every single scent the best
sense by the way out of there I really
liked the caramel corn one it's actually
called caramel sugar that was such a
good and such like a real scent in my
life like it immediately transported me
to another time like in my childhood
strawberry mousse was okay I really like
the color of the raspberry pavlova but
the scent was you know it was alright
the banana muffins was on point scent
wise but not a shade I'd really reach
for a lot creamy peach pie was one of
the better-looking colors on me I
thought but didn't really I actually
think Too Faced did peach better than
that and
and death by chocolate good scent and
really pretty color but just you know
watch out if you're wearing fat keep an
eye on it a rip favorite is caramel
sugar I'm actually gonna put that back
on so guys thank you so much for
watching I hope you like this I just
hope this is kind of a fun peek into the
world of scented makeup I'd love to hear
about your favorite or least favorite
scented makeup products in the comments
section below and before I sign off I
mean just talking about anything that
really impressed me overall I like the
Too Faced peach products the foundation
is quite nice and this was a nice
reminder to me of how much I like that I
like the primer that goes with it as
well it's a nice scent on both of the
things but it's actually truly a nice
product as well I don't feel like I'm
gonna get a lot of use out of the
chocoholic contour palette from
covergirl but I was really impressed
with the peach punch highlighter palette
which is highlighter blush and bronzer
like my it cosmetics bye bye pores I had
a little coconut e smell you've heard me
voice my love for these Smashbox sprays
on multiple occasions this chocoholic
palette I feel like overall every time I
use it I'm probably just gonna get like
a deep smoky Brown type of look out of
it even though certain shades might lead
you in different directions I do like
this one color here at the end this is
just kind of one of those murky palettes
though even though some shades seem to
have their own little personality going
on in the palette and look really pretty
in the presentation of the palette and
also might swatch beautifully doesn't
necessarily mean they're gonna do great
on the eye and that's where it's really
important and so that's where I was a
little letdown I will still be trying my
peach palette from covergirl and let you
know how that goes I've already used
that Sun sets one and that was good the
mascaras I mean that L'Oreal primer is
ridiculously scented like it's so strong
but I've yet to see it really do great
things paired with another mascara the
Maybelline total temptation is finally
drying out and like I said I had that
product before I didn't love it didn't
hate it now that I've got it back in my
collection I'll give it some more goes
oh it gave me a little bit of a smudge
under my eye beautiful the Oh sweetie
lip colors are really fun like maybe if
you find yourself at a Mac counter you
want to go through and like smell them
all no I would encourage that they're
really good just be aware of the
finishes and even though there are some
shades that don't necessarily appear to
be metallic or pearlized in any way I
still was able to pick up at least a
slight pearly finish on pretty much all
of them so anyway that's my wrap up
there thank you guys so much for your
time and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
