video I will be using nothing but sticks
only stick make up here I was thinking
about making it a 5 minute challenge but
then I decided no I want to focus on the
different formulas as I go and provide
some reviews along the way so I thought
it would be more informative to not do
this video that way although I am
completely open to more 5-minute
challenges if you'd like to leave those
requests in the comments section I think
that's fun but yeah I've got some new
stick stuff I'm combining some old
favorites with this look as well sticks
tend to be just a really low maintenance
easy way to apply makeup in a lot of
cases you wouldn't need to bring in
extra brushes to get the job done
although throughout this video you will
see me pulling in some of my favorite
brushes to use with stick products or
any kind of cream okay so the first
thing I'm going to put on is this hard
candy sheer envy coconut water primer
stick I love this stick for the way it
glides on under the eye area and I think
it's a great way to prep the under-eye
when you're getting started with your
makeup like it's just so cooling it
feels lightly hydrating but you know
it's not too much and it's a stick so it
qualifies right then I'm going to use a
stick that I've had quite a few
questions about lately it is the
Smashbox Studios skin shaping foundation
so this is a two-in-one stick I've got
it in 1.2 so it's the foundation on one
end and then a soft contour on the other
and this whole line of foundations is
put together in such a way that they
have kind of customized the contour
shade to be appropriate with the you
know color of foundation that you're
working with so I am first going to
sweep this foundation all over my skin
and I'm going to blend this out with my
little Sephora and the mini flawless
airbrush brush and this foundation
blends out pretty easily it's a nice
formula it's really smooth like even
coverage there are some foundation
sticks that I've used over time that you
feel like when it's time to blend him
out you've got to like pull them across
the skin like they just don't want to
spread and blend and there's got to be a
good amount of creaminess with the
foundation stick for that to happen and
this one is really good for that anybody
else feel like there's a total like
foundation stick boom happening right
now Smashbox has this one and I reviewed
besa Mays recently Tarte has some NARS I
think they're a great thing really and
foundation sticks are super handy super
quick to apply you can easily blend them
out with your fingers too I just there's
something about a brush that gives I
think a whole lot of evenness so then I
think I will go ahead and not leave you
hanging on the other end of the stick I
will go ahead and use that a little bit
I'm using this great brush from Real
Techniques it's their contour brush go
figure and I reached for this a lot with
cream contour products I love how it's
not too super big because usually when
you're blending out of contour you know
I wanting to blend it in that spot I'm
not wanting to really work it a lot
higher or a lot lower you know I'm
trying to keep it kind of confined to a
certain area so this brush is not too
big and I love that
and then you know I'm gonna do to almost
clean up the lower part of this contour
just a bit I'm gonna take a little more
Foundation and just give it a little DAP
right here underneath like the deepest
part at the hollow of my cheek then go
back in with that foundation brush not
looking for an absolute line there by
any means I just you know what I'm
saying
I just don't want the contour dropping
down to low but that's what that stick
can do all on its own I think that's
pretty cool that's first the time I've
really seen it combined that way and it
keeps you from making that additional
purchase I know there have been a couple
times for me with makeup where I have
wanted to do the whole highlighting and
contouring with sticks but to make the
effect happen you had to purchase a
separate one so this puts them both in
one stick I got this stick I'm gonna
tell you right now I don't really love
it it's the essence color correcting
stick and it's in the shade called say
no to dark spots and I've already used
this some it's like a small rounded
stick and I don't know it's a very
yellowish peach and I feel like the
peachy tone correctors that I really
like best maybe they've got more pink in
them I'm not sure then I'm using my pro
airbrush concealer brush from Sephora
like it blends easily enough and I'm not
really mad at the texture but there are
some things that have done better for me
for the under eye circles I just wanted
to kind of talk about it and show it to
you
see when I turn my head it's like I'm
still seeing some circles but whatever
I'm gonna go in with some concealer
anyway this is my Alma Age essentials
concealer SPF 20 and it's in the shade
oh yeah this is the one that doesn't
have the shading on it I'm pretty sure
it's light/medium but this is one of my
favorite concealer sticks if you are a
stick concealer person this one is so
dang creamy and this shade is just a
little just a smidge brighter than my
skin tone so it can be a nice like see
how I'm sort of working this whole area
here just to brighten it up and you know
you can just use it anywhere high points
of your face it's just so creamy there
are so many of those sticks that are
really dry really like dug across the
skin and this is kind of like I don't
know a little concentrated foundation
stick practically it's really great
really nice coverage and it's not too
sticky also and that's a thing with this
look you know I don't have a stick
powder I'm going to be using so yeah I'm
not wanting my skin to be like ultra
tacky at the end of this
see I really like the base that we've
got going on here and I love how that
contour part of the Smashbox stick kind
of gave me that bronzy look around the
hairline so yay for that I need step
warm coffee get kind of a custom
sometimes to drink in the room
temperature almost cold coffee somedays
okay I'm going to use this milk lip and
cheek I'm only going to use it on the
cheeks cuz I got other plans for the
lips but this is a stick in the shade
perk and this is just a mini stick I've
got some of the larger sticks and their
large sticks are just huge and I don't
know I really like some of the things
that milks coming out with but this
stick I'm gonna give it just a little
swipe there right on the apples of the
cheek is this just a fresh as a daisy
color or what and I'm using my ELF small
stipple brush you knew that was coming
in this video with all this cream stuff
right Blandy blend
why do words turn all cutesy when you're
dealing with a two-year-old it's like
everywhere like it's not just go put on
your shoes it's go put on your shoes
ease and we're not even a big like I've
never been a big baby talker with her
you know like once she was really
starting to form words I was trying to
talk to her
basically like she was a lot older than
she was and I think it's been actually
really good for her language development
and stuff like that but still we've got
those things we can't just say like go
for a walk you know it's a walkie walk
or it's a there's there's got to be some
little spin but on the word I don't know
it just comes out of yet you think
you're not gonna talk that way and then
you have kids and you do I added just a
bit more here this is a nice stick it's
not too overpowering you know as a blush
stick blush stick I like it and it
doesn't feel sticky either now I am
wanting some glow on this and I've got
this Maybelline master strobing stick in
the shade light slash iridescent and
these this is what the cap looks like by
the way I love the master blush sticks
that Maybelline makes so I'm hoping I
like this too I haven't really messed
with this a whole lot ooh am I gonna
regret just swiping this on straight
from the two bits it's gonna be a lot
highlight always looks like more to me
like in person I've noticed being up
here doing my makeup it appears to be
more pronounced in person than my camera
always picks up I think it's just all
the lighting here like maybe if we were
in more of a dim light setting the
highlight would really pop out at you
but in full lighting you know if you're
seeing anything on camera it's a lot in
person oh this brush by the way this is
the high cheekbone highlighter from
Sigma
the challenge sometimes with using the
cream highlight up in this zone it was
like I really went to great lengths to
use concealer and everything in this
area and I don't want to blend that all
away so I'm trying to be really light
handed and careful as I blend I think I
want to take a little bit of this like
down the nose I want to do a little bit
of it kind of coming up like in this
area a little bit on the Cupid's bow
it's no wonder call our youngest child
little bit cuz I sure just say little
bit all the time when I'm doing make if
I edit my videos I'm like how many times
can a woman use the phrase little bit oh
look at this
I got sheet creases right over here hmm
some of you guys asked me like what time
is it when you shoot your videos not all
of them you know is it dark outside but
right now it's 5 o'clock it's five
o'clock somewhere no oh it's six after 6
right now actually we're starting to get
into that season we're creeping into it
where it's gonna be darker longer in the
morning so all right this is what we've
got for our face makeup and I want to I
think from here do a little brows so the
stick that I'm using for that or the
pencil it's still still stick right it
actually resembles an actual stick maybe
more than some of those other things
like skinny and long I'm feeling a
little strange this morning honestly
this is the Too Faced chocolate brownie
this is the deep brown I think maybe the
last time I was talking about this I was
using the lighter shade I was using the
soft Brown I can really use either I
think maybe I like this deep Brown even
more cool thing about this product it's
like a rectangular as a skinny rectangle
so many of these are kind of a triangle
shape and I find this long skinny
rectangle actually forms the shape of my
brows really really fast like this is
one of my fastest fillings but you know
what when I have my camera turned on and
I'm narrating something I could make
anything take like 15 minutes anybody
else who does videos feel that way like
you can whip something out on your own
without talking about it and have it
done in 15 seconds and then you turn
your camera on oh it can take so much
longer and this smells good too
speaking of smelling good and sweet
stuff um we indulged a lot around here
on Eclipse today now we'll barbecue had
some ribs had some like scalloped
potatoes baked beans don't even get me
started on the Eclipse cake and the
apple pie and then pop was here puffs my
sister we started talking about like
chunks
foods and cereals and like we got into
this whole big conversation about like
which cereal do you like but which blah
blah blah and then you know we ended up
at Dollar General doing a junk food well
we just ended up with a lot of guilty
pleasures we ended up with some Little
Debbie treats some star crunch some
oatmeal cream pies
some gushers Reese's puffs cereal
we had like so much fun though it was
really fun we haven't like finished
everything pup if you're watching this I
haven't gone and finished all that junk
food I should have sent some home with
them for the trip home but I need to do
is just like pack it away for a rainy
day and not touch the stuff for a good
long while now I want to do my lip
before the eye because I'm not quite
sure where I want to go with the eye
look yet I want to do this kind of fun
Coralie end-of-summer punch on the lips
so I'm gonna use this Burt's Bees stick
in Niagra overlook I've used this stick
this color quite a bit I feel like it's
not really marketed as a matte product
it comes off pretty matte on my lips and
it feels creamy but it's not like not
sticky at all Burt's Bees by the way
what are they doing coming out with like
a big old range of products now I want
to try some and then I want to pump up
the color a little bit I've got this
liner from NYX in the shade called rosy
sunset I haven't used this one all that
much it looks like a really like bright
warm pink sometimes I like to use lip
liners after I've got the bulk of the
color on my lips and just like kind of
accent things clean up the shape
but that eclipse by the way I mean it's
a crime for me to sit here and just like
talk about the snacks I hate that we can
not tell you that we were you know in
the path of totality the the crossroads
of the Eclipse or whatever they want to
call it we were like the longest
duration in the dark where I live and it
was just incredible it was breathtaking
it was spooky you know you're looking up
through your glasses what's actually
happening in the sky you're seeing the
corona you know not the beer but the the
ring that forms you know in the moon
passes through and it's just so so
bright and so amazing and it was really
funny how when there was only a sliver
of Sun left it was still really bright
everywhere but once the Eclipse started
happening you're looking around and you
know the sky doesn't go black but it
goes like spooky it was so creepy like
looking around the lighting that was
cast over everything was something I've
just never seen before like this greyish
dusky but yet very different from you
know sunset time even though at one
point we did have this brief look of a
sunset outside but I mean it was just
just spooky lighting very lucky to be
living in the path of it and that's
gonna be coming back to this very same
area at 2024 knowing that and really
looking ahead maybe there should be a
big like beauty broadcast barbeque or
something no I'm just kidding I'm just
gonna go buy a Little Debbie snacks did
you get here I'll just have it a little
Debbie snack but that so the lip is bold
lip is bold today and that means I'm not
gonna maybe go too crazy on the eyes but
I have an interesting thing and this was
sort of what made me want to do an all
stick look and I got these in the mail
just yesterday if these laura mercier
caviar sticks and there were a bunch of
the regular ones like see the finish on
the outside of the stick like just her
regular formula that have a little
shimmer but then they're a bunch of
gnats as well and I thought it might be
fun to really work with some of these
mats personally I just always liked
using synthetic brushes to blend out
cream stuff when I'm working with it on
the eyes this is my first time playing
around with
I'm gonna use the shade called unnatural
it really is fully matte and I'm gonna
give myself a little crease color we're
gonna see how this works here you see
that popping on there I'm not sure how
much play time I have with these so I'm
gonna go ahead and blend and like now
yeah I don't think you'd want to wait
around too long I know the regular
caviar sticks do sort of set but man
this is pretty that looks really soft
and nice certainly fast let's do some
old
this is a brush it's the chic eyeshadow
brush it's from the it brushes at Ulta
line and I think it was like part of a
holiday set it's just really similar to
the Sigma e25 actually it's really
really soft and dense I think it blends
creams really nicely
I've got vanilla kiss really nice light
shade if you're into like carving out
your brows holy cow this is like a high
brow on steroids I mean use a little
firm flat brush from Real Techniques
this is amazing for creams as well it's
called the shading brush oh that gives a
really finished look to things actually
I may start using this kind of shade a
lot I think I want to use some of that
like around here
you know what else I'm gonna do with
that vanilla kiss I am going to just get
crazy here lower waterline yes
nice and bright there okay here's
something a little bit darker I thought
we could play with this color called
cobblestone murky kind of taupe I'm just
gonna start drawing this on the outer
part of my eyelid yeah I'm going for an
all matte stick look cuz I think these
are kind of rare we see so many shimmery
eye sticks I keep just doing like
back-to-back one eye than the other eye
and I forget like yeah that's going to
start to set pretty quick here
but these are doing a pretty good job
kind of blending on top of one another
considering I've got like different
textures I've got some bear skin but
I've also got areas where there's a
stick that is said already and I'm kind
of overlapping and I'm trying to you
know get sort of a blend going here and
it's doing it really well like the
sticks don't feel too heavy on my skin
even though in some parts I may be
overlapping two or three shades I know
this is a super super light look and you
may be kind of bored with it I mean
maybe I am too but I'm not bored with
the textures and that's really what I'm
trying to test here is what what are the
textures of these like how are they to
blend I'm liking this color on the lower
lash line
that's like instant smokey this little
brush though from Real Techniques you
need this if you're working with a lot
of cream shadows it is great so I'm
gonna real quick curl my lashes and do
some mascara I guess that's the one
thing that's not a stick makeup product
so for the finished look I just put on
some lash paradise' mascara there and
it's a nice like low maintenance kind of
look I mean I realistically probably
wouldn't do 100% only stick makeup every
single day but I think more so the point
of this video is just to spotlight some
different stick products and talk about
which formulas I like which formulas I
don't like as well see otherwise like
ideally to fully cover up certain areas
here on the tops of my cheeks
I would have preferred like instead of
the essence corrector to go in with
something like benefit erase paste or
the poem brightening concealer I must
struggle with that for a while also
topping off with some powder I think can
improve the coverage and maybe not using
a cream highlight that you have to blend
out on top of areas that you're really
trying to conceal that can mess with
your coverage level too that being said
I did think that this master strobing
stick had a pretty effect on the skin I
like the Smashbox shaping foundation I
love the idea of combining you know the
foundation and the right shade of
contour with it the Laura Mercier matte
sticks are very cool matte cream
eyeshadows are
the most forgiving things ever and when
they do set on your eyes and don't rub
off it can sometimes be a struggle to
blend one on top of the next but these
blended I thought really easily I think
the biggest standout to me actually I
love this vanilla kiss color I thought
it was super brightening just full
coverage up under the brow I've got it
right here alongside my wet and wild
brow highlight which is very pinky and
so this is a little more beige and you
rub over them both and the thing about
it is the wet and wild rubs right away
but this one actually sets and stays for
the long haul love the brow pencil
really enjoying that chocolate brownie
whatever it's called from Too Faced and
the lip color as well I think this is a
great like bright summery lip color so
thank you guys so much for watching let
me know your favorite stick format
makeup product in the comments section
below and I will see you again very soon
