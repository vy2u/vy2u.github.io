today's video is going to be something
kind of different first off the way this
idea came about I had a couple of
different pallets from Tarte that I
wanted to talk about in a video use in a
video just bring up somehow and I
thought well if I do a tutorial with
them they don't really cover my whole
face
and then the idea came in why don't I do
a whole face using only products that
are in pallets and this might actually
make a fun challenge if you want to try
this yourself you could certainly put
different restrictions on it make it a
little more difficult you could say all
drugstore palettes or put a limit on the
palettes I could certainly do this with
less ballots than what I'm going to be
using in this video I mean like last
week I talked about an it cosmetics
palette that had about 5 zillion things
in it so not really the biggest
challenge per se but something that I
just thought would be fun and I guess
the big rule for this that I'm going to
be sticking to is every single thing has
to come from a palette the only thing
that does not have to come from a
palette would be the mascara / lashes
every single other thing from foundation
to eyeliner to your eyebrow products has
to come from a palette of some sort so
yeah this will be fun we'll see how this
goes my first thing for foundation I do
have a foundation palette it's from ELF
and it's in the shade light / medium I
know there was a video quite a while
back when this first came out when I
talked about it I think I'll start by
picking up some of the second shade and
I'm just using this angled kabuki f-84
from Sigma I haven't used this product
in a while and I kind of forget you know
my preferred way of putting it on yeah
you know what I'm actually going to do
so I can get more product on my skin a
little faster I'm just picking up that
color with my finger and then I'll blend
it out buff it in with my brush
and then I think I'm going to dab around
a little bit with the shade that goes
even lighter and I'll kind of put that
on like around my under-eye area
Center parts of the face
the foundation feels nice going on
because it's not too thick it's kind of
a nice little middle ground there where
I feel like I am getting some coverage
although I call it like a medium
coverage it is relatively easy to just
swipe on and blend out there's a nice
smoothness to it
okay there we go foundation is on and
again I use the top two shades the
bottom two shades in this light to
medium palette are just a little bit
deeper this one down here has quite a
bit of yellow in it next thing is a
palette for concealer and I have this
palette from Tarte I think this was
limited edition it's called their
wipeout palette and I really like this
it's got different like color correcting
shades it also has a contour color and
you've got these two down here one's
kind of like a little bit more of a pink
tone peach and one's a bit more of a
yellowy almost nearly skin tone type
color so I'm going to use this shade
right down here kind of like an under
eye corrector I forget all these
palettes have nice big mirrors in them
so every time I pop one out I can just
hold it right in front of myself but
whoo the under-eye circles are real in
this third trimester I feel like I mean
for as much as I'm falling asleep on the
couch in the evening hours I would think
I shouldn't be having as many under-eye
circles but I perhaps am a bit more
wakeful at night while I'm kind of you
know tossing and turning and trying to
find a good position what else I think
I'll use this shade kind of around the
nose a little bit it's a little less
peach and I sort of want to brighten
down the nose with this Center yellow
shade I find it can be really
brightening it can be good if you've got
little areas that want to look a little
bit red sometimes and then this is my
swiss pers sponge that was mentioned in
my recent video about new drugstore
products I was kind of doing some many
reviews on and I really liked these
these I was able to get at Walmart kind
of near where they sell the cotton pads
from this brand it's like they just
jumped into this sponge game and said
hey we're making some really good mini
sponges that are a lot like the Beauty
Blender micro mini and they're just a
really nice softness with these it's
great for pressing in your concealer
feeling like you're applying very little
pressure to that you know very delicate
under-eye area because this will never
pull like your finger will or even like
a brush will when you're just dabbing
this soft soft sponge over that area
there's nothing like it I'm going to try
something crazy here and just add a
little yellow to this under-eye because
it was kind of nicely brightening
elsewhere on the face just do a little
bit of that right up in there okay that
works I think I've been adequately
concealed and then I'm going to my genis
a quoi palette from it cosmetics I've
had a frog in my throat all morning long
I'm going to use the bye-bye pores
pressed powder it's a nice little like
finishing powder it's been nice to set
the under-eye using my ELF small tapered
brush and I'm just going to dab this on
that area lightly not a lot of product
on the brush but that is a very very
creamy concealer from the Tarte palette
it's surprisingly creamy for coming from
a palette you know sometimes you expect
it to just be a little bit drier than
that and then this will be the only like
all over face type powder that I use
today and then I want to reach for this
hardest Pro glow palette so this is one
of the new palettes from Tarte it opens
like with a couple of little doors here
oops what we have is a cream contour and
then like this sort of matte powder
contour and for very shimmery highlights
and while they do have you know some
different tones this one down here's a
little bit deeper one up here's kind of
peachy you've got a couple of very light
ones over on the right I'd say my one
complaint about this palette is that
there wasn't more variety just in terms
of at least one of those for being like
a lot less shimmery having a little bit
more spectrum in terms of the finish on
the skin I do like this shade color that
they've got down here in the lower left
it really goes on easily and I found I
love applying it with this contour brush
from Real Techniques and I just kind of
go straight down into it and so that
allows her to pick up some product and
then you can see it going right there in
the cheekbone and it's very easy to
blend out I find myself just doing a
little light like buffing motion and
before I know it I've got a great
contour there and the tone just works
real
nicely for looking like a legit shadow
and this palette does have that kind of
like slightly sweet smell that some of
the recent tart palates have had and
kind of reminds me of a Too Faced
chocolate bar type scent I'm buffing
this around my hairline also
and then you can take this sculpt shade
and I've used it several times just on
its own and it's a fine like kind of
subtle contour as is it's just a nice
matte powder but I find that when I use
it over the cream it just gives like an
added look of softness to the contour so
I kind of like going over and setting it
with that and then I can furthermore you
know spread that deeper shade over
larger areas like when I go down my neck
it's like maybe I'm not going to bother
so much with doing creams there but I
can use the powder honestly what I think
could have been useful in this palette
for my own personal preferences would
have been just this color this color and
like one of the highlights and that
would have been great for me these four
different highlights while I'm all about
trying to pick up on the subtle
differences in products you know by the
time you've got them sheared out on your
skin there's not really like a huge
difference between them all you know and
so I kind of wonder like that they all
need to be in there or if they did want
to put that many highlights in could
they have made them quite a bit
different from one another
the one that I probably reached for most
is this shade cult stunner down here
the strobe shade has little bitty flecks
of glitter it's not as bad as some
glittery highlights that I've seen but
it's not my favorite fire down here can
be a little deep as far as spotlighting
just a certain area on my skin and then
I thought the shade lit up here with
just a little bit week but sometimes I
just end up bouncing around to so many
shades and combining them to get exactly
what I want but overall I feel like this
color called stunner is the most
impactful highlight on my skin so I'm
going to go ahead and take that right on
top of my cheekbones I'll go over that
with my blush and sometimes that effect
of blush over highlight can be really
pretty
so I am hitting up my genocide palette
using this blush right here is the
bye-bye pours blush in genesee quoi and
it's just a matte really pretty
universal pinky blush and see I think
that looks really pretty on top of a
shimmery highlights like they're still
glow coming through but it's it's
filtered just a little bit it's
interesting now next up I'm doing some
brows and I'm using this little makeup
forever brow sculpting palette it's in
the shade number one and here's what it
has in there three different tones of
brow powder you've got a wax and then
sort of a cream highlight right there
and I'm pulling in a separate brush this
is my Sigma u 75 for brows just because
this brush in here is so so stiff it
just feels funny
you know dipping into a powder with that
because I feel like it kind of cuts into
the product but you do have a spoolie on
the other end so I'm going to start with
some of this wax and I like to kind of
get that going in my brow first and then
when I pull in a powder it has a little
bit of something to cling to you know
and I'm going to be using a lot of this
shade and some of this one too they're
both kind of nice cool Browns
I feel like I haven't done my brows with
this kind of method in a long time like
using the wax it takes me back to my to
face throughout NV palette that I used
to use a whole lot lately I've been
reaching for more pencil type products
my area got a new Panda Express recently
you guys yep
sweet fired chicken oh my gosh it's so
good one of the weird things about this
pregnancy is that there is a Thai
restaurant a local place that I just
have loved love loved could have like
lived on the stuff before pregnancy
pineapple fried rice you know is so so
good but for whatever reason I just
can't stomach the stuff during pregnancy
I mean it I just have not wanted it at
all it's just funny how your preference
is kind of changed like that and then
I'm sure it'll change back after work
now I do feel like I want to put on some
kind of eye primer but you know what
would I use for that since it's normally
not coming from a palette when I use it
so I'm going to use this little creamy
like highlighter shade in here and sort
of use that as a base all over my eyes
not shiny shimmery but it is still kind
of light I don't know this might throw
my body into some sort of tailspin not
using Milani eyeshadow primer today
so I'm decorating for Christmas this
weekend I'm very excited about it we're
traveling back home to where I'm
originally from for Thanksgiving and
we're combining Thanksgiving and
Christmas up there because I by the time
Christmas rolls around I really won't be
traveling at all it'll be so close to
the January 12th due date so we're not
going anywhere and so let me know when
do you guys normally decorate for
Christmas I would usually do it right
after Thanksgiving but since we're going
to be away and coming back I feel like
on that Sunday I'm probably not going to
be in the mood or have enough energy to
get that done and I know I will need
Tyler's help to get a bunch of stuff up
from the basement
so I don't want to wait like a whole
nother week to do it you know I want
maximum Christmas time in this house so
I'm very excited about getting all that
stuff up this weekend and I think Belle
is going to see this this year I can
just tell she's taking in Christmas with
a whole different understanding than she
had one year ago you want some cheap
entertainment for your kid just take him
through the aisles of Hobby Lobby you
know is that just looking around all the
colors at the ornaments and the
Christmas trees
she was just in awe it was so sweet she
was like oh baby Jesus I'd like all
these different things as you was seeing
it was so sweet but then she did find a
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer stuffed
animal and had to go ahead and get back
first it was like oh can I hold Rudolph
and so I give it to her as I oh this is
so sweet and then a death-grip
took hold I'm like okay I guess on with
the show this is the eye palette that I
wanted to use and show you guys it's the
TARDIS Pro Amazonian clay palette and
this is what we're working with oh thank
you for a shirt none of their shiny
palette maybe if I hold it like this you
can see you've got all matte this whole
big chunk is matte and it does give you
a lot of different tones here a lot of
deep shades then you've got like kind of
some more pop of color mid tones some
light colors to work with and then the
four down here I think they refer to
them as duochrome and the claims there's
really only one that kind of takes on a
two-tone look and that's the bottom one
the other three just
seem like standard shimmers to me and
actually wish they stood out a little
bit more nice and all but they're all
very warm over here and if I want to pop
my lid with one of these I feel like it
takes my look in the same sort of
direction every time as opposed to maybe
having like a silver or something really
cool as far as the quality of the mattes
and stuff I really do like them and I
like the color selection if you
basically love neutrals and the only
sort of colorful twists you like is
something that goes maybe a little bit
Orange E or a little bit reddish or plum
e this might be a nice thing to have but
I've used a lot of these rusty colors
the plums the Burgundy's and the next
row down I really like that those are in
there but the row that I haven't used so
much of is kind of like just this
classic row down here and since I am
going to do kind of a fun lip today it
might be good to work in more of those
classic type colors I'm going to see if
this color does anything for me in the
crease actually
does give me a very light crease this
color called bold I think this would be
a fun video to redo um just with
different palates with different themes
you know all drugstore palettes all
favorite palettes that kind of thing
going to use a little bit of this shade
called vintage as my highlight right up
under the brow over the edge of the look
and then I think I want to pull in this
color called glam over here and just
kind of show you how that shimmery shade
goes on here like it has this hint of
gold in it
and the shade above that is called the
theory land it has a lot of gold in it
and I almost feel like what about a
cooler shimmery color to help your look
go in a different direction that's not
gold it's something about these shimmers
just texture wise on my lids I don't
feel like they look that pretty I get a
concentrated swatch they look one way
but then I see them on the eyes and I
think they're just not like super
gorgeous it's like they hand-picked four
colors to be your special shimmery
shades in this palette and I just have
not in love with them next I think I
want to really make a thing of like my
outer corner outer b-type area with
black today if you've seen this little
guy out of rotation for some time this
is my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
and I lost it for a little while
and now that it has been found it was a
situation where it's kind of like down
deep within my other brushes and I
thought I'd already looked there but
yeah I found it great story huh so I'm
going into this fake called Punk and I'm
going to really hack this on my outer
part of my lid and I want to just shape
this into a pretty dramatic outer V kind
of like using flat brushes to help me do
that sometimes
using that brush that I used with the
shimmery shade to overlap a little bit
on the lid and then around the crease I
think I'll use this a 25 and just
that'll help me bring some of this
darkness inward just a little bit and
then I'm going to use fold again the
shade I originally used in my crease to
kind of go over it over the top some of
the lighter shades I found in this
palette like they look like they're
verging on a light to a mid-tone maybe
they have some surprising intensity in
here like this shade called Sheik that's
deeper than you might think it would be
this one this one's probably the same
deal okay so I'm obviously going to
repeat the same thing on the other side
building up the matte black and then
softening it out with the shade called
bold
you
then I'm going to use that matte black
eyeshadow as my liner I'm going to take
my angled brush and spritz it with just
a little fix plus like that and that'll
give it some moisture and pick up the
shadow even though it's an intense
shadow I think it will pick it up in an
even more intense way I guess and I'm
just going to pull that dab that right
along the lash line seriously so I
didn't use Milani eyeshadow primer today
and I didn't use black liquid liner my
whole equilibrium is going to be thrown
off this does make a pretty solid
eyeliner though I gotta say
and for some reason I don't feel like
going too heavy on the lower lashline
like I'm going to kind of hit a little
bit of this like right on the outermost
part and then I think I'll smudge it
with a bit of the brown
so to finish the eye look I am going to
put some mascara on I've got some false
lashes here and I'm kicking myself
because they're not I don't think these
are demi whispies they're longer and a
little bit wispier than that but I'm
going to pop those on and then join you
for the lips so my lashes are on I
really like the way the flared out
shadow works with a lash that's in that
similar shape and then lips are going to
come from a palette - this is an Urban
Decay vice lit palette they have two
versions and this is the one called
junkie and I got to say this is one of
the most thoughtfully and well put
together lip palette I've ever seen
mirror up here a window that will open
up this way so there's no chance of
getting any messiness on your mirror I
swear a person with a real like problem
with making messes came up with this
thing a retractable lip brush is in here
also so that just works like that it's a
fantastic lip brush
there is really no chance for this
palette to get all gunked up and nasty
between the retractable lip brush the
window here is just really thoughtfully
designed I think the other day I was
playing with this color called studded
and today I think I want to do more of
like a purpley lip so I'm going to use a
combination of vanity kills that's this
kind of light lilac and mix it with
speedball which is right next door there
are definitely some more like kind of
fun and unexpected shades in this lip
palette and the other version is the
same nice design you know it just has a
few more like safe colors there's a lot
of neutral in that some reds now I'm
going into the more purpley color hmmm
that's intense this is the fun thing
about lip palette you know some of them
are designed in such a way where I'm
like okay they didn't give you a brush
or they didn't give you a mirror or they
make it completely not travel-friendly
and while this has some size to it at
least I feel like all the necessary
elements are there
okay hair is done purple lips because
why the heck not do whatever lip color
you want obviously but yeah this is kind
of fun to do something different hope
you enjoyed this video using nothing but
pallets I think it will be fun to do
maybe another one of these after the
holidays and integrate like all holiday
pallets or something like that not
necessarily a difficult challenge but
something where I think in certain ways
you have to get a little bit more
creative like maybe with the brows or
the eyeliner and just depending on what
kinds of palettes you own but one new
thing that I definitely wanted to
address in this video were the Tarte
palettes honestly neither one of these I
totally hit it down the middle for me
there are bits and pieces of them that I
really like for example I love the
contouring products in this tardis pro
glow and I thought you know certain
highlights look nice you can mix and
match and do whatever but I thought to
make this palette really worth its while
like I would have rather seen more
variety in those four highlights or if
this is the way it's going to be you
know just give me one glowy highlight
the cream contour the powder contour and
just call it a day and then the
eyeshadow palette I feel like I really
prefer them that side of this I don't
think the shimmers really knocked my
socks off that much so it's nice that it
is majority matte if you're going to
look at it that way and I think you know
the colorful pops are super wearable for
someone who's just kind of dipping their
toe into color
you know the rusty colors the plums the
Burgundy I think it's a really nice
balance of dark medium and light but I
kind of wish they would have done
something more or something different
with those shimmers along the right-hand
side I don't think they add as much a
variety to the looks as I would have
hoped to think to the lorac Pro palette
sand they're you know you're getting a
nice spectrum of your mats but you're
also getting shimmers in just really
good shades to have shimmers and you
know and the variety is so totally there
the shades are absolutely gorgeous so if
you were considering like this type of
palette or the lorac Pro palette like
lorac pro one particularly I would go
with the lorac but thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch I hope you
enjoyed and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
