thought I might do my best in beauty
video for the month a little bit
differently and actually do a full faced
application of the favorite products
because when I got to looking at all the
things that I loved over the course of
the month it nearly covered an entire
face so I'll point everything out as I
go and kind of talk about it as I put it
on so I've already got my skin all
prepped and everything oh the foundation
that I've probably been wearing most the
past month is from ELF and it's their
flawless finish SPF 15 foundation in
sand and this is the kind of thing like
I had it around for quite a while never
really dug into it and then more
recently purchased it as part of a whole
day recently but it's been you know some
months and I find that this is a really
like adequate foundation it's the way
I'd put it and that might not sound like
amazing but as you see with the
concealer that I put on top I feel like
I can wear get away with wearing almost
any foundation all over the skin my skin
has been pretty good lately like pretty
even and doesn't necessarily require the
fullest coverage but this does the job
you know and I just kind of like
thinking yeah I'm wearing a foundation
from health today and it's lasting all
day and it's doing what I need it to do
and as you will see the concealer is the
real MVP here that's the one coming in
and really like saving me in coverage
areas where I need it but this works too
and this is what I've just been kind of
reaching for the most so I do about a
pump and just a little extra and then
dab that around sand is a really good
skin tone match for me
and do you guys remember when I used my
insta pop brushes in the get ready with
me video and I was talking about this
cheek brush and how it would be a good
size for foundation and indeed it is I
do like using this brush to apply
foundation just a nice little soft
angled size
but I feel like this foundation I mean
if you've used it you can chime in but I
feel like it's just the epitome of
medium coverage really just regular
foundation you know regular liquid
classic liquid I would say it's kind of
a matte finish but it doesn't look too
drying and yeah it's just kind of
satisfying to think that you can find a
workable foundation from a brand like
elf and now the concealer that I have
been using so much and been so happy
with the look I've been getting is my
Tarte shaped ape and this is nothing new
you know like I've had this around a
while I'll bounce around and try some
different things always end up coming
back to this light medium is my shade my
perfect shade and I love spreading it
out with a flat foundation brush so
that's what I'm gonna do now and this is
you know the reason why I feel like I
can wear a lot of foundations that might
not have just amazing coverage because
this is gonna tackle my problem areas
and it's gonna stay really well and
that's a huge point about this like so
many concealers look great right when
you blend them out and then they just
don't last during the day and this ends
up looking so fresh all day I'm just so
happy with it and look at this coverage
on my under eye here I mean the amount
of brightening and I just love how this
flat brush just kind of spreads it out I
applied a little bit more today than I
usually do it's like you're talking
about it and you're so excited you just
have to slap a bunch of it on but I like
how this brush see how it takes it
precisely up to my lower lash line so
you're getting brightness coverage in
all that area and then I get it around
my nose as well so what tackles redness
too on my chin and I also had a little
on my nose there and then just kind of
blend that up toward my forehead I tell
you what if I were still doing news this
product would be the godsend that I
would use every day you know so good and
if I'm having what feels like a really
bad dark circle I've often times paired
this with my benefit erase paste and
y'all dab that product or it's boying
brightening concealer now but I'll dab
that underneath and it doesn't affect
the staying power or the look of this at
all but it just gives me a little added
color correction but
on the whole daily like this is kind of
the makeup routine now for powder I
haven't really picked out a favorite
powder of the month so to speak because
I have been trying to experiment with
some different ones when I did my shot
my stache video I mentioned how I'm
trying my cover FX and I am but I'm also
kind of wanting to compare that against
my Laura Mercier which I know is like
the tried-and-true baking favorite but I
guess my point here with what I'm doing
right now is that I have been baking too
I've been you know doing this kind of
heavy powder step on top of the
concealer and just being so thrilled
with the way the staying power is just
the flawless look of everything and
Laura Mercier is no doubt best for that
I just hadn't specifically selected this
as like a monthly favorite because I've
been trying to bounce around and try new
things too I've also got one from
Maybelline that I'm trying to get into
the mix and see if that can hang with
these others it's the Maybelline fit me
loose powder so we'll see I just put
this anywhere I kind of went to Brighton
and then I let that sit and it may not
be as much baked as you see on every one
or maybe it's more sometimes I can just
set the under-eye area quickly with like
just any powder if I want to but this is
kind of that flawless step that I've
been trying to do then I'm going to move
on to brows and I didn't really pull a
brow favorite either so I'm just gonna
go from my kaboodle my shot my stash and
use my Tarte arch architect and this is
the brow pencil and gel and it's got one
of those little teardrop shaped brow
pencils in here so it does kind of fill
in quickly sort of a universal taupey
brown color cool brown
some of you might be wondering how's
life in that Aircast
since you broke your foot yeah I broke
my foot on Halloween night it was like 6
o'clock and bob has gotten the girls
down in the van and getting everything
loaded up and we're gonna do this thing
called the pumpkin path in town that's
like where they've shut down Main Street
and you can go around to businesses and
everybody's walking around having a good
time and we did that last year it was so
fun and so that I'm realizing well if
we're gonna put even the stroller for
that I better have a little blanket for
it so I run back into the house grab the
blanket head downstairs so this incident
happens where I fall down the stairs on
our basement you know leading down
stairs area and we've got about five
stairs and then a little landing and
then the longer flight of stairs and I
guess if you want to call any part of
this fortunate which I do I'm very
grateful that because this could have
been worse a fall down the stairs can be
serious and I could have been holding a
kid too I mean granted I probably
wouldn't have been trying to fly down
the stairs as fast as I was and I don't
even know it's one of those moments
where you're like why was I in a big
hurry anyway
like why am I going so fast but anyway I
had my little like black flats on and I
must have hit like the second step in
that little short set of our stairs and
my heel just kind of went out from under
me for a second and then I think I
brought it back in and it all happened
so fast
it just went wobbly I remember that you
know that kind of sick feeling you feel
where you know you've just turned your
ankle although I'm not even certain
which direction I turned it for all this
to go down but I fell and I'm sitting
there now on the landing area
fortunately that's where the fall and
you know in a series of just a few steps
and then boom I was done and so then I
hobble down the rest of him and I get in
the van and I'm like I think I rolled my
ankle you know I kind of really wanted
to still do the pumpkin path so I got in
the car and oops like are you okay I was
like oh I'll just see when I get out
next you know how bad it feels and as
soon as I put weight on it when we got
out at the Downtown thing I thought I
can't do this I can
even walk around and put weight on this
so we ended up going back to Nana and
Papa's neighborhood and I just hung out
inside with a little bit thank goodness
mom and dad were able to help me out
then iced my foot Tyler took Belle
trick-or-treating around so she got her
fill of that experience next morning and
there's actually an orthopedic urgent
care around here which is kind of cool
because they've got all the x-ray
capability and everything and it's not
like really going to the full-on ER but
they are more specialized than regular
Urgent Care and so they x-rayed me right
away that morning and they could tell
there was a little fracture in my
navicular bone which is kind of like
where the foot and the ankle come
together and she said like the ligament
was pulling and it kind of pulled up on
the bone or something I don't know but
sometimes at this point I'd like to say
long story short no it's been a long
story but I will be in this Aircast boot
type thing for a month I guess I feel a
little bit grateful that it is what it
is because she was saying like if it
were a certain kind of sprain that I did
and I could be in this air cast for six
weeks you know I don't know if any of
y'all have had a lot of ankle injuries
but sometimes a break can be I guess a
little easier to deal with than a sprain
sometimes but there are tons of little
bones in your foot and I just broke one
and getting around in this cast has not
been easy like it's so bulky it's heavy
it you know it feels hot it makes me
itch like it just mm-hmm I really need
to get some kind of countdown going
until the day I can get this off like as
of Wednesday but this week it'll have
been one week one week of for having my
mom and dad around it has been very very
helpful obviously because I'm trying to
do as much as I can and I'm completely
the type who will tend to overdo and try
to think I can do more than I can and
stuff like that so to have some extra
hands here to deal with two kids
throughout the day has been huge um
let's get back to the actual topic at
hand here which is the favorites okay
this does anybody remember when I did my
super duper luxury video and I used this
gear lon terracotta sand
trio palette in natural and I think I
was kind of like it's an average bronzer
whatever well I keep reaching for this
all the time and the smell it smells
kind of like I don't want to say
grandma's smell it smells like the scent
that a classy mature refined person
might wear it really does not pertain to
Grandma but it's it's just a scent that
you don't expect to get out of a bronzer
okay and it smells really good and I
find that I'm opening this compact when
I'm doing something else makeup wise
just to pick up the smell and then the
product actually really fantastic
bronzer here like it's got the bronzer
part the dart part this little light
part which I will end up using so I kind
of first go for the bottom and I get
that working all around my hairline and
this is just matte you know but it's
pigmented I kind of am able to do one
pass over certain areas and I feel like
okay I'm good but yeah this is the
classic example of a product that's just
grown on me
you know it's just grown on me I do
really like the smell maybe the only
thing that should come from this because
you can get other bronzers that can do
what this does but maybe if you're in a
Sephora or like in a store with luxury
makeup counters just pick one of these
up and smell it just so you can try to
understand what I'm saying here I end up
taking the bronzer part down my neck to
onto my chest and you might have also
noticed like beyond the baking I don't
really feel the need to put a lot of
powder on and then I actually do find
myself tapping into this little light
shade which is matte so it's gonna be
kind of like a matte highlighter and it
actually does brighten a ton and I kind
of put this on the top of my cheekbone
now for blush I've been having a lot of
fun when I haven't been testing some
other certain palette like for holiday
or something like that I've been having
a lot of fun playing with my NARS liquid
blushes and I would say my couple of my
favorite shades I really like dolce vita
it's a nice like deep rosy shade that I
think could be so so intense for a
variety of skin tones and it can be very
light too like a light rose on a fair
skin tone but today I'm going to be
using torrid it's a really nice like
rich peach shade and so I get a little
on my hand I go for as little of a pump
as I can do and it still ends up being
plenty I get it on a synthetic brush
that's just a full brush not a stipple
brush and I just start blending this out
on my cheeks and it's so much color it
looks so fresh and it's like light as
air it's just so beautiful mmm isn't
that pretty just the intensity of the
color and the application a brush like
this is totally what you want to use and
I talked about this in a video too
but if you're into like peachy eye looks
or an eye look that incorporates any
amount of warmth I think a fresh peach
each eek like this is totally the way to
go look at that how juicy and fabulous
then I'm gonna take my essence pure nude
highlighter kind of rediscovered this
when I did my video talking about Target
bestsellers and this is actually one of
the best-selling products at Target so
it's a nice like subtle highlight this
is an Emily award winner last year it's
so pretty
like you get the affective glow but it's
not shouting at you really it looks like
that is believable skin that's that's
the way this can be summed up in a
nutshell and so when I apply highlight
these days I kind of like to put it on
basically where I want it and then buff
over it because it's amazing with just a
little extra attention to your blending
of the highlight can do that is just so
pretty and fresh like just in real life
I don't know if it's all translating on
camera this is really the highlight you
want if you don't want to exaggerate
stuff around your eyes like if you got
lines pores around your nose just any
problem area this does not make it worse
this is my proof I've been using my
Milani make it last setting spray and I
can confirm I really really like this I
told you guys I would report back I
would try to use this a lot throughout
the month and see how it did it has
proven to be really good in a lot of
different situations there were some
times where I thought maybe that's just
the foundation or you know maybe there
were other factors at play that made my
makeup wear well that day and I do think
that's a thing I think it's hard to put
all the responsibility for the staying
power of a look on the backs of the
setting sprays because then they're just
not going to be doing it all but they
can help and I do think this helps and
it also gives me a little bit fresher
appearance on the skin and I noticed
this one I do really matte looks so it's
not super confusing like when I've got a
bold highlight on and then I'm like did
the setting spray make me do a or where
did that come from this takes away a
little bit of the powdery look on my
skin but just to a small extent it's not
as glowy as you
the hard candy and different Mario
Badescu ones that I've used but I use
you know four sprays maybe four to six
sprays and I'm really happy with how
fresh and nice everything looks and I do
think it helps with a more locked-in
staying power but they also sell
something called make it Dewey and now
I'm compelled to want to try that and
see how different it is and if that
still enhances staying power or just how
do we will it make me look I don't know
but I do really like this and as far as
a drugstore setting spray I think it's
getting close to what the all-nighter
and easlick have done I mean D slick has
done downright miraculous things for me
and you might think why are you even
using D slick you don't have especially
oily skin well I have a travel size of
it so any time I travel like that's the
setting spray that usually goes with me
and I've used it times when an that you
know may not be my ideal product but I
put it on anyway and the staying power
is so tremendous with that so this may
not be quite on that level but it's
really really close I think it's done
some good things for me over the month
getting a little bit of primer on my
lids here and then I want to mention my
eye product favorite got a couple
two-faced things coming out here my just
peachy mattes
okay I love this palette I really love
this palette I have truly been bouncing
around to a lot of different holiday
palettes that I've been reviewing for
you guys this is the thing that in my
in-between times I want to come back to
it this is like when you come home at
the end of a day and you just want to
curl up in that comfy blanket or put on
that one comfy pair of PJ's like this is
my comfort palette I feel like I have an
emotional connection to like every shade
in this palette I love it so much I love
the all matte look I love the berries
that are in here all the peaches the
soft Browns it's here for me when I want
a natural look
it's gorgeous when I want to take it
deeper and more dramatic with either the
dark berry or the dark brown or the
really dark brown so it's just
everything that I want to be using these
days and guess what it pairs so nicely
with one of my favorite lip products of
the month which is the melted matte in
gingerbread man so this is Too Faced
special holiday lip and it's so cool
because it's like a rest
red rusty orangie red and it looks great
with the shades in the peach palette and
this formula tube-like where if I Benton
but I discovered these when I tried the
candy Johnson line because several
mattes came out with that I'm like wow
this is comfortable
this has good staying power I guys stop
talking so I can apply this
as you can see this is kind of a bold
shade it does have a little bit of a
scent to it as well and I like to put
that on before the eyes so I can kind of
bring my eyes to the level I want them
you know not make them too loud with
this look but I have been reaching for
liquid lipsticks a lot this past month
and it's kind of out of character for me
I'm more of a creamy lipstick person you
know like that's my top choice but when
you uncover some good ones it's like
that's what you want to go for and I
predict in the coming month I'm gonna be
all about my little L'Oreal set of the
mini Pro matte glosses that I talked
about in my last video you've got to see
that anyway I got this shade and I've
also been wearing these so much my Gen
nude from bareMinerals the send nudes
trio shades are getting by the way hemp
is the lightest your middle shade is XYZ
and then swank is this deeper one and
they're fun to kind of blend together
and get different looks and they are so
so comfortable and then I'm going to
throw out something that I'm gonna call
my purse pic because this has been
living in my purse for on-the-go
touch-ups and it's been Mac's teddy bear
lipstick goes with anything seriously
could live in anyone's purse and I think
you'd be content with your living
touch-ups throughout the day gonna throw
another favorite Hatcher right here my I
pop set a duo of brushes from Real
Techniques I talked about these at
length in my last get ready with me
video but one of them they call the
insta pop shade brush and one is the
insta pop crease brush do you see the
soft angle on these it's so perfect it's
so perfect to reach all areas of your
eye to really pack in shadow in certain
places where you need it
I mean it's so so good the little one
particularly is nice because it can hit
your lower lashline and do a really good
job first thing I'm gonna do is go to
fresh-picked down here and I'm using
that larger brush I'm just gonna hit my
crease with that lightly
it's just crazy how fast it creates the
look doesn't hurt that these shadows are
super easy to manage as well and the
trees right now where I live I don't
know y'all who live around me in
southern Illinois who have been here
even longer than I have like do you
remember a more colorful fall than what
we're having right now I mean I've been
down here since 2006 and I generally I
feel like take a lot of note of what
nature is doing around me and I love
watching the leaves turn colors but it
is absolutely brilliant down here right
now I love it so much okay I took peach
butter by the way that's the shade that
I'm using to just kind of blend out the
crease and get it nice and soft and this
is gonna be kind of a soft look with
this today I think I've done plenty of
more dramatic looks but I'm gonna do a
little peach cobbler now with the small
brush now see how good this does for
packing on oh it's so good it's just
exactly where I want it if you are a
small eyed person you would live for
this fresh
see how that shade right there that
peach cobbler color gave me depth but
it's not really you know it's not as
dark as the whole pallet can go but it's
doing some really beautiful things
without being super deep I'm gonna brush
off my brush a little bit here I'm going
to pick up peach meringue and I'm just
gonna Pat this on my lid
and then I'm going to do my little trick
where you flip your brush around and you
just go straight into the like the peak
of this brush into your product I'm
going to go into fresh-picked
I'm going to do a little bit of this on
my lower lash line
but you see what I mean about that kind
of color working so well with a rusty
lip and it great then this isn't
particularly a favorite I mean I love it
but I love it like every single month
every single look so I didn't pick it
for this video necessarily but it's my
wet and wild ultimate brow highlight
right there in the lower inner rim for
brightness because you do go surrounding
your eye with these ultra warm tones I
think it can help to brighten up your
waterline with something a little
different then I'm going to curl my
lashes with my tweezer Minh Pro curl
lash curler by the way if you're looking
for something to get in that Sephora
sale I probably mentioned a lot of
things in this video that you could get
from the Sephora sale and in other
videos too but um this lash curler my
word it fits my lash line so well I've
been using this for months now I think
it's wonderful and it's especially made
for round eyes I haven't always thought
of myself as having the roundest eyes
ever but it like it gets in touch with
the entire lash line so well and then
I'm gonna use my voluminous Lashkar ADIZ
blackest black mystic black guys is a
no-go talk about burying the lede in
this video but yeah mystic black and I
did not get along I thought that thing
dried out so fast as anybody else had
this experience backing it up a little
bit and they sell a version of this
mascara called mystic black and you're
gonna wonder like oh well why not get
mystic black you know I want to look
mystical or whatever the heck that means
so you get it and it's just in slightly
different like outer packaging but
otherwise the tube looks the same as
this and so I'd been using that on and
off and I thought it dried out way too
quick and it just didn't build on itself
like I'm all for a slightly on the dry
side mascara you know cuz I think they
do tend to build on themselves a little
bit better than the super wet slippery
ones but this one it wasn't dry in a
good way and it was getting chunky and
just not at all like the regular I did
not expect that much of a difference
guys and now I'm back to a tube of
blackest black and we're friends again I
love it
I just share that with you guys I mean
maybe I just got a really bad tube but I
feel like maybe they packed in some sort
of extra pigment into that mystic black
and it just made it a really derive
formula but I thought it was good for
the first couple of times I put it on
maybe the first week but it went
downhill fast I was surprised
so I've got a little bit careless there
and I got some on my eyelid never do
this you try to just remove most of the
smudge and then you put a little more
shadow on to help yourself out and then
I'm just gonna do a little clump crusher
water assistant on lower lashes this
would fall into that category of always
a favorite always a my staff doesn't
move doesn't flake doesn't smudge so
yeah on that note I'm going to take my
hair out of my clip by the way a new
favorite that I'm loving in the shower
right now candy Johnson has come out
with and some different like I guess you
might call him holiday sense of the OGX
shampoo and conditioner and I got the
apple cider one and it smells so good I
don't think I've ever had a shampoo that
contains kind of a cinnamon tea scent a
little bit and that is so so good the
shampoo and the conditioner love but
yeah this is my full face Tryon of the
fall favorites for you guys yeah I guess
they're technically October favorites
but you could call those fall favorites
again love the pairing of any kind of
peachy eyeshadow with a deep rusty red
lip so nice let me know in the comments
section what products you've been loving
and I will see you guys very soon in my
next video bye
well could is who just wants to sneak in
at the end of my videos just to just to
be safe
