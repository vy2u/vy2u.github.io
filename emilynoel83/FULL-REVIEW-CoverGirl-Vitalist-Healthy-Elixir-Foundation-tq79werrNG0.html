a new foundation it's from covergirl
it's called the vitalist healthy elixir
foundation if this sounds familiar I did
mention it in my haul video that I did
recently and this says it's a foundation
with vitamins right here on the bottle
it says EB 3 and b5 this does have
broad-spectrum SPF 20 sunscreen in it
and I wear it in the shade creamy
natural I would say it's a pretty darn
close shade match but it is just a
little bit on the peachy side so while
it's pretty good depth wise it's just
the tone is slightly off but this is an
oil-free foundation it says on the back
and it claims that this foundation is
going to be lightweight full coverage
and hydrating so those are three claims
that don't necessarily always go
together and a lot of foundations so I
want to share my review with you today
this is a full-on review it's not first
impression I've been wearing this
foundation on and off now for between
two and three weeks so I've got a pretty
good indication of whether my skin is
having any problems with it sometimes
you got to give your skin a little bit
of time to see just you know is it going
to have some kind of weird change in
relation to the new foundation you're
wearing first off let's just talk about
the packaging here it's a glass bottle
it does have a pump you've got this cap
which I find I'm already getting kind of
messy just with product from the pump it
kind of touches up with the end of that
pump but the top of the foundation does
lock so if you want to do away with this
entirely you might feel comfortable with
that but yeah no problems for me in
terms of the packaging of this I do love
a pump because I think when you start to
understand how much of the foundation
you want to use you can really be
consistent with it when there's a pump
so for example with this I found that
one pump seems to be adequate to get all
over my face and give me what I think is
an acceptable coverage level for the
foundation so I'm able to stay with that
every time I use it and I guess that
will roll right into the application of
this product so I'll show you this going
on I do find it very easy to apply I've
used both a Beauty Blender and a brush
but I do find that a brush like a dense
foundation brush kind of like a Sigma
f80 tends to be what maintains the most
coverage with this foundation now that a
Beauty Blender doesn't look pretty with
this but
I do think I get the most coverage out
of it with a brush so I like to just
kind of patch the product all over my
skin and then I just use the brush to
buff in everywhere and it's easy to
blend I don't feel like it sets too
quickly and one of the things that I
really love about this foundation is the
finished look right after I did it all
blended in I feel like it looks awfully
skin like you know it does definitely
even out some skintone issues here and
there but the look on the skin just the
appearance of my skin after I've got
this on looks really fresh doesn't look
too makeup he doesn't appear to be
clinging to any areas of dryness because
I have a few of those here and there and
yeah it's just a really good looking
foundation right at the onset going back
to several of those claims that they
have in the bottle you know is it
lightweight yes I do think it feels
lightweight the consistency of this
foundation is like a pretty traditional
liquid you know it's not too thick it's
not as runny as water but it's you know
a relatively thin liquid foundation is
it full coverage though I would say no
to me this is a strong medium coverage I
do think it's kind of buildable there
have been times where I've gone back and
added a little extra here and there I
think I've improved the coverage but
this is doing pretty much what a lot of
medium coverage foundations do for me
it's giving me a much more even skin
tone overall but when I look for more
pinpointed things like little freckles
what I know about on my skin I kind of
get an up-close look I can see that
those are still very apparent it's not
doing much for anything really happening
on my under eye and there are most
definitely full coverage foundations out
there that do take care of those types
of issues but I do agree with the
hydrating claim on this I don't find it
to be hydrating like right after I apply
it it's not like oh my skin is just
super sticky like a little bit of a
slight tackiness but it's nothing
unusual for a liquid foundation if you
like to see that kind of thing smoothed
out and you like your finish of your
face to be a little more matte and soft
you could definitely top it off with a
powder this is not the kind of thing
that looks luminous because of any sort
of flexing or anything but it just looks
healthy and skin light and like I said
you've got that option of applying more
powder on top and modifying it a bit
more but
there is kind of a deal breaker for me
with this in terms of staying power and
I do think we're going into the time of
year we're staying power is probably the
most challenging you know the time of
year when you're outside a little bit
more the elements you know are a bit
more of a factor in terms of your
staying power of your makeup a little
more humidity in the air but I'm really
not a big fan of the way this wears on
my skin I feel like I'm a pretty much
overall normal skin type and most
foundations you know don't fight me too
much on that you know like I don't get
super oily with a lot of things but this
one I found it really does break down on
my skin by about midday and that's kind
of soon I think for this like if I'm
putting it on at between 5:00 and 6:00
in the morning and I look at my skin at
noon I see quite a bit of breakdown in
this product and it's mostly around the
notes and size of the notes but also
kind of around the mouth chin area maybe
even a little on the forehead so having
given this foundation a pretty good shot
just using it on its own with very
little setting powder not bringing in
different primers with it that's kind of
my base situation that this gives me so
as I've experimented with this I've
adjusted what I've done a little bit and
I've used the Smashbox pore minimizing
primer underneath it which if you're not
familiar with all of Smashbox as primers
like that's a very different primer
compared to regular photo finish it has
kind of a beige II look to it and it's a
little bit like benefits professional
only I think quite a bit smoother than
that and this has helped certain
foundations that have given me trouble
in terms of staying power so this has
helped this a little bit it's kind of
odd it's like it gives this foundation
just a little more time I feel like the
foundation might look a little fresher
longer like maybe later in the afternoon
I start to see the bit of breakdown
instead of like at noon but eventually
it gets there and I'm just not in a
place right now you know taking care of
a couple of little kids
I'm not continually wanting to touch up
there are many products that I can use
that don't make me feel the need to
touch up so that's really what it's come
to with foundations these days there are
things that really can last all day and
look good now what about powder on top
of this I've set this a little and I've
said it a lot and what I've kind of
settled on overall is just doing a
little bit
t-zone setting powder because as this
starts to wear down it's not like it
completely disappears it might look like
it's disappeared let's say from right
here on my nose but then I start looking
at the creases around my nose and I'm
seeing foundation powder like you know
how it looks after you've worn it it's
like you can just see makeup collecting
in different areas and I think that's
some foundation and probably some powder
too so when I'm a little lighter with
the powder I don't see quite as much of
that going on I guess is what I'm trying
to say but at the same time a little bit
of powder in certain areas I think can
help and sure you could probably improve
the look of things if you wanted to take
the time and do a mid-day touch-up you
know do a little powder do a little
blotting that might help but I think
there are some people who have time for
that and who recognize that might be
something they actually would
realistically do and then there are some
of us who know more there's no time so I
think you kind of got to assess your own
situation there but I was a little
disappointed for the fact that my skin
is not terribly oily at all and this
made me look pretty oily by about midway
through so I think if you're extremely
oily this may not be your best friend at
all if you're more dry I'd love to hear
your feedback in the comments how was
the staying power for you I suspect
maybe you'd have a better experience
even than I had but overall I would say
this foundation falls somewhere in the
average category for me you know I've
definitely tried things that has been
worse
but I've tried a whole lot of things
that are better and the first thing that
comes to mind was something I just
recently talked about in a video which
is the Rimmel lasting finish foundation
you know this really accomplishes a lot
of what this does for looking so good
right after you apply it and looking so
skin like but I feel like I get a little
more coverage out of this and I get much
better staying power so there's just
like one example so what I'm going to do
with this now that I have it I probably
am going to still wear it from time to
time maybe do a little mixing with some
different foundations to improve the
tone of it even more even though it's
not like too far off it's not terrible
but I think I could improve that a
little bit and maybe even help the
staying power by combining it with
different things so it's definitely not
going to be a go-to for me on a day when
I'm like you know I need this makeup to
look as flawless as possible all day
long
no I'm not having that expectation out
of this foundation it will look really
good right at the start and maybe for
the first few hours of where but there
is a definite like breakdown point for
this on my skin and I didn't talk a
whole lot about price with this but I
mean I think I paid around eleven twelve
bucks for this at Ulta not exactly cheap
anyway where drugstore foundations are
concerned but I hope this review was
helpful to you guys if you're
considering this foundation I don't want
to be too big of a debbie downer on it
because everybody can have different
experiences with different products that
I just want to give you my take and
thank you guys so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
