full-coverage makeup it's all happening
in this video this is gonna be unlike
anything I've ever done because I am
actually trying on every single
foundation that I'm discussing in this
video so I can give you the best
description of what's going on and why
even talk about six well they are all
checking the boxes as being a foundation
that can create what I think of as
concealer optional skin it really just
100% evens out the face now there are
qualities about each that make each one
just a little bit different from the
next you know they're not all doing
identical things there are some things
that I think you should know that will
help you choose between these and figure
out what's right for you but I'm not
doing this video saying everyone needs
to be using a full coverage foundation
because not everybody does not everybody
a needs it or be once it I could
probably do this video all over again
talking about my favorite luminous
foundations or lightweight foundations
but I know how it feels to have
something on your face that you really
would like to cover up and you're just
trying to lay your hands on the best
thing to take care of it and I know
because I've lived the frustration of
going through so many different
foundations that market themselves as
full coverage like full coverage is in
the name of the product but then they
aren't timing-wise what made me want to
do this now is because I've noticed some
melasma kind of peaking through on my
cheeks maybe you've seen some in videos
where I've done like full face
applications and you've seen just a
little bit of like um it almost looks
like a sunspot really pronounced
freckles but it's more of like a patch
kind of happening right up in here and
that started coming upon me when I was
pregnant with Belle and then every
summer since regardless of whether I was
pregnant or not it just kept kind of
coming in I have to use really good
sunscreen but even still I can get
similar asthma coming through and no I'm
not pregnant now it's just something my
skin is really prone to doing now with
sun exposure so for me all of these
foundations tackle that issue anything
else I need to cover before I get
started here I've got six foundations
one of them is drugstore I'm sorry to
say there's just not a ton of drugstore
foundations that fall into this category
right now there's some that are closed
there are definitely some great
foundations out there from the drugstore
don't get me wrong but for this full
coverage
Euler optional skin there's one also
application wise you're gonna see me
applying these with different brushes I
do find that a brush is the best way to
maintain a foundations coverage you
could certainly use sponges with these
and using a sponge can even create a
more like natural finish on the skin
although it can sometimes take away a
little bit of your coverage from the
foundation if you really want to use
sponges with these go for it but you
might find yourself having to build up
the product a bit in your areas where
you need the absolute maximum coverage
you know what I'm saying you might need
to add in a little bit more you could
bounce over it with your sponge because
the sponge does take a little product
away and the moisture in the sponge can
just ever so slightly dilute things but
for my problem areas as you watch the
demos you might pick up on the fact that
if I'm using a buffing type brush I'm
going to do like a dabbing motion over
the areas where I really need that
fullest coverage and that's going to
kind of press the foundation into the
skin not just sweep it across and give
me like a sheer doubt coverage but it's
really gonna pack it in where I need it
most so that's a technique that across
the board with all of these products
works really well for maintaining
coverage in those certain areas and then
there might be other parts of your face
like maybe the lower cheek or wherever
it might be where you can go with a
little less and then I'll just kind of
buff buff buff in circular motions
there's no one special brush that you
have to have to make any of these work
that's why I kind of switched it up with
each one so you wouldn't feel like oh
I've got to have the foundation that I
have to have that certain brush I'm not
using any special primer underneath
these the only thing that's going on my
skin before each application is some of
this Clinique Moisture Surge intense
just because I really don't want my skin
to dry out too much with all of these
foundation on and off situations but
also I do think a good moisturizer
underneath so many of these matte finish
products will help you out a lot and it
will help you feel less dry I'm pretty
much normal skin type and I feel like I
benefit from something like this under
these foundations so much okay let's
jump in first what I'm going to talk
about is probably the first foundation
that I ever discovered that's really
truly in this category and it's the
Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
cover and I did use this in a video
where I was covering my Melania and I
wear this in the shade creamy tan and it
does have broad spectrum SPF 15
absolutely erase your flaws full
coverage this one is does everybody need
this level of coverage no but if this is
what you're looking for I mean it's
really really good the texture of it is
kind of unique and that it feels sort of
dry maybe some might describe the
texture as on the verge of being a
mousse like because there's just a
little dryness to it it's not like your
standard traditional liquid foundation
and what I do find with this as well the
coverage is so so satisfying I mean it
really is full you have to work kind of
quickly because it sets in on the skin
very fast to the point where if you're
not super confident with your foundation
blending abilities I might only put
product on a part of the skin work on
blending that out then put something on
the next part of your skin because I
felt like in my demo here I was really
like bouncing around just to try to keep
the product moving even before I fully
blended out one cheek I was like trying
to move on just so things wouldn't start
setting in on the other cheek you know
what I'm saying so I think you really do
have to watch yourself on that
application and be quick with it but
it's very matte and it's very full
coverage and I wouldn't highly recommend
this to someone who has very dry skin
because there is that like I said
element of dryness to the texture of
this foundation already so if you're
dealing with dry patches I think this is
only going to exaggerate it but once
you're done putting it on I gotta say it
requires a no additional concealer now
in reality I'm probably going to use
some sort of concealer type product or
maybe even just a brightener product up
in this area because I like to create
contrast I don't really want just the
complete flatness but I'm not using that
concealer to achieve more coverage on my
skin is my point there I might use some
just to kind of give my my cheekbone
area a little bit of a boost or whatever
I'm not feeling pressured to pull for
the concealer to compensate for what the
foundation didn't get done next
foundation is one that I discovered I
don't know maybe a year or two after the
S Day
and it's the Urban Decay all nighter
which I wear in shade 4.5 this
foundation does have a pump and I'll use
one full pump of it what I love about
this foundation so much is that it
achieves the Estee Lauder light coverage
but it's in a more natural Foundation II
texture it's a little more liquidy and I
don't feel like I have to work with it
quite as fast granted you're not going
to want to take forever on your
application here but for those who are
used to working with just a typical
liquid foundation that's kind of what
this is it's a little bit more on the
thick side of a typical liquid and I
really adore the coverage of this I
think it does come off on the skin
looking a bit more natural than the
Estee Lauder one thing that I know I've
heard people complain about what this
foundation is the fact that it can
oxidize on your skin and I haven't
experienced that much maybe a little bit
but I think a factor in that is what's
the thickness of product you're using on
the skin are you trying to get by with
the minimum like just one pump or are
you laying it on a lot I tend to feel
like that's one way you can help any
sort of oxidizing situation is to really
not go to too thick with the application
of product and then you really might not
notice it so much but I love this it
doesn't take a lot of product to get
that great coverage and another kind of
high point for pretty much all of these
foundations across the board is staying
power they're great coverage and they
also hang on the skin really really well
both of these are just so hardcore where
that's concerned
now the next one I'm going to talk about
and this is the one I've most recently
discovered and I just have a little
sample of it right here and I did get a
PR box that had every single shade there
are 50 shades in this foundation from
Shiwei it's called the essential high
coverage cream foundation and I have it
in the shade cameo I've already gone
ahead and placed my order for the full
size of cameo this is an outstanding
foundation what really sets this apart
it's giving me that fantastic full
coverage of the last two but it's the
thinnest full coverage foundation I've
ever encountered I'm surprised they
refer to it as like a cream foundation
because the instant thing that pops into
my mind when I hear cream in relation to
a foundation is thickness and it truly
manages to be quite thin it's very
easily blendable across the skin and I
kind of come away feeling
like while the other two are insanely
matte this one is a little step away
from that I wouldn't even call it
natural in skin because it's still mad
still matte foundation but like as I
turned my head when I've got this on I
can just see a bit more dimension
happening but yet I've still got all the
coverage so the G way I was very very
impressed with I didn't notice it
changing colors on my skin it looks
super fresh on my skin all day and I'm
referencing this from hey overall normal
skin type and I had that Florida trip
and the sunburn and everything like that
messed with my skin a little bit and
kind of over dried me for a period of
time even on my face where I didn't burn
I just felt extra dry for a while now
things are pretty much getting back to
normal where my skin type is I might get
just a little oily around the t-zone but
overall I'm just pretty normal now we're
gonna move into a foundation that is
kind of a different consistency compared
to everything else but it's a really
great product it's even-steven from the
balm and it comes in a pretty small jar
I remember when I got this I thought
whoa are they really like skimping on
what they should be giving me here but a
little bit goes a long way with this
they call it whipped foundation I wear
it in the shade light/medium i am
shocked that they're not promoting this
more as such a one and done just
complete coverage foundation it's so
good if you're familiar with like
Maybelline Dream matte mousse that's
kind of a dry whipped texture I do like
that foundation but it's something that
definitely requires kind of working in
and melting down into the skin this is
kind of like a lightweight cream is what
this feels like and spread it across the
skin blend it in with a Beauty Blender
if you want of course you can use a
dense brush any method works for it
because again it's not like a dry mousse
it is a lightweight full coverage cream
and the downfall what this might be
shape selection I don't recall there
being many shades to choose from it's a
very matte finish on the skin but it
really does kind of cover everything I
gotta say it's kind of strange when you
look at it in this format and you think
well what's the equivalent to that like
from these foundations that come in
tubes and bottles and I would say
thickness wise it's probably somewhere
between the Estee Lauder and the urban
decay it doesn't feel quite as Santa
when you're dipping in with your finger
you could of course use a spatula or
something but it's a little bit nicer
when you have total control over the
amount you're using with a pump or at
least a squeeze tube where you can kind
of get used to consistency with your
application and knowing okay this is
about how much I need for a
full-coverage face to get everywhere on
my skin so the packaging is a little bit
of a con with this that the product
itself is really quite good and I've
also had great staying power with it
just like the other three okay two more
to go the next one is one that's kind of
rediscovered for me in my collection and
it's from laura geller and it's called
cover lock cream foundation now I have
this in the shade light and as you'll
see once I roll the demo it's a little
bit peachy on me but yet once it blends
in I feel like the skin looks absolutely
gorgeous and this is a completely full
coverage foundation that's not quite as
matte as any of the other ones I'm
talking about if your skin is the driest
of the dry this would be the one I'd
steer you in the direction of because
it's got more moisture a more emollient
texture than anything else and it shows
once you've got it blended in on your
skin it's just got a little different
look to it that's not quite so flat and
it has nothing to do with luminosity in
the formula or shimmer or anything in
there it's just the texture of the
product it's really really creamy has
just got some moisture in there but it's
very full coverage a sponge is great
with this product but a brush really
maintains that coverage the best like
I've said of any of the foundations this
would be the one that I feel the need to
set the most and even just being normal
skin I can still get a little oily
around the t-zone and I definitely
benefit from putting some powder on top
of this doesn't have to be a ton but I
just feel a little more comfortable
taking control of you know that finish
of the product on my skin and making it
not quite so dewy but I'm happy to be
talking about this because I think you
know dry skin needs an option for
coverage as well but laura geller did a
great great job with this foundation and
I hope it never goes away now the last
foundation that I want to talk about is
the drugstore option that is truly truly
full coverage and yes I've tried I mean
if you've heard me talk about a found a
in the past it's gone into consideration
for this video the Milani conceal
imperfect that's a good one but it's not
as full coverage as this for me it's the
maybelline superstay full coverage 24
hour foundation today I'm wearing it in
warm nude that's the one that I've had
on my skin throughout this whole video
part where I've been talking it does
have a pump I've gone to a lighter shade
in this for a little while and now
they've got a little more color in my
skin warm nude is actually working for
me but well this is a really impressive
foundation I remember when the first
go-round of super state came out and I
was still living in the apartment so
we're talking within the first couple of
years of my channel was when superstay
first launched and I compared it a lot
with Revlon Colorstay but in that time
while those were good foundations they
are not the level of coverage that I'm
talking about here now I feel like
they've really made an improvement they
have stepped this product up so much and
the coverage is fantastic it feels like
you're putting on just a regular liquid
foundation in terms of thickness I feel
like the G Way is still a little thinner
than this but still I mean it's a kind
of a close call honestly between that
and super stay I have no trouble
blending this in it's gonna be mad on
the skin what I love to do really when
I've got one of these full coverage
matte foundations on is then make sure I
use some highlight that gives my skin
that glow back use a little setting
spray there are so many things you can
do to sort of work backwards a bit and
okay now I've got the coverage on my
skin but I want it to look all glowy and
nice there are plenty of ways you can
freshen it up but I love this product I
use very minimal powder with this
product I would say I make a point to
set my t-zone and I don't really bother
going elsewhere on the scene because it
just doesn't need it if you can find
your shade in this if you feel like this
works well with your skin and doesn't
cause you to break out or whatever this
is a really great option for full
coverage it can hang with these other
products that I'm talking about I feel
like I have fantastic staying power with
it and even having melasma to cover up
having you know pimples and redness and
stuff here and there I feel like I'm not
screaming for a concealer after I put
this on and that's really cool so
those my friends are my six foundations
that I own that I feel give me concealer
optional skin there's one more thing
that I'm going to throw out here that I
do think is a really good coverage but I
don't have it in the proper shade to
really prove to myself that it's the
best full coverage foundation so far
because it's this Kevyn Aucoin sensual
skin enhancer I have it in sxo five and
I feel like I can only get away with
using this color as sort of like a an
under eye concealer which I like it
there but it's pretty light when I try
to use that all over my skin so I feel
like I might need a shade darker to
truly test that all over my face but
this is really a potent little product
and I'm sensing when I use it on the
under eye like I understand why people
like this stuff so much but you know
what I've said about when you're trying
to camouflage things on your skin and
you go to light you can really just be
working against yourself because the
lightness only lightens the
discoloration it doesn't really
camouflages so it's important to really
have your right shade in everything that
I've been talking about here and really
match up with your skin tone well and
don't go to light don't overcorrect so
to speak because it won't do you any
favors and it will take away the true
effect that all of these foundations can
have coverage wise as always I would
love to hear your input in the comments
section what foundations have you tried
that I've talked about here do you have
any others to offer into the
conversation let me know and thank you
so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
