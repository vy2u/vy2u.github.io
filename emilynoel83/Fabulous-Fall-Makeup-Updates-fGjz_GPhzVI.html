I've had a lot of requests recently for
some videos on my favorite fall lip
products and I was just kind of thinking
you know how can I take that a step
further or do a little bit more with
that idea and I thought you know how
about some ways or some favorite
products to update your look for a big
make up rules person I don't think you
absolutely have to totally change your
makeup when the seasons change I mean
it's just kind of a fun thing to do if
you're looking to try something
different and I think it kind of helps
you get out of the makeup rut which we
can sometimes get into just using the
same kind of products all the time and
so maybe this video will just give you
some ideas of okay how can I make things
look a little different how can I make
some subtle fun changes for a new season
first thing that I love this time of
year is a really pretty rosy blush and
one of my favorite kinds is from ELF
and it is called blushing rose it's one
of the studio blushes and it is that
great kind of like a reddish toned blush
and it actually has a little bit of some
golden shimmer I think it looks
beautiful on the cheeks a little goes a
long way I think fair skin can look
gorgeous in this
I think darker skin can actually play
this up and look really nice with it but
I mean I just take a little bit like
that much on a blush brush and then just
kind of blend this on the cheeks and it
gives you that look like you were just
out of the football game or a hay rack
ride or those fun you know fall things
people but I think this can just be a
wonderful way to get a super healthy
natural kind of lip from within
type of glow with the blush like this so
that's a great one also kind of in
connection with that I think it's great
to continue using your highlighters and
your kind of glowy products this time of
year sometimes you know if your skin is
getting prior it needs a little more
help to look fresh thing that I've been
loving is my hard candy so baked bronzer
in Tiki and I know it says bronzer but
this is a really light color great thing
to dust on your cheekbones or just
wherever you want to give your face a
little extra glow it's not too shimmery
shiny so it's just perfect and I think
it works really nicely with this blush
to give you a look that's glowy
necessarily
to be deep in bronze but are really
pretty look nonetheless and another
cheek product that's nice kind of like
this type of a blush but in a liquid
form it's the the penitent product about
halfway gone on this little guy it's
taken me a long time to use it but this
is a liquid lip and cheek stain so it
looks you know really red but you shear
it out and you get just kind of a subtle
berry red type of thing going on so that
can be a good cheap product or a lip
product ously I'm playing up the lips
big time today but I think it can be a
really fun time to play with some of
these deeper berry color one was when I
showed in a whole I showed it on
Instagram but what I'm wearing now is a
really dark Revlon lipstick it's one of
the Super Lustrous lipsticks and it's
called black cherry and it looks kind of
intimidating there in the packaging but
it is a nice deep berry shade and you
can really sheer it out sometimes what
I'll do is I'll put it on kind of
lightly blot my lips and then I just
applied a little bit of like a clear
gloss over the top makes it look a
little more fresh just a little bit
lighter but you can wear this very full
on for a really deep dark lip if that's
something you want to try another great
lip product for more BET nice brick-red
type color is the Revlon lip butter and
red velvet that's been kind of a go-to
for me for a while and this is the kind
of shade you're gonna get they're a
little less berry more red it can be
buildable so you if you want the red to
look deeper just kind of do another
round around your lips and it's really
really pretty and for people who love
pink but want more that raspberry little
bit deeper but still really intense pink
Mac craving has been a longtime favorite
of mine and this is the kind of look
you're gonna get with that it's like you
know really rich and creamy but deeper
than your average painters people get
scared of dark lipsticks when really I
think they can be a little more wearable
than the ultra bright shades like a
really bright pink or really bright red
and you know it just lends itself to
this season I think quite a bit and I
love the look of it paired with with
that little more rosy colored cheek
something I want to talk about that I
did not really do with my face today but
I
they do in a future tutorial is sort of
a jewel-toned I think about the colors
you love but just a little bit deeper
version in a palette I recently came up
with that has this kind of thing going
on is from Sonia Kashuk and it's the
ayaan dazzling palette I first got
turned on to these when it's Judi time
was talking about loving the ion neutral
I think it's called palette which is
100% matte colors neutral matte shades
and I was thinking about getting that
but that's like oh I'm pretty much good
on those kind of colors but this one
really caught my eye
with its mix of not only neutral but
some purples and like a great emerald
green and a pretty sort of rusty red
shade so I thought for the metallics
that this has for the colors it has it
just seems like a great palette for this
season what's also interesting are that
these shades down the middle you know
how they look so shiny they actually
almost have like a glassy or wet look to
them you know what I mean see how when
you look at that you don't just see you
know glittery chunks but it actually has
a finish that looks like a wet look it's
just weird so I think those are so
gorgeous and then these other shades on
either side one is sparkly this black
actually has sparkle in it the rest are
sort of just like a soft velvety shade
maybe a little bit pearly in appearance
but they feel just really nice and
buttery that's one of the purple shades
here's a look at the green I just really
like this palette so I'm going to be
using this a lot have its own sort of
instructional thing that you can pull
out here and it's got like different
looks you can try another palette that I
have a tutorial actually a two in one
look already posted on is the Urban
Decay smoked palette again an emerald
type green a beautiful sapphire blue a
nice plum color here and then all your
neutrals is unique you are wanting to
you know play up the lips a lot like for
example what I did today with my eyes I
just used a little bit of that bar lust
color which was a shimmery Brown here in
the Urban Decay smoked palette I use
that and I used the peach and those are
the only two colors I used really in
this look and
that's how I just got this sort of
mid-tone neutral eye that I could do
pretty much anything I wanted with my
lips and feel okay about another thing
though that I think will really make
your look special whether you've got
like a homecoming dance to go to or some
big event or a party something that
really kind of makes your look seem
fancy and stepped up a notch is false
eyelashes and one of my favorite pick
kinds is now available in a four pack I
got these from Walmart these are the
salon perfect demi with so precise
they're not so evenly or blunt cut you
know they have a mix of shorter and
longer lashes so when you put those on
with your real lashes it looks so
natural like the thickness looks really
nice and I've got them on today and I
love how they get a little bit longer
here at the outside like they fit the
eye really well not too long from you
know used to West and I apply that with
my Revlon precision lash line which I
have here I was late to work today
actually I overslept you know my early
early wake up for the news I was
supposed to get up at 1:00 this morning
I ended up rolling out of bed at 2:30
randomly and I was like oh no what am I
gonna do and I was throwing this makeup
look together and I was keeping in mind
that I wanted to do this fall video and
I just put these on at my desk you know
no sweat this is a very easy glue to use
it has a wand applicator put it on the
lash band pop them on you're good I've
got a whole tutorial on that and other
kinds of lashes that I like but that's
just that just makes it look look
special and as soon as we get through
fall we're thinking holiday and I think
a lot of these trends work for that time
of year as well but I hope this was
interesting for you I will see you soon
in my next video
another try this knot that is coming
very soon I have asked on my facebook
page facebook.com slash beauty broadcast

feat so if you want to share your input
there that would be great
