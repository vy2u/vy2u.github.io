to look slimmer I know I have at times
look chiseled you want to get that like
model effect like you were born with a
great bone structure and so that's what
contouring is for so I have this kit
that I got and this is from it cosmetics
it's a brand that I first heard about on
QVC for their concealers and their
finishing powders and on the website I
saw this and this is called my sculpted
face and it says on the back here I'm
reading it says appear instantly slimmer
more youthful and energetic even hide a
double chin so I've used this today and
in this video I will show you exactly
how I use it I'm using I'm doing that
more as just me following the
instructions as opposed to me being a
expert on con you got a couple mirrors
here if you saw my haul video you saw me
show the mirrors and you get six pans of
product in terms of the size of these
this is a Mac eye shadow so um these are
about the size of like a silver dollar
and yes you say don't know how many
people are walking around with silver
dollars in their pockets but that's the
comparison size-wise at these you're
getting a two highlighting powders one
is matte one is shimmery and these would
be your for possible contour shades for
me I use this one and this one this
one's a little lighter this one's a
little darker so I would say I use the
two with a medium skin tone I'm using
the two that are in the middle because I
do occasionally do makeup on other
people I thought this might be nice to
have because then I do have the full
range of shades but if you have bronzers
at home or if you have highlights at
home and you're only doing makeup on
yourself you know you may not need all
these colors but what is the advantage
to getting this kit I think is the
instruction guide and so here you can
kind of see basically where you know the
generally speaking where you want to
have highlights and contours so you
could just leave it like this and you
could go out with a you know an awesome
tribal look
this folds out and you've got a whole
little roadmap here for how to use the
product you got an explanation of the
product they kind of indicate what
brushes you might want to use and then
you have the step by step not only a
like diagram and before-and-after look
of you know here's your here's your
before on this girl that contoured her
forehead I believe no she did her nose
so there's your before there's your
after and then they point out exactly
where it goes and they describe it right
here with text so you've got that for
what to do with your nose what you can
do with your cheekbones here what you
can do with your double chin and also
your forehead so plenty of explanation I
did not feel like there was anything
left out where that's cuz I want to show
you how I did it so you can kind of see
how it goes on and then we'll kind of
sum this all up with an overall review I
have a couple of different brushes I
like to use from the Sigma premium kit
it's the I know they've been renamed
with the F whatever but it's SS 165 I
don't have the relabeled versions but
anyway looks like this it is really
tapered and it's kind of just like a
mini egg shape practically and then I
also use my angled blush brush so and
this came in the regular they say you're
supposed to pick a shade for the
contouring that it's three to four
shades darker than your normal skin tone
so I generally am going for this shade
here and when I do my nose I'm doing
this shape I just kind of go in and work
this right on the side here and you can
already see a little bit of that effect
you can also carry that right on down
toward the tip as well if you their
guide they're showing you how to do all
these things so I'm just kind of going
through each thing they talked about
another thing is bringing out your
cheekbones so for that I like to use
this shade that's even a little bit
darker and I use my blush brush and this
is not really anything you guys probably
haven't heard of
for but you know you're kind of seeing
where a natural hollow of your cheek is
developing and you're going in there
with a deeper shade to intensify that
even more so just like this and you can
see exactly where that's at so I like to
lay it down like that and then buff it
out just like so I also like to use a
big kabuki brush to blend these out
because I find that you know the the
smaller brush can get the product
exactly where you want it but this can
really quickly just blend it so you know
there's no distinctive look a little bit
goes a long way I'm just kind of tapping
that into the product and then okay we
can see where that is starting right
back like by my ear and then coming down
just buff it right on out another step
is your chin area see the outline of my
face I am going to take my contour up
just a little bit and I'm kind of just
going to get this right at the base of
my jaw just barely on the part that
might be visible um to the you know not
under here but just on it a little bit
then you definitely want to take that
down you may want to use a larger brush
for this another great thing you can do
is contour your forehead so this is
great if you feel like you got a big
forehead or if that is preventing you
from pulling your hair back I mean it's
amazing what a contour can do for that
so again I'm using this shade I've used
this shape for all of my contouring
except around my nose I've used this
shade for some reason I just feel like
that little bit lighter color looks a
little more natural
on the hairline you do not want to just
start you know randomly right in here I
just go all the way along there with
this contour powder and just kind of
work on deepening up that area maybe
take that down even right in here if you
want to narrower forehead you know get
right there on those temples one of the
things that makes contouring work is
also highlighting because you're
creating a greater contrast brighter
parts you know it's kind of the
the face with the exception of the sides
of the nose forehead brow bone theater
is a mat and a shimmery and highlight
shaved off I am going to use the matte
shade I'm going to be using that right
down my nose and it's so it's still
giving me brightness but it's not making
me shiny there and then I'm again just
using that smaller brush that I use to
contour my nose with I'm just kind of
taking that up here
this is a sheer powder but it's still
giving you some light there and take the
shimmery shade hit that on my brow bone
also take the shimmery shade right up in
here kind of getting almost under my eye
and right on top of the cheekbone just
like that and I have not put on my blush
yet I put on my blush after I go through
this whole process get a little bit
right here on the chin get a little bit
right here on the Cupid's bow area
brighten that up after using this
palette I do feel like my face looks a
little more sculpted I really like the
shades that you have to work with and
it's important to point out that all of
the contour shades do not have shimmer
and contour shades should not have
shimmer because shimmer helps you catch
the light you know you want those places
in your face to recede so that's where
some people run into trouble because
they just grab any bronzer and think
this is a little deeper than my skin
tone I'm going to use this to contour
but if it has shimmer it really doesn't
look so natural so I like especially
these two shades like I used in the
video to contour with I like you have an
option of a shimmery or a matte light
color shave you've got a great bronzer
that you know is working well for you as
a contour a matte bronzer and you've
already got some some highlights that
you like to use you may not need to feel
the need to pick this up but if you
don't already have anything like that
and you also really want some
step-by-step guidance on how to contour
I think this is a great beginners pallet
or a great kit for a makeup artist to
have on hand because you do have
everything here I mean if you've got a
really dark skin tone you're working
and you still want that contour that's a
very dark shade and you can have it all
there in one nice kit nice amounts of
each product and it works really well so
thanks a lot for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
