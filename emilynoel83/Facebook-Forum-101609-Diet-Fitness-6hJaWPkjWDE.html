yourself harder
and some cinnamon raisin stuff like that
yeah will peanut butter
but like a spoonful of peanut butter in
it and then some oatmeal
I feel like we're on a radio talk show
or something this is fun
first thing is yeah everybody wants them
and they're very hard to get
hi everybody thanks for tuning in for
this video as you can see Tyler's with
us for this one because this video is
more Tyler's area of expertise than mine
we're kind of focusing on diet and
fitness for this week's Facebook forum
and basically what that that is if you
hadn't seen my last video i just put out
a question on my beauty broadcast
facebook page that's facebook.com slash
beauty broadcast and just ask for your
questions and then basically we're going
to try to get through as many as we can
right here lots of good questions that's
a big variety to on diet and fitness and
then i think um whatever tyler can't get
to in this video he's gonna try to get
most of those answered on its wall right
alright so we'll put a link to that in
the sidebar as well so i'm gonna kind of
just feed tyler the questions and we'll
try to get through as many as we can all
right all right the first one is from
susan she says i get really hungry right
before bedtime what are some tips or
low-fat snacks that you recommend for
nighttime hungries actually I wouldn't
be as concerned with low-fat that late
at night I'd be more worried about not
eating any kind of carbs because that's
going to get more converted quickly into
fat that you might store actually while
you're sleeping so something with that
actually would be good because that kind
of slows down the digestive process and
so your body is being fed more
throughout the night if you have
something with some fat in it so what I
would recommend is like some peanut
butter maybe or I even her and I'll
usually have some peanut butter with
some milk before bed but anything any
kind of meat would be good what about
like a Mott's like a cheese stick like a
string cheese can there is a really good
thing to have read before bed but just
out of wit all carbs if you can and we
should also probably tell people Tyler
how do you know what you know
no degree or certification or anything
like that I just do a lot of reading and
research on this kind of stuff so
everything I'm telling you is coming
from articles i've read and stuff like
that he's a college athlete he was in he
played four years of college football so
the interest probably kind of started
there and he's just kind of kept it up
ever since college some people kind of
get out of school and they let it go but
it's kind of stuck with Tyler so the
next question is from Laura she says I
know this isn't exactly for Tyler but
maybe Emily can help answer what are
some good ways to lose weight and retain
your curves as well do you think all
liquid / juice diets work I guess from
my perspective on this I guess if you
want to retain some of your curves than
you're not going to starve yourself
number one and you're not going to
probably be on a crazy crazy workout
regimen but I feel like sometimes those
like dance workouts are good because
they're not necessarily drastically
changing the composition in your body
but they are helping you tone up in some
place right and a lot of the weight
you're going to lose isn't going to be
from the places that you think of as the
curve areas just genetically women tend
to store fat in certain places that if
you're losing weight a lot of that's
going to come from places other than
what you would get your curves from it
as far as the juice diet liquid diet I
would avoid that completely anything
that's going to be a diet that kind of
promises quick results and it's drastic
and something like that is gonna you
might lose some weight pretty quickly
but a lot of that's not even going to be
fat a lot of that's going to be just
water weight and things like that and
then once you get once you drop a
certain amount of weight you're going to
just put it right back on right away and
your baby so what I would recommend is
to just find out you can just get on the
internet and fine search for something
to estimate your calorie needs for a day
under tons of websites out there for
that and then just subtract about 500
calories a day from what you need
and that's going to make you lose about
a pound a week and that's a that's a
good number and if you want to go more
drastic than that I would say a thousand
calories a day that's going to give you
two pounds a week but anything more than
two pounds a week you're probably not
losing fat like you want to you're going
to be tapping into either muscle mass or
water weight which is water weight just
comes right back on as soon as you get
back to normal so as much as you want to
lose weight quickly you need to look at
the long-term a little bit quick quick
fixes never really work andrea says with
two little boys I seem to never have
time to work out do you have any tips
for sneaking in a workout with a busy
schedule mmm like maybe things you can
do at home I would say what is it look
good in home exercise what i would do is
actually just get on youtube which i'm
pretty sure all of you guys familiar
what since you're watching this on
youtube and just search for something
search for complexes and like either
with a if you have access to weights
there's all kinds of different ways you
can do or if you don't there are there's
something called a kettle ball that's
like the ball yeah it's got a little
handle on it and if you search for
kettle ball complexes there's tons of
stuff on YouTube for that and you can
get those workouts in in like 15 minutes
and you're going to be sweating and
burning car we talking like squats and
lunges does the alternative well and
it'll be all right in a row you'll be
there great workout and fast less than a
half an hour you're gonna be getting a
lot of benefits from it what if just
throw it out there what if say you don't
even have a half hour what if some
people are like and I know maybe you
know maybe we all should try to ideally
have at least half an hour but what if
you just have ten minutes is there
anything effective you can do in 10
minutes the same thing you can do that
for 10 minutes and you're gonna be you
can feel pretty hard and get quite a bit
done in 10 minutes better off than if
you didn't do it all right all right
next question Veronica says I'm a runner
and get shin splints quite often what
are good stretches or exercise moves to
prevent this type of injury um as far as
stretching it's kind of hard I used to
explain without showing
but one what I do to stretch my calves
and lower legs out is I'll go up to a
wall and put your toe just point your
toe up against the wall then just lean
into it and feel like nice low stretch
stretch in the back here little bit your
calves and then it'll get the front to
the front muscles in your lower leg that
go over which is kind of where shin
splints come from and then also just
like a quad stretch where you just pull
your leg up back behind grab your toe
and then pull it up towards in the back
like a your drainage it it's hard just
with just my up about in camera thinking
kind of get what I'm saying they're also
i do what's called foam rolling I don't
know that's another thing yes sir let me
just search on youtube for that you buy
one of those for like fifteen to twenty
dollars sporting goods stores there's
any sporting good stores gonna be about
me yay good long and I would that's
another thing just get on youtube and
search for that because that's what I
did to find out how to do that just
search foam rolling and you'll see tons
of different ways to do it and basically
every video I've seen is almost exactly
the same they do pretty much the same
stuff and that's really good for
stretching out your muscles and keeping
your muscles and good shape all right
Melissa says I have a yeah Melissa I
have a bad back and need advice on
maintaining a strong back without
blowing it out while I'm working out I
just got over a bit very bad muscle
problem and was in horrible pain for a
week what can you ever um I know that a
lot of back issues can be made worse by
having weak ABS actually we're about
kinda you gotta balance you so what yeah
i would i would suggest doing some core
exercises and just do what you can
without causing yourself pain in your
back with the problems you already have
also i recommend doing kind of a lot of
if you do lift weights do it like from a
standing position or
something like that it really works
you're stabilizing muscles to do that so
if you can do anything standing up
pretty much anything any any lift you're
doing try to do it either standing up or
something like that that will help that
just don't push it too hard because then
you're you wind up destroying what
progress you have made so strengthening
your abs it's going to help your back
that's interesting our next question is
coming from Elise and I feel like we're
on a radio talk show or something this
is fun what do you suggest to do to
overcome a weight loss plateau this is a
great question okay it is it's kind of
complicated because it depends on your
specific situation but the first thing
I'd advise is don't be locked in and
looking at the scale for your progress
because a lot of times you could be just
putting on a little bit of extra muscle
mass and that's going to keep your
weight stagnant but you might still be
losing fat like you want to I've noticed
that would wait a lot one thing of
advice I'd have is to weigh yourself
really infrequently because if you start
doing it every day weight is messed up
because you might just be more hydrated
that day so it might be all water weight
you might be making a really good
progress but you you might be really
toning up but muscle is my that's gonna
I'm or so you might be losing fat and
you might just have drank a lot more
that day sir I mean you can easily put
on a pound of water just by drinking a
decent amount so be careful how how much
you watch your actual weight the good
judge is actually like how your clothes
are fitting and yeah like having a mere
how pair jeans fit Scism is a really
good gauge anyway if if your progress
has plateaued though i would suggest
really looking at what you're eating and
try to track your calories for a while
it gives her the tedious to do that all
the time but I I find that if I'm in an
area where I'm not making progress if
you go back and just write down
everything you're eating for a day
Carrie Underwood does that by the window
just sayin there's a lot of programs on
the internet just search for calorie
counters and they're free he just sign
up
get a username and stuff in it they'll
add everything up for you and it's
really easy so just do that for a couple
of days and probably you'll you'll see
that maybe you're eating more than you
thought you were you're eating the wrong
things and that's a good way to do it
and other than that just if you think
your plateau just push yourself harder
in the long term to I know we mentioned
the calorie counting websites but and
that's good for knowing exactly how much
you're taking in but um it's kind of
hard to keep that up especially if
you're eating out and trying to do
things like that so even if you just
have a hard time keeping track a little
notepad in your purse and a pen and just
kind of jot down what you've eaten and
then you'll kind of remind yourself oh I
did have that snack it's good it's
really thirty in the afternoon okay next
question I seem to have a craving for
bad carbs what foods can help me kick
that craving and not undo all the hard
work I put in at the gym and that's from
Robyn and first can you tell us what
what she probably means by bad carbs and
are totally sure we're gonna be anything
that's got like a processed flour in it
or has sugar in it so you look at the
label and if it says enriched wheat
flour enrich something flour that's bad
if that's like in your top five
ingredients that would be something that
has bad carbs in it not avoid it as best
you can but first off I'd say to keep to
keep on your progress and keep keep
yourself sane when you're trying to eat
healthy every once in while you gotta
have have a meal or a day where you just
do eat stuff that you shouldn't eat or
just what you're craving right just
because otherwise it's gonna just be
hard to stick with it all I've had
problems with that before with like you
want something so bad and you eat more
of other things just because you're not
satisfied so you got to satisfy yourself
also thing you can do if you got to have
those bad things either eat them before
or after your work up especially if
you're doing some kind of weight
training because that that at that point
you bought your muscles and your body
really need those nutrients so they're
going to soak them up and use them to
rebuild muscle
like that instead of storing them as as
fat but I guess we still haven't
answered your question she wants things
that what foods can help recover kick
the bad carbs rating one thing I would
say is oatmeal you can kind of doctor
that up a little bit put some Splenda or
some honey in it and some cinnamon
raisins stuff like that yeah lil peanut
butter and that's really good for count
tastes like it's not healthy but it
still is another thing I do for kind of
like an ice cream craving let's get some
you'll get some ice cream put like a
spoonful of peanut butter in it and then
some oatmeal that's pretty good a taste
guy okay okay peanut butter cookie with
ice cream moments with us it's not too
bad for you Tyler loves the peanut
butter I do third peanut butter knives
did be a letter get mentioned here go um
okay let's we're kind of running short
on time how do you keep yourself movers
how do you answer how you can you keep
yourself motivated and then maybe we can
talk about just in general busting belly
fat like if we can get keeping your abs
strong because that was asked quite a
bit several questions down so motivation
motivation um the one listen to Tyler
right the number one thing I can say is
if you get yourself into a routine where
you're actually exercising on a regular
basis it actually becomes harder to
break it then you would think you get to
the point where I've if you're doing it
regularly if you miss a workout you
don't feel it's good that day and you
start to kind of feel guilty so that's
the point I need to get to because I can
be kind of inconsistent with work I mean
busy lifestyles that's often an excuse I
mean it's an excuse for me it's an
excuse for a lot of people it's like you
know that's what I have to do and
working out is not always considered
like I have to do things but you just
gotta make it a priority or go out maybe
buy yourself something new to work out
in like if it's in the budget I guess
get a couple of new like what Tyler
couple new workout
it's maybe a new pair of shoes something
like that and also that natsu pink top
right need to be surprised if I'm how
much more you might be motivated to go
work out with that also maybe I've heard
of people just it some as simple as
downloading some new music mmm-hmm
that's a good thought cool just it's the
little things the little things that
keep you just remind yourself of why
you're why you're doing this is it
because you want to look do it is it
because you want to be healthy and be
able to play with your grandkids when
you grow up you know it's just kind of
frequently remind yourself why you're
doing it and that keeps me motivated
we're going to sum it up on how to get
abs and first thing is yeah everybody
wants them and they're very hard to get
number one thing for getting abs is
nutrition big-time nutrition if you're
if you don't have if you're not eating
well you're never going to get them no
matter how hard you work out unless
you're Michael Phelps and swimming eight
to nine hours a day we talked about this
while eating at dennys today it's just
you just gotta lose fat I mean you could
you could have abs without even doing
doing crunches because everybody's just
got those muscles there it's just all
about losing with fat that's covering
them up it's cardio a big thing cardio
is this big I would I would rank it in
if you want to get abs what you got to
do number one get your nutrition locked
in number to do some weight training and
number three make sure you're doing some
cardio and forth on the left on the west
of getting amped is actually doing ab
exercises um you can do very minimal ab
exercises and still have a six-pack if
you have really good nutrition and you
are doing some cardio all right fist
bump two six-packs boom blow it up
alright and I'm gonna do my best to
answer the rest of these questions are
than 37 I'm sure some of them are
overlapping and then there's probably
gonna be more but she'll linked it to my
blog and then see what we can do so if
you didn't get your question answered I
will try and check back a little later
because it will take some time there for
all those for sure so um thank you guys
so much for watching I hope you enjoy
these segments trying to make it a
weekly thing where I kind of create a
cat
for you on facebook to comment on and
ask questions about and I'll try to
answer them or will come up for some
more things for Tyler to talk about to
so thanks for watching guys have a great
night great day bye
