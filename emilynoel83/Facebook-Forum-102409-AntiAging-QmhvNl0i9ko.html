this video this is my mom and my sister
and you may remember pop a lot of people
remember pop her name's Kelly but I've
always called her pup and she did a
video with me once before and talked
about pups blog a little bit in some of
my blogs and videos and stuff and this
is my mom Jackie hi and this is mom's
debut on Beauty broadcast and what
brought this all up was I've gotten a
lot of questions recently about makeup
on aging skin and how to counteract
certain little problem areas and I'm in
my 20s I'm 25 I'm 40 I thought it would
be interesting to kind of combine us all
and for this Facebook forum as I called
it where I've taken different questions
off of Facebook just put out a topic you
guys asked the questions and then I kind
of answer what I have time to do Tyler
did one last week and so we've got some
guests in here this week for this one
and over the course of an hour we got
more than 30 questions so we're not
gonna be able to get to all of them
unfortunately but some of them kind of
overlap so we'll just get started and
kind of see what we can answer here so
the first one was from Emily and she
said she's turning 40 and wants to know
about a foundation for combination skin
so meaning she has some oily places on
her skin well I have really oily skin I
always have and I used to use liquid
foundation and
for a few years so you stick you know I
got into the minerals and I think that's
really been the best for me
oily skin for combinations I think it
would work well too it's as sheer as you
want it to be or you know it has a lot
of coverage if you want to put it on
yeah or two and you use the L'Oreal no
natural yeah that might help people
though because we can't see our skin
tones and they wouldn't a wet word and
so great there's a great question there
another one here from Polina and she
says and this this one was a multiple
time question here concealer to get rid
of circles but also people are thinking
about the fine lines and wrinkles under
their eyes how do you get rid of the
circle put the makeup on but not enhance
the wrinkles underneath there and mom
you kind of had a little strategy for
that right yeah I think the concealer
and then Kelly mentioned using it with
an eye cream mixing it together with the
concealer and then just dotting it under
the eye and and then tending to go up
into here where that starts to darken
and that really can help a lot so you
you you opt to use them like a creamy
creamy sealer for my age yes either the
kind with where it's a gallon okay those
can be a little bit dry and I think
sometimes those are good on blemishes
and things where you want that thick
coverage but here it's like you want the
coverage but you don't want it to be
super thick and then in that same vein
you can also keep it light around your
eyes which is a good thing you know the
dark any lines as far as brands there's
a lot of good concealers in the
drugstore I have liked the Maybelline
mineral power that's what you've been
using that I've done a few people onto
that and they
really enjoyed it not only for blemishes
because it's very gentle but the under
eye area is thick either right and I do
the thing with the eye cream they seem
like they're pretty much the same
consistency yeah if you're having if
somebody's watching this that's having a
huge problem with very dark circles and
a lot of discoloration the Bobbi Brown
creamy concealer kit it's it's not cheap
but it is good I mean I think it's it's
it's worth it if you have been plagued
by that sort of discoloration right here
and right in here some people with more
all of these skin tones can you can lean
toward that issue that's one of the best
mix or nyx concealer in a jar from
cherry culture calm is the closest
drugstore alternative to that but it's
creamy it's in a little pot form you can
use a brush or your finger to apply it
and mom go go over again what you were
saying about like right in here like
with your eyebrow course we all know
that if you'll put it in the corners and
in the inner area with something lighter
that always makes you look fresher a
little more weight but the brow starts
to droop at this point and if you will
put a lighter color right in here be
very careful and keep that lighter and
then head on up to under the brow that
gives you kind of a lift there so then
that following that old principle look
like it's highlighting rising a light
shadow kind of under your and then I've
been using it on the lid too and then
just a slight darkness at the corners
not heading out into the wrinkled area
okay but keeping it away from that and
that seems to do us as really much as I
can okay
next question is from Nikki she is 20 or
in her 20s she wanted to know when is a
good time to start using the anti-aging
creams and we were discussing this a
little bit beforehand and you know
everybody's got a different skin type in
a different skin problem and sometimes
the anti-aging creams are a little
strong and
can be a little too rich for certain
skin types so I mean what do you guys
think about this she's 20 yeah I said I
didn't start it until like maybe I was
in my early mid 30s and that was when
Neutrogena came out with it was an tag
lemak anti-wrinkle is something for
people I have both problems and for the
first time it seemed like this is
something that could use nice to lose it
and so I would say use whatever however
strong of a product you can and if you
find you can't then don't use it but use
whatever you can because I think the
sooner you start the better and you just
have to find something that you can
accept you know that your skin can
tolerate I've been using an interesting
kind of combination of products it's
it's the Mary Kay time lights
moisturizer but it's the one for the
combination to oily skin so it's light
but it has the anti-aging kind of
properties in it but if you're not yet I
mean you want to also balance things out
by making sure you've got SPF and what
you're using like pup here I mean people
probably are like if we had a closer in
shot of puppy yeah you wouldn't believe
that pup was 40 years old I mean it's
just she's got such a youthful
appearance and youthful skin but you
said you really it was staying out of
the Sun and like I remember I was I
think 17 16 it was during the summer and
I was laying out in the Sun a blanket
reading a magazine and I just kind of
touched myself why am I doing this this
is hot I feel gross I'm just gonna get a
sunburn you know it's kind of nice to
relax outside and stuff but that was and
so I just kind of stopped doing it
there and so it's been like 23 years I
haven't tanned at all and you've got
great skin to show anybody groups good I
guess
she also like if I do got the Sun I have
sunscreen on all the time you feel a
little bit you know you should see the
leathery faces and if you want the tan I
mean there's no shortage of products out
there where you can safely do it
yourself with I mean any there there are
gradual Tanner's for the face and body
and then the more you know spray tan
things like that that actually works so
in my age group you know we were
encouraged to sit out in the Sun the
term healthy tan was which of course
those you can get and anyone young Emily
didn't tan at an earlier age and so I
think the anti-aging goes along with how
much tan and you might have done too in
your early years and you know you're
gonna need a little more help on those
right next question is from Tina she is
36 and says eyeliner can start to look
kind of harsh all the way around your
eye when should you stop doing that or
maybe what are some ways to make that a
little more wearable you taught me that
you should just come in from the edge of
the eye a little bit and kind of maybe
smudge that and not make that you know
line which I never did do but a lot of
people do I think it makes it a little
less severe and and yet brings it out
brings your eyes out a little bit I've
said before in my videos I'm not a big
make up rules person because I mean that
takes the fun out of makeup to say like
you know you can't do this past age
whatever I think that's a little crazier
than one yeah if you like the look of
some of you I think we all kind of have
a vision of the way we feel like we look
bad
and I think there are ways you can if
you like the definition around your eye
some people are very round honest and
sometimes people actually think their
big eyes they kind of want to bring them
in and like rein them in a bit so
sometimes it can be nice to define the
lower part of your eye but I think
smudging and keeping that line very soft
is a good way to make less attention
drawn to the makeup and more to your eye
and the definition around the gel liners
the cream liners that are out there
right now that can be applied with a
brush and smudged out with a q-tip or
another smallish brush can really just
you know enhance it or just a powder a
powder shadow with a with an angled
liner brush just kind of dotted under
there a little bit and blending and
smudging can kind of make things work
yeah I mean I used to and to me it just
looks it just reminds me you know it's
like a David look on me I feel I mean
you look gorgeous
I usually go all the way but I just kind
of stay on the top if I do it at all and
just kind of rely on mascara do but your
skin's a lot lighter than hers and may
never sing you know just this real
contrast next couple of questions are
from Angela she's 24 years old and
Stephanie is 21 and both of them had
wondered how to look more mature they
say they have they can sort of a young
look I guess and people they say they
mistake them for being a younger age
than they actually are so some ways to
maybe not look to look a little more
finished maybe your polished maybe go
with more of a matte
yeah a sparkly lip gloss I can kind of
make you think junior high or high
school or you know I don't know what
else she's doing
that maybe she's just two words trendy
things just don't go into the trendy
things quite so much you just get more
classy with the way you I think one
simple way to try it is I know when when
people first start using makeup
sometimes it's like the really light
kind of rustle it glosses maybe that you
start off with not a darker tone and
maybe a darker tone will just kind of
make things I think your face always
looks a little more polished when your
lips have just a little bit of color to
them a little more than you're used to
so maybe just a little darker lipstick
with veneks when you use that darker
lipstick I think you really need a gloss
to keep that from I think your your lips
tend to sink in give it a sunken look
with that with a darker look and this
kind of brings and that makes it look
more youthful so you need to always keep
a gloss on really deeply colored another
thing do you have sometimes people with
round faces tend to get they maybe a
younger appearance to them and so
contouring there can help a little bit
too just a a matte bronzer or a deeper
blush a little bit and then in the
cheekbone area right in there can give
your face a little more sculpted look
maybe and not quite the round you know
cheeks and stuff question is from Cora
Lee she's in her 50s and she wants to
know what the best eyes shadows are if
you have considering that you may have
lines or lack of totnes in the eyebrow
areas she says so mom well like I said I
think you need to use quite a bit of
light colors above and even on the lid
and then to go up just in the crease and
give it just a little darkness there but
never bring it out like I used to in to
the wrinkly area on the edges because
all that does is just settle in there
and just define it so you want to keep
things as light as you can and then add
just a little definition there and
that's really about the best well we
were messing with him with some stuff
when you were down last time like I
think everybody kind of has a little
natural discoloration to their eyelid
especially as the skin thins a little
bit you're seeing more bullet maybe
blueish wreaths and reddish tones
underneath so sometime just taking a
light matte color shadow and we go down
your eyelid and I noticed a difference
right away Ostrom I think witness and
remember light colors are gonna grab the
light and bring things out dark colors
are going to make them recede a little
bit more mom what she would do is put
some of the light shade there maybe a
little bit of a medium to dark darker
shade Matt again Sparkle just brings out
the lines something in the crease she's
got a liner the liquid that's what I use
along the top upper lash line but I
would suggest that that's not a really
good idea as your as your lids get a
little more wrinkly because they will
settle down on to that liner and if you
would cry or laugh even and moisture
would come you can never rub out but I
like to use especially fun going to a
funeral or wedding or something I will
use a waterproof liner but it is a
liquid because it's just too hard to get
anything else on kind of a soft they're
always wrinkly eyelid and so this is the
only way you can get a nice definition
there well unfortunately that's about
all the time we have for the questions
we have a lot of good questions
fortunately hopefully some of these kind
of overlapped and maybe some of the
things you were sitting at home
wondering about God answered here with
the questions we had but any final
thoughts on the topic just from from you
guys um one thing I didn't say was I've
stopped sleeping on my stomach and I've
noticed a huge difference in the way I
look in the morning wrinkle wise entire
this wise and dark circle life so if
you're having those kind of problems
just see what happens it kind of force
yourself so you might roll over in the
middle of the night but at least you're
not spending all right where it is
reaching your face on the pillow you
know well I might just and I was trained
as a cosmetologist back in the 60s and
it's just amazing what what my daughter
here has learned new things that have
come out since then we had very basic no
it's just makeup and hearing the whole
business but she is really now teaching
us thank you for doing this video with
me this is really cool I haven't seen
anything like this before
on YouTube to the beauty in the beauty
community so maybe we'll try this again
sometime you answer another batch of
questions but that's all for today bye
guys thanks for watching
oh do you want to get a little bit more
on you because I felt like shoulder room
yeah why not see okay three wait a
minute you did me something you did
something maybe stayed out of the Sun
right so timeout my battery's flushing I
think we pretty much that was the
anti-aging creams</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
