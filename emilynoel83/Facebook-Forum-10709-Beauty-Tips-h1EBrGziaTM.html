this video this is a new thing I'm
calling Facebook forum and basically
what I did this morning was I opened up
my Facebook fan page and you can get
there by going to facebook.com slash
beauty broadcast become a fan and you
can comment on the wall and stuff and I
take a lot of requests there it's just
probably one of the easiest ways to get
through to me it I can immediately
comment back and the beautiful thing
about it is everybody can see my answer
and it may help other people along the
way to just have it so public like that
but anyway I'm today I posted a comment
on there and I said ask me any beauty
question and I will use your questions
in the video i post today so I gave it
about a two hour period it turned up
about 30 questions on there so I'm just
going to start now and try to get
through as many as I can in about say 10
to 15 minutes here so I'm just going to
go ahead and get started then the first
question is from nada she says how
should I maintain my eyebrows i pluck
occasionally but they're very thin I try
to fill the men as well however black is
too harsh and brown is too light I'm
Asian so they are black okay so she
wants help filling in her eyebrows what
I like to do is use a dark brown matte
shadow what I've been using is one from
L'Oreal it's just a dark brown single
shadow and I use a little stiff angled
brush to kind of go in and fill in areas
of my eyebrows now my eyebrows aren't
super thin to begin with but I feel like
the powders are a little more forgiving
that a pencil is if you've taken a black
pencil to your brows and you feel like
it's showing up too dark maybe go with
just a deep matte powder you don't want
to get shimmer in there it's really
going to make that not look very natural
but it's sometimes there are other brow
powders out there I know NYC has a nice
little brow kit that actually has sort
of the wax a waxing sort of that product
that you can put on there with a brush
and then top it off with the powder and
you've got more of a long-wearing look
so keep in mind that powders can be a
really good way to
you know boost give your eyebrows and
boost even if you did go ahead if you
got major problems with your thin brows
and you want to take that lighter pencil
and fill in that way and then top it off
with a slightly darker powder that might
be a good combination for you there next
question from Karen face primers what's
their purpose and do they really work
some work some don't that's a good
question but what primers are supposed
to do is extend the wear of your
foundation and help your foundation go
on more smoothly by basically filling in
pores lines and things like that
obviously it's not going to fill in the
deepest wrinkle but it is going to give
your face a smoother finish one of my
favorites is Smashbox photo finish but
another one this will address another
question a little ways down what's a
good face that was from Jennifer what's
a good face primer that isn't high end
and I like Rimmel fixin perfect I know
there are a few other drug store primers
out there but that's one that I've tried
that I really like their I haven't tried
a whole lot beyond that actually because
I have enjoyed fixed and perfected it
has sort of a peachy tone to it but it
works with most skin tones and you just
put it on it's somewhat creamy and I do
feel like it extends the wear but
ultimately what I feel like the biggest
benefit to a primer has been for me has
been just to help your makeup go on more
smoothly it just helps the feel and
therefore the makeup spreads better on
your skin and you want to definitely put
that on after a moisturizer let your
moisturizer sink in for a couple minutes
and then go ahead and put your primer on
and then your foundation next one can
you do a makeup collection video and
yeah I need to do one I know I need to
update that I've been asked that before
and it's kind of like my collection
keeps growing and I keep reorganizing
and kind of redoing how I've got it laid
out there so I think some of something
like that will probably be coming in the
come
months had just sort of still messing
around with my area right now still
trying to figure out better lighting
solutions for my tutorials so probably
once i get a solution there with that my
whole setup then i'll just show it all
so yeah thanks for that question next
one is from Stephanie what are some of
your favorite perfumes and body sprays I
love a lot of the perfumes from
Victoria's Secret I once was given a
little sampler of a bunch of different
kinds and I love so many of those I love
very sexy and I think once called
supermodel and the body spray the pink
body spray it's in like kind of a fresh
and clean kind of scent I really like
those I like some of the body fantasies
body sprays like there's an apple one
that I've used that's really good I like
fruity and sweet scents I like things
that smell like cotton candy and just
really really sweet since like that I do
like a lot of body sprays and I try to
layer my sense like with a lotion and
then a body spray over the top of it so
it kind of lacks a little bit longer
that way um Jennifer says oh she asked
about the face primer the inexpensive
base primary answered that orally says
how to achieve super sexy beachy waved
hair without hot rollers or a curling
iron well here's what you can do and
I've done this before you could go ahead
and braid your hair and like maybe do
you can do a couple of braids or if you
wanted a more concentrated a tighter
wave you can do several and go ahead and
spritz them down with some water or
spritzen with like a spray gel or maybe
a hairspray of some sort that you like
to use and leave them like that maybe
sleep in them or where those throughout
part of the day or something like that
and then let them down and you'll have a
really neat wave there and that mean it
without using any kind of styling tool
another thing you can do is kind of take
make little pin curls with your hair and
like take little section
like this and kind of twist them around
and curl them up and like pin them with
a bobby pin and then maybe spray them
with some some hairspray or some sort of
setting type spray and you could sleep
with them that way there are also
there's a set of things called I think
there he'll wrap snap and go and they're
available at sally beauty supply I have
these and they really work they're like
little foamy fabric-covered pieces that
are about this long and they have snaps
at the ends and you just wrap your hair
around it like it's a curling iron twist
it up and snap it and you can sleep in
them and then you wake up and you've got
some really nice curls actually so just
make your sh make sure your hair is dry
before doing that one because otherwise
I think it kind of will mess up the
effect and they're kind of foamy and I
think it'll soak into the foam and so
you don't want to deal with issues there
but if you do braids you could have you
do that on slightly damp air and then
you know sleep on it or something um
next after your eye makeup makeup is
done and you put on mascara your mascara
smears on your upper I how you fix it
without taking the whole eye makeup off
great question there and if you just
have a little dot of that somewhere this
just gotten on one random place I would
say go ahead and leave it leave it there
let it get dry and then take a little
q-tip or just your finger and sometimes
that will flake right off and you won't
even be able to tell so sometimes
instead of completely freaking out and
rubbing it immediately let it dry then
you can flake it off or sometimes if I
get something like say right on my
eyelid and it's just not coming off like
it was just such a small spot that I
it's not even flaking off I'll take a
q-tip get a little eye makeup remover on
it and just go over that very spot
without doing a whole lot of rubbing
back and forth but just kind of
saturating that one spot get rid of the
spot and then maybe go over it with a
little bit of eye shadow and I think the
key is just to not freak out and don't
rub like all over it because sometimes
it's just a very very small fix and you
can make it work again and next and
what's your opinion on brand
that test on animals well I've got to
say that I'm not fully it probably as
educated as I should be on exactly what
brands are testing on animals I know of
a few offhand that are and I do use
almost if almost every brand testing it
out regardless and I just not that I
support animal testing although some
people might see it that way because I'm
still buying the product i'm still
supporting the company but I mean if I
was ever at a position where I could
stop animal testing I think I would do
I'm an animal lover i enjoy animals and
i hate some of the processes that they
may be put through although i'm not
totally sure what they are so i think do
i need to educate myself more on that
absolutely I do but I am I feel like for
the purpose of what I do here reviewing
products reviewing the quality of the
products that's sort of what my focus
has been up until now what's the best
drugstore can see where you've tried
there are different formulations
different reasons why I like certain
concealers but i do like maybelline
mineral power that's one that i direct a
lot of people toward who say i want to
cover up blemishes and i don't want to
irritate them anymore with a thick thick
heavy concealer i feel like that can
conceal but it's very light and very
good for sensitive skin then I like NYX
concealer and a jar if you're into that
more creamy consistency concealer
something that's kind of its it's one of
the closest things that I found to Bobby
Brown's creamy concealer because it's
it's very good for around the eye area
as far as the hard-candy concealer
palette that i recently tried to haven't
quite worked with that enough to know
for sure if I if I like that yet and
next up although I love the packaging
I'm just saying I need to kind of run
some more comparisons to it Tyler's
giving me a little I don't nothin give
me a whole time key what I got about 10
min
l gosh I'm not going to get through all
these okay I'm going to have to run
through some very very quickly Samantha
says how do you pick the right
foundation for combination and very fair
skin for combination you're going to
want to look for foundations that say
they're oil-free mat or you know things
and that lead you to believe that they
are not laden with oil and also for the
color I'm assuming you're referring to
looking for a foundation in a drugstore
on I say go ahead and find something in
your current collection now that is a
close match to you bring that to the
store and kind of use that to match up
with other shades that you think might
work whenever I take my makeup off at
night this is from Alexandra I used
heavy duty cold cream and then a makeup
remover all over her face but basically
she says she knows i wreck recommend
their makeup removing cloths but she
says they don't get it all off for her
and she wakes up with smudgy black
eyeliner still on the LA Daily facials I
use them for combination to oily skin
they were great for me I use them on my
eyes they don't irritate my eyes and
they get rid of all my eye makeup i must
say i don't use waterproof eye makeup so
i don't know if maybe some of that is
lingering on your eyes but they work
fine for me I just I would say if you're
still having problems with some eye
makeup remaining on there just use a
separate eye makeup remover and some
cotton balls kind of hold them over your
eyes wiggle them just a little bit and
it should help remove the excess I
makeup I will still at times wake up
with just maybe a teeny bit of residue
but before I start my makeup I just take
a q-tip and some eye makeup remover and
get rid of all of that next one which
celebrities look do you love the most
and why um gosh there are a lot that I
really admire and like I hate i would
say for my day to day i think i really
think about robin meade in terms of
having great makeup hairstyle for news
anchoring that's what I do
so I kind of keep that in the back of my
mind I really like the way she comes up
on camera she's the one with the book
that I wrote she's anchors for CNN on
HLN and but other celebrities I
generally really like Kim Kardashian's
look I just kind of maybe associate with
her dark hair and dark features I like
the way her makeup is done almost all
the time so and i also love i mentioned
this in my blog the other day i think
the people on Dancing with the Stars
have amazing makeup the makeup arts do a
great job on the celebrities and the pro
dancers I think a lot of those pro
dancers are just gorgeous to begin with
but I mean their makeup is just amazing
and fun and fun to look at so I really
like them as well um please recommend a
good moisturizer this is from Rebecca
and well I'm not sure what skin type you
have Rebecca so that would make a
difference for me but if you have oily
skin I really like neutrogena oil-free
moisture for people who are already
dealing with some oil on their skin
clean and clear has some good light
moisturizers just make sure it says
oil-free the they have to like several
different separate lines but I feel like
those have been good light moisturizers
for me what I'm looking for something
light and i also like um there-there
been different brands that I've tried
silk be if you're looking for an online
like all very pure natural organic brand
silk be is a good one i also like if
you've got sun aging skin or you're
worried about your going to counteract
the aging process as i know somebody
asks this down a little ways further
here on my list of questions the mary
kay timewise stuff is really good as
well i tend to change my moisturizer
with the seasons a little bit i'm going
to be soon getting into a time where my
skin feels a little drier in the
wintertime so i might opt for something
just a little bit heavier but during the
summer you know really those oil free
moisturizer where that is their big
claim i think is a good thing
um next up okay this was a great
question tips for using I shadows in a
way that isn't so bold and obvious this
from wait did I say this one from this
is from Alexandra and I have the coastal
scents 88 palette but I tend to only use
about a fifth of the colors because I'm
afraid of the really bold ones a
wonderful question even on an everyday
work day I'm probably not going to walk
in there in bright green turquoise I
looks however I feel like I can
incorporate a little bit of the color
and do sort of a peekaboo I look if you
know what I mean that means maybe taking
like the brightest color using it on
your lid and then using a matte black or
deep matte charcoal gray type shade to
deepen your crease these colors are
going to come off a lot more bold if
that's all you use you know what I mean
if you use that shade and that shade
only and only the bright shades from
your lid to your crease to up in here so
I think to calm it down you want to use
a not too crazy shade up on your brow
bone for your highlight keep that almost
skin tone take your brighter shade and
maybe consider using that on the lid use
a lighter white shade to highlight the
inner corner and a deeper shade like a
like i said if you're using if what
you've got here is bright and shimmery
like maybe a pretty lilac purple or
something like that take a black or a
charcoal shade that had that is fairly
matt and used that to tone down your
crease so what you're going to wind up
there with is some kind of a
multi-dimensional i look that's not one
flat bright shade all across you're
going to have a lighter area darker area
you've created some contrast but it's
not going to be I think what people are
picturing which is oh my gosh i see this
palette of blues and orange and red and
green and how do i make that work you've
got to work in some neutrals in there
with it and i think a deep deep brown
shade is nice to tone down orange or
yellow i like using black and charcoal
with say the blues and purples and
green families there as well all right
guys I think I'm going to have to wrap
it up at that I still have a few more
questions a lot more questions that I
wasn't able to get to but this is
something i think i'm going to do in the
future and maybe i'll have it a little
more focused in terms of the topics i
like your questions on but this was fun
i think this is great to just get your
ideas see what you're interested in on
any given day and give you my feedback
so thank you guys so much for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
