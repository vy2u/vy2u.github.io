tuning in for this video this is what I
call a facebook forum and I've done
three different videos of this type
before and basically the way I set this
up is earlier in the day I will pose a
question or a topic on my beauty
broadcast facebook fanpage and I say you
know underneath this question in the
comments section feel free to ask any
questions you want about the topic this
week it was all about I make up in the
past I've had three other videos on this
and I did one on just my first one I
think was on just make up tips in
general and then I did one on diet and
fitness which tyler was a guest question
answerer there and then i did one on
anti-aging with my mom and my sister so
I'll have links to those in the side if
you want to see it but it's just kind of
you know i'm sitting here basically just
answering your questions i had 70
questions at least asked on this topic
on i make up there so I obviously can't
get to all those and I don't want to
make this like a marathon video for you
guys to watch so I kind of either picked
questions that I have been asked a lot
in the past or maybe a unique question
that I thought would help a lot of
people or just something I felt really
confident and answering there are some
questions on there that I really did not
exactly know the answer to and so I'm
not going to try to sit here and act
like I know the answer but like I wish I
could answer every single question but
I'm just going to select some and then
you know I'll continue to do this I'm
going to try to do them on a more
consistent basis so you know at some
point down the line you can get your
question answered so anyway let's go
ahead and get started first question
came from Lydia and also Stephanie they
were asking about wearing red and pink
shades on your eyes without looking kind
of like you're sick and that had been a
big concern of mine before I started
wearing those really warm colors and my
first tip on that is if you want to wear
red sore Pink's on your lid I think it's
very important to make sure you use
eyeliner as well because that's going to
give that definition between the color
and
the eye itself if you think about if you
just want all pink all over your lid and
had no definition or no sort of a
finished look to it with the eyeliner it
might make you look like you're whole I
areas just a little red and swollen so
if you want to put it on your lid you
can I actually did read I did Mac
cranberry all over my lid last weekend
and it turned out really well but part
of the reason why was because I did line
it i did a little winged outliner the
look appeared to be very finished I also
used a black shade in the crease so kind
of using more than one color not only
using the red or the pink is a good idea
and also another great way to use those
shades probably my favorite way to use
them is to do your eye look let's say
you just kind of went light shade on the
lid darker shade in the crease and outer
V and then take that warm shade the red
or the pink and go over it right in this
area I'm not doing it right now but I'm
just trying to show you approximately
where it would be and you get a really
really pretty kind of fade look there
I've done several looks where I've taken
the warm shade like that and used it in
that way and it comes off really pretty
I mean it's just a very different look
so hopefully that gives you some ideas
to not look like you're getting sick
when you use those colors on your ID
next question from Christina how to
prevent smudging under the I get asked
this all the time I had a video I did
way back when when I started first
started doing videos about preventing
the under-eye smudging and here's my tip
and typically you're going to use a
pencil on your under-eye and liquid on
the top I mean you can obviously do
whatever you want but I find it
difficult to use a liquid liner on the
bottom because of your eyelashes really
get in the way so let's say I'm going to
use Revlon Colorstay eyeliner under my
eye like I did today I use this one in
black brown and I just went under my eye
area here and I feel like Revlon
Colorstay does a fantastic job of it's a
little bit of a dryer liner but yet it's
smooth enough to to go on very evenly
without kind of skipping as you put it
on but
it does not tend to smudge too terribly
bad i know we've all had different
experiences with different products but
i put that on I top it with a powder in
a coordinating shade today I'm going to
use dark brown or black and just take a
liner brush like an angled liner brush
and and just top that off with the
shadow okay there you're putting a
powder product on top of a cream based
product and you're already functioning
to absorb oils out of the out of the
liner then what you want to do I have a
little cheapo concealer brush but I
believe it got from Walmart alongside a
long time ago and um have some powder
like the maybelline mineral power
finishing powder is one that I use it's
just a pressed powder and a little
compact and once you've done your whole
I look go around and go right up under
the liner just like that not on top of
it but right up under it this has been
on by the way I got it I got to give you
a frame of reference here that's what I
did today you pat it underneath i was up
at 130 am with this face of makeup on
because i had to do a morning newscast
and now it is about quarter to 20 till
nine at night and i'm not dealing with
smudges and i took a nap as well and
that's i almost always see soon as some
sort of smudge but if I really make a
conscious effort to do my eye makeup
this way it usually works for me so
again you want to put your cream liner
down top it with powder and then put a
little bit of powder underneath you
don't have to cake that powder on
underneath but a little bit because
basically you've put your cream on your
surrounding it by powder products that
are going to absorb any oils that come
away from it if you haven't tried that
technique please test it out just use
any you know any press powder you want
to use is going to be able to work for
you here underneath but that's been the
strategy that works best for me and you
know you may want to go if you have
problems especially in the corners and
also think about not getting too much
liner um
in the corner of your eye you know if I
was going into line right here you know
don't really pile it on there in the
corner if you have issues with that
corner your I getting smudgy watery
whatever make sure you're putting the
minimum amount possible and definitely
top it off with the powder so next
question best technique for winged liner
I'd like to refer you and that's from
Jennifer I'd like to refer you to my
Valentines Day tutorial where I really
show basically how I do this but to do
it i would use a liquid say if you were
using a liquid pin i would trace all the
way on my natural lash line and by
natural lash line i just mean right
where my lashes are coming out so from
here to here and then draw a little line
from the very corner of your eye as if
you were going to draw it all the way up
to the outer part of your eyebrow but
just take it out a little bit just as
far as you want the wing you know it may
be just like that much your hair
something and so when you draw that out
you're going to connect over and it's
like you've got a little open triangle
thing going on and yeah like I said yeah
you can see it in action in my
Valentines Day tutorial that I just did
a few videos back and you'll be able to
see how to do it but it's a matter of
drawing your line up connecting it over
you got kind of an open triangle and you
just fill it in and I know I've probably
oversimplified that in my explanation
made it sound too easy but practice does
make perfect with that and start small
if you've never done winged liner before
just go out a little ways and then and
you know then make your little make your
little wing once you get more
comfortable you know go go more dramatic
with the look but just start small and
practice Angie says best eyeshadow
brands that are blendable if you're
looking for a drugstore a shadow that
really blends well covergirl their
formula has improved leaps and bounds
from what it was several years ago just
looking in my little drawer here a
Milani great shadows and Nick's
NYX available at cherry culture calm
those blend beautifully the shapes from
glam couture they're available online if
you google glam couture cosmetics you'll
and be able to see those shades they're
very very bright but they are super
super blendable on the more high-end
scale I find that some of the matte
shades blend a little better than others
I like the the frost finishes I think
those have worked really well for me
smash boxes is wonderfully blendable and
so are the sigma shades but you need to
watch out for a little bit of sparkly
fall out there but if you are careful
about your application those will blend
very nicely as well Katelyn says how do
you get a smokey under eye without
looking like you fell asleep with your
makeup on great question and something I
had wondered about a lot until I kind of
started studying different videos and
and really experimenting with on my own
eyes and basically here's my tip you can
line your waterline and then go under
right under your lashline with some
powder shadow and then just basically
buff that out with a small a small
shadow dress like a fine crease brush or
a small issue brush like this is one
from Coastal Scents that's just like you
know one of these very little brushes
that can get right in there and smudge
it right out that's an interesting smoky
look because you're getting even more
dramatic look by lining your waterline
but then by using a powder underneath
and then smudging it out right here you
just got to stay very close to your lash
line with that and it's not going to
look too messy if you're not comfortable
with lining your waterline or if you're
like me and sometimes you feel like it
makes your eye look a little bit closed
in and just go ahead and do your liner
technique like normal what I've got
today is a pretty kind of clean precise
liner look but if I were to make this
smoky what I might do is when I topped
my regular cream liner with a shadow I
might instead of using my angled brush
which is very very slim like that use
this brush use the tip
take the tip and put it down in the
product and then use that to kind of
buff over the outer part and another
really great way to kind of keep your
whole look contained once you're done
with it goes back to that concealer
brush with a powder and kind of padding
it in so I almost sometimes you can
clean up a you know a look really
quickly if you just kind of pad around
it and you can almost see how that would
define this shape that I've got here a
little better um next sorry if I'm
taking a really long time with these um
let me see where was I Gilda says I
shadow shades for mature women and also
outer v's on smaller lids and to answer
this in a quick nutshell here for mature
women if you've got an aging I area
which we all technically do but if
you're seeing wrinkles in your eye area
you do not want to go with highly highly
shimmery products because that's going
to draw the light to it those wrinkles
are going to stand out more and I don't
think you're going to be really pleased
with the look especially as you wear it
throughout the day so think about matte
eyeshadow shades that don't have a lot
of sparkle to them and and basically get
a light shade in the lid a darker shade
in the crease and without ervys um the
question was phrased and out doing an
outer V on a smaller lids but really the
outer V doesn't have much of an impact
on your on your lids because as you can
see with my outer V my shadow is going
beyond my eyelid area it's really just a
matter of pulling that shadow up and
around the eye just a little bit more I
would i would use some matte topes plums
Browns maybe even some navies but not
too terribly dark and and just bring
your outer V subtly outside your eye
area and don't go too overboard stick to
your crease and just gently bring that
shadow up when your eye is it is you
know so many of us try to do they are I
make up where we're looking down and
we're looking at our eye on that way but
as you look straight ahead what you
see beyond your eye is kind of the outer
V so keep it subtle and just try to
build with what you're comfortable with
rihanna says how to make downturned eyes
not look so tired and that goes back to
the outer V techniques and techniques
using a cat ID liner or liner that just
goes up slightly at the at the outer
part of the eye I've done makeup on
people whose eyes tend to go down just a
little bit and it really does make a
difference when you take the liner and
instead of maybe tracing just exactly
where the eye goes you know you do that
but you really concentrate on bringing
it up and using shadow to create more
than more of that lifted look next
questions from Yelena about I makeup
remover she says some removers are too
oily or don't remove thoroughly what are
some of the best products and methods
there are a lot of great oil-free eye
makeup removers out there right now i'm
using the almay one there's also oil
free versions from Neutrogena and also
Rimmel I feel like they remove pretty
well but sometimes there are still those
products that are a little more
resistant to being removed and so I
would suggest and when you get some of
that on say a cotton ball or a like a
cotton pad to really hold it over your
eye and let it kind of soak in let it
really saturate those areas that are not
wanting to come off and almost wiggle it
just a little bit almost wiggle it just
a little bit wiggle it just a little bit
before you take that off and that's
going to really loosen on some of the
makeup but another tip is to take like a
q-tip and really get it in there on some
of those areas along the lash line
sometimes you remove your makeup but
what really remains is still a little
bit of residue around your lash line so
a q-tip really has the ability to get in
there and concentrate right on those
areas and also my Olay on daily facials
face wash cloths do a really good job of
not only taking off my face makeup but
they can take off pretty much any eye
makeup i have on as well whether it's
waterproof or not so I've been pretty
impressed with that and
it's the same concept applies you know
if it's a little more resistant really
try not to scrub back and forth too much
wiggle it just a little bit because
doing that on your eyelid will
definitely cause irritation I know that
firsthand then Christian says that
should you match your clothes to your
eyeshadow or what are some tips to bring
out the color of your clothes in your
makeup I am one who tends to be pretty
inspired by clothing in terms of you
know I figure out what I'm gonna wear
and then I decide what I'm going to do
with my eye makeup or if I've got a
really special i look in mind I'll sort
of coordinate my clothes but you don't
have to match and and you know you don't
necessarily want to look like you have
just matched yourself from your outfit
to your shoes to your jewelry to your
eye makeup it can just be a little bit
much but what I would suggest just kind
of working within certain ranges of
tones like let's say I'm going to be
wearing something where maybe I've got a
colorful top or colorful shoes or
something but black is also involved in
my outfit then I would stick with you
know maybe doing a look that involved
not only black but some sort of bright
color because those sort of compliment
each other if you're talking brights and
blacks you know you can work with those
kinds of shades on your eye doesn't have
to be the same bright shade you wore but
you know you can work it into an eye
look another idea is if I'm wearing like
oranges like I have an orange outfit on
now or cream shades browns olive greens
those more earthy tones I would go with
more neutrally brown tone looks it's
just kind of like look at the color
family you're wearing is it neutral or
is it something that could go with a
bright shade and you know you'd like I
said you don't have to exactly match it
up I could wear this and do a really
pretty olive I look you know I just
think it makes sense to keep it within
sort of that color family that you're
working with but you can also pick like
contrasting colors something I'd love to
do over the summer is when I was wearing
a bright coral top I liked using like
turquoise on my eyes I thought it made a
nice contrast look kind of in real life
and find the things that you think like
you see color combinations sometimes it
really catch your eye why does that
catch your eye and would that be
interesting in makeup you know kind of
try to think of it in in those terms
another lasting little point here a lot
of people asked about good eye creams
and I'd like to say I'm an expert on eye
creams but I'm not I haven't tried all
that many really the one that I had been
trying for quite a while was from Mary
Kay and it was the firming eye cream um
I like that ok I but I've just kind of
wanted to branch out a little bit more
because I hear from a lot of people who
say I want to be able to pick this up in
my drugstore what i'm using now is the
Olay age-defying anti wrinkle eye cream
and this comes with a whole line of
products that I actually trying like the
Olay age-defying SPF 15 day lotion and
there's a night cream as well so I went
to the drugstore the not too long ago
and I thought you know i'm just going to
test out some new skincare products here
see if i like them and i plan to put
together a new skin care video one side
i'm sure you know that I kind of would
recommend this stuff I guess but yeah
this is what i'm using now what i'm
looking for is basically something that
can really moisturize my eye area
overnight and hopefully work it's sort
of a preventative measure to keep from
developing a lot of wrinkles around the
eye area i don't know if that's wishful
thinking or what but um I don't feel
like I can give you a really solid like
this eye cream is better than all the
rest because i don't think i've tried
enough but if i turn out to really enjoy
this product that i'm using right now
from au lait i will review it you know i
will let you know either way if how it
works out but if you all have any
suggestions about eye creams i would
love for you to share those below this
video in the comments section because i
feel like it is a very common concern
it's something a lot of us are thinking
about even if it is in sort of the
preventative stages as opposed to the
corrective and so if you've got a good
tip please share because i would like to
hear it just as much
is everyone else I think so anyway
thanks for tuning in for this Facebook
forum video I'll be doing more of these
in the future on some of these general
topics you can ask a question and I will
try my best to answer is so thanks again
guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
