Patrick's Day yay
hope you're all having a good day so far
this video is actually inspired by well
if you want to call it inspired it's
sort of inspired by my lack of sleep
lately because daylight savings time of
course kicked in last weekend and I can
tell that a lot like I really noticed
the change because I incur a morning
newscast I wake up at 1:30 in the
morning I try to get to bed you know
like around 6:30 let's say and so when
it's still light out when I'm going to
bed it makes it harder to fall asleep
and I'm not feeling like I'm getting as
good as sleep as I used to so anyway I
thought it would be interesting to do a
video kind of talking about the ways you
can compensate beauty wise for a lack of
sleep because I think we all tend to
feel a little better
or feel like we look better you know
when we're well-rested I mean I think it
shows all over your face really but
there are some ways that you can kind of
you know help the situation a little bit
and I'm not saying hey you know don't
get as much sleep as you think you need
or whatever because I think that sleep
is important for health reasons and
there are just a lot of benefits to
sleep so if you can get you know your
full eight hours or whatever by all
means go for it but if you feel like
you're waking up and you're looking a
little tired and you want to look more
revived these are just some tips
one thing is to wear light or bright
colors for example this green kind of
bright on me today but it is bringing a
little more life a little more energy
its brightening up my face a little bit
clothes can do that it's amazing how
you'll put on different colors me but
why do I look better I didn't change
anything about my makeup why do I look
better in this color or that color you
know different colors can complement our
skin tones and if you are wearing your
lighter brighter colors I think it can
really bring a little more vibrancy to
your look also if you're maybe not going
with such a bright outfit think about a
bold necklace you can wear you know
something that will bring some attention
up to your face and kind of even more
than that just serve as that brightening
factor you know when it's up near your
face it's making your face seem a little
more alive I have like some kind of
chunky necklaces like I might just be
wearing a simple black top but then I
throw on you know a necklace like this
this is from Claire's this other
necklace that I have here kind of a
chunky double beaded pink thing is from
Claire's I like beads now and then I
think it's just a nice variation from
the metals and different things that
will wear but I like big necklaces like
this because I feel like when I get them
up near my face I just see something
change from when you were just wearing
that simple black top and then you throw
something on like this it brightens the
face pink is a great color too for so
many skin tones to do that if you're not
feeling like a necklace earrings
earrings can be that pop that you need
sometimes you go with a larger earring
something more sparkly a little more
vibrant and you know maybe you don't
pair it with one of those big necklaces
but there are a couple sets of earrings
that I feel like when I put them on I am
doing good and it's these little these
came from maurices I've worn these in
different videos and Ben and Ben asked
but these are like little flowers and
there's just tons of little crystals or
rhinestones or whatever that is on there
and I feel like when I've got these up
by my face you know it's just it's the
reasons why people put on nice sparkly
jewelry when they're going out it's
special it makes you look a little bit
more put together
also think about wearing your hair up I
feel like putting your hair up like even
today what I just did I took um you know
like I went like I was going to do half
up here
I pulled the top section of my hair up
teased it a little bit and then bobby
pinned it right behind here and then
pulled the rest up with it and just made
it into a ponytail and something about
getting your hair up it lifts people's
eye when they look at you and also once
your hair is up and done generally if
you got some hairspray on there it's
done you're not fussing with it
throughout the day so if you're not in
the mood to you know do a lot of fussing
getting your hair up and really pulling
it up so that the eye everything looks a
little bit more lifted I think it does
something and it might be one of those
days where you want to think I want to
cover up my face a little bit want my
hair down what you know the bangs
crossing over half of my face or
whatever but if you really want to look
more alive and lively this is going to
do it
makeup-wise concealer is so important
and I think it's kind of a no-brainer I
think it's just probably part of a lot
of people's everyday routine you know
I'm not just going to wear concealer
when I think I look tired but I'm gonna
wear it every day that's the way some
people feel but there is an added little
you know thing that I think you should
think about especially if you really
want to remove the discoloration and
let's say we're using for example this
is my Malley cancelation concealer it's
a really nice light brightening
concealer when you're putting that on
get it all the way up to your lower lash
line okay I'm talking right where your
you know your lashes hook in or in there
get it all the way up there because what
I think some people neglect is that
there is discoloration all the way up in
that area if not more redness and you
know a look of puffiness tiredness
whatever right up there next to the lash
line so don't just think oh I'm dark
right here I'm gonna put my concealer
down here and get it all the way up
there that's a trick I learned when I
was watching Bobby Brown I think I had
watched her on QVC at one point she
shared that trick and I was like this is
an eye-opening moment in my life right
now and then when I tried it I was like
such a difference such a great little
way to get a little more coverage going
on in that area and making yourself with
more finished and polished where the
eyes are concerned and don't necessarily
take what I did today because this is my
fake back because they look and I just
got to wet nuts with it but um you might
think that a lot of heavy contouring and
shading is going to give you you know
that sexy look but it doesn't
necessarily do a whole lot for making
you look well-rested
so think of maybe simplifying your eye
look a little bit and not reaching for
the deepest and darkest of the colors
you have for your contour you know
crease type shade like let's take for
example this is a palette from
wet-and-wild called walking on eggshells
you know this a white like this is great
to get this all over your lid and then
use a crease shade like say a medium
brown like this that is going to be
natural not to mention quick to use you
know to put a look like that together
but it's not going to make your eye look
like it's receding quite so much like
dark colors can do in the crease and
gonna make it look a little bit more
awake you know if you put on then your
your liner on your upper lash line if
you want to maybe smudge a little bit of
some liner on the lower lashes
definitely use mascara and curl those
lashes but that can be you know your
look that makes you look a little more
wide awake and I totally understand the
issue of not always being able to pop on
some false eyelashes in the morning
there just isn't the time a lot of days
if you're working going to school and
thinking uh not going to mess with it if
you do have the time though a pair of
natural-looking false eyelashes can work
wonders for how awake you look one that
I want to talk about real quickly revlon
beyond natural in defining and yes i did
pick up the 4-pack of these and i like
that they're selling them like this now
because this is also going to be a nice
way to may other men throw in my
bathroom right now but a nice way to
kind of store them again as well but
these are so natural you put these on
you get a little more thickness you get
a little bit of length but it's nothing
too crazy use the revlon precision lash
glue if i can grab my hair this is the
lifesaver too this does not take long to
use swipe it across the lashes pop them
on I know I'm over simplifying this but
this is a very very easy glue to use
doesn't take long to get tacky and it
doesn't give you a lot excess there that
gets goopy around your eyes so you know
some natural lashes if you have
something special going on maybe a photo
or something and you're like up what can
I do whatever I've done makeup wise
isn't enough for me popping on some
natural-looking false eyelashes can
finish the look very very nicely and
really make you look awake think about
maybe using a light or a white colored
eyeliner on your inner rim on your
waterline that can make your eyes look
more wide awake
for me I mean I might just use what
straight up white because I am on TV and
that doesn't necessarily show like oh my
gosh there's white there it just comes
off on camera like I may be looking a
little more awake than I really am some
people like to go for peach because
maybe in /
it's a little more obvious when white is
there so some sort of you know light
beige or something that can basically
eliminate the redness that you might get
on your waterline and kind of cover that
up that's a great thing to talk about it
daily must-haves that I personally would
never skip but I think it is a must must
must do if you are not feeling very
awake and that is blush I mean just pop
it on here on the sort of you know think
about the outer part of the apple of
your cheek getting too close to the nose
with the color can emphasize redness
around the nose but kind of keeping it
right up here right around this area is
gonna do great things for making you
look healthy Physicians Formula happy
booster this is a great one loved a
little set going on but that's a
gorgeous rosy blush the one that I
talked about recently from Milani Rose
Dior oh um this is a baked powder blush
here pretty pretty apricot shade think
about a brighter or lighter colored lip
as well and when I say brighter I don't
mean this has to be a neon shade to get
the job done but using a nice red like
NYC sheer red or you know a nice pink if
you've got one of those revlon
colorburst shades and like baby pink or
carnation would be pretty coral colors
are great as well but something that is
going to basically contribute to the
globe that you've got going on on your
face right now
you know my lips are pretty light but I
feel like they're not sort of sucking
the life out of my face for lack of a
better word sometimes you know you put
on something that's either too dark or
too light and it's like this is not
working with my skin what I've done now
is actually max Viva Glam to this kind
of neutral a lipstick bordering with a
little bit of a cool pink undertone
perhaps and I've got that on along with
my NYX lip gloss in sweetheart so that's
kind of a peachy cuz again I'm not
trying to say that you know use this as
an alternative to sleep use these
methods you know and don't get as much
sleep as you need because I think sleep
is really important we should all shoot
for
as much as we can but I know I found
even when I do get enough sleep I don't
always look like I did so these are just
some ways to perk yourself up in the
morning or whenever you have to get
ready and kind of get you on track for
having a better day so thank you for
watching have a great day and happy st.
Patrick's Day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
