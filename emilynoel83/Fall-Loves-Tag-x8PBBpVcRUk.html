I'm really enjoying some of these tags
lately and i was tagged by
eleventhgorgeous so tracing Stephanie hi
thank you so much for tagging me for
this I love their channel and I think
those two girls together like they're so
funny sweet absolutely gorgeous all the
time and I think that if we met up
sometime I think would have the best
time so thank you for tagging me and if
you want to see their channel click
below and link to them because I think
you'll have a lot of fun watching them
but anyway this tag is split up into
beauty and fashion questions and random
fall questions it says top 5 full makeup
items so I've pulled some from my
collection that I either associate with
fall or I think you know are specially
useful to wear in fall and first one is
a lip balm a great lip balm and I know I
recently blogged about lip balms on
beauty broadcast net but as I mentioned
in that blog so my true favorites
continue to be these eos smooth sphere
lip balms i think this is like
strawberry sorbet or something I feel
like they all smell so good they're
really moisturizing without feeling
greasy or like really sliding around on
the lips and I just I mean I'm keeping
them in my purse I'm keeping them beside
my bed in here where I do my makeup so I
just love them I also like a good
lipstick that's kind of like what I'm
wearing now that's maybe a little bit
deeper you know getting into some of the
deeper tones and I've been asked a lot
what's a great sort of universal read
that looks good on a lot of people and
one that I keep coming back to then I'm
wearing it right now is NYC cheer red
it's the ultra moist lip where this is
what it looks like and um this isn't
going to be your super bright like fire
engine red it's just a little deeper and
I think just a little more wearable in
that regard even after this wears off I
find my lips are still stained a little
bit with that red look so I like that a
lot bronzer I think some people think
bronzer is just a summer thing like oh I
want to look tan in the summer no I want
to look tan all the time you know I want
to have at least a little bit of that
healthy glow carry
me through four seasons you know just
because the weather changes doesn't mean
I don't want my bronzers so NYC sunny
good basic to have its Matt just works
really well for warming up the skin and
so I still want to do that as fall rolls
around and I also want to glow as well I
want my skin to look have that look of
health and a little bit glowy but not
too greasy and a great product from
malli that I actually like for that is
the shimmer shape and glow so it's a
shimmery powder a shaping powder that
gives you just really nice natural kind
of contours and then the globe which is
a blush so this is really cool all in
one compact it's kind of like you're you
know several key elements there so I
definitely like that for giving that
healthy glow and also there's an
eyeshadow trio that holds several great
fall eyeshadows and one that I really
swear by is like a Mac cranberry which I
used in my Mac tutorial but here's the
dupe for that and it is Nick's rust so
that's in this trio with its rust golden
and walnut bronze I love all these
shades and I I mean that cranberry is a
must-have fall shade for me but i love
the other ones different hair product I
don't know that my routine changes a
whole lot from like spring and summer to
fall and winter except for the fact that
my hair continues to be you know dry at
the ends I've got long hair you know and
it with heat styling on a daily basis it
does get dry at the end so a leave-in
conditioner is something I'm going to be
reaching for I've talked about this one
before and I still like it and I love
the scent and it is called herbal
essences long-term relationship leave in
split end protector for long hair so
it's kind of like a leave-in conditioner
it has kind of a raspberry sent to it I
love it so much so that's great for kind
of after you get out of the shower your
hair is wet you've kind of towel dried
in a bit and then I put some of that on
there and comb through it favorite nail
polish um I don't know that this is so
much a fall nail polish but it's a nail
polish that I'm loving a lot lately and
it works absolutely here round
and I tend to I feel like I'm liking
some of the lighter shades more and more
and this I've gotten a lot of
questions about what I've had it on and
it is Sally Hansen diamond strength no
chip nail color in nude shimmer this is
a gorgeous shade look at some of my past
videos like just recent videos and I
think you'll see me wearing this in them
it's just a gorgeous metallic that's not
too you know it's not stark silver it's
just got that little bit of warmth to it
may be just the slightest hint of pink
or beige but it's very very wearable and
it just it will match all your jewelry
gold or silver it will match all your
outfits so I love that next question is
favorite false scent and what I
initially thought about was like candles
and the bath and bodyworks wall flowers
and stuff and I'm like well maybe they
meant fragrance so a fragrance that I do
like that I just recently got from Bath
and Body Works is the cozy autumn
vanilla because I love vanilla sense
that this one in a way I think it's kind
of vanilla plus a little bit of Musk
plus it just has kind of a little bit
deeper richer feel than most vanilla
scents do so i like that i have the body
wash and the lotion um i'm not as wild
about the scent of the body wash for
some reason it's just a little different
but i do love the spray and i love the
lotion and a candle but i love that i've
been talking about on my facebook page
and here and there has just been this
one it's five dollars from walmart these
better homes and gardens five-dollar
candles are great and they come out with
a whole batch of them around fall and
then I think they bring out some new
flavors at Christmas too and this one
country kettle corn my goodness this is
a lot like oh my goodness this is so
good like you've got to check this out
at least just smell it just take you
know a minute and go by and smell it if
you're like me you go buy candles in the
store and you can hardly walk past
without like popping open five of them
and giving them a whiff but this one it
kind of rim sul tea or so
carmel scent from bath and body works
but it just blows my mind how good that
is that's just and it smells up the
whole house like it smells up from the
living room through the kitchen to the
bedroom a bit like as soon as you walk
in if you've had this burning for a half
an hour to 45 minutes this is going to
have your house smelling amazing also I
have to note here I put down my favorite
Wallflower scent which I've got in my
bathroom and Tyler and I are just nuts
about it it's called marshmallow
fireside and it's one of the new
wallflowers it has like a little owl
design on it actually and it just smells
insanely good I mean if you can't tell I
love the scent of things that are edible
so I'm loving you know around this time
of year things that give you a really
warm feeling that are just sweet and
kind of like you know fresh out of the
oven type of scent that's what I like
and this marshmallow Wallflower is
greatest worn clothing item and
accessory most worn clothing item for
the fall season is the sweater dress I
love sweater dresses because they're so
versatile they just texture-wise and the
weight of them makes you feel warmer but
yet you're still wearing a fun dress you
know so and you compare them with boots
really easily this is one that i have
i've gotten several um not this season
yet but last year in the year before
from wet seal I've had great luck with
their sweater dresses this is why I just
wore this past weekend and it's you know
going to come to above the knee and its
really cute its kind of gathered in
right here very comfortable it's very
cute and my must-have accessory has got
to be the boots um this is another wet
seal thing here and I've seen this style
of boot elsewhere but this is going to
go on my short legs it's going to go
most of the way up my camp and it's got
a little heel I love that shape of the
boot I think it makes my foot look
smaller buckle detail here it's kind of
a faux suede thing going on in another
buckle up top so I've had these for a
couple years now warn the heck out of
them and they still look great as your
fall style icon I never really thought
about
having a false style icon until i read
this question but i am going to go with
an all-around style icon and I'm gonna
say Kim Kardashian because I feel like
whenever she was photographed whenever I
see her I like something about her style
I may not always like the entire outfit
or this or that but generally speaking
she always looks very put together and I
feel like when I see her around this
time of year I noticed that she does
lots of layering but it never looks too
bulky I like that she's got kind of like
a normal woman's figure you know she's
curvy and she manages to later without
looking like she's got tons of bulkiness
on that's the challenge for all of us
this time of years you know you want to
throw on a sweater and a shirt under
that maybe something over the top and
you just end up looking bigger and
bigger the more you put on so I think
she's kind of got that masters question
going to a corn maze what do you wear um
pretty typical I'm gonna wear jeans and
my wear sneakers I'm probably gonna wear
a hoodie favorite Halloween movie I'm
not the biggest horror movie person I'm
I just don't love getting the crap
scared out of me when I watch a movie
but for those of you who are looking for
something really scary and if you
haven't seen this yet silence of the
lambs freaked me out like none other
like I saw that movie in the comfort of
my own home and I was like scared going
up and going into another room after
horse by myself like it really got into
my head so um definitely Silence of the
Lambs is a freaky mood favor al Wayne
candy I am going to go with the caramel
apple suckers have you guys had those I
think they come out I don't notice them
being out any other time much other than
Halloween I'm sure I could get my hands
on somehow and somebody will probably
tell me how but they are like the green
apple suckers that are coated with
caramel and they taste so good but don't
like bite into them or I'm sure you will
pull out pull out a filling but they're
really yummy and what are you going to
be for halloween I haven't even decided
yet actually I'm not sure if you have
any suggestions for me if you think of
it as you've watched this video
something has occurred
to you that would be a good halloween
costume for me or maybe me and Tyler let
me know we have gone as a dancing with
the stars couple before I should link to
that video I went through the whole
process of how we got ready for that but
we like spray tandem spray tan me we
were like orange and fabulous it was
just great thank you for watching this
video this was so much fun thank you too
