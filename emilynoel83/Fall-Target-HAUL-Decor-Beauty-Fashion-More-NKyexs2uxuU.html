if you like hulls and you like a little
bit of randomness that's pretty much
what this is I went to Target a few days
ago and just picked up a lot of
different things I was looking for some
new fall decor so I have some of that a
little bit of fashion just a little bit
and some beauty type things as well but
I first off just want to say if I look
puffy I feel like my eyes are so puffy I
maybe don't notice it as much now with
my makeup on but as I was doing it they
were just really kind of puffy and
swollen and it's because I was crying
last night just so emotional thinking
about Belle turning one year old and
Tyler and I were just talking about it
we put her to bed and we're just
reminiscing about just and here it goes
again no I can't go there now just
thinking about not only the fact that
you know a year has passed and she's
getting older and that kind of makes me
weepy but just all of the ways like we
as people have changed because of her
you know just all the things she's
taught us all the things that a baby
brings about in your life it just it
makes me so emotional not like bad
emotional but just like it's hard to
explain but it's just been a really
monumental year for us here we've been
going through old pictures and looking
at her when she was like you know she's
just the length of your forearm you know
you could hold her right there and now
she's walking around we are just so so
grateful for her for all of your
kindness that you guys share with us as
well it really really means a lot it
touches me um more deeply than I can
express so I just want to say thank you
okay how do we kind of transition out of
the emotions let's talk about target
stuff pumpkins back here I actually ran
into these pumpkins in the whole fall
Halloween area of Target and they have
some really really cute ones um they
also had some that we had little like
studs on them and it was just adorable
and this is my favorite time of year to
decorate aside from Christmas you know
but Christmas can get a little
overwhelming sometimes with the decor
not that I don't love putting up a
Christmas tree but I go really big at
Christmastime and it can be a lot but
for fall it's just like you know throw
around some cute little pumpkins
I'll be happy they had these two sizes
at the polka dot once and I knew I was
getting the little one and then
something told me go for the big one as
well so they just fit really nicely back
here that little gold candle holder was
actually just something I had from Hobby
Lobby
well these pumpkins are pretty much
white I don't know maybe they're like
the slightest bit off white but you can
see they look okay on top of these white
IKEA drawers I also got this little
sleeve of like eight mini pumpkins and
they're more of a cream color and it's
kind of burnt orange and they had this
really pretty like kind of bronzy rose
gold glitter on them as well and so I've
got those scattered around the house
downstairs they really match in with my
decor down there they're just so cute I
love the polka dots and little like
zigzags on them and I love those that
was pretty much what I came up with
decor wise I have a lot of fall type
stuff already that just really carries
over a year to year for me and I'm kind
of simplifying it a bit more now like
definitely being mindful of what things
Bill can like reach up to a grab but if
you're interested in more on that what's
thinking maybe I might do something on
the vlog channel like home decor wise
but let me know if you even care about
that I also of course stop by the one
spot in target where everything's a
dollar and this I don't know it just
belongs in this room that's all I can
say it's not like I've went insane hmm I
really need a mini clipboard and if it
could be pink and gold that would be
great but I saw it it was a dollar and
then they had this little um this is
actually a magnetic little to-do list so
yeah that fits nicely right there that's
having a baby I've become much more of a
list maker and just you know scratch it
off as you get it done as opposed to a
day-by-day planner like this certain
thing needs to get done on this
particular day because that kind of
drove me crazy because I was always
crossing things out and drawing arrows
and it just looked like I don't know
some kind of football play chart so I
like to do lists it also had some super
cute little thank-you notes I'm often
sending these out to you guys so you may
be seeing some of these come into your
mailbox too but I like the green and the
gold on there and
as many of you probably noticed I pretty
much live in the Moroni um target
t-shirts I love them I have so many like
solid shades or like that kind of
heathered looking print and there were
actually two new prints that I saw lots
and I was there that I really wanted to
get one was this and this is just
standard like v-neck t-shirt style here
and this made me think of Leopard at a
glance but really it's just kind of a
leopard issue present I don't know what
to say it's got that bronzy kind of old
gold also black and dark brown and I
just love it and actually when I laid
eyes on it I thought wouldn't that be
pretty with a bronzy smokey yeah there
was some kind of deal on them I don't
know if it was buy one get one 50% off I
think that's what it was so the other
one I picked up was this cute camo one
which actually has like navy blue in it
instead of black I see that just looking
great with a pair of jeans you know very
simple for these shirts they're
relatively inexpensive and it's just I
like wearing those things that I don't
have to wear and be worried about like
get upset if it gets stained or if the
neckline gets pulled out was anybody
watching my CVS haul where I was talking
about those awesome little headbands and
bun wraps that have the flexible ties on
them like you can just they're wired
there's a small wire running throughout
and you can make them lay exactly how
you want them to I've got more of those
but I found them from the Remington
brand actually I think it's just a
brilliant idea because bandanas
sometimes those just take a little more
fooling around with and these are so
easy so what I have done is this is just
a long you know strip of a headband
I literally just twisted it a couple
times and pulled this to lay however I
want it to like the wires in there I
could have it sticking up like that if I
wanted to it's so cool it's kind of like
a Pippi Longstocking type effect but
these are by Remington it says anywhere
hair hair and wrists okay people are
wearing these on the wrists apparently
but here's you know a look at some of
the different ways you could wear them
I'm a big fan of also just pulling the
hair up into the bun and then wrapping
one of the
around I love that there was just a
plain black available and then a couple
of super cute the plaid ones I thought
this one seems so wintery and it's a
little bit thicker fabric so I just love
that and then this one you know just a
classic like red white and blue plaid I
think that's so cute or something I have
liked to use actually kind of at the
start of my day at times instead of
doing a full face washing I've been
experimenting with some of the different
micellar waters including the one from
simple that's the one I've had the
longest and used the most of it it's
seriously just so simple to grab a
cotton ball and just swipe it all over
your face and you feel refreshed but you
don't feel over dried and I think that's
kind of the concept is that you can
cleanse your skin without completely
stripping it I've also been using the
Bioderma the sensitive formula of that
and this boots botanics micellar
cleansing solution called albright now a
lot of these will claim makeup removal
as well and I have experimented with
that you can check my full review on the
simple micellar water for more of my
experience in a nutshell though I didn't
think it did a good job on my makeup
even though it claimed to really be able
to tackle everything I thought it took a
lot of work on the eyes a lot of little
cotton pads but I was really interested
when I saw I think it's some magazine
ads that they're putting out then my
seller makeup remover wipes so I'm
interested to give these another crack
from the makeup removal standpoint and
see if maybe these work better it's
gonna take a lot for me to like anything
better makeup removal wise than the Olay
Daley facials where the equate daily
facials cleansing cloths so once it
start dry you get them wet and then they
suds up I love those but I'm willing to
give these a shot
I also saw this in the bath aisle I have
not used a lot of stuff from the brand
method actually I think I have one like
um I used a cleaning spray for a while
and really liked it but they had this in
the body wash aisle it looks like either
a mouthwash some sort of cleaning
solution but this is a foaming body wash
it says with aloe and vitamin E the
scent on this is ruby orange
and I think I was instagramming about a
soap that I liked a while back and so
many of you were saying you should try
the method foaming soaps if you like the
foaming hand soaps and I do love those
I've got one from Ulta I really like the
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works foaming soaps but have
never tried a foaming body wash so I
have not used this yet the scent on it
is really really refreshing and I got
the orange because I know Tyler loves
orange scented stuff so I thought he
would like this so we haven't used it
yet but we're gonna sit Burt's Bees has
a pumpkin spice limited edition lip balm
I've never seen this before until this
year saw it at the end of one of the
makeup aisles got it I've already
reviewed this stuff on the Express
channel if you want some more details
but it is a pretty legit pumpkin spice
scent on this and Burt's Bees is just
kind of on fire with the different
scented lip balms that they're coming
out with I love the wild cherry I've
talked about that before but I had to go
there I had to get the pumpkin spice and
this is nothing tinted by the way it's
just like standard lip balm but yeah it
gets you in the mood for the season I
gotta say and I got the pumpkin spice
Oreos holy crap why didn't anybody tell
me these are so good I really like them
I get such a yummy like pumpkin pie vibe
and I think I don't know be where you
come away from eating those and you
really do one simple goodbye but it's
really good so that's glad I found those
and makeup wise I really wasn't running
across a lot of new launches I have
bought you know a few new things that
I've seen on ulties website that you
will probably see me talking about in
future videos but as far as Target goes
I just wasn't seeing a lot and I was
feeling compelled to try some older
things that maybe I tried like way way
back in my early makeup using days one
of those which is probably the first
concealer I ever bought is the invisible
concealer from covergirl I got this in
the shade light and this is now I guess
under the clean umbrella because it's
called clean and visible concealer and I
did use this today it works rather well
I must say I need to keep a close eye on
whether or not it drives me out like on
the under
area cuz that's really the main place
where I used it but I just felt like
trying that out again and also this
powder the simply powder foundation
adding creamy natural I remember always
buying the shade of creamy natural in
covergirl stuff
whoa back in like my late junior high
days this was maybe like an eighth grade
purchase for me comes with a little
sponge and really I don't think they've
changed or improved the formulation much
since then because it is a much like
drier feeling powder compared to some of
the like powder foundations I'm used to
using nowadays like I think the NYX stay
matte but not flat the it cosmetics even
that Revlon nearly naked powder you know
you touch them and they feel kind of
buttery smooth and this does just kind
of feel dry but I did set my makeup look
with just a little bit of this today and
I don't know felt a little nostalgic so
that pretty much wraps up the new target
stuff that I picked up super excited
about the flexible headbands so I really
wanted to share that with you I was
thinking of lumping in some of the new
Altis stuff with this video but I
thought it might just be too long and I
think it really would be so if you want
to see a separate video on that let me
know or I may just kind of introduce you
to some of those products and individual
reviews but thank you so much for
watching thanks for bearing with my
emotional self as I looked down at the
start of this video and just but I love
you guys I really appreciate your
support and I thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
