having a good night or day whatever time
of day you're watching this I'm actually
getting ready to go out on the town
tonight my hair still still drying here
and I did kind of a dramatic look um on
my eyes and you can probably tell since
1i looks a little bit bolder than the
other I have a false eyelashes on this
side and it's sort of a natural set of
eyelashes but I had been asked before
you know can you do a tutorial showing
false eyelashes and how you do that and
it is something that I do use
occasionally but I haven't really
incorporated it into many videos if any
videos I think maybe there was one sort
of like picture thing that I've voiced
over doing some eyelashes but I haven't
really gone in-depth describing it
because I feel like there are a lot of
gurus on here that have done some
excellent um eyelash tutorials couple
that come to mind Eve pearl a makeup
artist to the stars she is one that I've
picked up some tips from as far as
applying those so if you and kind of
search for her channel on youtube its
ease pearl and she has a great technique
for doing this um julieg 713 I believe
those are the numbers um she
incorporates a lot of fake eyelashes
into some of her tutorials you may pick
up on that but there are different ways
to do it so basically this is just my
technique for doing it take it for what
it's worth if you like it that doing it
my way you know me to try it out see if
it works for you if not there are plenty
of other methods that you can use okay
so first off you can see what I've got
going on here they are not the most
dramatic false lashes that you can work
with they're obviously some very
costumey lashes or big lashes but what
I'm using are the UM see if I can show
you here they're the vm mod lash from
andrea and they're the number 50
so um and just to give you an idea I
mean I not too long ago several my
sisters and while we're down here and we
were going out and I had some sets of
these are actually perfectly picked up a
few sets because they're like we're
gonna do fake eyelashes and I use this
color this kind be mod lash number 53 on
them and they loved it because i think
the apprehension for a lot of people
with false eyelashes is how you put them
on and keep from looking like you're
going to a Halloween party basically and
so I think they were really pleased with
how naturally turned out to be on their
eyes just kind of really enhance what
they had but you know can do a lot for
you so it's exciting and fun to do false
eyelashes especially when you're not
sacrificing a whole lot so anyway enough
of me talking now I'm going to just get
to the tutorial and I put them on my
right eye here and the first step I
would say is to curl your lashes and put
on mascara as you normally would maybe
don't put on as much mascara since you
are going to get quite a bit of help
from the fake lashes but I call them
hold it there for like 15 seconds like I
usually do put on you know one coat of
mascara and what that's going to do is
get them in that up in that club state
because these are very much very curvy
you know and they're going to blend a
lot easier once you put them on so
rather than just going straight to bear
lashes that had nothing done to them
you'll find it'll be easier if you curl
them and do put a coat of mascara on now
what I'm going to do is I've squirted
out onto I kind of used this little
thing that comes with the lashes is my
palette and I've squirted on you can see
a little glob of it right there the duo
dark tone eyelash adhesive this is
available at walgreens it works great
I've never had any issues with anything
coming off or you know having any issues
with that so um also these these number
53 you mate with some ways you may have
to trim a little bit for me these are
fine lengthwise
for several different people I used them
on they were good as well so maybe for
the average person these are going to be
okay but do be aware that some lashes
will come much longer and you will need
to take a little pair of scissors and
just clip off a few segments of it no
big deal there but what I used to take
the glue from the card to my lashes is
um these little double ended applicators
these are from studio basics I think I
got them from some beauty store like
beauty first or something like that and
you can find these pretty much anywhere
and what it is basically a q-tip with a
nice point to it just like that so what
I'm going to do I'm going to use the end
that I used on the last one I'm just
going to dip into the glue just a little
bit and just get a good amount there on
the tip and then holding my lashes here
with my finger not a big tweezers person
I just for some reason I feel like I
have more control with my fingers I'm
just going to take my q-tip and run this
right along the lashes right along that
whole strip there okay so I kind of go
down one way back the other way and I
really make sure that I've got the ends
so I might go back for a little more
glue and just make sure that those ends
have enough glue on them because that if
any if you have any problems it seems
like it may be on the ends so just
reinforce that and then big key here is
to not immediately put them on your eye
you want this to get a little bit tacky
give it between I would say maybe around
30 seconds or so just long enough for
this to not be in that quite that
liquidy state that you're in so what
we're going to do here is I'm going
again use my fingers um just place these
on my eye and I'm going to my I'm
shooting for is to get as close to my
lash line as possible I want to lay them
right on there and get them right above
I don't want to lay it on the lashes
because then you're going to really have
some issues I mean you're going to
notice it with your clothes opening and
closing your eyes you're going to notice
if you've got eyelashes sitting on
eyelashes so you do want it to be in
contact with the skin very close to your
lash line so now I think we're about
ready I'm just holding these at the tip
and um okay I want to get so you can see
it but I'm not gonna hear what hits well
do please my little Mary down here okay
so I'm just looking down into a mirror
and I'm focusing on where the center of
that is okay there they are I'm just
pressing the band down okay now as soon
as you are shared that that band is
secured on both ends and all along the
middle what you want to do as its drying
is keep lifting like this like I can I
just put my finger there and then close
my eye because you want these to dry in
a very upward state you practically if
you watch Eve curls method she really
exaggerate this because she will just
turn them back so it's like the lashes
are just it's up pointing to the sky and
beyond you know so you really want that
because this is the difference in
eyelashes enhancing your eyes and the
fake eyelashes cutting your eye in half
I've had people say you know I put the
fake eyelashes on but they do nothing
for me and where I think some people go
wrong is they're not getting that curve
defect there because I mean think about
it when these are if these were hanging
down in my eye it would make my eyes
look smaller so you do want them curving
up and away from your eye so this whole
time want glue is still may be a little
bit tacky on there I'm just continually
pressing up and up and you'll find if
you did go ahead and do your mascara the
first time around that you're not having
a lot of issues with them blending in
your real lashes and your fake fake ones
but I always do this I take mascara i'm
just going to use my lash out mask
are any kind really will do I wouldn't
make recommend a waterproof for this
step just simply because I you know
don't want to have to really fight
tickle when I clean off the lashes
because these can be used more than once
i would say i don't know maybe four or
five uses out of one it depends on how
gentle and careful you are with them but
i do go ahead and apply a coat of
mascara just to make sure everything is
blended here I don't take my eyelash
curler to these lashes because you'll
find you may leave a dent and your false
lashes there might be some certain ones
out there that that doesn't happen with
but I've mistakenly done that and been
like oh these don't look like the same
eyelashes anymore so anyway we've got
got the mascara on there and you're
ready to go and you can see again you
can totally see a difference but yet
with these lashes they're not super
outlandish to where you don't look like
yourself anymore so anyway this is bat
your lashes this is the look that I've
got tonight and that's kind of how I
mean if you've seen enough looks that
I've done you can see how the lashes
really enhance that so I hope this video
was informative for you and you maybe
wanted a few new techniques like I said
different things work for different
people so just take it for what it's
worth but I hope maybe next time you
attempt the false lashes maybe seem a
little more doable after watching this
so thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
