viewing this video on the Ladies Home
Journal blog blas daily it's great to
have you here my name is Emily and in
this video we'll be talking about all
things false eyelashes I really wanted
to do a video taking you through the
process from the absolute start which
means actually picking out your false
eyelashes to finish when it comes to
taking them off storing them and keeping
them nice for future uses you can
actually get multiple uses out of one
pair of false eyelashes if you take care
of them and of course we'll also cover
how to put the darn things on because I
know a lot of people are a little bit
intimidated by the process and I really
was - at first it was years before I
actually took the plunge and decided I'm
going to try to put some of these on but
once I did I realized that it could be
the single quickest and most effective
way to take you from everyday to
glamorous so first off what you need
some false lashes that's kind of the
no-brainer here also an adhesive to
apply them and when we get into cleaning
them off and caring for them you're
going to want some oil-free eye makeup
remover now if you start looking at
false eyelashes in the store you're
probably going to notice kind of an
overwhelming selection so if you are
looking for really natural false
eyelashes a couple of good kinds are the
Ardell or salon perfect these two brands
pretty much sell a lot of the same
styles but look for the Ardell or Salon
perfect number 53 is probably one of the
most natural-looking false lash styles
and also the 110 that's another one that
might give you a little more thickness
to your natural lashes but not a whole
lot of extra length if you're looking
for something that's a little bit more
dramatic but still not over-the-top I
would look at the Salon perfect or
ardell demi wispies that's the kind of
wearing now and the kind that you'll see
demonstrated in this video they've got a
nice flared look a little extra length
on the ends and I think it just gives
you a great almost like a cat eye effect
without having to worry about winged
liner if you're looking to go really
really dramatic i recommend the Ardell
double ups that's basically two bands of
false eyelash
is layered with one another but you can
still put them on in one easy step and
those are very thick very long I mean
they are just intense but they're really
pretty too you also may see individual
false lashes little bitty false lash
bundles
I'm not demonstrating that in this video
I just feel like the lash band for me
and what I've noticed on other people it
can give you the greatest impact and
there are so many styles you can still
look very natural even with just false
lashes on a band there are a lot of
great glues out there as well the one
that I like to use best and that I think
is really easy especially if you're just
starting out is the Revlon precision
lash adhesive it comes with a wand what
that has a little brush tip so you can
just brush it directly on your lash band
and it dries fairly quickly so it just
speeds up the whole lash applying
process and also you want to make sure
again that you have the oil-free eye
makeup remover because if you have one
that does include oil it can cause some
problems for you down the road when you
go to reuse your lashes that you've
cleaned up because the oil-based eye
makeup remover can remove a lot of the
product that might have gotten on your
lashes it's also really infusing them
with oil and making them potentially
harder to apply in the future so when it
comes to application a couple of makeup
related things you want to do first I
love to have a nice dark line of
eyeliner on my lash line because that's
basically what our lash band of these
false eyelashes is going to disappear
into once you put them on I personally
also like to curl my lashes and apply
some mascara first before I add in the
false lashes I just feel like I get a
better blend that way I have very
straight lashes and false lashes tend to
have a really nice curve to them so to
make my own lashes really blend with
that shade like to just give a quick
coat of mascara and the curl before I
even start with the false lash
application all sigh lashes are actually
adhered to the packaging that they come
in they're not hard to get off but you
do want to be kind of careful so you
don't lose any lashes off of the lash
band in the process so I like to take
some tweezers just kind of loosen up one
and then kind of slowly pull them from
the packaging and it doesn't hurt to
before you get any glue on the lashes
just sit them on your lash line and make
sure they're not too long from left to
right if they are you can easily trim a
little bit off then you're going to
apply your lash glue and if you don't
have a kind like this that has a nice
wand applicator you can just squirt some
out onto a surface onto a Kleenex and
use a q-tip basically as your wand for
your glue but you're going to apply that
all across the lash band and you want a
very small amount of the glue too much
we'll just basically make a mess on your
lash line so I like to go across the
lash band and then sort of reinforce
each end with just a little bit of extra
glue I find that if your lashes are
going to start to come off normally it's
the ends that are the most susceptible
so add a little more glue there next
it's very important to wait and let that
glue become just a little bit tacky
before you put it on your eye otherwise
if you immediately go to put it on your
lash line it's going to kind of come
right back off it's not going to cling
so for most lash glues you want to wait
maybe 45 seconds to just let it get a
little bit tacky don't get in a habit of
blowing on your lashes to make them dry
off quicker if you ever do somebody
else's makeup they don't want to see you
blowing on what's going on there I then
I just grab the lashes right in the
center and if you have issues with this
step you can also use tweezers for this
as well but you've got your fingers
right in the middle and then I just
align my fingers with the center of my
eye then I just set them right on my
eyeliner and we're not trying to set
these on our own natural lashes but as
close as possible on that eyeliner that
we already put there once you get the
center part down then you just take each
end and kind of tap it down make sure
it's attached and then tap over lightly
on the whole lash band to make sure
every part of that has come in contact
with skin then you can kind of blink
onto your finger and that makes sure
that the lashes dry onto your eye in a
nice upward fashion something you'll
notice about this lash glue and pretty
much any kind you use is that once it
dries it basically disappears so when
you feel
like it is dry there on your lashline I
like to add just a little more mascara
just to blend my lashes with the fake
lashes I don't use much and I'm not
raking my mascara wand all the way
through because I got good link you know
once you put on the false lashes you've
probably got a lot of nice lengths so
just kind of practically blot it toward
the base of your lash and that way you
can ensure that your real lashes and
your fake lashes are as one so there you
go now you got great lashes and just
that one step can make such a big impact
on your overall it never hurts
throughout the day to maybe keep a
little lash glue with you just in case
something happens and something starts
to come loose you can reapply but I
rarely have to do that so now we've
reached the end of the day and it's time
to take the false lashes off and keep in
mind when we applied them we really
aimed for getting them on the eyeliner
not to get them on the lashes at all but
there's a chance that some of the glue
could come in contact with the lashes so
I want to show you just the absolute
most painless way of removing these it's
really not painful just to peel them off
anyway but just in case you got a little
bit of glue in the wrong places here's
what to do I'm taking some of my oil
free eye makeup remover dipping a q-tip
in there and then I'm going to just run
this q-tip right across my lash line and
you could also just you know moisten a
cotton round you know with some of that
remover and just hold it on your eye but
you can just run this right over the
band I'm going to do it on the other eye
as well and then I'm just grabbing the
lash at the innermost part and it comes
right off it it really just comes off
very easily
and then you're ready to get these
cleaned off so you can store them if the
glue doesn't come off easily for you you
can just add a little bit more eye
makeup remover to a q-tip and run it
over the band and it'll help you peel
off the glue even easier but I find it
comes off pretty well just with your
finger nails just good old fashioned go
over it and pick that glue off so we've
still got some mascara on those
lashes because remember we put some on
to help it bond with our natural lashes
so I'm just going to get my q-tip wet
there again with some oil free eye
makeup remover and I've got my lashes
sitting here on a tissue and I just run
right over them with that q-tip you can
see a lot of the product has come off
but you can kind of go over them again
see if there's any more didn't think we
put much on but you'll always see a
little bit come off and then you can use
your clean side to kind of go over it
and see that it is indeed clean so there
is your clean lash another kind of handy
way to clean off false lashes are these
little oil free eye makeup remover pads
almay makes them and basically with this
you just make a little taco out of the
pad and you can hold that over the lash
and that can really start to loosen up
some of the mascara that's on there as
well just kind of massage it a little
bit and then when you're done you can
see so much product has been removed
kind of run over it with your q-tip and
get rid of any extra and that can clean
it off effectively as well so once your
lashes are nice and cleaned off the best
place to keep them is the container they
came in I like these containers because
when you put your false lashes back see
how you're kind of sticking them back on
that little curved area there and it
keeps them really nicely shaped so if
you've got a multipack you may have this
kind of setup if you have a singular one
you might have that as well on the
container so that's it I am now lash
'less but I've got my lashes nicely
stored here so I can reuse them and
that's something to keep in mind just
because you sometimes do see lashes sold
in these multi packs it doesn't mean
you're just going to do one use every
time and then throw it away these are
pretty good quality lashes they've got a
great band there and a lot of times I
find that as long as the band can keep
that nice shape for you and the lashes
keep that nice gentle curve that you
expect them to have you can reuse them
multiple times I've reused these you
know up to a couple of weeks actually
use the same pair just because I kept
them clean
Dolf and I kept them stored back in
their container so hopefully that makes
the whole false lash process a little
bit easier for you if you have any
special tips and tricks definitely share
them in the comments section or just
shoot me a tweet and let me know your
best tip for applying falsies and thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
