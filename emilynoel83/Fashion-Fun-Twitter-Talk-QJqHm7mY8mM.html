really want to say a huge thank you to

up for a special feature on the front
page of YouTube and I would really
appreciate your votes it's very easy you

and click it's like two clicks and
you're done so thank you so much for all
the support you guys have shown so far
there's still several days of voting
left so I would really really appreciate
you taking the time to do that for me
thank you so so much and it's just
really an honor to be included in this
I'm the only makeup Channel that's part
of it what I wanted to do in this video
was actually go back in time a little
bit I did a Twitter talk video yesterday
that's where I kind of just answer some
random questions on Twitter I just kind
of put a call out there hey ask me any
questions you want it'll be included in
an upcoming video so I'll be going
through that I'll be in a different
outfit since I did that yesterday but I
thought for today I might do a quick
little outfit of the day and if you're
wondering about makeup right now you can
check that out on my dailybooth page
I've got this some pearl earrings on
these are really neat they're actually
kind of like a lilac shade so it's like
that's pearl effect but really soft and
pretty um my necklace is just this
little it's actually a little feather
and I got this very cheap from forever
21 so if you want to check that out
forever 21 is the place to go I bought
this little like cardigan sweater here
that I have had for a really long time
it's just regular long-sleeved sweater
and I just kind of paired this with a
shirt that I think I might have included
this actually in another outfit of the
day but it's got this neat little detail
right here kind of like a floral poofy
thing going on I'll post in the bottom
bar exactly where I got this from but
kind of letting that sort of show there
on the top
just got genes on the bottom and this
cool bracelet that I got from Claire's
it's gold and it's got this like really
dark wood beading all around it's so
kind of a neat little cuff bracelet
that's my little outfit of the day
because lots of people who said you're
neglecting the fashion so there it is
for you and here is the Twitter talk so
my first question here is from any SP
and she says maybe you can talk about
skin products that are best for the
winter especially for when skin gets
flaky I've gotten a lot of this kind of
question here lately and a couple of the
things I would say are to look at the
cleanser you're using and the
moisturizer I think sometimes with
cleansers we use things that really can
strip our skin and maybe we gear towards
that a little bit more during the summer
you know you want that oil sweat to not
be a part of your face whatsoever but I
think maybe going towards a cream
cleanser for example I use a vino ultra
calming daily moisturizer and I also use
the cream cleanser and I know there are
a lot of people sometimes when your skin
gets real dry it also gets sensitive so
this is very good for sensitive skin the
ultra calming and that cleanser being a
cream cleanser I mean it's not getting
me oily but it is you know it's cleaning
my face but it's not stripping it of the
oil natural oils that it that it needs
dela has a question she says what is
your favorite high-end foundation I
haven't tried a whole lot of high-end
foundations but I have tried some and I
can tell you the one that I'm actually
wearing today is one of my favorites and
it's the Mac mineralized skinfinish SPF
15 foundation and this is a really great
foundation I feel like it gives your
skin that little bit of a glow it
reminds me a little bit of Revlon
Photoready speaking of a product that
when your skin gets a little more dry it
keeps it from looking really dull I feel
like this is one of them it just it has
this nice little pump applicator and I
just feel like it's very blendable I've
gotten really used to working with this
over time that I've had
and I just think it's really great so
that might be one worth checking out
especially dry skin or if your skin gets
dry in the winter time something to look
for there Tammy Marie says are you going
to review that new law real mascara
million lashes well I tell you what I've
got one right here
and I am gonna use it a little bit more
before I go ahead and post a review
right now I'm very soso on this I feel
like it really doesn't seem a bit like
the regular voluminous or the voluminous
carbon black so I mean the fact they put
this in the title they that's my that's
my text meant to drink long story behind
that anyway this really does not remind
me of any of the other voluminous
mascaras it has a rubber brush that is
excuse me it's kind of a large brush and
I feel like it doesn't clump at all
which is good but doesn't quite give me
enough formula on the lashes either like
the other voluminous versions do to
really plump them up and make them
really thick so right now you know it's
not a mascara I would urge anyone to go
right out and buy but if my opinion
changes like I said I'll post a formal a
real review hunt that later on next up
Jess Hollywood says what are your
favorite high-end and drugstore brands
wow this is a hard question because I
like so many brands I mean high-end or
drugstore I still have a lot that I like
just to throw out a few you know a
high-end brand that I am getting more
into as time goes on and just enjoying
testing out new products from it is
urban decay I got the Naked palette I
have several other palettes that I like
and then I really have enjoyed so I
think they have several real standout
products so I'm liking experimenting
with that brand Too Faced has been a
brand that I've loved that I've gotten a
lot of kind of gifty items from from my
sister from Too Faced and I've loved
them all and I just I don't know it's a
great brand for experimenting and
adorable packaging Smashbox is another
great high-end brand that has
some really nice especially if you're
thinking about the holidays they tend to
have a lot of nice boxed up sets so you
can try a lot of different products and
they're pretty generous with what you
get even with those sets I mean there's
usually several full sized items in
there and so I think that's a great way
to it get introduced to the brand I've
tried lots of those kits that I've
really liked and then finally I'm
getting a little bit more into Mac I'm
definitely not as into Mac as many of
the youtubers out there are but I've
kind of a small collection and what I
have you know some things I like some
things I don't like but as a whole I
think it's a great quality brand so
those are some high-end things that I
enjoy and then from the drugstore my
goodness I could tell you something from
every brand that I just love but just
off the top of my head Revlon has tons
of great Colorstay products that I like
with a few minor exceptions but many of
them I think are great I love a lot of
the shadows from covergirl
I think wet-and-wild has some
individually outstanding products NYX is
another great great brand inexpensive
makeup but some amazing quality products
and they're great for color if you're
looking for color but you don't want to
spend a lot for it you can get that
great pigmentation out of NYX products
so I definitely didn't include
everything here but those are just some
ideas just the ones that popped into my
head just now because I haven't looked
at these questions in advance so thank
you for that loss set hello can you talk
about how you do time management
considering you work your work schedule
and YouTube and Tyler great question
here because I'm on a weird schedule if
you're not familiar with me and what
I've talked about so many times in
videos I get up at about 1:30 in the
morning to get to work I get ready and
everything get to work between 3:00 and
3:30 and I have to go to bed you know
like around 7:00 or I really should be
in bed a little before that so it's it's
crazy
it is weird it's been a lifestyle change
I think a lot of people think maybe I
just go around not getting a lot of
sleep but I need the sleep so I do have
to change my lifestyle around
get to bed early and just make it work
and with Tyler he works you know the
more typical eight or nine to five or
six job and it puts us you know not
having a lot of time together in the
evenings however we do really I think
make the most of our weekends and that's
I've got cupcake crawling around on my
lap my baby hi hon she gets very excited
when I'm here in the makeup room the
thing that we try to think about most is
basically what are we gonna do on our
weekends how are we going to you know
enjoy have time to spend with one
another sometimes he's got work to do on
the weekends I'm doing YouTube generally
in the afternoons after work so I have
that time free when it's now just me and
cupcake here so afternoons have been a
time for me to accomplish a lot with my
YouTube channel and then weekends too so
basically you know it's just we don't
get a lot of time during the week and
that's just the way it is and we've sort
of coped with that but communication is
a big thing UD brunet says what
celebrity do you look up to as far as
style makeup and why I have several that
I just kind of admire either their
fashion sense or their makeup
I think Carrie Underwood hair wise like
I always really enjoy the styles that at
least the style she's taught wearing by
the magazines all the time I feel like
man does this girl ever have bad looking
hair so I think she inspires me a lot in
that sense I think Kim Kardashian just
always has a gorgeous makeup look even
when it's one is natural makeup when
it's dramatic I feel like it always
looks very clean very finished very
polished and I mean I'm sure she has
makeup artists to thank for that
I know makeup by mario has a great blog
and and kind of goes through a lot of
things he's used on Kim and it's just
it's just very impressive how she looks
all the time and you know I think
sometimes I had that in the back of my
mind when I'm getting ready and also if
you if anybody watches headline news HLN
in the mornings morning Express with
robin meade she is
it's great style for ya I mean great
news anchor style but she looks great as
well all the time and she's just also
has this wonderfully upbeat personality
for that hour of the day so I kind of
strive to be you know that positive
person in my news as well but she has a
great look and once again very polished
always put together and so I love that
style sunny days says what is a simple
way to make foundation seem more natural
and seamless not cakey and overdone I
would say get a sponge that you can
apply it with and squirt that spritz it
with some water like for example I have
a little water spritzer here that's just
water and I'll take you know one of
these triangular sponges everything's
just within reaching this this isn't
good fortunately because I got a cat on
my lap right now but I'll use like one
of these wedge sponges spritz that with
some water then get your foundation on
and apply that and then for a really
really natural finish maybe get a little
more water on the sponge and just kind
of blot over everything you get a really
natural finish and I mean you still get
the coverage but it's like you just sort
of in a way diluted it and just made it
very blendable on the skin and you've
added just a hint of moisture in the
application process
to help some of those foundations that
can try kind of quickly to help those
spread a little bit better and go on
more evenly so I think think that gives
a really natural look so that's
something to try and of course it's
super inexpensive to do all right guys
thank you so much again for taking the
