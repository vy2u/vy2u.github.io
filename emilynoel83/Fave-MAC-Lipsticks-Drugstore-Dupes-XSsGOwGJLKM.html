for this video this is going to be so
much fun because I'm going to share six
of my favorite MAC lipsticks and then I
thought you know when I was coming up
with the idea for this video how can I
take this a step further I have found a
dupe a drugstore dupe I'm talking brands
like Rimmel L'Oreal elf for each one of
these lipsticks and I've got to say I
have been very critical with these dupes
this has been a video that has been
several days in the making in terms of
the time it took for me to figure out
what lipsticks best matched these other
lipsticks I've had dupes in the past for
a couple of these and then they got
discontinued and so it's no good if you
can't go out in the store and find it so
this has been quite a bit of work for me
but I am so so excited to bring this to
you so this way if you're a Mac fan and
you want to buy the MAC lipsticks that
you see here that I like you will know
what those are but also if you want to
find a lower cost alternative you'll
have that as well so in order to show
just how similar the dupe is to the
original Mac shade throughout the video
I'm going to be showing you putting the
Mac shade on my top lip and then I will
be applying the low-cost alternative to
my bottom lip and you will be able to
see right there just how much they match
and could be you know the same lipstick
basically so let's get started first
we're I'm going to talk about my first
favorite and this is actually the very
first matte lipstick I ever bought and
this is angel and so this is a really
pretty I think of this is like a classic
pink and I actually have that on right
now and on my top lip and I just really
like this shade I think it works well on
a lot of skin tones who want to try that
pretty pink shade it's a little bit cool
I feel and it just is very creamy I love
the feel and I love the scent of the MAC
lipsticks because it's kind of like a
slightly sweet maybe a little bit of a
vanilla scent I'm not quite sure what
I'm detecting there with that but I was
so excited when I found an exact dupe
for this shade and it is $1 and it's
from ELF and it is called classy so elf
has come out with these $1 lipsticks you
can find them on ice lips
space.com or at Target and I've got to
say that these two are definite definite
dupes and what I'm looking for the
similarity is I'm not only looking at
the overall shade but also the texture
how it feels what the sheen is like on
the lips I'm not going to pick a dupe
that has shimmer in it if the original
does not have shimmer so you know what I
mean it's kind of you know really trying
to find all the similarities I can and I
was really excited when I found this one
that only cost one dollar to really
match Mack's Angels so for those who
want that look if you've seen it in
tutorials you've seen it in other videos
on YouTube and you want it you can't
find it for just a dollar
now the next lipstick that I love from
Mac is actually kind of similar to angel
and it's called cream cup and it's a
cream Sheen and that's probably my
favorite texture of the MAC lipsticks
and I'm going to show you just how
similar it is I actually swatched each
of these this is angel on top that's a
little bit more pinky and a little bit
cooler and then cream cup down below has
a little more of it's like a mixture of
pink and nude so it's got a little more
of that nude look to it so I really like
it I loved how smoothly it goes on and
the dupe that I found for this is one
that a lot of people have said is a dupe
for angel but actually this is much more
of a match for cream cup and it's
Maybelline's born with it these two are
so so similar very similar in texture
very similar in the feel on your lips
and born with it is nice because it is
that both of these colors are kind of
that stepped-up nude if you don't like
flat out nude lips but you want
something that gives you that hint of
peachy color hint of warmth on the lips
either of these would be a good option
for you so you've heard me throwing
around the term nude and for a lot of
people a nude lip doesn't mean the color
of their natural lips but it means
practically like erasing that color I
don't have super pigmented lip Mac Viva
Glam 2 is one of those lipsticks that I
feel like is my lip color but better
and so this is just a nice nice it's
kind of like a nude with it comes off
having just a hint of pink to it not
very much though and a dupe for that
that I have found that is so similar is
from L'Oreal and it is fairest nude so
if you're looking to try and Mac Viva
Glam to L'Oreal's color riche lipstick
and fairest nude is super super similar
again texture is the same you're getting
the same look on the lips and everything
it's just you know a lower price
obviously and it's just one of those
lipsticks if you don't want to go the
totally nude route and make you don't
especially like you know the look of
light pink on the lips Mac Viva Glam 2
or L'Oreal fairest nude will give you
that look that is very polished but very
much not distracting from what you're
doing with your eyes if you have
something bright on the eyes and you're
thinking how can i pare this down but
not go totally nude that might be one
for you now here's a pairing that I know
I've talked about before and it's Mac
Viva Glam 5 this was the first of the
Viva Glam that I had tried and this is
another great neutral shade it's going
to give you a little more color than the
past ones I've talked about and this
does have a hint of shimmer it's got a
hint of kind of a golden golden shimmer
there and I've talked about the dupe for
this being the Rimmel moisture renew
lipstick in Sunset so yeah these are
definitely definitely close because if
you get a close look at them in the
packaging sunset actually has that very
same slight golden it's very subtle but
a very slight golden sparkle that makes
it just extremely close to Mac Viva Glam
follow those who do want pink I've got
something for you
great classic pink great pink for spring
this is the most recent one I picked up
and this might be my most favorite MAC
lipstick out of my whole collection and
I tell you I had one heck of a time
trying to find the dupe in my collection
and you know what that tells me that
there's probably a reason why
speed-dial which is a cream machine
again it's that creamy creamy texture
that I enjoy you know you kind of think
about well why do I like this so much
probably because I really didn't have
much of anything like this I went
through everything and then I finally
found what I thought was a very close
dupe for it but it's creamy it's pink
it's interesting because if you look
very closely at it it has the slightest
slightest bit of a golden undertone that
I honestly was not able to find in
anything that I had I was able to kind
of match the color I mean I definitely
was able to match the color with revlon
colorburst and carnation but still this
is the one lipstick that i feel like man
you know it's got a slight it's like a
cool pink with a golden little slight
slight barely noticeable shimmer to it
if you're looking up really close so
these two are a lot alike um they really
come off the same on the lips but if
it's getting really really critical on
speed-dial just has a little something
different there that that is just so
special and it makes it just a great
lipstick you're a fan of berry lipsticks
which I love to get a good berry
lipstick on every now and then I think
you know if you've got like maybe that
medium skin tone dark hair I think it
tends to work and Mac craving this is an
amplified lipstick so this one gives off
a lot of great color great classic berry
toned lipstick it's creamy it is rich it
is all the color you could hope for and
the dupe for that I used to have a
different one
and it was let me find it for you just
mention this just in case you might have
it in your collection Maybelline
Roseberry
this is a moisture moisture extreme
lipstick this used to be the dupe that I
would refer to as a good dupe for
craving but I've gone and found another
one that is now available in stores and
it's called party pink and it's a
Maybelline Color sensational so close so
so close because what a nice thing about
a lot of these color sensational
lipsticks is that they're not all loaded
down with a lot of shimmer so you are
able to get pure color and really
duplicate the look of some of these rich
lipsticks that you'll find from Max so
yeah party pink definitely definitely
close and there are some very richly
pigmented lipsticks in that line alright
everybody hopefully that gives you some
insight as to what my favorite MAC
lipstick shades are and I must say I
first picked my favorites I wasn't
thinking oh well that's not going to be
my favorite because I don't have a dupe
for it I just set it out there for
myself these are the ones I love and I
gave myself the challenge to find
something that was similar to that that
could be found in the drugstore so I
hope you enjoyed this let me know what
your favorite MAC lipsticks are and if
you if you have one you want to request
or suggest to me and if you have a low
cost alternative that would be awesome
to share as well so everybody can kind
of be sharing their ideas thank you so
much for watching this video and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
