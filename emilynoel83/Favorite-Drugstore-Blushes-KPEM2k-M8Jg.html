joining me for this video and welcome to
anybody who has recently found my
channel through the whole YouTube front
page feature thing this past weekend and
if you're hearing any bells in this
video my cat cupcake is playing like
crazy with this toy it's like a stick
and it has this string that like dangles
the toy on the end of it and there is a
bell on it and you know whatever she is
playing with anyway I wanted to do a
video on my favorite drugstore blushes
because it might seem like kind of a
specific topic but actually I've been
requested to do this video by a lot of
different people so I thought I would go
ahead and get that done for you and I'm
gonna kind of be going through some
different categories some blushes that
are good as contours my favorite peachy
blush a couple of Pink's that I like in
a really good rosy blush as well so I
feel like blush I mean as my mom has
always told me blush is one of the best
things you can do to just perk up your
face make yourself look more healthy and
it's so quick and it's really easy I
mean it's not like okay you have to
apply this shade here this shade here
you know it's not as complex as eyes and
it's not really as in your face as lips
but it's very easy to put on and it just
you know can really enhance your look a
lot so for blush I'm use of lush brush
about like this this is from Revlon and
I actually found this from Big Lots not
too long ago but this is about the size
it is on my cheek so you know I like to
use a brush that is tapered also for
blush so meaning you know it's not blunt
cut straight across but it has you know
shorter bristles here and longest
bristles at the you know highest point
of the brush there so that works good
for me for application you will find if
you're interested in a brush similar to
this Revlon sells brushes now in Walmart
and stuff like I don't really recommend
with
some of these different blushes that
actually come with a small brush I'm not
recommending any of those little brushes
because I just don't feel like they
blend well feel like they're too small
and I just don't think you should rely
on those for your blush application so
get a good blush brush you know about
medium sized if you were to smile and
really press it on your cheek it would
like cover up the apple of your cheek I
will start with the blush I have on
today which is kind of a rosy blush and
as I go through this I'll sort of tell
you why I choose different shades on
different days but for example I'm doing
a reddish lip today actually what I have
on is NYC lipstick and sheer red one of
my favorite Reds and then I kind of sort
of took it down a notch
color wise but gave it some shine with
my maybelline shine sensational lip
gloss and tempting top you can see
that's almost more of a neutral shade
but anyway if I'm going with more of a
red lip I like the rosy cheek that's not
so much coral and peach and also not
pink but it's more like a a really nice
flushed look like maybe you just worked
out you've just got this nice glow to
your cheeks and this one happens to be
the elf studio blush these are being
sold at Target and also online at eyes
lips face com cupcake is sniffing the
camera but it's called blushing Rose eye
cupcake hey sweetie pie okay there's
gonna be a tail come into the show but
it's called blushing rose and it has a
little hint of sparkle but I feel like
it's it's kind of a deeper blush this
will last me for a really long time
because I literally only go like that I
only touch my brush to the product and
I've got enough on there for one cheek
so that's a really good good blush good
standard blush just for that glowing
cheek kind of look for a peachy blush
that I really like so this is sort of a
peachy pink and this is probably one of
the most universal shades I feel like
this looks good on pretty much all skin
tones and this is a matte blush and
you'll be able to see that I like this
one a lot it's the Milani minerals blush
in might I talked about it so many times
Milani is a brand you can find online at
cherry culture calm you may find it in
certain drugstores as well but it just
has
that really nice kind of poorly peachy
tone but it also has kind of a pinky
tone to it as well so this is good kind
of regardless of what's on your lips and
eyes this is going to work with your
skin tone perk it up make it look really
fresh and not add an additional shine
with that one next off if I'm doing like
a light or even a bright pink lip look
you know I kind of tend to go toward a
more pinky blush and two of my favorites
this first one is a little more bright a
little more pigmented and it's the
covergirl cheekers blush and plumbery
glow and as you can see there it's got a
little shimmer it doesn't come off very
shimmery on the cheeks at all and it
kind of reminds me of Mac's
dolly mix blush in that you get this
sort of somewhat sheer but pretty pretty
pink glow to your cheeks even if you're
doing a nude lip and you want the cheek
to kind of take the spotlight a little
bit more this is a really great blush
I've used it so many times and really
enjoyed the effect that I get with that
so plumberry glow from covergirl if you
want something even more subtle and you
really like the glowy shimmery almost
like a blush and highlighter in one hard
candy really cute packaging available at
Walmart has this shade called living
doll and if you look closely at this or
maybe you have to see it in person you
can tell it's more shimmery but it's
also laced with like a golden shade
there as well so you're gonna get a
lighter pink with this a more shimmering
highlighter type look but it's very very
pretty I love this blush and I use it
quite often sometimes even layering it
with a blush like plum berry glow next
up we need to talk about blushes that
are a little bit deeper and something
that you can use as a contour rarely do
I ever use just one shade of blush and
that might sound high-maintenance or
whatever but I just feel like my face
looks better but I've got that pop of
color on the apples of the cheeks which
would be any of the shades I've just
mentioned and but then I like to have a
little deeper shade right in here just
to really enhance my face give my face
some death
and that sort of thing one of my
all-time favorites is from covergirl
again it's a cheekers blush in golden
pink and this is basically just a deep
shade it's almost like a bronzer but
it's a little bit warmer by warmer I
mean it's just got I'm sorry the light
is kind of catching me funny here in
this video um so I apologize but it's
just got a little bit more it's less tan
and more like a deep peachy tone to it
and it works great it's a contour only
issue with this is that I'm slowly
starting to see I feel like it's being
practically phased out because I'm
seeing it in some stores and not others
so I'm concerned that it may be getting
discontinued if so I have a back-up plan
for you and that is a shade called soft
sable which is not quite as dark as what
I just mentioned but it can still work
very nice
probably better even if you have lighter
skin like very fair-skinned and you
still want a good contour soft sable
could be good for you as well it's just
a little lighter than golden pink but
it's a pretty close comparison there so
in case you're going to your store
you're like I can't find golden pink go
for the other another great option that
I use pretty much daily is from ELF and
it's the contouring blush and bronzing
powder and it comes in a nice compact
like this really love that these
compacts have such a nice big mirror to
them I think that's great if you're
traveling I mean I was traveling this
past weekend and this was like the one I
would pull out to see my face in because
you can see so much of your face when
you use this but anyway this comes with
two products you're getting like a sort
of a really apricot peach blush with
with some golden sparkles so this will
have some shimmer on your face keep that
in mind
probably more shimmer than almost any of
the ones I've talked about except for
possibly this hard candy one and then
you've got a bronzer there as well and
this is pretty deep if you are if you
have very fair skin I would advise you
you use this extremely sparingly
just really just touch your brush to it
much like the other elf blush I
mentioned at the start just touch your
brush to it and use it as a contour kind
of I like to set my cheeks in and then I
can start to see that and when you put
it on with your blush brush you just
start to see that contour develop you
can contour below a little bit up in
here and if you look in any full face
tutorials I've done you will see more
demonstrations of that but this is just
nice to have the two in one thing that's
a very all-purpose blush that's not
going to clash with any sort of lip look
you got going on so I think that is a
very good buy it's like three dollars so
can't go wrong with that
in terms of cream blushes at the
drugstore one I have to talk about is an
actual cream and it is the blush Abul
cream sticks from New York color the one
I have here to show you is Plaza pink
it's just kind of a neutral pink shade
but they have multiple shades I really
like how these go on I like that they're
easy enough to blend in to wear like
okay I've already put on my foundation
and I don't want to feel like I have to
rub like heck to put on my cream blush
and mess up the foundation so it's very
easy to blend love that and lots of
different shades just pick your favorite
another one that's good is the dream
mousse blush from Maybelline I have
multiple shades of this this one is
peach satin this is more a light texture
even easier to blend than the NYC and
that one's pretty simple to use as well
but this is very light this one's almost
like a highlight I have other shades as
well there are more pigmented less
shimmer but if you're really looking for
staying power maybe you struggle with
the staying power of your blush as it is
putting on a cream blush topping it off
with with a coordinating powder can work
really well so hopefully that gives you
some ideas in terms of blushes how to
use them when to pick certain colors and
not others you know you may just want to
simplify it pick one that works and then
be done with be done with your whole
selection process there but for me I
mean if I'm using a red lip
I said I'll go for more that rosy blush
if I'm doing a pink lip kind of a tent
toward light pink blushes or you know
more nude seeming blush that just gives
that hint of glow and if you're doing
just kind of a neutral lip or really
anything else
peachy Pink's are always a good option I
feel like so hopefully this helps you
guys that we're looking for some good
deals on blushes good affordable blushes
and thanks for watching and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
