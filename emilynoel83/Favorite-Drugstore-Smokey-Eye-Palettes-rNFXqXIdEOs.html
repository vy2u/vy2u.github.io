tuning in for this video this is going
to be sort of a review slash kind of
favourites video because I get a lot of
questions about smoky eyes and what are
the best sort of all-in-one palates to
get that look with there are a lot of
people out there that aren't necessarily
wanting to have to buy like several
different expensive individual shadows
to come up with one look it's been
requested of me a lot to just you know
can you do looks that don't use so many
products just using maybe like one thing
and so I think palates especially from
the drugstore and by palate I mean you
know a little eye shadow set that has
multiple shades in it using something
like that is really kind of what a lot
of you are going after how can I get
that look by not buying ten different
though ten different items so I just
wanted to highlight a few of my favorite
drugstore smokey eye palettes so
basically palettes that I'm pulling out
here and saying you can get the smokey
eye with this you know you may want to
use some liner or you may want to throw
on your own mascara and stuff but with
these colors you can get the eyeshadow
look you're going for in many cases I
believe all of these have a deep black
you know or a super dark charcoal gray
shade that can even serve as your liner
in some cases so these are very good I
picked them because I feel like they
offer everything you need to get the
smoky eyes so I'm just gonna go through
that first off I did want to say what's
on my lips today cuz I kind of get that
question a lot in sometimes I forget by
the time you know weeks have passed and
I don't remember what I was wearing on
my lips in a certain video today I'm
wearing elf moisture care lip color it's
it's kind of like twists up through that
little tip there it's in Ruby slipper
it's a red shape but kind of a soft red
super wearable um on to the shadows now
I'm gonna start off with one from ELF
and I actually featured this in a video
it's the elf quad in drama this is only
a dollar on eyes lips face calm why mine
are in little rectangles I'm not sure
that's just the way it was when I
sent to me at first but I have another
one and it's in like little triangles so
the anyway I did a video on this I think
I called it my two dollars smokey eye I
kept you know super minimal products on
it and so I used this and here you're
getting like a sparkly black charcoal
shimmery shade a white and a light gray
and the colors really do have nice
pigmentation for the price that you're
spending here on these so I just think
that for a dollar this is really really
great optimal colors to get the smoky
eye I mean you've got your light shades
to do highlighting your dark shades
really get that contour and a black that
can make a fantastic liner so that one
is just you know can't go wrong with
this if you're making an elf order
already or you're considering it just
toss this on to what you're getting it's
only a dollar it's I know they've
expanded into studio and mineral
products and stuff like that but they
still have the one dollar stuff that's
got some some nice selection in it as
well so that is one another great one is
from Revlon I've been using this for a
long time it's a great look for just
day-to-day and it's the 12 hour color
stay eyeshadow and sultry smoke and so
here it's kind of playing off of a blue
tone for smokey eyes so you're getting
kind of a matte um this is actually
seems to me like a very light blue gray
a nice navy medium to dark grey and then
your charcoal nearly black shade there
so you're gonna get a nice smokey eye if
you'd like to kind of veer toward tones
of blue or maybe you just like the
smokey eye and then you like you know
having the option of accenting with blue
or using that as a liner shade you know
you can go kind of soft with this like
this on the lid this in the crease and
then use a liner brush to put the blue
on that would be a great way to use this
as well Revlon also does a nice thing
because they give you like two different
applicators I know a lot of people are
into brushes and you know God have this
brush for this and another brush for
something else but
and it's nice to have these two
applicators because you can I find that
this little guy here
the pointy one can be really nice to get
some of that dark color like right on
the outer part of your lid they just
give you a lot of control the
applicators do sometimes so that's a
really nice palette there as for its
staying power these color stay palettes
really are good for that so pair that up
with a nice eye primer maybe you know
the elf mineral eye primer or L'Oreal
decrease I'm thinking of the lesser
expensive ones there um you know you'll
have a good long wearing look let me see
I had five here oh there you go
they're all sitting kind of around me so
I forgot and I also did a tutorial on
this palette so this really helps when
I've you actually used these in videos
but this is from Milani and it's the the
runway eyes and catwalk so look at these
I love this palette because you're
looking at it and you're thinking oh
smokey eye well yeah you can definitely
do that you've got your white your
silver and your black but you can really
have some fun with it with the blue and
this pretty kind of brick-red which is
actually a really really nice shade to
kind of like what I would do is I can
grab a brush here like what I've got
going on here I've got kind of a medium
gray shade there I would take this red
shade if you're not sure how to use it
grab it on a somewhat fluffier brush and
use it just like that see how it warms
up you just put it over a little bit
deeper shade and kind of blend upwards
and you get this gorgeous warm look out
of it you know it just comes as seal
seems very natural because it's playing
off of natural colors that are already
in your skin I love that shade I just
always gonna love that and I use this
the colors I used in the look that I did
in a tutorial I believe I use the white
the black the blue and the red and it
really created a fun look so if you
search through my videos find Milani
runway eyes tutorial in catwalk this is
just an example of a smoky eye palette
that is giving you even more you can the
black is great you know you're getting a
nice nice deep pigmentation on the black
but you're also getting a gorgeous blue
there that's on that finger here to play
with and you know a pretty kind of
bronzy gold shade I mean think of all
the variety you can get out of this so I
would totally recommend this to get your
smokey eye but if you want to start
experimenting with more color try that
out as well and next one is the one that
actually features the colors I'm wearing
today this was what I use to do my
makeup today and you'll see it's not a
super smoky look it's overall fairly
natural you know and this is what I
think if you if you like the smokey eye
but you'd like to also keep it natural
it's the Maybelline stylish smokes
collection they have several different
shades they've got like greens purples
this is just the smokey kind of Gray's
it's charcoal smokes is what it's called
and you can see it does tell you where
everything goes lid crease outer corner
and brow bone and obviously I just added
that little red shade there but I like
these colors just for a kind of you know
keep it natural sort of smoky eye look
the black is not the most intense black
that I've run across in my in my shadows
that I've used however it's not bad I'm
gonna put some on a brush here just to
show you put it in my corner and it's
giving me it's giving me a nice depth
but it's not like the immediate like oh
my gosh there's a lot of black there you
know what I mean
there are some shades that almost are
difficult to blend this is like a
buildable black so keep that in mind
oops just got some of my hair there I
think so you know you can you can get a
dramatic look with this but you're just
gonna have to build it up a little more
but it's still one of my favorites
because I think it's just it's just so
easy to wear for like a work scenario
you've got these shades up top that are
almost kind of like topi gray shades so
that's a little different from I think
anything I've shown you so far I've
shown shown you elf which is just
standard classic smokey eye shades the
Revlon which goes more towards blue the
runway eyes that is kind of colorful and
now this that is also kind of your
traditional smokey eye but with some
really natural kind of topi grays in
there so this is a nice palette very
user friendly and that it highlights
where all those need to go on your eye
and lastly it has to be my absolute
favorite and it's from covergirl
I've mentioned this several times it is
the quad in drama eyes and the
pigmentation on these is superior
covergirl has really improved their
shadows lately and this is just one of
the best all-around kits I've
recommended this I've recommended it to
my sister-in-law and she picked it up
and I did a look on her with this and
you know she loved it it's just really
great you've got a rich rich black find
a finger I didn't use yet very great
black there and then you've got a pretty
burgundy I mentioned why I like those
kind of shades of red so much this
silver is really pretty as well if I can
show you that there there's that nice
silver and then you've got sort of a
matte white shades so these all work
together really well that black is going
to be one of your favourites by far it's
nice to have them all together in the
palette like I've said there's a big
advantage to getting the palette and
getting it from a drugstore and finding
something you love because you're not
spending a lot you're getting a lot of
shadows for one price even if you
haven't experimented with smoky eyes
before this is something that's very
user friendly really fun to use it's
going to give you the smoky eye look
that I think you've been after so
I hope you guys enjoyed these
suggestions and maybe next time you head
to the drugstore you'll sort of be able
to pick through the crowd of shadows a
little better and get something you like
so thanks so much for tuning in for this
video guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
