tuning in for by 800 video I am so
excited I can't believe I have done 800
videos that's crazy Wow yeah my first
one was back in 2007 and you might be
wondering well what's the significance
of doing your 800th video on elf brushes
and I will tell you that was my very
first video was a review on elf brushes
so I thought wouldn't it be fun to kind
of remake that or update it finally this
many videos later and just give you some
new information kind of in honor of that
very first video where it all started me
everyone hope you all having a great day
I just wanted to give you a quick review
on I would like to think maybe some
things have improved since then if
nothing else maybe the video quality but
anyways thank you for watching thank you
so much for supporting me I would not
have done 800 videos it hadn't been for
the amazing video ideas just all around
support and love I want to hug you like
there's my hug to you and thank you so
so much for everything you do whether
it's just watching a video sharing your
love and your positivity I mean it goes
both ways and I really appreciate you so
much so thank you for that
um I also thought I might point out um
what I'm wearing on my eyes today I did
something a little fancy with the liner
I did I don't know if you can tell it's
real subtle but I took a little bit of
like so hot pink eyeliner and I went on
top of my black liner there on the wing
and I also dug out my Too Faced summer
eye palette and I just kind of used some
of this shade and some of the pink and
just real softly kind of blended it out
nothing major but I just I'm trying to
work in a little bit more color and
wearing a lot of neutrals and you know
that's fine because I love them but I'm
trying
get back into my colorful shades and on
my lips I'm wearing my Milani lipstick
and fruit punch this was the one I
noticed last week or the week before I
remembered seeing Nicki Minaj on Idol
and I was like her she's wearing fruit
punch like it looks exactly like that
color and I've got all these lipsticks
like swatched and shown on me on my blog
if you're interested in that so onto the
point of the video we're talking about
these elf brushes I'm going to share my
favorites and it's not so much like I'm
trying to give you an all-encompassing
brush video here like this like all the
brushes I mentioned could be your full
set or anything like that
but they're just some individual brushes
that I really like and you might see one
and think wow I can plug that into my
current brush set and it'll serve a a
special purpose for me let's say so I'm
going to start off with a couple of the
one dollar brushes and if you're not
familiar with elf at all you know you
can find some things at like Target
let's say or different stores you know
Kmart I've heard carries some elf but it
can be kind of spotty in the stores as
far as selection so the full selection
is at eyes lips face comm and that's
another reason why I thought this would
be a helpful video to do again because
you can't always you know when you're
seeing brushes on a website you can't
touch them so this way you can maybe get
a better indication of what they're like
but the first brush I want to talk about
is the elf and this is called the
professional eye shadow brush so it's a
one dollar brush and I use this today
for my look and it's just a great basic
flat eyeshadow brush
everybody needs just a flat shadow brush
it's great for packing the shadow on
your eyelid it is nicely tapered here so
you got some shorter bristles there
leading up to some longer bristles up in
the middle it's got a nice kind of dome
to it good shape for the eye I mean you
can see about how it fits on my eyes so
very nice for packing on shadow really
soft dense I mean for a dollar this has
gone through many cleanings has not lost
bristles that I could tell
and still is staying in great you know
constructive shape you want to talked
about other great inexpensive brushes
like the target up-and-up brand has a
couple of great eye brushes but I mean
you really can't be just a dollar so
that's the elf professional eye shadow
brush and then alongside that another
great one is the eye crease brush so
this one looks like this and it looks
like a rather small brush and it is and
I again use this in this look used it
for my crease shade and it's a very
small compact crease brush but you can
use it several different ways
I think it's kind of a cross between
like a small crease brush and
practically a pencil brush so you know
it's not a ton of bristles in here but
the fact that this is a small brush is
what makes it special in my opinion I
would actually kind of compare it to a
brush that I love from essence of beauty
and this is the fine crease brush that
kind of thing gives you a lot of control
when it comes to maybe building up an
outer V and getting the shadow right
where you want it and then you can take
your big fluffy brush and buff it on out
but this really gets controlled
application if you've got small eyes if
you feel like all the other brushes are
too big for your eye this one and this
one are very good options and again it
comes to kind of a point so you can
definitely smudge right underneath and
have a good amount of control there too
so I don't believe two dollars I think
those are two great brushes some brushes
from the studio line and I believe these
are all $3 apiece so a little more
pricey but you're getting a little bit
more of a brush here as well larger
brushes we've got a the elf powder brush
and this is a flat top brush so it is
cut blunt straight across and it's very
dense this is pretty large like you look
at it compared to my cheek my big cheek
there um I got some big cheeks I don't
care I like it
but you just buff it on in you can use
this with your powder foundations get
more coverage out of them you can use
this with your mineral powders and again
I just feel like it gives really
even coverage and more coverage so it's
just a great buffer type style does
anybody use this with a liquid
foundation I have not yet used it with a
liquid but I'm thinking it could be good
in that sense too in extremely impressed
with how soft this brush is the
construction of it's very solid it's got
kind of a decent weight to it actually
this is not an expensive brush but I
mean it can just be great for getting
like I said if you're feeling like your
powder foundations aren't quite
performing for you I think a flat top
brush is a great way to get the most out
of that also the complexion brush and
now this is kind of my little
jack-of-all-trades brush and when I was
going to work at the TV station I
remember taking this with me there often
because I felt this was kind of a
multitasker brush I think it can apply
some powder lightly to your face it can
be good for bronzer it can be good for
even blush because it's just not a huge
brush so compared like size-wise to this
one this one is more pinched you can see
it's pinched right there so that's why I
think it can like it can contour for you
because it can become narrow depending
on the way you turn it it can also go
circular motions for you it's got a very
nice taper it's very soft again this is
probably the way I would use this most
would be my bronzer or just when I want
a little bit of powder you know you can
kind of blot it on you can dust it on
whatever you feel you need now this
one's quite interesting this is one of
my more recent finds and it is the
flawless concealer brush again this is
from the studio line and it's very hard
to tell on the website when you see this
whether or not this is a round brush as
it is or if maybe it would just be a
flat type brush so the the ferrule here
is not pinched in at all it's totally
rounded and the brush is not cut totally
blunt it's got a bit of an of a taper
right here at the end but overall I mean
you look at it the best way to describe
this might be it's like a jumbo eye
crease brush but I
love using this for concealer in both
the creamy and liquid forms or the
powder forms today I use this to blend
out my mac prolongwear concealer and I
thought it did a fabulous job like
seriously really nice blend I've
mentioned before liking to use kind of
buffing type brushes like this for your
under-eye concealer because when you use
your fingers sometimes you apply so much
pressure you can practically blend away
your product and so here you're getting
just a very lightweight pressure but a
good blend so this works for the creamy
products it's also fantastic if you like
to use like the bare minerals well
rested or the bisque products that I've
talked about before liking to set your
under-eye concealer with that kind of
thing because it mattifies it perfects
it brings up the coverage level a little
bit and so this is just a phenomenal
size for getting in there and setting
your creamy product with the powder I
mean and you don't want to apply too
much powder obviously but you just just
for a little bit I mean this is a great
soft brushing who wants a rough brush up
under their eye this is just really
really nice so that's called the
flawless concealer brush finally um this
might be my favorite and this one had
its own video like dedicated to it it's
the elf small stipple brush so this
little guy is what I use for my cream
blush or my cream highlight products and
why is it so special well I think it's
special because it's cut shorter than
other small stippling brushes that I
have let me grab my Sigma here here you
can see and I think I've shown you this
comparison before but with this one the
bristles are so long when they come in
direct contact with the skin they
there's a lot of Bend there there's a
lot of give and that brush could be good
for maybe some other purposes but when
I'm talking creams look at how this one
is they're show so short they remain
stiff like that and so it's just perfect
when you're using a cream blush and you
just want to dot it on like that or you
can work in soft kind of circular
motions but this doesn't apply so much
pressure that you're going to screw up
your foundation or whatever under
layer of product you've got going on
there straight into the cream product
and then go straight onto my face if
you're working with maybe a product like
benefits high-beam or some of those more
liquidy products and put some out on my
hand stipple it onto the brush you got a
nice even amount there and then BAM
right on the face it's so great with a
lot of these other brushes you know I
may work them in like when another brush
is dirty I pull out one of the elf ones
and they're kind of interchangeable kind
of similar to other brushes I have this
one is a real standalone like the only
one I really use for that cream blush
cream highlight purpose so definitely
wanted to mention that little guy so
that's it those are my favorite elf
brushes that I've tried I haven't tried
everything I don't have one of their
like full sets but I just you know over
the years gotten some of their
individual ones and I must say I'm quite
impressed with this little handful that
I've got right here so thank you again
so much for watching for supporting me
after 800 videos you're still around so
kudos to you thank you so much and I
will see you again in number 801 so bye
