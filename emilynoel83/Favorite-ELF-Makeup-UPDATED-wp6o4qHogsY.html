me for this video I know quite a while
ago I had promised a new elf favorites
video and I really wanted to get that
out of the way before the Emily Awards
start that's my big like best of beauty
products from the past year series that
I do I split it up into a bunch of
different videos and I've been working
on that and I know last year I did it
toward the end of January and it'll be
the same story this anyway I know when I
did my ELF Cyber Monday haul many of you
reminded me is that elf favorites video
coming so yeah it's coming now so here
are my products my favorite things from
the line it's probably gonna seem like
there's a lot but actually my list
started much longer and I've pared it
down to the things that I just truly
feel are my favorite and the first thing
I want to mention is something I really
haven't talked about all that much but I
have been experimenting with quite a bit
lately and it's the elf mineral booster
in shear and think of this as something
comparable to like bare minerals mineral
veil in shear because it has just a
little color to it and I actually think
this can be a good thing to set your
under-eye concealer with if you're
looking for something that's more
lightweight than say the bare minerals
bisque or summer bisque if you want
something that just is a little bit
lighter on the skin than that it's gonna
be a little less coverage but it does
still mattify and kind of help perfect
that area so I really like this product
I just tap a little bit into the cap and
then I use like my Smashbox number 10
brush and buff it in today I actually
just set my whole face with this after I
did some BB so a long time favorite no
surprise here but I love the elf
contouring blush and bronzer
particularly in this shade this is
called Saint Lucia and you're getting
the deep dark bronze area which you can
contour with very easily and in this
lighter kind of peachy colored blush
very wearable pretty pigment today I am
wearing the contour and then another one
of my favorites which is a couple of the
studio blushes I really really like
these you can find these at Target
usually some of this stuff it's like
you'll find it at Target but the full
line is definitely a eyes lips face duck
but I love pink passion this is such a
fresh blush and you will glance at it
and think what get out of town but this
is a really nice like Matt yet bright
blush and you just use a little bit and
I feel like there's nothing more
youthful than a soft kind of light pink
blush
I also love the shade and blushing Rose
I've loved this one for a long time a
nice winter type blush even fair skin
can wear this beautiful and it reminds
me of NARS dolce vita I'm in that it's
got that deeper rose color but this does
have just a hint of golden shimmer is
very subtle on your cheeks but it's a
gorgeous shade I know I've raved about
that one a lot and then finally for face
products the daily moisture stick this
has its own video about how to use it
the main way I like to use this product
is it's just a clear stick by the way it
contains antioxidants and anti-aging
ingredients grape cocoa shea avocado
macadamia aloe and chamomile it's as
clear kind of moisture packed stick and
I just get a little bit on one finger
and after I've gone through most of the
day and if I feel like I'm looking dry
on my under eye area I just had this
over the area and my fine lines will
look reduced I have before and afters of
that in the video where I featured this
but really just any dry spot that you
have with the exception of lips I don't
love this product on lips but I mean if
you've got dry elbows dry cuticles it's
just a nice little quick Moisture Surge
and very very portable great for the
purse great for travelers eyes I've got
several different really impressive
single elf eyeshadows to talk about two
are from the pressed mineral line which
I discovered pretty recently on my last
haul and then a couple of single shadows
from their studio line so from those as
shade I really like is called pebble and
it's a great like matte grayish taupe
type color makes a really nice like
natural crease shade I know you maybe
see a color like this near they go I
doesn't look too exciting but it's one
of those workhorse kinds of shadows you
know it's just really nice for a subtle
crease shade to help you blend out like
maybe an even darker smoky look this
works really well in another shade that
I love is this raspberry I think it was
called raspberry truffle the sticker
only says raspberry but I know there was
another word involved but see how this
is kind of a shimmery burgundy brown but
a little bit of a coppery tone and
you'll see that in the swatch do you see
how there's kind of some copper coming
through such a pretty shade to pair with
your neutral looks to wearing your outer
corner in your crease just a really
really pretty soon you've never tried
these pressed mineral singles I suggest
you do they've got a beautiful texture
and I've run into a couple shades that I
really like one is called wine tour and
it's this pretty lilac with golden
sparkle and there's a look at that in
the swatch really pretty you know not a
bold in-your-face purpley shade but just
that dusty light another shade that I
love and this matte texture will blow
you away I mean so soft just you're
gonna be thinking as that elf is that an
elf product but this is called forest
frolic and it's a nice deep charcoal and
I just can't get over how smooth this
shadow is how pigmented I mean you just
put your finger in that and you might
mistake it for a much more high-end
shadow so the eyelid primer that's one
dollar I know this does not work for
everyone but it does work for me it
might work for you if you don't have a
lot of experience with eye primers and
you just want to try one and a dollar
you're not taking that big of a risk but
it's got the wand applicator it has that
same kind of color tone as like an urban
decay primer potion type thing blend
that and you can still feel just a
slightly tacky finish there and it helps
your shadows cling and become more
vibrant helps the staying power for me I
don't have any creasing when I use this
so for a dollar if you want to try it
see if you can get away with the cheapo
eye primer you might give it a go I just
wanted to mention it because I love it
so much also an eye product that I love
is the studio eyebrow kit this is the
kit that contains a tinted wax and a
matte powder you've also got a little
applicator one side with an angled tip
one side kind of has a shadow brush on
it this wax is really nice because it
does have enough color to it to really
fill in area
that are sparse and then when you take
the powder over the top I think you get
a really nice natural look it clings to
the wax you've got something that's long
wearing that kind of holds the shape of
your brows too you don't necessarily
have to put a clear gel over this
realize I had something black there my
fingernail sorry about that but I really
think this is a nice quality brow
product I have it in medium this is the
shade that works for me so maybe keep
that in mind as you look at the range
the full range of lip products that I
really like from elf three things that I
totally recommend the first one is the
lip exfoliator this is that little thing
that looks like a brown sugar lipstick -
definitely does smell kind of sugary
sweet and as you use this you work down
to this sort of gritty texture on top so
before you apply your lip product you go
over your lips with this you slough off
that dead skin and then apply something
really hydrating a nice balm or go ahead
with your lipstick or whatever I just
truly think this is one of the best
formats to exfoliate your lips look
these lip balm tints I don't feel like I
hear that much buzz about these but
these are awesome
there's a nice amount of color in these
you could apply them with your fingers
or with a lip brush but they give off
color that you wouldn't expect you might
just think oh that's gonna turn out to
be one of those like you know clear lip
gloss things no there's a lot of color
here I'm wearing this one called berry
in this nude shade I mean look at that
that does give you that kind of color on
your lips they have kind of a sweet
flavor to them a lot of shine think
they're beautiful and they're like two
dollars each so something I haven't
mentioned too much in a while but I
still really like the product and it's
the pout Perfector this is something
that comes in one shade and this is a
gloss type product that you can just dab
in the center of your lower lip and get
a much fuller shinier much more luscious
looking lip and I've got a little bit on
there I just did it right on top of that
lip balm tint you can do this over other
glosses over lipsticks over stuff like
this and it just gives you that extra
bit of shine and the key is that you
just want to confine it to that one area
and this Shay
just really seems to mesh on top of just
about anything or pallets one thing that
I must mention is the little black
beauty book it's the day edition I
talked about this on my Beauty broadcast
Express Channel I had reviewed it as
part of the kit that it came in it had
like an eyeliner a mascara with it and
just a gorgeous little palette that I
found at Walmart and now I can't find
that sold on its own on elfs website got
other like varieties other colors in the
little black beauty books but not the
day one for exam reasons so I thought
I'd mention it if you are able to find
that somehow if you are struggling to
find that but you want those kinds of
shades I must say that the 144 neutral
palette has it's like a jumbo sized
version of that little black beauty book
for day it's got like an expanded color
selection the reason why I like the
little black beauty book was because I
thought it was so compact so travel
friendly had a nice little mirror in
there this I'm not going to be traveling
with this but for an at-home kind of
neutral palette to have on hand
this is everything under the Sun plus
quite a few actually colorful shades you
know there's a lot of plums a lot of
pinks corals in this along with all your
Browns topes smoky colors and this is
just 15 bucks and the quality of these
shadows you might be like rolling your
eyes at me thinking Emily its elf no but
these are actually really nice shadows
in a variety of finishes from shimmers
to metallics mattes satin finish you're
trying to save some money but want the
ultimate neutral color selection I would
recommend this also elf has something
called the custom compacts or mine still
say elements on them I've had these
little compacts for a while and this is
something that I see available at Target
and they're these nice little white
compacts with a pretty good sized mirror
there and then spaces for for eyeshadows
and depending on what kind of eye shadow
it is it may or may not magnetized in
here like if you wanted to use something
other than elf you might just have to
try it out and see what works for
example I put Coastal Scents hot pots in
some of these and I had to add
magnet to the back but the elf ones will
magnetized in and there are some really
fun shades available they've expanded
their shade selection but I really like
all four of these this shade is pink ice
this kind of bronzy golden shade is
called peach fuzz a very vivid teal
there and then this deep plum is so
pretty that's just called purple the
compact and each of the shadows are just
a dollar a piece you can really
customize it whatever way you want to go
but here I did kind of a smoky look moon
dust is a great shade mocha is another
one out pretty pretty cool right for
just a dollar a piece on those singles
and maybe just one of the singles you
know appeals to you and you don't want
this whole palette but these are
actually really nice little compact love
the mechanical eyelash curler this has
been my favorite for years I've tried
some other things I usually end up
coming back to this because first off I
love the handle here I really can get my
fingers around that and I don't feel any
slippage at all I think we've all been
there at one point in time where we were
holding an eyelash curler it went boom
if your eyelash you know it just makes
you want to scream also I like how the
pad on these is pretty squishy therefore
I feel like it really can clamp down on
those lashes and get a good curl and
finally the shape the curve right here
seems to work really well for my eyes
there are some lash curlers where I feel
like it's too curved up like it's it's
more like a you like this as opposed to
a very shallow curve like this one has
so for me it's a very good fit this is
one dollar at Target and for some reason
I'm not seeing these on elfs website I'm
not seeing any lash curlers of any kind
on there right now but I continue to
find these at Target so stock up if you
can't elfs to do small stipple brush
this is a no brainer must-have if you
want to find the easiest way to apply
your cream blushes bronzers highlights
you must have this love I can dip into a
cream or even a liquid product to think
about those Benetint type products you
know cheek stains in any form you dip
into a
and then you can stipple or lightly
blend on your cheeks but you see what's
happening to this brush those bristles
aren't bending they're not just
squashing over you know with light
pressure you're able to get just a
really great blend and great application
of color with the lightest possible
touch on your skin so therefore you're
not messing up your concealers and your
foundations that are underneath and a
couple of really inexpensive eye brushes
that will totally get the job done for
you it's the essential eyeshadow brush
and the essential eye crease brush see
how this is just your typical flat
eyeshadow brush you don't need something
pricey to do that job for you I'm here
to say and that can pack on shadow like
nobody's business and then this little
guy is a great size for getting your
outer V blending out shades into your
crease and just getting it placed
exactly where you want it if you've got
smaller eyes and you're always using
ginormous crease brushes go with
something like this and then grab out
your larger brush just to blend out the
edges you know what I mean these are
great and only a buck apiece so that's
my updated elf favorites video guys I
hope you liked it what you know these
are products that I like and sometimes
you hear people talking about elf and
they'll say you know oh that's good for
the price these are all things that I
feel like are good not just for their
one dollar or three dollar price but
they're good really in the spectrum of
makeup as a holy this makes your
shopping a little bit easier if you're
using the elf website or just bopping
into Target but thanks for watching I'll
see you later
