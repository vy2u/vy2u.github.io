what's one of the quickest ways I can
glam up my look I would say false
eyelashes are the way to go because it
can really take your eyes to the next
level regardless of what you do with
eyeshadow and eyeliner and anything like
that I feel like false eyelashes can
really open up your face and make you
look more glamorous than you ever have
before problem is I think a lot of
people are scared of the application
process and also if you go to Sally's or
if you even go to Walmart the selection
is getting so much bigger and for those
of us who already like false eyelashes
we're like yeah you know there's more to
choose from but if you've never tried
them before I can totally see how you
would be like ok where do I begin you
know what to what works for my eyes you
know what's going to be a good fit so in
this video I'm going to go through some
of my favorite sets of false eyelashes
and they come from a lot of different
brands so hopefully you do have you know
at least one or two of these kinds
available to you where you live and then
I'll also go through a quick tutorial
but it is going to be very basic for how
to actually put them on so yeah let's
get started with some of my favorite
kinds I'm gonna start with the most
natural and I feel this kind might be
good for people who have never worn
false eyelashes and wants something
that's not going to be too drastic from
the weather net their lashes actually
are and those are the Revlon beyond
natural false eyelashes in natural
defining and these are truly a natural
set and it can be hard to tell that's
one of the reasons why I wanted to go
through this video is when you see them
sitting here in the packages in a store
you're like which one you know how
unnatural or how natural are those
really going to look these are not
terribly long so they're going to add
some good thickness to your lashes
they're going to you know if you feel
like your lashes are sparse you just
don't have a lot of them these are gonna
thicken them up you can wear these on a
daily basis I mean you can put these on
for work and I really think if you put
them on correctly if you watch my
tutorial hoops people are not going to
you know even think that you've got
false eyelashes on there
gonna think your lashes look great so if
that's the kind of effect you're going
for these would be great another kind if
you chew if you try these and you think
yeah one just a little bit more try the
intensifying it'll say intensifying
right up here
try those because they are also really
good and just a little bit longer a
little more dramatic one of the easiest
ways to put on false eyelashes are the
strips that are like half half strips
and you can obviously take a full strip
and cut them but there are some that are
really nicely designed to just go on the
outer part so that would give you more
thickness more length at the outside it
mimics a cat eyed look without doing
anything different with your liner just
because your lashes are coming up and
out in this kind of a shape and there's
a kind from Sonia Kashuk that's the way
I really got into these I found them in
target in the Sonia Kashuk line and they
are just a little bit flared out at the
ends and they look pretty much identical
excuse these because I have not cleaned
these off but these are from Coastal
Scents and so these are great too but
Sonia Kashuk has this very same thing in
target and as you can see it's a shorter
lash strip it gets longer toward the
outside the lashes kind of crisscross so
it gives you a very thick look to the
outer part of your lashes and it's not
that unnatural but it is much more
glamorous than no lashes at all if we're
wanting a little more glamorous look if
we're thinking a night out I want more
length I want more thickness one that I
love these are from ardell and they are
the number 106 so these could be found
at say Sally's or Target or you may even
find them at Walmart too and they look
kind of spiky but I tell you what these
are awesome
I love that actually as you look at them
see how they kind of each one of these
little sets of lashes is in like a
v-shape so you're gonna get the look of
thickness because all those there's more
thickness right here close to the lash
line and then they come out and I mean
it's hard to distress make your eye look
so wide open if they really aren't so
much the effect of really you know
lengthen
on the outside but they make your eye
look so wide-awake and another brand
that I recently stumbled upon at Ulta is
called I'll or and I love these lashes
for a lot of reasons and I like these
these are the natural lights evening
wear and these are number 107 and here
you can see they are another one that is
kind of thick and yet um you know a
little bit longer on each side so these
are a great glam look you're not going
to be over the top with these they're
gonna give your lashes more thickness
more length especially on the end I
could turn my eyelashes into any one of
these sets this one might be it or the
ones that I have on now which are kind
of like this they are the ardell demi
whispies so i will show you how to put
these on in my little tutorial but they
are this shape this very shape of
getting thicker toward the outside
I know ELF sells false eyelashes for a
dollar and they're pretty they're not
bad but the strip can get very hard to
manage at times I feel like and so it's
kind of flimsy but I did find something
for a dollar 25 at my Dollar General
Store called select lash and they look
like this sorry one came off of my
little area there but these kind of
remind me of Oh a little bit of like
maybe these with less thickness you know
there's there's the length is there
they're longer at the outside but
there's less thickness throughout anyway
they're called select lash these are s42
they're only a dollar 25 so if you're
wearing false eyelashes a lot you know
these are these are actually really nice
and I like the band I don't feel like
there's flimsy as the elfman for 25
cents more the one thing is they don't
come in containers like this that kind
of closed back up for you you know you
just kind of have to tear it off and if
you want to keep them you know you put
them back in there so anyway just an
idea if you're checking out Dollar
General those are actually good quality
and you know writing you several dollars
cheaper than these other brands
location is the whole other part of this
so I will show you how to do that stay
tuned so I'm basically going to start
from scratch just telling you how to put
on false eyelashes so they'll come in
packages like this these have already
used so you can see they're not sitting
exactly right there in the packaging but
these are Ardell invisible demi wispies
and let's say i was using these for the
first time usually there is already a
little bit of glue right there on the
false eyelashes so you're gonna want to
peel them off very carefully so i
usually take a pair of tweezers get them
on the end and just peel them then i
would hold the lashes up to my own lash
line and see do i need to trim any off
here are these gonna be just long enough
or too long so just kind of roughly set
them on your lash line and you can see
if they are too long for yours so these
happen to work for me so one thing I
like to do is kind of make it upside
down you with them and this basically
made sure the strip is totally flexible
sometimes you get different ones and the
strip is really straight and it's too
straight for the way an eye naturally
curves here honestly if you've used the
lashes a couple times before they're
going to almost have your your eye shape
formed into them then I like using the
Revlon precision lash glue this is the
only glue I will use why it has a wand
applicator and it keeps you from getting
too much on the lash strip it's just
great so you just unscrew that I've got
this applicator and then I just go from
end to end and you can see this glue
appears kind of whitish or actually it
has a slight bluish tint and you really
only need one swipe on this strip but if
you are you know wondering how did I get
enough there you know you might put on a
little extra right there on each end but
what you want to do now is let that get
tacky so don't just immediately stick it
on your eye because this glue will still
be wet to the point that it won't want
to bond to your eyelids so let it dry
give it you know 30 to 40 seconds I've
already put a coat of mascara and curled
my eyelashes so I curled them I put my
mascara on and they are kind of like in
that form now so they're they're curving
up and they will follow the curve of
else eyelashes that you put on if you
put nothing on these lashes mine
personally tend to point almost
downwards so it would be really hard to
get them joining in together so that's
why the coat of mascara helps me and
then I'm going to line this up I'm
looking down into a mirror right now and
I'm lining this up with the center of my
eyelid and so just get it right there
centered and I'm not putting it on top
of my lashes I'm getting it like where
my eyeliner is then I take this end and
I make sure that's pressed down and I
take this end and I make sure that is
pressed down and then kind of give a tap
along the lash line to make sure
everything got you know pressed on and
there are no gaps and now the lashes are
on and what I like to do excuse my
flaking off polish I like to kind of
blink onto my finger and this is going
to gently as that glue continues to dry
the lashes will dry in an upward fashion
okay so they're going to be nicely
lifted when you put them on and what I
like about these eyelashes is that even
though I didn't win out my eye eye liner
like a cat eye because these are flared
at the outer ends it almost gives you
that cat eyed effect without having to
do anything otherwise with your liner so
once you've determined that you know
everything is dry there and it's looking
good you might want to put one more coat
of mascara on to kind of bond the your
your real and your fake lashes together
sometimes for me it's just a matter of
kind of tapping a little bit you know I
don't necessarily always feel the need
to run it all the way through those
false eyelashes but just doing that you
know will help to make sure that they
are as one so I'll be right back I'm
just gonna put on my other strip the
next natural question is once you get
the lashes on and you're wearing them
throughout the day how do I take them
off I recommend starting to peel them
back from one side I'm not gonna take
yourself right now but you just peel
them you peel them right off what I love
about the Revlon precision lash glue is
that you don't get too much on with some
of the other glues I found I was getting
too much
and it was hard to control and so then
when it came time to take him off it was
really straining me you know I was like
oh it doesn't want to come off so this
you get just the right amount of glue to
hold on there all day really strong but
yet it peels off easily and I do have a
whole blog that I've written on how to
maintain your lashes and care for them
because that is the main determining
factor in how many times you can reuse
them you can take these lashes and wear
them multiple times but I think a big
part of it is how you care for them that
you don't let them get miss shapen and
things like that so check out the blog I
will link to it below because I go
through you know how to clean them off
how to take care of them and how to tell
when it's about time to give them the
boot so thank you so much for watching
this video I hope this was helpful to
you I know it can be difficult to go
into a store it's like you know buying
an outfit almost without being able to
try it on with false eyelashes you can't
put them on your eye you just got to
play a guessing game you know so
hopefully here you've gotten a range of
natural to kind of in-between to
dramatic lashes that I do like the look
of and I think will work for you as well
so thanks again for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
