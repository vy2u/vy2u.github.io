in for this requested video on my
favorite multi-purpose products so
things that you know some of them may be
designed to be used in multiple ways and
other things you know are just something
that I have sort of come up with another
use for that it wasn't necessarily
intended to have so I'll go through
quite a few of these in a second here
and most of them yeah most of them are
going to be drug store items so first
off I wanted to just tell you what's on
my lips just got a message there first I
just want to tell you what's on my lips
and eyes because I've had some questions
and some people wanting me to be posting
that in the bottom and I thought since
my bags right here I can actually show
those things to you so on my lips right
now it's kind of like a a brownie bronze
color and it's my yes to carrots see me
blush lip tint in chocolate kiss so this
is I got my from target for about four
dollars and it looks really dark there
but it's kind of all it all depends on
like how thick you put it on like
there's a little swatch of it on my hand
so it can be more sheer I'm wearing it
kind of like in the middle but it looks
good if you got kind of a bronzy look
going on on your face and then on my
eyes i'm wearing my Maybelline trio in
bronze glitz and I have that lightest
shade on the inner part of my eye that i
put the bronzer shade out here although
I think when I contoured I sort of
covered it up I used this warm shade in
the middle it's sort of a blending color
right up in there but the main shade I
think you're seeing that's making it
look kind of smoky is this Victoria's
Secret beauty rush shadow and it looks
like this and it's called espresso lane
so it's kind of like a baked shimmery
brown but it's really really dark so
anyway those look like that if you
haven't seen those at your Victoria's
Secret store yet but anyway I put that
there i line my upper lash line Oh feel
like a much nice I hate that feeling I
had that feeling like during the
newscast several times it's so hard like
while you're reading a story you're like
oh
that's gonna happen it never happened
okay um anyway I did for liner I think I
used my L'Oreal liner intense in black
on top and then on the bottom I used on
this wet and wild dark brown eyeliner
just kind of right in here I topped it
off with that brown shadow and I used my
Lancome Hypnose mascara there so hope
you like this look I just happened to be
what I were to work today and I've got
some runs or on what did for all
different products on my face I've got
my too faced chocolate soleil matte
bronzer on I've got a little bit of a
highlight going on my Milani minerals
brush blush in my tie which is a quarrel
a shade so anyway I don't want to take
too much take up too much time there but
i want to show you these multi-purpose
products so the first one I'm going to
talk about is one that is sort of an
intended to have lots of purposes anyway
and it's the elf all over color stick I
have this in multiple shades but this
one is probably the one I get the most
use out of its called lilac petal yeah
my light petal and it's it's one of the
one dollar items on Elvis website this
is a great great purchase if you get the
chance so this one is really light and
shimmery and oh gosh I dropped it oops
sorry anyway I think it yeah it landed
on the right side I hate that I've
always liked holding my breath but I
drop something like I hope it doesn't
land face down anyway really really
creamy as you can see if I make a little
swatch there I like sometimes using this
like on really lightly on the tops of my
cheekbones this can be and I base like
you know lightly on your lid before you
put your shadow on just keep it really
really sheer but the use I've been using
it for a lot I'll take one of these
little like disposable lip brushes you
can get it Sally's pick up a little bit
of the product there and then watch what
this does to my lips you put it here and
here and this is going to look kind of
crazy for a second but you just kind of
put it on
right there that Cupid's vote area and
you can also bring it down there a
little bit and then kind of blot over it
with your finger and you've got actually
like a really pretty highlight there so
you just kind of have to put it on and
then soften it up but you get a nice
highlight makes your lips look extra
pouty it makes your whole look kind of
look a little more fresh and dewy so if
you're into the dewy look and that's an
extra quick step you can do with your
makeup that looks really good and if you
wanted you could top that off with a
highlight as well but that's the elf all
over color stick and when I'm giving you
these multiple ways to wear this stuff
it's not just like I had to search and
search for another way to use it I mean
it's not like I'm saying you could use
this as eyeliner or you could tattoo
your arm with it you know like I'm these
are legitimate uses that I have used it
for that I think are good ways to use
the product I wasn't like you know how
many ways can I figure out to use this
so I don't know why I came up with that
but anyway um next thing I want to talk
about is mac fix+ I know a lot of the
mac fans out there swear by this and
this really is a good product a couple
of them it ways that I use it is to make
a powder product like more of a wet
product if you want to wear a shadow wet
for example like I will spray a little
bit of this on my hand like that and
then maybe put my brush in some shadow
and then dip it in here and you get a
more intense like um kind of like a
liquid shadow you just get more
intensity to anything if you there are
any shadows you have and you feel like
oh my gosh I wish this was more bold wet
it down with you can even use water but
this is just nice because it's all like
self-contained and it's kind of
refreshing to it's like a refreshing
mist and another way you can use this is
if you want to sort of set or refresh
your makeup if you feel like you've just
done your makeup this is at least the
thought process i have if i've done my
makeup and it looks a little too just
Matt and not quite fresh enough
sometimes I will take this and I'll kind
of squirt it I almost squirt it like
straight up in the air and then I let it
like kind of the mist kind of falls on
my face
like that so it's not like I'm like here
I see some people do that and I'm like
oh isn't that a little too wet but
anyway I just a light mist is all you
need but this is a great product for
those multiple uses as well another
thing that I use a lot is this
maybelline mineral power finishing veil
powder and my shade i just have it in
light and i've gotten tons of use out of
this have already hit pan on it but this
is just i mean it looks super light here
really it's kind of like an ultra ultra
sheer powder it can be nice to kind of
refresh your makeup like I dusted this
on my face right before I did this video
and it kind of you know made some area
eliminated some areas where i was seeing
shine this can be a final step to your
makeup when you get done or the way i
probably use the most is with a little
concealer brush you know i'll tap my
concealer brush in here and then i use
this is like the powder that i use under
my eye to kind of make sure that no
product runs south on me there so lots
of juices for that the next thing that I
think you're going to know I've
mentioned this product so many times
it's the Physicians Formula shimmer
strips in I mean any penny of these
color ranges look pretty good but the
one I have is the Waikiki strip the
peachy glow bronzer so it's like this
it's got a bunch of strips here and I
mean you guys all know how you can use
this I mean this can be your bronzer
clearly this can be a highlight as I've
used it mainly as a highlight you can
see how a lot of these shadows are worn
down a little bit these can all be
individual shadows each of those strips
and another fun use for it take one of
the lighter shades just get a little bit
on your finger there like that and then
tap it right in the bottom of your lower
lip and you get like an instant you know
if I stop talking for a second maybe you
could focus on it but just a little
extra shame there that's not like real
heavy and glossy and just another
example of something like that to
another brand that makes
thing similar is the palladio herbal
mosaic powder and I have one called
goddess of the Sun and this makes a nice
bronzer and there's some matte shades
and one really shimmery shade there so
this makes great eye shadows too so like
just to swatch one of them like there's
one there's one that's really pigmented
all the way around so that's another
good option if you don't like as much
shimmer as the physicians formula gives
you another multi-purpose product is a
tinted tinted gels I guess bronzing gels
a couple examples that I have her the
L'Oreal Paris sublime bronze one day
Tintagel I think I've reviewed this
before but it can be used for face or
body on instant tan but it's not a
self-tanner so you put this on and you
get kind of an all-over glow and that's
great just to use it in that way face
body there's a couple of different uses
but also take something like this and
use um if you've got like either a
shimmery moisturizer we're just a
shimmery powder that's loose in general
or some glitter or something whatever
you prefer and put some of this in your
hand mix some of that in with it or you
can dilute that with a little bit of
regular moisturizer and you can get a
different look so adding shimmer to one
of these can give it a totally different
appearance than just you know I tan glow
and I like how it can be used on face or
body another one that's good if you like
steel products Sun gel is a good option
there too I had found this on beauty
ticket calm but I'm not sure if it's
still available that kind of stuff comes
and goes on that site a whole lot so
another kind of obvious multi-use
product here is my wet and wild Colt
brow and eyeliner dark brown I just gave
it away its brow and eyeliner and it
does happen to work well from my
coloring in both of those ways this is
what the pencil looks like it's really
long I used it as my lower liner today
and it looks like that so it's a deep
brown and that works well on my brows as
well if I want to fill that and its
really soft
and you get a lot of product this is a
long stick and it's like 99 cents so
that's cool another item from be
luscious that has a couple of uses that
are also obvious is the eye and lip
primer if you want a closer look at this
and also more explanation on this check
my blog it was a recent blog but this is
great too a primer eyes with like a
neutral um skin toned base and once that
dries that's not going anywhere so
really long wearing base or if you want
that kind of erased lip look so you can
start fresh with like a nude lip and not
have your natural lip color show through
it all this is good for that too it's
from you luscious it's called ion lip
primer it's in kind of a small container
but I'm not going through it very fast
and I use it often another multi-use
product not maybe so obvious is from
coastal scents and it's their gel liners
they make excellent excellent eye shadow
basis I've used these as bases in a
couple of tutorials and I know I've
mentioned this before but a couple of
shades like that I like to use that in
that manner summer fun makes a great
base it kind of reminds you of a
slightly more metallic version of Max
rubenesque Paint Pot so these are little
deeper these little containers so you
might want to use like say one of these
little brushes these disposable lip
brushes from Sally's your great to kind
of get into your products there that
summer fun is nice wicked is a great a
silvery shade that makes a nice base and
a good dark base for a smokey eye if you
don't feel like drawing like a liner all
over your lid to get that creamy black
color stellar is nice because it has a
little shimmer but it is very dark as
well um let's see Wow I think that about
did it guys I think I just went through
all of my multi-purpose products that i
can think of at this moment i'm sure
i'll get done with this video and think
of even more and that will frustrate me
but anyway i hope you enjoyed this i
hope this basically extends the
use of the products that you own maybe
you don't end up having to buy as many
things if you find out that one thing
can serve you in a number of ways so
it's definitely a cost effective way to
go so thanks a lot for tuning in have a
great day and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
