been hearing lately so much more hype
about sunless tanners than I ever had
before I mean they've been around for a
long time but I feel like so many people
are using them and kind of coming to the
realization that tanning in the Sun or
in a tanning bed is not good for your
skin it's not healthy and it's not good
for you know trying to fight the aging
process either so I'm excited to share
with you my favorite sunless Tanner's
about a year ago I did my what I thought
were best in worst sunless Tanner's and
the worst ones that I mentioned in that
video kind of remain the same this year
so I'll link to that in the box below if
you want to get kind of an update on the
things that I don't like because they
have remained the same and there's no
real update in that department so I'm
gonna get started with the product that
has really been kind of revolutionary
for me over the past few months and it
is from San Tropez and it is the
bronzing mousse and I got this big size
from QVC when this was on a today's
special value not all that long ago it
came with a couple of these myths that
you put it on with and at first I was
really skeptical about the Midd idea I
thought you know how does this give you
any control how do you know where the
products going but really it helps your
tan go on really evenly and really
quickly too actually so basically what
we have here is a pump and this is again
a really large size this is typically
sold in a little bit smaller container
but it pumps out a bronze tinted mousse
and you put that directly on your mint
here and then you just start going to
town and you got to move kind of quickly
but this is a sunless tan that really
gives you a sort of tan look right off
the bat before they actual you know
sunless tanning is actually taking
effect on your skin but also it dries
really quick and I'm going to talk about
another sunless tanner that I also
really love because the color is great
and I don't think it gets streaky on me
or anything like that but this one what
I love about it so much is that I can
put it on almost right before I go to
bed no colors coming off like on my
sheets and it's drying like immediate
but that what the one thing about that
is you do have to move kind of fast with
your mitt but you are covering a lot
more surface area with this mitt and it
takes the fingers out of the problem you
know what I mean so you can go all the
way down to your hand and all this stuff
and you're not worrying about getting
you know the streaks that you sometimes
see most commonly fingers are causing
that with sunless tanners so I love this
I can use it on my face as well or the
drying and the color and the longevity
of the color I think is pretty
impressive too so I just give this one
really really high marks and I know
that's popular with a lot of people and
this is probably not the first you're
hearing about it but I really love it
but something else that I think is great
and this was sort of the top one for me
last year and I still have some in here
and continue to use it it's the faux tan
by bare essentials and when I got it it
came with this nice dense brush it could
be put on without the brush but what the
brush does is again like the mitt it's
you're not applying it with your hand
and this is really dense really soft and
you just apply the product to the brush
put it on and I don't get streaky with
this it gives me nice color this is
maybe a little more moisturizing to the
skin than the San Tropez is I mean with
that quick dry you're sacrificing
something that's providing a lot of
hydration to the skin so this is a
little more hydrating I won't say it
takes forever to dry but you know I
would definitely wait probably several
hours if I could before going to bed to
put something like this on or if you're
putting it on before a night out you
know just allow yourself a little time
so you don't have to worry about it
getting on clothes because it is again
you can tell by the pump here it's a
dark tinted gel it goes on with color
you can tell where it's going with both
of these I mean you can see exactly what
you're doing so I love them both the
only thing that edges out the San Tropez
is really the drying time for me I
realize both of those are a little bit
pricey but there is a drugstore sunless
tanner that I think is really really
good and it's from Banana Boat and it's
the summer color self-tanning lotion and
I have it in deep dark color I think
this is probably my third container of
this that I've had this again is a
tinted product and you can see right
there
it's coming out with sort of a light tan
tint and of course that's going to
develop on your skin and give you that
tan you know it doesn't have any sort of
application method that comes with it
like a brush or a mitt or anything like
that but it's rather moisturizing I
don't think it has quite the intensity
maybe color wise that these other two do
but you can build up a tan the color
will build with this if you continue to
apply this on a daily to every other day
basis you're going to have pretty good
luck with that and quite a few questions
so far this season from girls saying
they have fair skin and they want
something that's not going to give them
like a super obvious transformation so
you might be looking for like a gradual
tanner and one that I think is the best
and I named this one last year it's the
Jergens natural glow foaming I have this
for medium to tan skin tones and much
like the San Tropez it dries very fast
so this comes out as a colorless white
basically mousse and you just rub that
in it's gonna dry real quick it's gonna
not provide you like a whole lot of tan
on the first day but as you apply it
consistently several days in a row maybe
several times a week at least you will
see some gradual tanning happening there
it's not gonna be crazy don't say it
dries in seconds and glides on evenly
for streak-free color and I actually
think that's a pretty accurate claim
what's what's good for what skin tone um
a lighter skin tone could use the San
Tropez or the fo tan I think it's more a
matter of personal preference you know
do you like seeing yourself with more or
less of a tan and those can get you
pretty dark after like a couple
applications with either of those you
will have what I consider to be a
relatively deep tan face my ultimate
favorite face self-tanner it continues
to be these pads from dr. Dennis gross
you can get these and I think 25 packs
or a 50 pack I most recently got the 50
pack after trying these in a QVC Beauty
test tube but they're the alpha-beta
globe hats anti-aging self-tanner with
active vitamin D these are just little
towelettes they go on colorless Li you
can put them all over
face they dry pretty quickly I've been
using these several times a week for a
while now just to keep up sort of a
natural level of color in my face this
is one of the few few sunless Tanner's
for face that I actually get an effect
from I feel like so often but sunless
Tanner's for the face do nothing I mean
I've gone through so many that have
claimed to you know give you a great tan
and I feel like when my face has a
little more color I use less makeup and
this just works really well for me he's
have enough juice and one of these to go
all over your face down your neck and
this whole decollete area love these so
much
I've never gotten streaky on my face
with these not one can't use the San
Tropez or the faux chana on your face if
you want to I have used both of them on
my face with no negative side effects I
guess they haven't broken me out
personally but I just like reaching for
this because I know it is providing some
kind of like anti-aging benefits excuse
me for my face and that's good to know
just a couple options real quick for
something that you can do to give
yourself some temporary color maybe you
were in a pinch you had an event coming
up you didn't even think about it you
hadn't been sunless tanning and now you
gotta wear a dress I had the Sally
Hansen's Salon airbrush legs in deep
glow and this is a favorite I know for a
lot of makeup artists this is something
that I think Kim Kardashian has said she
swears by but what this is is a little
spray thing in here and you can put it
on and it actually has like some
coverage to it if you've got
imperfections on your legs I don't know
if you've got had little bumps and
bruises and whatever this evens out the
skin it's kind of like a makeup a body
makeup if you will used on its own it
doesn't spread extremely easily but
here's well do I'll cut my hand and you
know spritz some of that in there and
then I'll add a little bit of lotion
whatever kind that might be just put a
little lotion in there rub it all
together and you still get the coverage
but it spreads so much more easily on
your skin and your legs will be looking
you know ten perfect wonderful women
this might even be something where let's
you had a little mess-up with the
sunless tanner got a few streaks going
on this can really make those seem less
obvious by using something that is kind
of like a body makes the other thing I
would advise you to do before you do any
sunless tanning it's a really good idea
to exfoliate the skin you could use a
body scrub I have one from soft soap
that I love it's coconut scented and it
just kind of gives me in that mood okay
I'm going to do some sunless tanning but
another thing you can use are just those
you know those puffs that are like you
know bright colored sort of mesh pups if
you just use one of those with any kind
of body gel or body wash and really use
that that will exfoliate your skin is
one thing that will really extend your
tan because your sloughing off the dead
skin cells before you even put on that
layer of whatever it may be hope this
video was helpful to you again if you're
wondering what to stay away from I
mention a few things in last year's
video which I've linked to below thanks
so much for watching guys and have a
great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
