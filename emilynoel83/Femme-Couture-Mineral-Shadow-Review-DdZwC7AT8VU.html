great day today I wanted to share a
review review with you about a new line
of mineral makeup that's being sold at
sally beauty supply it's called it's
called femme couture and so far I've
just tried three of the mineral eye
shadows and I wanted to review those for
you today because i think they are
awesome i really really like them and if
you guys have access to a sally beauty
supply it's likely that the same deal is
going on where you live because it's buy
two get one free they cost like 699 a
piece so that may be a little more
expensive for single eyeshadow then you
may be used to paying but I promise you
on this the quality is outstanding and
it's nice because you know you get you
buy two get one free you're able to get
like what I did I got a highlighter
shade I got kind of a medium shade and
then a really nice dark shade to work
with and they've got a good range i want
to say they have maybe um 12 or 14
different shades not quite sure on that
i'm just trying to visualize what I saw
there but I want to show you what the
colors are like I actually the eye look
I have on right now is using the three
colors that I got so I'm really really
excited so let's uh let's go ahead and
show you what they look like this is
what the packaging is like um it's cut
it's got a neat little um square design
and what kind of a dark plum colored top
on it that's kind of the way all the
packaging is it kind of makes me want to
try some of the other stuff they have
their I know they have blush and
foundations and all kinds of stuff they
have eyeliners they have gel liners too
but anyway him back to the eyeshadow
because this is what I was most
intrigued by there
and top just twists off and then you've
got the little shaker here and I just
kind of tap it into the lid when I use
it but I've got this this shade is the
purple amethyst which I got some
swatches don't worry because you can't
really see all that well through the
container and one thing I have noticed
is if you're there at the store and
you're looking at these because you
can't open up the container obviously
they look a lot lighter something about
the shininess of this container like
reflects light off of the shadow and um
I feel like the shades are all deeper
than what they appear to be through here
so just be aware of that especially with
several of the brown shades I went ahead
and got one but when I was there I was
like this doesn't look very dark but it
really does show up I promise so the
other chin it got was cocoa and that's
the deep brown this is not shimmery this
is the one that I got it wasn't and then
the other one is golden Oasis and that's
kind of like my highlighter shade so go
ahead and show you the swatches that
have here on my hand just using an
eyeshadow primer here and unfortunately
it's not picking up quite well enough
the difference between the cocoa and the
purple amethyst but this is golden Oasis
and you can see I mean it's it does not
appear to be a very light shade here in
the packaging and look at the color that
you get that comes off of it I mean it's
just really golden and just has a nice
shimmer to it and that's actually what
i'm wearing which i'll give you a closer
look up on it but i'm wearing this as a
highlight and also on the inner corner
of my eye
and then this next shade here in the
middle is Coco and I expected this to be
once again much lighter I mean look at
the at the packaging I just just to look
at it I thought of it does not seem
super dark but this one does not appear
to have shimmer in it so this is a deep
a medium to deep brown without shimmer
if you're seeing some shimmer it was
probably because when I initially tried
these or when I was messing around
trying to do just watches I got some of
the gold all over but and that is Matt
and then the last one is that what was
it called deep amethyst and that's like
a really nice dark purple if you like to
wear purples and you like a purple
smokey eye this would be the way to go
with that and it is it does have a
little bit of shimmer to it but it's
very fine I mean you're not getting a
shimmer powder with these I sometimes
worry about that when I'm purchasing any
kind of loose shadow even if it says its
mineral I mean you gotta wonder is this
just going to turn out to be a shimmery
mess my i would but these are really
just I mean straight-up pigmented
shadows and the color is great one thing
you do need to be careful about is when
you're applying these kind of shadows
you probably want to use a flat type
brush like this or this one which is
actually former wait I can feel or brush
but I thought that would be nice for
getting loose shadows and packing them
like right on your lid because you got
to worry about fallout a little bit with
stuff like this so I mean you can still
use like your your contour brush for
getting it up in here and everything but
just be aware and fallout may happen if
you got a fan brush it's really good for
just sweeping the little particles that
may fall out sweeping them away because
I did have a tiny bit but fortunately it
was only with like the golden shade so
it didn't really bother me that much but
like i said i was able to get a
right off and I mean that's just going
to come with the territory basically
with any loose powder shadow you get you
just have to be kind of careful when you
apply it and don't just like stick your
brush on your eyelid and back for that
point I mean you're going to have to
kind of be almost like pack it on and
then blend it out Jim gently and
carefully in like a circular motion
around it so let's give you a closer
look at my eye shadow here I've got some
decent lighting here for a change and I
just want to show you what the look is
that I have what i did was i use the
golden oasis on and and can you see how
these colors they blend together you
know they just I mean I just picked
three random shades these want group
together or anything but I get the
feeling that all their shadows just
blend really well because i use the
golden oasis here like on the inner
portion and then i used the cocoa shade
um going out up onto the brow bone just
a little bit and i just think that
blended flawlessly i really like that
and then i use the purple amethyst it's
kind of an outer v sort of and right in
here in the outer corner of the eye so i
really really like the way these worked
out i think you could get just as
dramatic or simple look as you want with
them i really think it's it's very easy
to use easy to blend and again the
colors are great they have a lot of
neutral colors they also have like I
remember they had a rose shade and some
greens and so I think this is something
I'm a repurchase and I just encourage
you to give it a try I mean
so if you have access to it sally beauty
supply that is great i'm sorry for those
of you that are you hearing me go on and
on about this but you don't have a
Sally's near you but it's really a
quality product i'm so excited about it
and i hope you guys get a chance to
check it out so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
