video this is going to be a look using
the new Coastal Scents creative me
pallet number one and it's an assortment
of bright matte shades and this is using
a couple shades of pink and a shade of
purple for this look I really liked how
it turned out I love pink and purple i
looks to begin with but you'll see this
palette has so much more than that even
you know you've got tones of yellow
orange pink purple blue aqua kind of
greenish tones there too so this is
definitely promising you know I'll have
a lot of other looks that I can do with
this as well but just keep in mind that
when you use these shades you don't have
to use like all the colors of the
rainbow and one look you know you could
pick one of those bright matte shades
and use it as a color to sort of accent
a smokier look or to you know bring a
little brightness to your eyelid or as
you blend it out so just keep that in
mind that this palette while it might
not seem very practical it these are
some really great shades that are going
to give you a lot of bang for your buck
they are going to show up on your eye
this look I love how they blend they
blend like kind of a you stay really
they practically feel kind of creamy
almost I know that doesn't make sense
for a powder product but when you when
you feel them you can see that they just
they just stand out wonderfully well and
are really a dream to work with so if
you want to see how I pulled this look
together keep on we need to do is apply
a primer to our lids this is just going
to help the colors stand out more please
excuse the nail polish that chipped off
there it's going to help our eye shadow
stand out more and it's going to extend
the wear of the shadow so I'm just
getting that all over my lid I used for
this video Smashbox photo finish lid
primer okay so that's really good one
for neutralizing the natural
discoloration that your eyelids do have
so next step we're going to grab our
coastal scents creative me pallet number
one and I'm going to be first going for
this magenta shade right here the three
colors we're going to be using here are
this shade this beautiful deep grape and
then this lighter pink here which is
still very bright in itself so take that
magenta or fuchsia shade and I'm
take my ELF I shadow brush and just
begin padding that all over the lid
that's where we want this shadow to be
is just all over our eyelid so you can
see we're getting a lot of color here
I'm even getting it up into the crease
just a little Bush that's only going to
help in blending overlapping is one of
the keys to blending in some cases so
there we are all over the lid and then
I'm going to go for the purple that's
right next to it again these are all
matte shades we're going for that deep
purple shade and I'm going to first take
my sonia kashuk it's the I think it's a
medium shadow brush just a flat brush
that can really get into our crease and
kind of pull that colour outward so get
a little bit just on the tip of the
brush and as you can see i'm getting it
right there in the crease and that's the
first place i'm paying attention to i'm
getting it right in the inner part as
well so don't ignore that get it in
there and then start pulling it outward
and at that point you might need to get
a little more on your brush um go as far
out as you feel comfortable with this
I'm keeping it kind of a typical outer V
I'm not going really over overly
different with this than I would with
any other look but now that I've got
that there I want to take a fluffier
brush just bare and I'm going to use my
Sephora rounded crease brush and just go
over the outer edge of all of this
everything you did with the purple there
you're going to see it diffuse a little
bit and just become a little less harsh
okay next we want to come in with a
smaller brush I'm going to use my fine
crease brush from essence of beauty
that's those are great I brush is
available at CVS this is a very small
brush and I'm using that to blend over
other areas like right in here okay you
don't even have any more product on it
at this time but I am going to go ahead
and add a little bit more
and get that on the outer half of the
lid right there just overlapping you're
going to get a little different tone
when you overlap colors so it's like
instead of you know we use pink waves
purple and when we put pink of the
purple over the pink we get an even you
know multi-dimensional look okay so
there we are we've overlap that a little
bit next we want to go to the lighter
pink which is still kind of like your
classic hot pink I think right here and
I'm going to use that Sephora rounded
crease brush a fluffier brush again get
some of that on the tip of the brush so
I'm just kind of putting it down on the
shadow like that and i'm going to go
over the outer border of the purple here
and so it's going to be like a purplish
pink now so we're still going to have
that look of dark purple in the actual
crease but as it fades up to our eyebrow
it's going to have the effect of this
hot pink shade next I want to have a
little bit wider highlight and since
this palette doesn't really have any
light shimmery shades I'm going to be
taking my covergirl um this is the one
kit I enhancers in champagne so a light
light light shimmery cream shade keeping
that right up under the eyebrow creating
a nice contrast not only with your
eyebrow but with the bright colors we're
using here next we're going to go back
to the dark purple and I'm going to use
my Coastal Scents tackle on angled liner
brush and this isn't going to create a
whole whole lot of contrast we are going
over a bright pink but I'm using that
just to get a little bit more of that
purple right in near the lash line like
I said it's not going to make any huge
huge difference but as I sit here I can
see that it's just a little deeper than
another lash line it's going to make
more of a difference when we put it down
on the lower lash line here okay so we
are going to do that flip your brush
around and start packing some of that
purple on right here lower lash line
just kind of getting it like right in
between the eyelashes
just like that as much intensity as
thick of a line as you want but I'm
going to keep it just pretty pretty
standard here just like that then we're
going to do a little more blending here
you can see how this is all kind of
really faded around the outer corner and
that um fine crease brush is going to
help us do that so I'm going to get a
little bit more of the dark purple there
on that and I'm going to really play off
the outer edge here outer edge of the
liner this is going to blend seamlessly
out and we're just going to complete
that outer V a little more outer views
can be a lot easier to gauge and then
when i say outer V I mean the outer
batch of color that's kind of coming
right outside the typical shape of our I
because when we use liner where we're
also changing the shape of our I so use
the outer V and kind of play off of
wherever that line ended like you can
see this line is really the leading edge
to that shadow there we're just keeping
blending around making sure we're
maintaining that the deepest part of
this shadow is in our crease not outside
the crease okay and we're call so kind
of keeping it in line with the eyebrow
you can see this line if I continued it
up would end up going to my eyebrow okay
if you want to go over that a little
more if you feel like you've lost some
of that brightest pink shade that hot
pink that we used go ahead and go over
that again and I was a last little
finishing touch for the shadow I'm going
to take my detail mini contour brush
from Coastal Scents remember you don't
have to have this brush a um q-tip or an
eye shadow applicator can work here as
well taking some of that light light
shimmery shade that did not that's the
covergirl shade didn't come in this
palette and just brightening up that
inner corner
giving it a little wife a little bit of
a dewy glow because everything else is
so mat with the exception of what's
right up there and there we go all right
next I'm going to take a couple
different mascaras I'm going to use my
L'Oreal voluminous on the top lashes and
then I'm going to use my Maybelline lash
discovery you know the really really
small brush mascara that will define
every last one of these lower lashes and
then I'll join you what the finished
look
all right guys here is the finished look
really really pretty Matt blended out
pinkish purple look I really love using
this creative me pallet number one from
Coastal Scents all the shades in here
are Matt and they're super pigmented
very colorful the color stands out so
much even on the yellow shades and so I
really liked using it kind of to
sandwich the the purple in between
fuchsia tone of pink and then blend it
out on the outer edge of this whole look
with a basically a hot pink shade and I
just think it turned out to be a
wearable look yet colorful and one tip
that I would pass along is this this
palette can be really useful you might
look at and think how do I use this in
everyday life but use like one of these
shades is sort of like your accent shade
you know you might be using more neutral
colors but say take one of these aqua
shades or the blue or the pink and just
use it with your typical Gray's Black's
Browns as a little shaking might use on
your you know in the center of your lid
or as you blend it out as you blend out
you know your crease shade you could you
could hit it with a little one a little
bit of one of these colors not that you
have to use all of them you know but
anyway this was a fun look as well
because we didn't actually go in with
any eyeliner we just used the shadow as
our liner which was nice and it really
kept the continuity of the look we had
purple you know in the crease but we
also had a deeper more concentrated
version of that color on our lower lash
line in our upper lash line as well in
terms of what else is on my face I used
my bare minerals foundation today and
then I used a bronzer all over i used
the warmth that comes with bare minerals
and i also used the photon to kind of
contour in some areas here and then on
my blush i kind of wanted to keep with
the tones of pinks so i use my wet and
wild silk finish blush in berry shimmer
this is intense this is a really intense
blush you only need like literally one
tap of your brush in there and then
blend it blend blend on your cheeks but
that really does kind of keep the pink
thing going and then I went kind of
light on the lips i use my Jordana
pretty shine lipgloss ensuite it's a
very very light pale pink
comes off very light and shimmery there
so if you like this look please let me
know or if you want to see more looks
using the creative me palette I mean I'm
sure there's other things I can do you
know maybe if you see this and you think
you know what are some color
combinations you want to see here it
doesn't always have to be like the color
family that's kind of the obvious choice
kind of like I did today you know we
could do like blue and pink or now that
can be pretty these two shades right
here could be fun as well but I just let
me know if there's anything in
particular you want to see I will
continue doing tutorials with this
palette so keep on watching and thanks
for watching this video everyone and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
