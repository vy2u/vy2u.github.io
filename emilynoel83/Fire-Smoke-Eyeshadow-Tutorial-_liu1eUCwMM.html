this video this is going to be a really
fun spin on a normal smokey eye because
I'm using a bright coral orange shade so
chances are you've got that color maybe
in your wardrobe for spring and summer
coming up so this will totally work for
that it'll work for any sort of bronzy
look you've got going on elsewhere on
your face so if you want to see how I
put it together keep watch okay guys
step one we're gonna take our Mac
rubenesque Paint Pot a pretty peachy
golden eat own which will work really
well with what we're going for here and
just go ahead and spread that all over
your eyelid and kind of up basically
onto the rest of your eye area but just
concentrated on lid next we're gonna
move on to our shadow and we're using
our Coastal Scents 42 double stack
shimmer palette and we're going to be
using this shade right down here it's
kind of like a pinky Orange just a
really vivid coral shade and we're just
gonna kind of go nuts packing that on
our lids so just pack it on an eyeshadow
brush I'm going to use my ELF eyeshadow
brush and the color is gonna be pretty
intense but you know don't worry about
it we're gonna kind of work with it and
make it make it kind of wearable while
also showing letting the some of that
color shine through so just get that all
over your lid and once you've pretty
much got it concentrated there think
about sort of blending it upward a
little bit kind of into your crease and
beyond just a bit I know it's gonna seem
really strange to have that orange or
that coral there but I promise it'll
work out in the end now once you've got
that there we're gonna go back to our
palette and grab another kind of gold in
the orange shade this one right here is
gonna basically take it sort of being a
highlight shade but then we're going to
do an ultimate ultimately the highlight
with this white shade right under our
brow bone so I'm gonna go ahead and go
through those steps I'm just taking my
Sephora rounded crease brush just a nice
fluffy brush that will kind of diffuse
that color and this is
the sort of yellowy orange shade so just
blend that really well it's also serving
to blend out the border of that orange
there and then if you want to take that
white and I just kind of use that going
right under my eyebrow just highlighting
the brow a little bit just like that
okay so you can obviously tell that
we've added some darkness in here just
to kind of make the eye a little bit
more wearable and not just stark orange
so also in this palette is a really nice
shimmery black shade right here so
that's what I'm going to use to
basically start shaping and contouring
so I'm going to use for this my own CBS
essence of beauty round bit or rounded
crease
it's my fine contour brush from essence
of beauty and those are available at CVS
that's what I meant to say and I'm
basically with this gonna just start
working it into the crease and kind of
while I'm blending it side to side like
that windshield wiper motion I'm also
going sort of up and down just to kind
of blend down onto the color a little
bit okay so just basically first try to
get it in your crease and then start
thinking about an outer V okay so it's
pretty much used up what's on my brush
now I'm gonna go back for a little bit
more you really do want to be careful
with you know anytime you're
incorporating a black shade and you're
kind of trying to use it somewhat
sparingly over some colorful shades you
know you don't want to go overboard and
make your color look too muddy you just
want to create that contrast you know
sometimes it takes something dark next
to your bright shade to make your bright
shade even more complimented you know
what I mean so we're working it out
they're kind of creating an outer V and
we
may come back to our dark shadow in a
moment once we get our liner there and
then that will kind of caused us to
reevaluate the shape of our eye
basically because we will wing it out a
little bit I'm using might be luscious
black liquid liner and this is just a
really rich liner and it does last quite
a long time too so I've been pretty
impressed with this so I've got it out
here it's got a little brush tip
applicator and I'm just gonna go inner
corner to outer corner with this
and this if the supply is really smooth
and the little brush holds quite a bit
of product so that can be nice and
convenient so you don't have to go back
too many times to your container there
we're just continuing outward just a bit
here
just go wherever you're comfortable in
terms of that line but I'm going out
just a little bit and you can see that
it's kind of making sense with where we
have that shadow and now I'm going to
come in with my black pencil liner it's
Revlon Colorstay in black and I'm just
going to connect right in with the
liquid and then basically just kind of
smudge that right in my lower lash line
sorry
and all the way into the inner corner
and there you go to go over our liner a
little bit I'm going to take some of
that black shadow shade and just use
that to go over and kind of set our
lower liner here just like so and then
in a second here since this one's got
all this dark color on it I'm going to
grab a different liner brush and go back
to that sort of yellowish orange shade
it was really shimmery that we sort of
used as a highlight and I'm gonna just
put some of that in here in the inner
corner just to brighten this up a bit
next I'm going to curl my lashes hold it
there for about 15 seconds then I'm
going to use my Too Faced lash injection
mascara and apply that to your top and
bottom lashes then I'm going to apply
some false eyelashes it'll be the Ardell
number 106 and I will join you back here
after I get those steps alright guys
we're back here's the finished look I
hope you like it it's just a totally
different spin on a normal smoky eye
it's kind of more glamorous because we
did add on the false lashes and smoke it
out a little bit but I think it's a
great summer look because you're
incorporating just a really warm shade
for the season and in terms of what's on
my lips let's see I used my NYC lipstick
here this shade is caramel and it's the
it's a certain kind it's the ultra last
lip wear and so that's just kind of like
eh I don't know sort of a coppery nude
shade and then I went over it with my be
less liquid lustre in euphoric so a
really super pretty coral sparkly shade
and then on the rest of my makeup I used
my both sides of this I use my Rimmel
lasting finish foundation and then I
used both sides of this Sonia Kashuk
bronzer duo it's got the golden curry
bronzor here which I already had in a
different just you know just that solid
and then I found this had that and this
pretty coral a blush so I used both of
those went over it with my Milani
minerals blush in my tie it really
pretty coral a shaved their and just
used a little bit of highlighter I used
the Physicians Formula shimmer strips
and waikiki glow and just kind of went
over that and so i think it just really
keeps it a fresh kind of dewy look
with sort of a more dramatic eye so i
hope you guys like this tutorial and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
