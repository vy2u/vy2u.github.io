response on the five random facts
question and it always been a while but
I got around to doing it and so I'm
going to share my five random facts with
you and hopefully you'll find it
somewhat interesting maybe you wanted
all that school to my first fact is that
I am ever since I was in seventh grade I
was in cheerleading so I went throughout
junior high all of high school and even
all throughout college I went to
Monmouth College and not the Monmouth
University in New Jersey but Monmouth
College it's a small four-year liberal
arts college in Western Illinois and
such a really is a really great school
and they had a really great cheerleading
program there to where we got to compete
a couple of years and we moved into
having a co-ed program and I was the
captain for my last couple of years
there cheerleading was just my life for
a really long time I learned how to
tumble and I taught gymnastics during
the end of my high school years at the
local YMCA and I was really enjoyed that
and I just loved cheerleading so much
you know I would watch every competition
whenever it came on TV and I still do
I'm still really interested in and
actually I would like to UM you know
maybe part-time coach somewhere coach up
at the college level I think that's
really awesome cheerleading has just
become such an athletic activity that
people do these days and I just love it
to this day and I'm still really
interested in I still subscribe to
American cheerleader magazine so I just
I just love it so much still and I
choose four so it would have been for
about ten years that I spent as a
cheerleader so that was a big part of my
life so that's my first random fact um
second um I guess I can contribute this
to all the strength training I had to do
while I was in cheerleading um I was the
one usually that got tossed up and we
did like back
what basket tosses and that kind of
thing and you know two and a half I
pyramids and stuff but still had to be
really strong to do that and I can do
one-armed push-ups so a lot of people
don't look at me and just think I can do
something like that but I can and I'm
happy to say there's nobody here to
videotape me doing that so I don't have
to show you but I promise you that I can
I can do a left arm or right arm um it's
just a strength that I guess I've built
up ever since I was actually when I was
really little I like to swim a lot I
think that built up a lot of upper body
and back strength and so I'm able to do
that um another random fact about myself
was that when I was in college at
Monmouth I joined a sorority and it it's
actually the PI beta 5 women's
fraternity it was the first one ever
ever created it was actually created way
way back in the day under a different
name and so it's very historic at
Monmouth that's where it was founded and
I really missed that part of college too
because I made so many friends in that
group a lot of the cheerleaders that I
was with we're also my close friends in
Pi Beta Phi or PI thought if I move a
little bit you can still see there's
that paddle that's my pipe I a pallet
they give you when you initiate and that
kind of thing and so we had formals and
parties and lots of fun stuff but it
also it also helped me really learn to
manage everything that I was doing in
college I was very involved in
cheerleading but um being in Pi Phi
allowed me to do a lot of kind of
philanthropic things to giving back and
really had just having a good time with
a lot of people that had shared interest
with me so if anybody out there is
watching there's a former Pi Phi high
and another number 4 random fact about
me is that I bite my nails
I've done it for a really long time it's
just a hat it's kind of like kind of
like I just pick at it you know like I
just just a nervous habit I just pick at
my nails when I'm sitting here um but I
for a while they're like I had oh okay I
had had the time to keep having them
done you know like painting my nails and
having them look all nice and when they
were like that I would never buy them
but then it wouldn't be long before
there would be a little chip on it then
I start picking it off and so I really
need to try to make a better effort to
keep him done I know that one video I
did they look like
really bad but um I don't know I need to
work on it because I really don't want
to buy 20 houses the rest of my life so
if you got any good tips oh let me know
I know I've tried the like the no bite
stuff it's like bitter but that really
doesn't work for me so because it is a
lot of it is just that I messed with
them and I pick at them with my fingers
and so it's just a random fact about me
and my last random fact is that I am
married I'm 24 years old so I'm like a
couple years out of college now and when
I was a junior no my senior year it was
homecoming in the fall and I was out
doing like this doing routine that we do
it's called the spirit shout like the
entire school comes and the different
student groups do like performances and
stuff and the football team comes out
and they give all speech each of the
captains because their big homecoming
game is the next day and Tyler is what
was one of the captains at the time and
so he when it got to him he was the last
captain to say something and so he said
it never is who's all excited and then
he calls me up on the stage and um I
just thought because he kind of started
it with you know got really good
cheerleading squad this year and always
a big part of that and when I come
uh period I was just like oh gosh you
know I don't want to I don't want to
have to say anything or anything like
that but within moments he was like he
was like I'm not going to ask you to
give a speech one word would be fine and
then he got down on one knee and
proposed to me right there in front of
everybody and I of course said yes and
everybody in the crowd was screaming and
all these girls were crying and I was
crying too and it was just like so
exciting it was and it totally took me
by surprise people asked me like like
obviously they could see that I was
surprised but they're like if you talked
about that at all I mean we had been
dating since since sophomore year of
high school so by the time it rolled
around to seeing in your college you
know we've been dating for quite a while
but we really hadn't just like set yeah
I think we just assumed we'd be together
but we never really talked about it you
know so when he you know totally caught
me by surprise and did that it was very
out of character for him to to do
something like that in front of
everybody um but that was a really happy
time and then that following August
before we moved down here he's going to
law school at Southern Illinois
University and while I'm working at the
TV station down here and we moved down
here and we got married then the August
before it was just a great wedding so
fun and um that was just something I
don't think I've ever mentioned in any
of my videos and I tried to make
everything I talked about something that
I don't mention in my videos so I hope
you found it entertaining um if you have
any comments please let me know
otherwise thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
