video and talk about just the typical
face makeup routine that I use on pretty
much a daily basis now I am on HD
television daily so I'm looking for
something that's gonna have pretty good
coverage most of the time I am always
experimenting with different products
and the specific things I use might be
different day to day the techniques I
use are pretty much the same and the
sequence of products and things like
that
so I thought it might be fun to go
through that with you and just kind of
show you what things have been working
for me lately are gonna be days here and
there were you're gonna just want to
slap on some tinted moisturizer and go
and this is not that routine this is you
know gonna take you through foundation
concealer bronzer powder blush all those
different things just for the face I
like a lot of the time is kind of
glowing but never greasy that glow on my
cheeks is not coming from any amount of
oil that's coming from just the right
product in the right places so here's
how I do it
all right so first off I do moisturizer
and I'm using the Olay complete
broad-spectrum SPF 15 for combo to oily
skin this has been really good for me
during the hot months when I feel like
my skin gets more oily and then I used
my hard candy sheer envy primer when I
recommend this to people I usually
recommend they shake it up first because
I feel like the product gets can get a
little runny at times but it's still a
very good primer so and you get a lot of
product in there too again I rotate
foundations a lot this is one that I'm
kind of in the process of testing so I'm
using it today it's the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi healthy luminous makeup so I
just kind of pumps some onto my finger
maybe one and a half pumps there and
then I dotted around not really for the
purpose of blending but just to get the
product down in certain areas I kind of
concentrate the most product in sort of
the center part of my face and then when
I really get to the blending part with
my brush then I blend outward then I use
my Sigma f80 brush it's a flat top
kabuki brush and I just think it does a
great job blending out foundation making
it look really even and flawless so and
it also seems to fit kind of nicely even
around the eye area so I get it all up
in there and just kind of use circular
motions
make sure to kind of take it down as
well around the jawline a little bit on
to the neck just so it's all really
blended then I go to concealer and one
that I'm really enjoying right now is
from brand called Dalton and this is
sold on QVC the product is called
conceal it I'm using it in medium and
this is actually a lot of product this
this is about the size of a typical
powder compact but it has a sponge there
you could use it like in larger swathes
across your face and it's also got the
secondary a little lid here to keep it
keep it from drying out so I just use
that with my finger and I dot that over
different areas you can see the coverage
is you know just with one tap over that
sunspot there and it really took it away
this is also great on the under-eye it's
a good creamy texture it's not maybe
quite as thick as say benefits erase
paste so it's kind of a happy medium I
feel like for a creamy concealer that
still has really nice coverage so I'm
just going around my eye really good the
inner corner and I do some around my
nose just - I feel like this area can
get looking a little dull and I have
some broken capillaries on the sides of
my nose so I just go over that if you
really want just the most flawless look
with your concealer I have on this
product from bareMinerals called summer
bisque
there's bisque their summer bisque
there's different shades of it and this
is the jumbo size here actually but I
take a little bit of this with on this
brush from Sigma find that this is good
for this under-eye area and so what I'll
do is tap out a little bit of that
product here in the lid and then just
kind of go over that area and I find
that it's just great about mattifying
everything here and really taking away
the look of any sort of circle I find
this even makes you know a lesser
quality concealer a little more full
cover a little bit goes a long way and
you can go around your nose
anywhere else with that Wow the whole
complexion is basically even now I go
over it with some powder I'm gonna use
my NYX stay matte but not flat powder
and this says powder foundation I just
use a little bit of this and I'm using
medium beige just get a little bit on my
brush and dust it very lightly if you
wanted to use it like a powder
foundation you know use the sponge or
whatever's provided there and go over it
in a little more with a little more
product in a thicker way but for this
you know just really light I just really
like the finish of this powder then I'm
going to put a little bit of bronzer on
all over I'm using my Revlon Photoready
bronzer the shade is bronzed and chic
and as you can see it's for shades it's
all matte and I'm just swirling my big
brush in there just to get a little bit
of all the colors and then just kind of
take this all over the face if you're
trying to give your skin tone a little
bit of a boost in this way you know I'm
you can see I'm not really trying to
contour anything I'm just applying this
all over you could use a bronzer that
maybe has a little bit of a shimmer to
it if that's what you want but I do
think that the matte is really natural
looking and then be sure to take that
down around your jaw line down your neck
decollete area here's what I love about
this product is the multi-purpose nature
of it you got your darker a couple of
tones right down here so I'll take an
angled brush and just pick up a little
bit of that and then this can become my
contouring steps so I kind of like to
Center the product right here and apply
kind of like I'm going right under my
cheekbone and then circular motions to
buff it out so it's kind of like you're
putting the product on and then you're
giving it a really good blend as you can
see getting right back by the ear and
applying it and then buffing it going
underneath around the hairline you just
really want to make sure you're getting
it right in the hairline don't be afraid
to kind of overlap a little bit with the
hair because it's
be really obvious if you don't do that
then I'm going to do a little blush I'm
today I'm using my Milani baked blush in
Dolce pink and it's just a really pretty
fresh pink with some some shimmer and I
just kind of circle this on the outer
part of the apple of my cheek and then
bring it upward I'm not getting it in
too close to the nose because then it
can look a little funny on your face and
it can kind of bring a look of redness
or pinkness or whatever color of your
blush is really close to your nose and
we don't want that so keeping it kind of
out and then up and that upward motion
you know is again keeping the face
looking a little bit more slim that way
sometimes I also like to go with a
little blush right on the brow bone I
feel like there's something about that
that really pulls the whole face
together and makes it all look a little
bit more bright and that blush was
practically like a blush and highlight
in one but just to show you my highlight
step I've got my hard candy this is
actually a bronzer intiki but it really
is a highlight to me and I just take a
little bit of that you can use the same
brush and I'll go right up here right on
top of the cheekbone maybe right down
the bridge of the nose and a little bit
right on the Cupid's bow area making
that stand out once you do your lip
product it all really pop and using the
it cosmetics bye bye pours powder just
pick a little bit of that up and I just
dust it really lightly all over
everything some kind of shimmery
products and I've still got some glow on
there so it's not taking that away just
it really does add to just the even look
of everything and like I said it helps
staying power to I do switch up my
products a lot so sometimes I might use
this is my finishing step sometimes I'll
reach for my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray both work well as a good
light finishing touch type product so I
do find just doing my makeup in this way
doing the foundation setting it with
powder setting the concealer things like
that I feel like it all really
contributes to a pretty long wearing
look so things I'm going for are again
good coverage long wearing and something
that has the appearance of a little bit
of a glow to the skin as well so I hope
this was helpful to you let me know if
there are any other kind of
back-to-basics type videos you would
like to see since in some cases it was
alone it was many many videos ago that I
did something like this initially so
probably about time to update some of
those so send me your request and thank
you so much for watching let me know if
you have any questions and have a great
day fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
