really excited when I hear about a new
makeup line and if it's from the
drugstore I am totally there and this is
a new makeup line called flower Beauty
it's by Drew Barrymore and I'm sure a
huge team of chemists and designers and
whatever but it's out in Walmart stores
now and I was watching her on several
talk shows she's really been on the
media circuit here lately she was really
claiming that these are high-end
formulas for drugstore prices so of
course I am out to see if that is really
true these products are made in the USA
they're not tested on animals and I just
picked up sort of a handful of things
when I ran into him at my Walmart store
I saw the full line and it is you know
everything from foundations to
concealers and nail polishes lip
products cheek products you know
everything is there out this video I'm
also going to be cutting to some shots
of the actual application and swatches I
want you to really see how these
products apply not just my descriptions
of how quick the things I'm going to be
talking about are the foundation stick
powder foundation a blush bronzer duo
and eyeshadow quad a mascara and also a
couple of different lip products first
off the skin Cognito foundation stick I
am in SF 3 for this one always been a
huge fan of foundation sticks
I feel like Maybelline used to have one
years ago
L'Oreal vyd as well I think they're
super convenient because they're usually
very buildable and I found that to be
the case with this one as well so
basically you just twist it up it looks
like you know a giant lip balm or
something but this is very creamy and
texture and so the way I applied it was
I just kind of dotted it around on my
face and then I used my Sigma f80
foundation brush to buff it in you could
also use your fingers I just feel like
that brush gives me a nice evenness in
application and pressure applied to the
phase-in I also use this as my concealer
so I went back and I layered a little
more product over those certain areas
that I would normally use a concealer on
and I was really pleased with the cut
rich I felt like this could totally be
built up customized to the coverage you
need it to be and then I just used a
smaller more targeted brush to blend in
those areas and that is all I used I did
not bring in another concealer for this
look and so I think that makes this
wonderfully user friendly if you can use
this as both kind of like a really
creamy foundation and also a concealer
you're eliminating an extra product
there and that made this great for
travel so I did travel with this and I
found it so easy to be able to use it in
that way one thing I did notice even
though I was in a very dry extremely
cold climate I still did need to touch
this up with a little bit of powder
about midday and I am kind of like
combination skin so I get a little bit
oily in the t-zone I went ahead and even
in my initial makeup application I
applied powder on top of this but I
still needed that little extra bit later
in the day so if you're a dry skin
person I think this could be perfect for
you if you're really really oily you may
still be able to use this in just a
lighter way maybe don't apply too much
in those areas that you get very oily
and be very conscious of the fact that
you'll want to reapply some powder or
whatever mattifying type product you
like to use this product is the powder
foundation it's called powder Tripp I
have it in pp3
okay so it's got this kind of you know
quilted looking packaging which i think
is adorable and it comes with a little
brush here I don't really like the brush
I just prefer a more full powder brand
then you've got your powder foundation
right over here so there's no mirror
here and to break this down in a
nutshell I don't feel like this is as
much coverage as most powder foundations
have I feel like it's more on the
coverage of just a typical pressed
powder and even then I don't feel like
the texture is really outstanding I mean
it feels nice it's not super flaky and
really really dry feeling but I still
don't really like it as much as say
L'Oreal True Match or the new Revlon
nearly naked powder it's just not quite
as creamy as feeling as those
and so it doesn't give a lot of coverage
so I'm thinking this isn't going to be
you know my powder foundation maybe this
will be just a powder I throw in my
purse but there's no mirror and we all
know compacts are great to have in your
purse because they have that mirror that
you can use for touch-ups so this is
just kind of like not the greatest
powder in my opinion and then you don't
get that mirror so even as a sheer
powder it's not quite as functional for
you that way positive point about the
packaging I love the white paired with
sort of this rose gold look I think that
is a really cute detail that you're
going to see in some of the different
products as far as this goes I mean I
used it in this look to set my
foundation stick it works okay in that
sense but it's not amazing for oil
control it's not amazing for coverage
next we have the Ready Set glow blush
bronzer duo so this is a cool little
thing it's that in shimmering goddess is
the shade I have but I must say it does
not have shimmer
I hate when names mislead you like that
and you think oh is it going to be
sparkly nope it's not it has again like
many of the compacts have this magnetic
sort of closure really feels nice I mean
I think this is really cutely designed
packaging but as you can see here on two
very deep shades you've got a pretty
deep bronzer here with no shimmer and
also a matte blush in sort of this kind
of deep raspberry color I really got
this because AI thought the bronzer
looked matte through the packaging and I
knew I wanted a matte bronzer and they
just seemed so bold I just wanted to see
what they were made of you know and they
really are intense you've got to be
careful when you use these use a light
hand don't load up the brush too much
definitely tap off the excess I used
first off the bronzer it's kind of a
contouring product so I use that under
the cheekbones contoured the forehead a
bit I found it to be blendable even as
dark as it was and my skin is not
exactly deep right now or even tan this
time of year so I found that to be still
very easy to blend but again don't get
too much on your brush the blush is has
the potential to be so intense it
reminds me of the sleek blush that I got
for Christmas this year in the fact that
you
you know it just takes a tiny bit find
that it's a gorgeous color and even if
you're a skin tone like me kind of light
skin tone this can really be blended out
and look gorgeous and they did have some
other shades I think there may have been
four on different combos one had like a
lighter pink blush maybe something more
peachy I'm not sure that all the
bronzers were entirely matte so that's
something you need to kind of look
closely at in the store but I really
like this one again it's called
shimmering goddess no shimmer but really
a great blush bronzer duo there next we
have the eye shadow quad and it's called
shadow play and my shade is in foxy
Brown's I think they had just four
different options at the store so this
is the only one of the shadow quads that
I had it consists of some neutral shades
that I typically would gravitate toward
anyway it's got kind of a light pink as
a highlight a really nice deep bronze a
sort of taupe silver shimmery gray and
then a great matte dark brown so in
terms of the configuration you know the
way these are put together the choice
that was made to put you know matte
brown with a couple of shimmery shades a
nice light highlight is very user
friendly these can be used together to
create either a deep dark look or a
totally you know kind of
middle-of-the-road everyday look like I
did today you're wise with these shadows
and keep in mind I've only tried one
quad and I think they had some more
colorful ones available but it reminds
me it's probably the closest thing in
the drugstore that I've found to the
quality of the wet and wild eyeshadows
which you know I love one thing I
noticed was that this bronze in
particular was kind of flaky you know
sometimes you put your brush in kind of
reminded me of the lorac eyeshadows in
the fact that you put your brush in in
it and it just kind of got a little bit
loose on you there something that can
definitely be dealt with you can tap
your brush off you can be a little more
careful but I didn't notice that as much
with the other um three shades here felt
like the color was pretty full on color
you know I didn't feel like it was
lacking or feeling like gosh I wish I
could I do I need to work harder to make
that show up they worked really well the
texture of this matte shade is really
nice
when I say a shadows creamy when you put
your finger in it and it's like oh it
doesn't feel dry flaky you know it feels
almost has a softness to it and that
Brown I just think is a wonderful kind
of cool dark brown to half way I use
this today for just an everyday look I
took the dark bronze kind of went all
over the lid with that and I also
blended out my crease somewhat with that
as well used a little bit of the light
pink as and under the brow highlight and
an inner corner highlight I think it
works great for that and use some of the
dark brown just to deepen up my outer
corner a little bit I also used it as
sort of a smudgy liner under the lower
lash line super easy to do they went in
and use my own just black eyeliner on my
upper lash line because I haven't tried
an eyeliner from this line yet it does
come with a sponge tip applicator one
side is a little more pointy one is more
traditional I think that I got was this
lash knockout volumizing mascara got a
kind of thick brush it reminds me a lot
of my Malley volumizing mascara brush
and for that matter the formula does too
it's not maybe quite it's lengthening as
that one is but I still felt like it
really thickened up the lashes it did
not clump much at all and wearing it
throughout the day you know and didn't
really have any issues with flaking off
onto my cheek or anything like that and
what I think is really nice about it is
it keeps the lashes feeling like
eyelashes having that sort of flexible
feel they don't feel super hard and
brittle a couple of different lip
products from the line one is a lip
butter and sheer Snapdragon and that's
what I'm wearing now and I gotta say I
don't feel like this is sheer at all the
packaging is a little bit bulky and I
did struggle a bit because you couldn't
open these in the store of course um and
also you've got this tinted cap that you
know you assume okay it's probably going
to be kind of like that shade but you
can't really tell when the cap is tinted
like I only do like the shade it's kind
of like reddish with maybe a little bit
of an orange II twist a little bit of a
coral color I think it looks really
fresh and as you can see it look
almost like I've maybe applied a lip
gloss so it's very shiny very full-color
haven't had issues with it traveling
outside the lip line scent wise I don't
smell much at all and I don't smell much
off of any of these product other
lipstick I got which i think is even
better packaging really cute but you see
the actual lipstick shade right down
here so you know exactly what that
lipsticks gonna look like it looks just
like that so and it's just a little more
compact in general is the kiss stick
luxury lip color in petal kiss and I
think this is a gorgeous everyday shade
I could see this lip color looking good
on so many women so many people who are
maybe out in the working world and want
that lipstick that's not going to you
know scream across the room at someone
but it's going to at the same time kind
of enhance your skin tone and just bring
everything up a notch this is a super
duper wearable shape the other shade
there's no shimmer in it it doesn't have
quite the shine factor that the other
one has it's more like a typical
lipstick and that's the way it performs
I mean it is it has a good creaminess to
it is this makeup you know that higher
quality high-end makeup just given to us
at a drugstore price and I really feel
like for the most part I could see a lot
of this makeup is comparable to some
high-end brands that I've trashed here
your packaging is very cute but I feel
like the function of the products is
really good as well my definite
standouts are probably the foundation
stick I really liked as I said that dual
function of being a foundation and a
concealer and having good enough
coverage to cover up under eye circles
spots you name it really nice I think
that the pigmentation on these blushes
is pretty much unmatched from the
drugstore in my opinion I mean matte
full color I would love to try some
other shades of the blush bronzer duo
and I've got to give a high marks to the
eyeshadow as well I mean I feel like
texture wise these are probably some of
the best that are out there in the
drugstore they only had I think four
different quads though so there's not a
ton of selection out there right now
that could change in the future I guess
but
this is a great little neutral quad and
I think I'm going to get a lot of use
out of that in terms of the things I'm
kind of middle-of-the-road on but I
still really like the mascara I didn't
feel like it maybe gave me the amount of
volume and length that say Alma get up
and grow does but at the same time it
feels really nice on the lashes and I
think a lot of people would like this
for the fact that it's not it doesn't
get real clumpy yet it still does volume
eyes I also love the lip products but at
the same time how different are they
from the other offerings in the
drugstore how does this lip butter
compared to the Revlon lip butter it's
like it gives full on color like the
Revlon ones do it might feel just a
little bit thicker on the lips a little
bit heavier not sticky heavy but just a
little bit more of a you feel it a
little more on your lips so and the
packaging is kind of bulky this lipstick
i think is great staying power is nice
with it it's not as glossy as the other
one the color is not outstandingly
unique but at the same time that's what
makes it special because it is that kind
of wearable pink that i think is really
really going to work for a lot of piece
and the product that I really kind of
didn't like is the powder foundation
just because I didn't feel like it was
truly a powder foundation if the
coverage was a little too sheer and then
if you want to use it as a travel powder
compact you don't have that mirror if
you have any questions let me know I'll
probably be trying some more things and
as I do you'll probably hear about them
in future videos and always check my
blog that's beauty broadcast net because
I put a lot of individual product
reviews on there as well so thanks again
guys have a great day and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
