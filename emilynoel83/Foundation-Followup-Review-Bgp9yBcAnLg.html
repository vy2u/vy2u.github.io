follow-up video in a hole not too long
ago I talked about several new
foundations that I'm trying and ever
since I've been getting questions about
how I ended up liking this one or that
one so this is just gonna be a whole
wrap-up of what I ended up thinking
about those different foundations so the
ones I'm going to be talking about our
Rimmel clean finish that's a new one
Rimmel match perfection maybelline fit
me and also from Lancome the tante it
all foundation so a high-end one in
there and I don't know if I pronounced
that right that's the way somebody else
told me to pronounce it so that's what
I'm gonna go with for now first one I'm
going to talk about is Rimmel clean
finish foundation and this says look
100% poreless vitamins A and E it claims
to be lightweight for a clean fresh
finish fragrance free dermatologist
tested so this really claims to give you
that flawless complexion and be somewhat
good for your skin so what's interesting
about this packaging wise it is in this
kind of glass jar but when you take the
cap off you have this little spatula
which I actually like and I wish came
with more foundations that didn't have
the pump you know because you can take
this out you can get it off off of there
with your finger and then you know blend
it in all around your face now let me
talk about blending that was sort of the
problem I had with this I felt like it
didn't blend all that easily like if you
want if you're the type that likes to
kind of dot your foundation all over
your face and then go blend those places
out you might not be able to do that
with this foundation I really had to go
section by section like get it on my
forehead blend all that in cheek chin
nose and my other side as well some
things I can think of that might make
that a little easier would be to use a
damp sponge when you put this on and
that sometimes helps me with my Revlon
Colorstay in terms of just the finish
and the coverage and how well it lasted
I felt like it had pretty good coverage
maybe not as good as a Revlon Colorstay
foundation but pretty good didn't feel
like I was a greaseball by the end of
the day I really felt
the staying power was pretty good I tend
to see a little bit of oil by the end of
the day around my nose with most
products I try so I still had a little
bit of that but as a whole I was pretty
impressed for less than four dollars for
how well this came off on my face just
be aware it's not super easy to blend
it's not going to be one of those you
get it on your face and oh it's so silky
and it just blends so easily you've got
to use a little bit of patience I guess
to get used to using that product the
other new foundation you've probably
seen that's new from Rimmel is the match
perfection foundation and this says it
has smart toned technology and it's SPF
15 and it says mimics skin's texture and
tone for a match that blends and covers
easily I felt like the shade I wound up
with here was just a little bit dark for
my skin tone
I'm not holding the foundation
responsible for that that was my own I
guess decision making there but this is
a glass jar but it does not have the
little spatula so wonder why they
decided to give it to that one and not
this one this did spread on a little
more easily it reminded me somewhat as I
put it on of the lasting finish only
maybe just a little thinner
I think Rimmel lasting finish one of the
real benefits to that foundation why
I've liked it so much over time is that
it manages to be long wearing and be
good coverage but it's very easy to
blend still this didn't have quite the
coverage of lasting finish but it was it
gives you a good natural wheel applied
this with my fingers I've used a
stippling brush it went on beautifully
with a stippling brush it's definitely
the big difference I noticed between
these two are the way they blend out the
bottom line for both of these Rimmel
ones I don't think they have beat Rimmel
lasting finish in my book but they're
not bad and I mean they do offer you
something different if you're looking
for a little bit lighter coverage and a
really smooth blend go for match
perfection if you're looking for
something that is going to be pretty
good for oily skin but you might have a
little challenge blending it in maybe
shoot for the clean finish the other big
drugstore one that a lot of people have
been wondering
about right now is the Maybelline fit me
foundation and the packaging looks like
this another glass jar foundation twist
off top and no little spatula inside now
I'm like hoping that's there for
different products that I try but little
I guess description of this one on the
bottle matches natural tone blends
seamlessly
let's skin breathe and the overall idea
with this line is that you buy the
foundation it's got a certain number
that corresponds with a powder a
concealer you can figure out your blush
and your bronzer I guess this is
probably a little bit thinner than any
of the ones I've mentioned so it's most
similar to the the match perfection but
maybe just a hair thinner than that I've
heard some complaints of people with
oily skin saying they just look like an
oil slick act at the end of the day with
fit me I have combination skin and I
didn't feel like it totally broke down
on me I really did like the way it
blended in but it did it definitely
didn't look as fresh by the end of the
day it may not have held up as well as
match perfection on me but it's just a
definitely like a light to medium
coverage foundation so if you got pretty
good skin and you've got skin that's not
too problematic where oil is concerned
you may enjoy this just for that light
layer of coverage but just don't over
apply it something that that you got to
worry about at times with foundation you
think oh it's not enough coverage I'll
just build it up even foundations that
appear to be like and then you build
them up if they're not gonna have that
good staying power with them it will
just break down over the over the course
of the day and you will just kind of
have a little bit of a mess on your
hands in terms of blotchiness that's
what I see when I see a foundation
breakdown I see the oil come out in
certain areas and then it doesn't appear
as even or smooth so that's something
you got to think about other end of the
spectrum
this one from Lancome is definitely full
coverage it claims to be like a 14-hour
foundation it says all skin types and it
does advise you to blend quickly on one
area the
the face at a time looks freshly applied
all day no fading no retouching so this
foundation is really nice because it's
got a lovely little pump applicator
obviously more expensive than those
drugstore options and I kind of wanted
to just see because I haven't tried a
lot of department store foundations but
there have been several of you that have
said this one is awesome and that's the
one I have on today and I feel like
finish wise it goes on really smoothly
this is serious coverage this is
coverage that is right up there with
Revlon Colorstay for me if not even a
little bit more matte coverage so
probably the most matte finish
foundation I've tried it did blend and
smoothly I felt like even though I went
as advised portion by portion of the
face but it still had almost a silky
feel as I put it on so that's kind of an
accomplishment to be that good coverage
but also be blend okay like this does
last well all day I wore it to a special
event the other night and it held up
beautifully
so I think this is probably the best
high-end foundation I've tried so far
because it gives the coverage it gives
the staying power and those are a couple
of the things that I look for as well as
ease and application with a foundation
so I hope that gives you kind of a heads
up on what I'm thinking about some new
foundations that I've tried lately I
know I referenced Colorstay and Rimmel
lasting finish because those are a
couple of my ultimate favorites I think
they are great values would I go back
and repurchase this again is this
ultimately better than Rimmel lasting
finish I don't know I think we're more
lasting finish is going to be my
favorite because I think the price is so
much better but this is good for a high
end foundation if that's what you're
looking for if maybe you've had a
reaction to Rimmel or you felt like the
shade selection wasn't there you're
gonna have a better shade selection with
match perfection than you are with any
of their other foundations so I hope
this helps you out guys as you're kind
of scouring the drugstore or the
department store for a foundation have a
great day and I'll have more video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
