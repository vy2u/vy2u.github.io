today video is going to be focused on
the face it's been a while since I've
done a video on sort of a face
foundation routine type thing but I've
kind of fallen into a routine that I'm
really enjoying and it's one that gives
both a glowy look to the skin but also
coverage and I think I did a video kind
of on this topic a couple years back but
I definitely thought it would be worth
updating a lot of the things I'm using
in this video are new ish type products
just a great summery look it's got SPF
50 in it so I am using one of my it
cosmetics products that has that and
it's really long wearing as well I've
had great luck with the staying power
and that's a very tricky thing but I
really feel like this look maintains
this happy level of glow throughout the
whole day for me so I'm really happy
with it and I hope you like it too
so my overall foundation type product
for this look is actually a CC cream
it's the it cosmetics CC plus SPF 50
illumination and I do have a full review
that I just posted a couple days ago on
the Express channel on this but I am
really really enjoying this it really
seems to have the coverage of the
regular CC cream but it just has that
little extra glow and a lot of times I'm
not even a huge fan of that much like
all over glow and a foundation II
product but it really seems to work with
this because it still has the coverage
so I use a full pump of that and I just
start out spreading that all over the
face just kind of roughly with my
fingers pretty much the way I start
every foundation type step in my videos
then I'm using this double ended it
cosmetics brush that came with a today's
special value that I got not too long
ago on QVC it's got this really nice
full side and then a side that works
great for concealers so I like to use
the fuller side to just kind of start
buffing this product in dab over areas
that you want to you know keep a little
more coverage but I love how this
product which I'm wearing in shade
medium it's able to even out my skin
tone so much but just provide a lot of
radiance to without making it look too
disco ball
I do like to add in a little bit of
concealer but I don't want this look to
become too heavy I want it to still feel
fairly light on the face so I'm using
kind of a lightweight concealer here and
it's the maybelline superstay better
skin and I have this in the shade
light/medium I'm just going to dab this
around the under eye area let's give it
the old a Bru there and a little bit
around the nose where I've got a little
redness and then I'm actually just using
the full side of this brush to tap over
that it's amazing how much coverage this
will keep in your concealer product when
you use this big side but then
ultimately the little side right in here
it's providing a little brightness
around the eyes where we're kind of
tired when we wake up in the morning
then I want to lightly set that area I'm
using my ELF contour palette and I'm
using this shade right here which is a
matte kind of a yellowy tone powder
really tapping off the excess because
it's easy to pick up a lot with that and
I'm just gonna dab that right where I
put the concealer
because while I want the skin overall to
look kind of radiant and glowy I don't
really need the under eye to look glowy
I just want that to look you know very
even and smooth now I don't think the it
cosmetics CC requires a lot of setting
powder in fact I don't want to use too
much because I don't want to take away
the glow that I've got going on but I do
want just a little bit of powder on here
I think it does help the staying power a
lot and a couple that I like to use are
the it cosmetics celebration
illumination foundation not in a real
foundation type sense but just a light
dusting of that or today I'm going to
use my NYC smooth skin BB radiance
powder and this I have in the shade
naturally beige so just get a little I
like to use these powders that really
aren't going to be super mattifying I'm
really just using this to set the look
using hardly any powder next I want to
do a little bit of bronzing but I'm
using more of a glowy type bronzer this
is my Too Faced sun bunny and I'm just
gonna use a mix of both sides as you can
see it's a two tone bronzer again using
my ELF complexion brush I'm just gonna
take this up around the hairline you can
see it instantly really bronze this up
the forehead area here I just really
think this bronzer looks very natural
and summery you can go overboard with it
of course and because this does have
glow and you're putting glowy on top of
glowy I could see that being a bit much
at times but I'm just keeping it like
I'm thinking about putting this product
really where the Sun would naturally hit
all those kind of interesting to have to
go okay in the hollows of the cheek as
well and I'm also gonna go down the neck
and chest area this bronzer it looks
really pretty there then for a little
more definition I'm going back to my elf
contour palette and I am gonna use this
cool tone contour shade and an angled
brush I'm just gonna apply this right
here to the hollows of the cheeks this
really provides some nice contrast on
the face because everything's so dewy
and glowy and here you know we're
working with the shadows still and then
finally I'm using a really pretty blush
that I've been loving for
look I've been kind of going back and
forth between a couple one is the
two-faced pink leopard which is a very
bronzy pink blush I'm also loving this
color pop blush in birthday suit this is
one of those super shock cheek colors
it's a satin finish so it's not
incredibly shimmery but it does have
just a little bit of glow to it I like
to use my ELF small stipple brush and
kind of load it up with this and then
just very lightly swirl this on the
outer part of the apple of my cheek see
that very soft amount of color but I
feel like it totally works and most of
the glow that you're seeing right here
on the cheek that is still this CC
product so this little bit of cheek
color is just kind of like icing on the
cake but it's not adding a lot more glow
but I love kind of getting in a groove
where you know you've got this sort of
cocktail of face products that work
really well together and then that blush
is kind of the accessory item that you
can always switch out and change up
maybe depending on what kind of lip
color you're wearing or what your eye
looks like then I'm just gonna take a
little bit of my Mac prep and prime this
is the Rose fix+ and just give a couple
spritzes of that lightly over the look
and that's it and I really really enjoy
how we've got coverage on the skin we've
got a really radiant looking glow but I
can also look up really close at my skin
and not feel like like scared to look up
close because there's all this glow
happening because sometimes that's what
glowy foundation you type products can
do but I think it's about using that
product pairing it with a little
concealer pairing it with powder in the
right places and the right kinds of
powders and just knowing where to place
the glow on your skin you know we went
with Loi bronzer up in here but we put
contour here we put matte powder on the
under eye area so that is my full
coverage yet glowy face routine I hope
this was useful to you guys it's kind of
funny how I've labelled this as a glowy
look but I didn't really even pull in a
highlighter because at the end of it
I really don't feel the need there's so
much glow that comes through from this
product you know that first product that
went on the skin but as far as what else
I happen to be wearing today I actually
pulled out a palette that's been sitting
unused for too long my naked too so I
used some of the sort of plummy smoky
shades in this palette right here
actually I used this new smudge pot from
Elle fun this is a cream shadow the
shade is called why not and that just
made the perfect base I thought for
those shades and then on my lips I
really wanted them to be kind of glowy
bronzy really go along with the face
makeup so I used a combo of products I
use two of the elf matte lip colors
nearly nude I used in the center of my
lips and then I used praline which is
just a little deeper neutral on the
outside and I used my pal Perfector this
is an awesome like really reflective
gloss and I use that on the center at
the lower lip I'm also playing with a
little bit different hairstyle at this
little top not half-up half-down thang
so thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
