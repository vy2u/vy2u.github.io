day so far on this video is going to
show you how to use that brush i
reviewed not too long ago this
foundation brush from coastal since i
posted the review and many of us to see
it in action you know in a tutorial and
I thought well duh you know why didn't I
think of it the first time I made the
video but anyway this is the brush if
you haven't seen the review I will have
a link to that and kind of vice versa so
you can get to both of these videos but
this is like a foundation brush that is
not your typical flat foundation brush
it's a little bit fluffy it's got its
tapered you know has a nice tapered tip
there and is tapered up on the sides as
well it's very nice to use to just kind
of blend the foundation as you go my
technique is sort of to spread the
foundation on and then buff it out with
this so this video is just going to take
you through that real quickly I hope
it's somewhat informative for you and
this is a brush that I use from liquid
foundation you could use this with
powder products but I like using it with
liquids it has an interesting effect on
it that's different from a stippling
brush or like I said a typical
foundation brush so if you want to see
how it all comes together keep online
it's all I have on my skin right now is
some moisturizer and my Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer so now i'm just
going to use my Revlon Photoready
foundation you can use any foundation
you want with this obviously it's a
tutorial using liquid though so I'm just
going to pump out a little bit of that
and before I actually reach for my brush
at all I'm going to just kind of smooth
this around on my skin here so just kind
of like I'm not really blending it in
but I'm just getting it on there and
then I'm going to take my brush at that
point and I kind of do sections of my
face and at that point I'm just taking
it with this brush and sort of blending
it in around those key places like the
hairline around your eyebrows is a very
important place so it's just really
functioning to buff that in and you can
see it's not like a stippling brush this
is actually kind of serving to just
blend that right into
you you know all your little areas all
your corners are your face so there we
have it now on the forehead and so now
I'm going to just put some more
foundation on like say this whole side
of my face here just a little warm and
so just kind of smooth it on in kind of
a rough fashion and then use the brush
to just really it's great for getting
around the eyes too because it's just
small enough that was the sort of the
challenge I would have sometimes with a
stippling brush is that you know you
can't quite get get right in there so I
was smoothing it around the jawline is
very important so you want to really
blend it down off of your jaw not just
not just staying with this kind of
emotion but really making sure you've
blended it out so there's no like line
or anything I kind of just go right over
my my lips there it's not really going
to hurt anything so nose is another
important area where we all need some
coverage so just get a little on the
nose you see kind of what pattern this
is following so I'm just kind of going
but going over my face and sections
because as you can see you take a little
time to actually get it get it all
blended in so I wouldn't really want the
makeup just sitting there in kind of a
blotchy way in and you know it may get a
little bit dry and less easy to blend
this foundation is really easiest to
blend when you just put it on so then
the last part of the face here get a
smattering of that on there don't you
love that word and just blend and like I
said this this is a method that can work
for any liquid foundation you got our
coverage all over our face and this is
just so nice if you wanted a little bit
of extra you know foundation under the
eye area that you can just really buff
it in and not have a real appearance
that you know you've got a lot of heavy
coverage on but it's very blended out
very nice for just blending all over the
rest
your face and if you wanted to put some
concealer what my next step would be
would be to put some concealer around my
eye area and then I may just take this
brush once I get it on there and just
use it as sort of a blending to you have
it guys that's the easy application with
the Coastal Scents black synthetic
foundation brush this is very easy to
use you'll notice working in sections is
really helpful to just kind of blend as
you go if you have any more questions
please let me know and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
