hour or day whenever you're watching
this it's night for us right now
it's a rare video does it's dusk
specifically and so we had to mess
around with our lighting and because
Tyler's in the shot I'm like up forward
looking big and Tyler's like back here
looking back found similar than usual
but anyways we wanted to do the freaky
facts tag freaks we're freaks so honors
question what's a nickname only your
family calls you Tyler bub I call him
bub uh he calls me chief which modified
into many different nicknames done we
don't even have time and then my family
like my sister calls me poof and my dad
calls me bring dog which there is a
story behind that
it's a weird habit of yours I'm thinking
I will just see him like he'll be on the
couch like on his laptop and he's got
the you could tell he's really
concentrating cuz he's very focused on
it but I'm like put your tongue back in
this is just like I think kind of my
weird to have it is I'm always like if
I'm just sitting doing something or
reading something like I'm always with
my tongue I've met her a love my teeth
like in feeling if there's food caught
in my teeth or something like that
I've been dislodging it with my tongue
you have any weird phobias I would say
height Heights and confined spaces but
on the queerest that's pretty normal I
used to kind of have as a little kid the
typical afraid of the dark kind of thing
I wanted the light on I'm not sure what
my weird phobia is right now mmm what's
the song you secretly love to blast and
belt out when you're alone really belt
out what do you okay is there like a
genre of music like you sing
music babies working our country 80s our
country um pretty broad for me it used
to be like when I was a little kid pup
would instigate a lot of singing for me
and she got me singing the star-spangled
banner then I would do that all the time
now I mean I don't know Tyler's usually
here I feel like so I'm usually hears if
I'm singing along to like songs on my
eyeballs one of your biggest pet peeves
these pet peeves mine a longtime pet
peeve of mine has been when people make
that smacking noise as they eat like
like you can hear the saliva and the
food and usually it's a result of people
chewing with their mouths open mine is
the use of the word literally
incorrectly oh my gosh
examples please literally I'm about to
die what's one of your nervous habits
touch my face you touch your face I
think I I tend to pick at my nails side
of the bed do you sleep on if we're
facing the bed facing the bed I slipped
on the right side that means I sleep on
the left side and then when she leaves
to go to work I sleep on the entire bed
the other day yeah cuz I leave I get up
for work at 1:30 in the morning so I
like the other day when I left Tyler was
in a perfect straight diagonal across
the entire bed what was your first
stuffed animal and what is its name what
was it really probably the one of the
first things I ever had was a blanket
and it was kind of a it became a very
ratty looking kid and I called
it it was it was Safi and I slept with
it every night and I just it ended up
getting to where like it had fallen
apart and it was kind of knotted
together I mean but I loved how about
you have no idea you weren't a big
stuffed animal kid I had so much can't
remember their name what's the drink you
always order at Starbucks if I were to
go I mean the thing that I have enjoyed
the most from there
is that the one thing that comes out
around this time of year which is the
pumpkin spice latte it's very yummy and
then Tyler usually he doesn't go to
Starbucks really know everyone says no
but you do get a coffee drink oh my god
yeah McDonald's I'll get the sugar-free
vanilla iced latte sometimes skim it
just depends I can hear this now gone if
you're there then I order it and I get
four skin with skin for you just for
ease just letting go it's a beauty rule
you preach but never actually in fact
Tyler it's always preaching beauty rules
reaching beauty and I don't follow any
of it
here for you you're a beauty no I mean
Tyler it's going to sleep in my makeup
but I always tell people not to he's
good about washing his face before he
goes to bed I mean skincare I guess
stuff like that he's pretty good about
um I guess you're more opinionated on
fashion stuff do you follow
I'm not a big like make up rules person
I don't feel like I am always like
setting forth never do this always do
that but I think something I've talked
about before it's like combing through
your through your eyelashes after you
put on mascara and a lot of times like I
might just put on false eyelashes and
not even do that step so yeah I don't
always do that which way do you face in
the shower uh most of the time I guess I
face with the shower like towards
pointing towards the back of my head you
know
yeah pretty much good in there
face towards a shower get my hair wet
get everything wet and then I turned my
back and let's get the body
and uh put my pajamas on and then turn
back towards the shower wash all that
off everybody's loving the visual
they're getting turn my back in and once
again you're very methodical have any
weird body skills weird body skills um I
can do one-armed push-ups
actually haven't done one in a while so
I may need to reconfirm that I have kind
of a weird I have one of those thumbs
that bends way back there I can raise my
eyebrow it's got this thing in my elbow
more like the chip like the typical oh
oh he had me touched that one said I
won't touch it and you touch it you can
actually feel the hole actually find the
piece of bone what's your favorite
comfort food that is bad what you'd love
to eat it anyway I'm gonna go with fried
food general fried food like mozzarella
sticks or fried mushrooms onion rings
there's a sandwich at Denny's that we
had last weekend a bunch of us went to
Vinnie's late and they are grilled
cheese sandwiches with mozzarella sticks
in the sandwich I mean come on I had
half fried ice cream you love what's a
phrase or exclamation you always say I
say yay just like that all the time
about a lot of things that's it biscuits
biscuits word more like just Oh biscuit
usually I'll say like Oh biscuits time
to sleep what are you actually wearing
Tyler boxers and maybe socks don't know
how you sleep it sucks just do the same
thing you normally do for the socks
under
it's gotta have my feet usually I'm like
poking my feet out of the sheets cuz
they're hot and I don't like I wear a
tank top tank and underwear what did you
used to wear that you thought was cool
but now you realize it wasn't wasn't
that hot I know I don't know that I
thought it was cool but more functional
I was wore a white t-shirt under pretty
much everything polo shirts dress shirt
no it's just white poking out everything
I remember that um for me gosh I can
think back like throughout grade school
about some really like like stirrup
pants and lots of weird stuff and I
overall to bit over all this we're done
that's it those are our freaky facts
y'all enjoy hope you're freaked out now
