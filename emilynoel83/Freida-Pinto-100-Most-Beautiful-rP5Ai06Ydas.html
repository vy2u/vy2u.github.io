tuning in for this video I'm so excited
to share with you my interpretation of
freida Pinto look she was on the People
Magazine's 100 most beautiful list as
you know I'm doing this series where
I've covered numerous different
celebrities and their makeup looks and
this one is yeah Frieda Pinto the star
of one of the stars on Slumdog
Millionaire the Academy Award winning
film and it is such a great movie she
was absolutely gorgeous in it and no
exception with this picture I think she
just is very very beautiful and I've
tried to kind of imitate the eye look
that they gave her kind of using some
smoky tones but not in a very obvious
fashion so I think you'll enjoy this
look if you're looking for something
that's absolutely wearable for work play
or wherever so if you want to see how I
pulled off this look from start to
finish I just wanted to bring you up to
speed on what I've done with my face
already
I've moisturized apply some applied my
photo finish primer from Smashbox and
then I put some use my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick just to kind of go
around my eye and just wipe out any
discoloration in that area and then I
used my sterling minerals foundation in
Hannah this is the velvet formula it's
really really nice coverage am i blogged
about this a while back but I really
like to use this just for that ultra
flawless look that is matte and just
very you know flawless so anyway after
that we're going to do some bronzing
here and I'm gonna use my wet and wild
bonds or bronzer in Bali bronze looks
like that it's kind of deep and it does
have some shimmer to it and I'm just
gonna grab a fluffy fluffy powder brush
this one's from Coastal Scents and just
apply that kind of along my hairline
just like so we're kind of just trying
to mimic you know where the Sun would
naturally hit us so and we're also just
trying to deepen our complexion as a
whole it's nice because we've got that
nice matte foundation but now we're able
to add with
shimmer on top and not look you know too
over-the-top shiny by any means next I'm
gonna grab my ELF contouring blush and
bronzing powder and this bronzing powder
makes a great great contour shade so I'm
just gonna suck in my cheeks a little
bit and just kind of apply that I like
to go this way and then to just really
blend it out kind of do circular motions
up next I am going to use that pretty
pretty peach blush that's a little
shimmer just on kind of the apples of my
cheeks here and then something I noticed
especially by looking at the picture in
the magazine
freida really has a pretty plum tone to
her blush as well and it's sort of you
know it's not like a real August like
right here on her cheek it's kind of
like almost worked into a contour shade
so I'm using my ELF natural radiance
blush and flushed and it's one of the
prettiest most pigmented plums that I've
found and so I'm just going to apply
that kind of right in here
just to give us some really nice kind of
different color to our cheeks
and lastly we really want to mimic that
gorgeous glow she's got from the
magazine and it's kind of like you know
she's working with obviously some
awesome lighting and photographers and
whatnot but you can really give yourself
that well lit and well lit look just
through your makeup just by kind of
highlighting the center of your face so
I'm gonna use my Physicians Formula
shimmer strips in Waikiki's strip this
is the peachy glow Boram bronzer that
they have and I'm gonna be using like
the top portion of this and just
applying that right there on the top of
my cheekbones and kind of right on top
of my cheek and then a really light
dusting really be careful to not overdo
this on your nose because that's an area
we can all get shine in very easily
anyway so just a light dusting down the
nose and right in the middle of the
forehead it's gonna really give you that
look like you know just you're that
glowing look because that's right there
in the center of your face so that's
really what you want to highlight it
will help in the long run bring
attention to our eyes as well so let me
get started on the eye look I first used
my ELF mineral eyeshadow primer on my
lid and so just to give me a nice smooth
surface and something for the shadow to
cling to then I'm gonna take my
covergirl quad in country woods just a
nice variation of some matte and
shimmery cream and brown tones and I'm
going to take this shade right here this
one kind of with the shimmer and just
use this the applicator eye means that
can sometimes be the best way just to
pack the color on and I'm just going to
apply that all over my lid
just like so and she also has kind of
some shimmer right here on the inner
portion like yeah right in that area so
go ahead and use that color right in
there as well then with a crease brush
I'm going to take this deepest shade in
the quad right here it's kind of a matte
medium brown and just apply that right
here in the crease just overall deepen
that up a bit don't go up very far on
your brow bone at all with this just
keep it right in the crease
okay
all righty next we're going to go to a
different palette I'm gonna go to my um
this is a palette I made with my Coastal
Scents hot pots and I'm gonna be using
this shade right here this is I will put
the exact number of the Coastal Scents
shade in the sidebar but this is known
to be kind of a dupe for satin taupe
from Mac and so that's gonna be sort of
another crease shade we're gonna use
with my fine crease brush if I can clear
off my area here a little bit with my
fine crease brush I'm gonna take that
color and just apply that to my crease
but again I've noticed with her look she
has some concentrated color kind of in
the inner corner in here actually and it
goes to the outer but it doesn't go up
too high it doesn't it's not like that's
stretching swooping you know outer vite
kind of thing so just get that kind of
just think about it like smudging it
right there into your crease just to
deepen that and then we also want to
overall deepen the outer portion of our
lid so if you have any kind of small
brush or applicator I'm going to use my
little Cornell 1/4 brush and I'm going
to be using my matte black shade that I
have here Mac carbon of course could
work or any black shade that you have
and just get some of that on your brush
and just use that to deepen up the outer
part of the eyelid
and while it's hard to see exactly what
you know her eyeshadow is doing as a
whole you kinda have to look at it
head-on because she's not doing you in
one of these where you can see exactly
what's going on so but I can sense that
there are probably some plumb kind of
tones to her eyes just like there were
on her cheeks so I'm gonna use this
shape of my Coastal Scents palette and
this reminds me a little bit of Mac's
sketch so it's kind of like a deep sort
of purpley tone just with it's just very
deep kind of some shimmer and maybe a
little bit of brown in there as well and
I'm just gonna go over the entire crease
just kind of with a very small amount of
that on my brush I'm just using that to
blend out the crease a little bit and
finally for a highlight shade just
really lightly I'm going to go back to
the country woods palette using the same
shade that we put all over our lid at
first and just lightly dust that up here
to the brow bone for our eyeliner I'm
going to be using a pencil liner it
seems like she doesn't have too much of
a like super defined line so I'm going
to use this basically to go from inner
to outer corner on top and a little bit
of the way in on the bottom and then
we're going to top it off with some of
the shadows we've been using so it helps
me what I'm doing my liner to kind of
look down into a mirror so that's what
I'm doing here and I'm also wanting to
make sure that I go all the way in
because I can tell that she's done that
and I'm just keeping it pretty close to
the lash line I don't I don't remember
if I mentioned I'm using my Maybelline
define online eyeliner here in black
doesn't have to be a perfect line
because we are going to sort of smudge
that out a bit and on the outer corner
I'm not really gonna wing it out but I
am gonna extend it just a little bit
past my natural end to my eye and then
just bring it down make sure you connect
it at the outer corner and just bring it
down - yeah about half way in like that
then there's a handy this is though the
color is ebony black by the way and then
there's a little smudge tip at the end
of this so you can kind of take that and
just buff out the top lashline a little
bit it's like so then we're gonna top
that off we're gonna kind of set our
liner with some of the shades we've been
using I'm gonna use that matte black
shade just gonna grab my Coastal Scents
angled liner brush the taklon brush and
using that black shade just kind of go
over the top lashline with it
not really changing the appearance of it
much but just helping with the staying
power and then I'm gonna use that on the
outer here as well and then I also want
to use some of that satin taupe kind of
shade over that it's well and then
continue that shade in just a little bit
and then eventually we're going to fade
right back to the shade up from the
country woods palette that we started
out with on the lid kind of clean your
brush off a little bit get some of that
on there and use that nice light
shimmery step right there in the corner
next I am going to curl my lashes and
apply a coat of Maybelline colossal
mascara I'm just really liking this for
some reason when I use false lashes I
find it really is effective at blending
the real and the fake lashes once you
put them on so I'm gonna apply those and
then I will join you with the finished
look and also tell you what I'm using on
everyone I am back with the finished
freida Pinto inspired look as you can
see the eyes are fairly natural they
really follow the natural shape of your
eye in terms of the contouring we did
and that kind of thing and just using
some sort of deep somewhat smoky shades
topping it off with a little bit of a
very very subtle plum tone but it's
definitely a look you could wear for
every day the liner is kept pretty
natural too so for those of you who are
a fan of that you know this will work
well and we use some false lashes the
salon perfect number 53 s are a great
great everyday lash that you can put on
and get a little more thickness but not
you know go over the top with it so
obviously we did some contouring some
bronzing to really bring that you know
really toned look to our face and then
the plum tones in our cheeks are also in
our lips as well I would suggest using
any kind of berry lip gloss that you
have I use the lip licious lip color in
raspberry jam that's from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and then I kind of topped it off
with this liner it's the Jordana easy
liner in plush plum just really lightly
kind of blended it in with my finger
just to deepen the color a bit but
overall this look is totally wearable
for summer or really any time of the
year I hope you got some good tips on
maybe getting a look inspired by free to
Pinto and that is the keyword I'm not
claiming to look just like her but I am
using some of the techniques that are
apparent in some of the pictures I've
seen to sort of play off of her makeup
look so I hope you enjoyed it guys and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
