random video but everything is still
focused on beauty these are frequently
asked Beauty questions that I get
obviously if they're frequently asked I
get them a lot and I thought it would be
fun to just compile those into a video
these are things I get a lot whether
they be in emails private messages
tweets Facebook you name it you know
just things I see over and over I feel
like I've done these videos in the past
and you know solicited for questions
saying ask me something on Facebook ask
me something on Twitter I'll answer it
in a video and I think those are helpful
but here I just really wanted to focus
on those things that I truly do get a
lot some are questions about certain
things I do beauty wise others are just
kind of random advice type questions
also if you want true randomness check
out my vlog channel I did the 25 things
you don't know about me tag and you will
learn a lot about being thicker and the
non beauty related since I was inspired
to learn to do that after watching GI
Jane like I couldn't handle it this is
something I have never mentioned
anywhere well this is something I'm
really ashamed of Tyler's body is like a
space heater I mean I was with a bunch
of girls and we went and got tattoos
I don't know started piercing stuff I
hope you don't think I'm too weird after
you see that video starting off you're
one of the first things I want to touch
on is this guy right here
this little Bowl gets called out so
often what's in there what is or if you
know that these are yo s lip balms you
will ask what kinds I have and first off
the little dish is just a little plastic
dish I think it came from a dollar store
probably at some point and I just
thought what a fun way to display these
lip balms which are honestly kind of
hard to store in you know shallow
drawers and stuff like that so I'll go
through and tell you what I have in here
this is the lemon one that's one of my
favorites my other favorite the sweet
mint loved those too and by the way I
like to use these a lot as a base for a
lip product I don't like to use super e
super easy super slippery
slick ones where I feel like any
lipstick I put on top with slide right
off these are a little bit while I feel
like they're moisturizing I don't feel
like they are really really slick so
they make a great lip primer another one
I have here this is the tangerine I
think this is a medicated one I wasn't
such a big fan of that
I remember getting this pink one which
is the strawberry sorbet I think and
then this purple one is like a raspberry
or berry sorbet type thing these came in
a duo I remember and I think now the
strawberry is sold individually this is
a summer fruit the first one that I
remember getting that came out the
honeydew melon this is a really good one
- I love that scent and then um a while
back I got like a three pack at Target
and they were a Disney collection and
there's a vanilla and this kind of very
strawberry very types and I'm not
exactly sure and there's a blue one as
well which cupcake got a whole dozen
likes to chase around like a captain yes
these are all lip balms that's what they
look like and I like to keep them in
this little dish some people have also
asked if I've had a storage change up
here you might notice that these little
drawers don't have the same
embellishment let's say that I put on
these little pearls and the rhinestones
and stuff
I have switched some things around some
of my other containers that did have
that decoration or down lower now and I
just kind of swapped some things out and
rearranged a little bit I do a
collection video or something like that
soon or a new storage video probably
will I'm still fine-tuning a few things
but yeah I do need to find a cute way to
spruce up these other little containers
that don't have my nice little beads on
there paint color in the makeup room it
is Valspar very very paint it's satin
finish and I remember getting that from
Lowe's this one is what hair products do
you use and I'm gonna stick with
basically those things that are more of
a like shampoo conditioner daily use
things there are some products like
styling products I might switch off a
lot but as far as the things I use all
the time and with the shampoo and
conditioner there
been a little switch I've been using the
end route from the balm and as you can
see I'm almost out of these the shampoo
and the conditioner I used to give me
volume kind I've reviewed these on my
blog I feel like when my hair was being
really really dry these got my hair in
better condition I have long hair as you
can see is pretty long and it's fine
hair naturally straight hair and I felt
like this took dry ends and kind of
rejuvenated them a little bit so I've
really enjoyed these I must say however
they can be a little heavy and like I
said I got fine hand hair will start to
get oily or faster when I use they as a
whole I think these are like pretty high
quality hair products so as you can see
I'm kind of starting to run low on those
and so I started using another kind that
we had here around the house and it's
the suave professionals rosemary mint
it says salon proven to invigorate as
well as Aveda but I love these these
have actually been doing great for my
hair lately I've been using these over
the course of the past month a little
bit more and I haven't felt like they've
over dried I also don't feel like
they're getting me you know oily any
sooner than normal at my scalp so I love
these I also a must have for a deep
conditioner that I use about once a week
it's the N root conditioning treatment
mask from the bowl I'm experimented with
a lot of different deep conditioners
this one is definitely my favorite I
really notice a difference in the
softness of my hair and I feel like it
is something you can use maybe alongside
a less expensive shampoo and conditioner
and get a great result and keep your
hair you know not feeling dry another
thing I do and I forgot to bring it in
here but it's on the other side of the
house I think I mentioned it in a the
best in beauty video before my June one
what would that be May derp and it's the
got to be styling oil that stuff is
great
I used that like before I curl my hair
like for example before I curled the
ends here I put some of that oil on the
ends of my hair and I feel like maybe
that's played a role as
in my hair not feeling or appearing dry
at the end by the way does the girl on
here not kind of remind you of Leanne
from Leanne says I mean obviously Leanne
is even prettier but every time I did
conditionally and I think of you because
of this girl on the packaging naked and
nude palettes so many questions about
comparing one to the others which one do
I buy do I apply the lorac Pro or the
nakeds what about Stila in the life that
you've been talking about so I just
thought I would give you a little quick
comparison here naked palettes I love
them I think they're great great quality
palettes I mean you got your original
naked here everybody's familiar with
that pretty much a lot of neutrals a lot
of versatility in this palette as well
because you do have a great range of
lighter to medium shades or you can get
a bronzy golden look you can get into
the you know the berry almost plum type
look and then you've got some really
nice deep shades that almost border a
little bit on a blue tone so there's
more variety in The Naked one than the
naked 2 that's a big question I address
this in a video but I feel like Naked 2
while it's pretty I don't feel like I
can get as many different looks as the
naked one there's also like a massive
amount of light to medium shades in this
palette not that they're not gorgeous
great shades and then you've got BAM a
black I kind of wish there was a little
more middle ground The Naked original is
great about having a lot of those middle
ground shades that work great in the
crease you know great for a smoky eye or
something like that so in my opinion I
tend to go for this more than this but I
still think they're both nice palettes
to have then people will ask what about
naked palettes versus lorac Pro as a
whole I think if you want versatility
okay if you want the ability to get a
lot of different looks having all these
matte shades and all of these shimmery
shades and getting them in a variety of
tones you know you are going from
ultimate light to dark here and then
you're going from warm to cooler two
colors a little
I think this is probably the most
versatile if you want a ton of different
looks I would kind of steer you toward
lorac pro over the naked palettes just
because I think it's a little more
versatile a couple of other great
palettes that I have mentioned that I
love are the balls nude tude and Stila
in the light as far as these go I just
love the quality of the foams eyeshadows
and I have just really loved this
palette this stands up to the naked one
Naked 2 just as good you know just a
different configuration I think you kind
of got a look at it and think what kind
of colors do I want this gives you some
matte shades some super dark shades a
lot of mid-range with a little bit of a
warm brown a lot of highly highly
shimmery shades too so there's a great
range in this palette I love this one
steal it in the light what makes this
different for me when I'm thinking of a
warm I kind of a rose gold looking eye
this is what I go to this was demoed in
my Bridal favorites plus tutorial video
because this whole top row just seeing
it on camera like this is not doing it
justice but these shades are wonderful
together and that whole top row works
great then the bottom part you've got
some cooler shades some shapes it really
remind me of the naked I hope that gives
you a little idea of all those kind of
nude palettes you know what's what how
do you remove your makeup I used these
equate daily facial cloths on these I
get from Walmart and these are basically
the generic version of the ole a daily
facials cloths when did I talk about
these I've talked about these recently
but basically there are dry cloth and
when you get it wet it lathers up I use
it to remove everything I make up face
makeup it all goes down with this these
say for normal skin and I believe this
is the only variety sold from the equate
kind and if you want sensitive skin
specific kind for combo to oily and
normal to try aller splits them up that
way so there's little different textures
on the cloths but these work great for
me lower cost 66 and a box seat two
separate packs in here I love another
question here do you wear false lashes
every day well it might seem like I do
I really don't but I will say I wear
them often and I like experimenting with
and playing with false lashes just like
I like trying on new lipsticks and new
eyeshadows you know it's just another
element of makeup experimentation for me
and I love seeing you know sometimes
like you do a finished eyelook and then
you know how does the lash frame that
look and give it a different appearance
you know or glam it up some I love to
glam it up so I do love my falsies I
like using the Revlon precision lash
glue to apply them have you ever had
Botox no I have never had Botox or any
sort of beauty procedure or any surgery
of any kind quite frankly my eyebrows
are far too mobile for having Botox I
haven't even had a manicure or pedicure
in a salon folks this is DIY here
setting sprays lots of questions about
setting sprays I'm going to give you a
rundown of what I've tried and what I
think works best here as quickly as I
can
I've tried the model in a bottle makeup
setting spray matte finish does prolong
staying power some but really when it
comes right down to it reason why I want
to put a setting spray on is not just
for staying power but to also undo any
sort of powdery look and just really
make the look come off fresh and well
this will give me good staying power it
doesn't necessarily do much for taking
away a powdery look what's that I think
kind of do it all that I've been really
impressed with as far it's given me the
fresh look but also giving me good
staying power are the Urban Decay all
nighter and most recently this is
something just within the past week or
so I've been playing with it I got the
little size of the D slick and that is
specifically for oil control and this is
interesting because this will make me
look fresh
but yet it really seems to help the
makeup hang on so I like both the elf
mist and set with a low green tea
cucumber and vitamins A C and E and this
I don't really notice prolong staying
power when I use this but I do think
it's a great little refresher spray you
know spray and you could do that with
any of these but spray them on kind of
midday just to get your glow back so to
speak that's a good one also have mac
fix+ but I'm gonna be honest I haven't
used this recently enough to compare to
all those others so I'll have to get on
that and update if I notice any sort of
similarity to the others a lot of people
ask me where do you find wet and wild
products um for me it's sold it pretty
much all of my local drugstores I can
find it at Walmart I can find it at CVS
Walgreens I would say well greens for me
is what tends to have the best selection
they also sell the Fergie line at
Walgreens gonna be more likely that I
find a limited edition wet-and-wild
collection at CVS or Walgreens and I
don't have a Rite Aid near me but if you
have a Rite Aid I know a lot of people
say they find wet and wild there - what
is your hair color this is actually my
natural hair color right here I haven't
changed the color for probably over a
year and a half now um what I used to do
was I would get the Clairol natural
instincts which was a semi-permanent
hair color in a shade that's like pretty
much this this color maybe a hint darker
and I thought it was adding some
thickness to my hair by doing that but I
guess I kind of just got to the point
where I didn't want to mess with it
anymore and I'm happy with this color so
that's what we're going last one here
advice we're starting a blog this is
something that recently I've been
getting so much to the point where I
created a blog post with tips for
starting a blog so I will link to that
so you can check it out and I tried to
focus on things to do before you even
start your blog like how to kind of go
through the brainstorming session and
and things to be aware of before you get
going some tips for writing PO
and some tips for like spreading the
word and trying to just you know get
your blog out there to the masses
basically so I covered all that and I
hope it's really helpful to those of you
who are thinking about starting a blog I
think that's really exciting and I
noticed a lot of people comments it as
well some bloggers with their tips which
is great so hopefully that clears some
things up those are the questions I get
a lot whether it is here on YouTube or
other forms of social media so thank you
so much for taking time to watch thank
you for asking me those questions and I
love you guys I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
