this video I'm just going to be passing
along a little concealer trick that may
help you if you are really struggling
with finding something that's full
coverage or the under eye area in the
more early morning hours I often
struggle with really getting this area
fully concealed to where you know even
if my lighting is not so good if I'm in
an area where you know there's shadows
and stuff like that I still don't look
like I have under-eye circles that's my
always my ultimate goal and I found this
trick I didn't come up with it myself I
actually found it online one of the QVC
hosts lisa robertson she's really
beautiful and she has a little thing
online on I think the QVC YouTube
channel where she was sharing some of
her beauty tips as she mentioned you
know using a regular concealer on her
under-eye area and then topping it off
with a prop with a product from bare
minerals known as summer bisque and this
is kind of like a full coverage product
from that line that can act as a
concealer on its own but if you pair
this with a creamy product and you top
it off with this it works really well I
don't notice get like get increasing
throughout the day or I don't notice
problems with the way this little duo
wears throughout the day and I have
pulled this off with a lot of different
concealers I have used my ELF complete
coverage concealer which is in my eyes
not such a great concealer but yet
paired with this it steps it up so think
about you know concealers things that
you have in your collection that are not
your favorites right now that aren't
working that well if you top it off with
the summer bisque which is again a loose
powder product you can just tap it off
into the lid and use you know somewhat
of like a medium sized brush with this
even like if you've got an an eye brush
that's maybe a little larger than you
like to use on your eye area and you can
use it to Pat it in there a concealer
brush can work as well but I've used it
with products I don't love so much and
products that I do love like benefit
erase paste or in this demonstration I'm
going to show you I use it with my
Revlon Photoready concealer so take alot
so the first thing you
do is use any creamy under-eye concealer
that you want I'm just gonna take a what
an inexpensive one from the drugstore
this is Revlon Photoready concealer
comes in a little stick form here so I
just twist it up and apply that wherever
my circles are and then kind of blend
that in with my finger here I've already
got foundation on and this is just you
know allowing those circles to be a
little more covered up but another trick
to make it just go a step further I'm
taking that bare minerals summer biscuit
does have an SPF 20 in it and this is
multitasking minerals this is a product
that can be really just used as a
concealing product because there is so
much coverage to it so you can tap a
little bit out in your lid and I'm using
a brush this is the Sigma SS 227 it
comes out of the premium kit it's kind
of just a larger brush it actually looks
like a jumbo sized eyeshadow brush but
this isn't look like the face brushes
and I'm just going to Pat that summer
bisque all over this area and you can
start to see just little imperfections
that we're there you know when I just
did it with the cream concealer now are
getting covered up it's really amazing
how the how matte this product is and
that really allows it to conceal those
circles even areas that are really dark
around the inner corner you know
sometimes it's lighting which I'm having
a little issue with today but you know
like right in there you can't see those
contours anymore that make you look more
tired and stuff like oh there you go
again I can't take credit for this
little idea I did come across it online
but once I started trying it I was like
this is really great this is a great
full coverage mineral product that I
think just has proven to work great with
pretty much any concealer I have in my
collection I mean I have not come across
one concealer that I have used that has
not also worked well with this on top
and I just feel like the coverage is
great I do have a circle there but I
feel like it really does a good job of
mid
I think that and I'm not sure what other
shades like this is seen as a this is
called a multitasking min I'm wondering
if this kind of thing comes in other
shades for the so darker skin tones
could wear this I do know that they have
something called bisque that is just a
step lighter and this would be the
summer bisque that works for say my
medium skin tone so anyway I just really
had to tell you guys about that because
of how much it's been helping me as I've
been using it so hope it helps you as
well thanks for watching and I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
