my hair up I get at least a few
questions asking how did you do that
with your hair and more often than not I
take my hair I've kind of wadded up and
I stick a clip behind it but I finally
found something that makes buns a little
bit easier because my problem has always
been that when I want to go wrap my hair
into a quick bun I feel like I don't
have that much hair to put into it and
so therefore my bun turns out to be
really small you know when you do it
kind of tight and stuff so this product
the bun maker from Conair which I picked
up at Walgreens is allowing me to have a
more full bun up here and I'm really
like if you want to see how to make this
bun on yourself keep on watching keep in
mind that the items in this little kit
can also be found elsewhere this little
tool which is basically the essential
piece to getting a fuller bun as you can
see it's kind of like a a mesh I don't
know netting sort of thing going on
there it's really squishy it's almost
like a a sponge or something like that
but you can find these at Sally Beauty
Supply you get that you get your
ponytail holder and you also get for
just regular hair pins like that so you
can definitely find out the all those
pieces you know individually elsewhere I
just want you to know that they do all
come together in this kit and what I do
I actually do a little step before hand
you could do a bun down low on the side
in the middle of the back your head or
up high and if I'm gonna do a high bun
something I like to do instead of
necessarily pulling all my hair straight
back is I like to get a little bit of
volume going right up here right at the
front so I tend to pull up all the hair
that comes across my forehead basically
just a little bit just about that much
and then I'll take some hairspray you'll
know I love the Tresemme tray - I guess
what they're making an even bigger can
now and I just spray a little bit from
behind and then use a brush that you can
tease with just a little bit behind
there it's no big deal this is one of
the easiest you know teasing things to
do then I take a couple bobby pins these
are just my own bobby pins and
just sort of secure that kind of give it
that little bump for it as much bump as
you want you know if you wanted
something real big here you could do
that just make sure that you're securing
it right about here right about the
middle of the top of your head so you
can still get nice height with your bun
to give it a little more hairspray to
just reinforce what you've done there
and then you're just gonna secure your
hair up in a high ponytail kind of
aiming to secure this ponytail in an
area right behind where my bobby pins
next step is to use this little guy and
this basically is going to allow your
bun to look so much fuller and that's
kind of my top complaint when I do buns
it's like I'm always looking for ways
and like I'm teasing the hair up a
little bitter I'm looking for ways to
make it fuller so basically put the
little donut we'll call it the little
donut put this around there then what
you need to do is kind of pull your hair
around this donut so it's kind of
covered from all angles like that it's
really not that hard it seems kind of
weird but that's what you need to do it
first then what we're going to start
doing and you can see it's the
difficulties with my hair just a little
bit because my hair does have multiple
layers start to take your hair from the
front and what you're going to do is
just kind of twist it around this bun
that you've now created and as you go
around it you're going to pick up more
and more hair and that hair is just
going to twist around to the front as
well now I don't like a real you know
perfect looking bun I like for it to be
a little bit more like you know the hair
has just kind of been gathered up there
so just continue to circle that bun as
much as you need to until you feel that
all your hair cause is going somewhere
and then that's what you have these
little pins for these pins are just
going to poke right in there at the base
of your bun all the way around and
they're going to poke right into that
sort of mesh donut thing so I've got
four here and if you've got even longer
hair that's kind of struggling to say
where you
you know you may need to stick in some
additional bobby pins as well but
otherwise that's the basic fun that
you're working with
alright guys so here is my finished but
I mean once you're done you're done just
put as much hairspray on there as you
want it would also be really cute to
stick a little flower right in here and
again this can be done right on top of
your head down low in the center of the
back of your head wherever you want to
do it just I'm really happy with the
effect it gives my hair and I will
probably wear my hair up a lot more
often now that I know I can get this
kind of a result and again you don't
have to poof the hair at first that's
totally optional you could twist it you
could you know braid back I mean there
are just millions of ways you can work
with this product but I just wanted to
let you know it's out there and if you
have fine hair like me and it will help
you out thank you so much for watching
have a great day and I will see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
