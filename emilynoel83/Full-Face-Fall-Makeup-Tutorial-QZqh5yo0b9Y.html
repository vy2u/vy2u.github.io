me for this makeup tutorial this is
going to be a full face look so I'm
gonna take this from absolute start
where I'm wearing no makeup to finish
when I'm doing the eyes and talking
about what's on my lips and all that so
why have you have been wanting kind of
an updated look at what I'm doing
foundation wise and and also I've been
hearing from people saying you know I
love the colorful looks and these
gameday tutorials but show me a neutral
look for a minute you know like I want
to see something you know kind of
fall-like and just sort of a warm brown
look was hit requested by a few people
so I thought I'd give that a go using
some drugstore products that you can
easily find hopefully wherever you're at
so thanks a lot for tuning in for this
and I hope you enjoy all ready put on my
moisturizer and my primer I used my you
know ultra calming moisturizer all over
because my skin is getting a little more
dry and that one's really good for like
dry sensitive skin and then I've got
Palladio herbal foundation primer on and
now I'm going to use my Rimmel lasting
finish foundation my shade is 200 soft
beige and I'm just going to who I
definitely squirted out too much there
that's okay and I'm just going to kind
of generally like I'm not really fully
blending it in but I'm kind of just
putting it in general where I'm going to
blend it in more this doesn't you know
you have time with this foundation to
blend it it doesn't just set and I'm
using my Sigma it's one of the new
sigmax like high definition brushes
round top kabuki f82 and so it has a
really it's one of those really dense
soft brushes and I like it a lot for
liquid foundation cuz you get a really
good blend on it and it just gives you
just that really flawless face look
another nice thing about it is it's a
smallish brush really so you can get
right in it's very dense you can get
right in around your eye area you know
blend it kind of circular motions down
around your cheek your chin I'm getting
right down under my jaw there and
getting under the other well blend blend
it out foundation is
such an important first step many people
you know they may be dissatisfied with
the way their makeup looks at the end
and sometimes it's those early steps
that really make a difference as you
continue to pile on more makeup then
you're like wait I don't like the way
this looks but really just getting a
good blend on your foundation it should
be easy you know if you're having
difficulty with a certain brush you know
maybe it's too small maybe it's you know
just not good for blending out
foundation so you know you shouldn't
really be struggling to do this step
this should be fairly easy so you use a
brush that makes it easy this one
happens to work for me and it just
really does give you that great blend on
all areas of your thing gonna take care
of some discoloration around my eyes
with my Maybelline Dream mousse
concealer my shade is light 4-5 the
shade is called cream so I just get some
on my finger and basically I I really
like to use my fingers for this step
because it just really does you know
press it into your skin helps it kind of
melt in with your skin and with this
mousse consistency I think that's really
necessary so even if you're using like
Maybelline Dream mousse foundation I
really recommend putting that on with
your fingers just to get the best finish
on your skin so as you can see getting
it right in here right in the innermost
corner of my eye and right up under my
eye actually like right up to my lower
lash line because you know discoloration
happens in that whole area you can look
at kind of see the difference in both
eyes now let's stage the game where I
like to take a loose powder and just
kind of set the foundation really lock
in some staying power here and my
all-time favorite this has been like
daily use product since I been making my
youtube videos and it's from Mary Kay
and it is just the signature loose
powder my shade is beige one and I'm
actually using my ELF studio complexion
brush recently picked that up from
Target to see how I like it and it works
pretty well for you know a light
application of powder so I'm gonna just
use that all I just go all over my face
with this and if you have oil control
problems in certain areas
definitely cater to those areas as you
apply your powder but I'm just gonna go
lightly all over my face my application
of bronzer all over I'm using my Rimmel
natural it's the natural bronzer and
Sundance it has a little shimmer to it
but I find I've been actually using this
on a daily basis on the news because I
really don't feel like the shimmer comes
through that much and I think it's just
you know it gives you a little glow but
nothing too overboard nothing really
glittery or anything so again just using
my ELF complexion brush and I would just
apply this you know when it's a light
bronzer like this for my skin anyway
this is fairly light I just kind of try
to hit the places where Sun would
naturally hit my skin so I sort up
around my temples forehead area tops of
cheeks and stuff we get into contouring
that's where I take like a bronzer or a
blush that's a little bit deeper and I
use a smaller brush to apply it so I'm
using this blush brush from Revlon this
I got quite a while ago at Big Lots but
you can find similar Revlon brushes at
Walmart or you know just any blush brush
you like an angled brush is good too
but I'm going into my ELF contouring
blush and bronzer yeah I'm still working
on using up this last little bit here
before I open up my new one but kind of
helps to sort of look at an angle where
the light allows you to see that little
bit of shadow there under your cheekbone
and then kind of I just suck it in just
a little bit and then you can see
exactly where to go I sort of apply it
like that and then blend it out in that
sort of emotion really important to make
sure this step is blended it should be
subtle but it can really do a lot for
your face if you do a little contouring
right there so same thing on the other
side suck it in give yourself a little
application and then buff it out and if
you're struggling with blending on this
step it can always be a good idea to
take a big fluffy kabuki brush and use
that to really blend over anything
you've done because often times that
kind of a brush will be more dense than
your you know blush brush was so just
keep that in mind and other places you
may
contort that's the main place I try to
contour but you can go kind of under
under your jaw there for a little face
slimming or you can contour your
forehead if you feel like my forehead is
kind of wide I want that to be a little
more contoured you know you can
definitely do that there as well get the
application buff it out use a larger
brush if you so choose look especially
as we head into the colder months you
know of sort of that rosy cheek I think
it just makes me think of fall and
winter and chilly weather and a great
blush for that is actually the elf
studio blush in blushing rose and this
is a gorgeous pigmented blush it doesn't
take a lot when you use it and it has a
slight slight a golden shimmer in it so
it's like a rosy blush golden shimmer
only use a little bit get just a tiny I
just literally just went like that with
my blush brush and I try to concentrate
it on the apples of my cheeks not
getting too close to my eye get it on
and then I blend it at this point you
could apply a highlighter if you wanted
to I feel like that blush had just a
little bit of the glow to it and that's
really all I wanted for this look so I
feel like I've got enough sort of glowy
faceless going on here so I'm taking my
ELF High Definition powder and this is
just a translucent powder taking a big
Brush and I just kind of shake it like
that big kabuki and just kind of run
that around my face and I feel like it
gives a really flawless look somewhat of
them a matte look but just I put it on
all over everything and it just makes
everything look really even and blended
and I like that
first I applied my Palladio herbal
eyeshadow primer all over my lid then
I'm gonna go to a hard candy eyeshadow
duo in rush hour and I really like the
hard candy
eye shadows I have a couple of them and
this is a really pretty neutral one so
we're gonna take this lighter shade here
it's kind of like a super light coppery
Brown and so I'm going to use my ELF
eyeshadow brush really get some of that
product on there and we're going to Pat
that on the inner part of our lid here
I'm also using the tip of the brush just
to get a little bit of that product
right around the sorry right around the
inner corner right here using the same
shade just a different brush to sort of
change the application going to it with
a fluffier brush my Sephora rounded
crease brush and just getting a lighter
application that shimmery shade all up
under the eyes the elf eyeshadow brush
and the darker Brown with the pretty
gold undertone and picks some of that
shade up and we're going to Pat that on
the outer half of the eyelid I love
these two shades side-by-side kind of
blended like this on the lid I think
it's just it really pops it's just a
really beautiful way to wear Brown not
all Browns are this pretty to look at so
just doing that and you can see I'm also
kind of working that up into the crease
as well just a little bit so kind of
getting it on the lid and also pushing
it up towards the crease take my
Smashbox brush it is my number 15 brush
it's kind of just a medium sized crease
brush getting a little more of that same
brown we put right there on the lid and
just taking it even more on the crease
following just the natural crease shape
here we're not doing an outer V right
now we're just trying to get that shade
up there to provide some contrast we're
gonna go to one of my favorite drugstore
shades and it's a covergirl eye enhancer
single and brown smolder definitely a
deeper Brown than what we just used and
I'm taking my essence of beauty fine
crease brush and I'm just getting a
little bit of that brown just sort of
right out here I'm not working it into a
big outer V but I'm just taking
outer part of the crease and deepening
it just a little bit more I'm gonna use
some Brown cream liner this one is
actually it came like this I just
twisted the top off and it was part of
that trio of cream eyeshadows from
Physicians Formula this Brown came from
the hazel eyes kit and I'm going to be
using my angled bent and like if you
will eyeliner brush from Coastal Scents
and I'm just gonna be taking this creamy
product and getting it all along my lash
line covered my whole upper lash line
from inner to outer corner but with the
outer edge here we're going to build
that up just a little bit we're not
making a big real wing of it exactly but
we are thickening it and just extending
it a little bit past the natural lash
line so you can see where my eye would
curve and go back down we're actually
bringing this just out a little bit with
that dark brown we're just making a
connection with the lower lash line
there so bring it up connect with the
outer edge and just bring it down
slightly and we don't want to go really
under the entire lash line here so I'm
just taking it like kind of fading it to
the halfway point because I'm going back
to the covergirl shade brown smolder
that matte Brown using an angled
eyeliner brush and just going over what
I just did there with the cream I'm
going to go over the upper lash line a
little bit you can kind of like soften
it up just by going over it with some
powder shadow like this my final step
with the powder is just to take sort of
a you can use a pencil brush and I got
this one from Coastal Scents it's sort
of like a pencil brush really stiff
small brush and I'm going to this shade
again this the darker of the two Brown
shades in the hard candy kit and I'm
just using the tip and running under
this whole lash line area and what
that's going to do is just make it look
almost a little bit smoky and it's just
going to make it look less like okay
there's a line of eyeliner there and
it's gonna make it look really kind of
blended out and just deep and then we're
gonna go in with a black liner on the
waterline just to provide some real
contrast so everything's been brown a
little bit lighter and then as we get
really in close to the eye we're gonna
get that nice darkness so this is the
Loreal pencil perfect I find it to be
very creamy and extremely dark and so it
really shows up whenever you put it on
the waterline so they're just putting it
from the inner corner into the outer
corner there and suddenly the whites of
your eyes are popping just a little bit
more and it really sets off that I'm
gonna apply some mascara and I'm gonna
make it a nice rich black mascara so
again we have that contrast with the
brown like I like using some dark
accents even when I'm using kind of some
dark smoky colors to really have some
deep blacks so nothing ends up really
looking muddy so I mean I use that black
on the waterline of that I'm using my
voluminous carbon black mascara on the
upper lashes and just a quick coat of
lash discovery on the bottom so it
doesn't look clumpy but will kind of
help those bottom lashes stand out as
well
alright guys here is my finished look
just kind of my basic fall makeup
tutorial I really just like I said
wanted to do something where I could
take you start to finish again show kind
of what I've been doing lately
foundation wise and also a neutral eye
look that many of you wanted to see so
on my lips I really love this lipstick
sometimes with tutorials it's kind of
like okay I'm just looking for this
certain thing and I need it for the
tutorial but this is one of those
lipsticks that I'm going to be using a
lot I got it recently from Walgreens and
it's from Maybelline it's the color
sensational lipstick in nearly there and
so it's one of the neutrals and what I
love so much about this is like you put
it on and it's like your lip color but
glowy and shimmery and pretty and it's
just like you know it's not a far cry
from my natural lips but yet it looks so
much more polished and finished I really
like it
so that's all I have on my lips right
now I just put that on and I feel like
I've got this nice neutral finish but it
gives the look a really nice glow
because everything is so neutral with
this so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
let me know what your liking for fall
makeup these days or what you want to
see in a future tutorial and I would be
happy to try it out so thanks so much
for watching and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
