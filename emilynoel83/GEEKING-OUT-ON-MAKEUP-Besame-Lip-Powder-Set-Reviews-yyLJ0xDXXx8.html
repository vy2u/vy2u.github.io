here I am pumped to do this video I'm
talking about a couple of makeup sets
from the line called Besame so I have
their brightening setting powder trio
which is a $25 product at Sephora calm
and also their mini lipstick set set of
five mini lipsticks 25 bucks
also at Sephora and this line I've got
to say I'm getting a low-key like
obsession coping with this brand last
night I found their YouTube channel I
was watching all these videos about
their products and about just the story
behind the brand there's a great video I
think it's there like spotlighted video
on the best make cosmetics YouTube
channel you should totally check it out
to give you a little background just in
a nutshell
Besame means kiss me in Spanish and this
brand was created by Gabriella Hernandez
she grew up in Argentina moved to the
United States when she was a young girl
like early teens she works with her
husband and her daughter and you can see
them in that video that I mentioned on
the YouTube channel and that's just
that's precious I love that idea
her daughter is so cute and it's neat to
see her like really being involved in
the process but Gabriella spoke about
this era when glamour was so valued and
like her grandmother would not leave the
house without lipstick on and I love
that kind of feeling and she said this
whole line was inspired by a time when
makeup was a treasured experience and
when people really treasured their
makeup products that they had and going
back to like the 1920s the 30s the 40s
50 60s throughout all of those decades
what she says she noticed from that time
was more simplicity a very traditional
style of makeup where people weren't
using you know dozens of products on
their face every day they had a few key
things like a powder or a lipstick that
would really accent their look and be
just what they needed it's this feeling
of a look that is beautifully glamorous
and old Hollywood but yet incredibly
simple you know for what it is and I
love the thought of the you know
treasuring the experience of putting on
makeup that's completely in my soul you
know that's
and I think it's neat to see a brand
really focusing in on just some key
things so if you look on Sephora's site
there are a ton of products being sold
from Besame on there they got their
setting powders they've got their
lipsticks a couple of brushes maybe but
there's not this whole like big spectrum
of products now you go to the Besame
cosmetics website and you can see a few
more offerings there it got some pressed
powders there that I'm really interested
in trying some powder and cream blushes
that I think just look gorgeous so right
down to the packaging they're trying to
make this a very vintage inspired line
lipsticks are a total cornerstone of
this line and it's so cool because if
you look through what they've made what
they're offering and selling in their
brand they are actual replicas she goes
in gabriella seeks out vintage makeup
products you can see her in this video
likes watching out the product trying to
discover exactly what kinds of pigments
are in there and then she does these
recreations of lipsticks that were
popular in those certain eras in those
certain years and I just think that is
so cool and she mentioned she addressed
the fact that her line contains a lot of
reds and that's because in you know a
lot of these eras that she was looking
into you know the 30s the 40s the 50s
people were wearing nothing but reds
there would be slight variations in the
tones or the trend you know that people
were going toward but red lipstick was
where it was at and frankly you know it
doesn't get much more glamorous than a
great red lip so I'm gonna stop
chattering on and on about the backstory
for a minute and just tell you about the
products I am here to review so the
brightening setting powders and these
are a product that I'd seen floating
around on Sephora you know being sold
individually for sometime I think when
you get a full-sized powder you also get
a puff that comes with them here you're
just getting the powders there's 0.1
ounce in each one of these and you're
getting two sample three totally
different tones and they've got those
right here on the side these tones are
extremely accurate and representative of
what the different tones of powder are
that you get so one is more pinky tone
one has a yellowish tone and one has
this violet very very soft lilac tone
and and the lids just twist off you're
looking at a really just traditional
sifter type of jar here but I think when
you buy a full-size not only do you have
the puff but they have like a little
plastic lid that comes down and keeps
product from going everywhere and so
that can be helpful too but you
definitely utilize the lid I think
tapping out some of the product and then
use a brush sponge puff to apply it
another interesting thing about these
powders they each have a very soft scent
which I find to be very pleasant and I
really enjoy that aspect of these
powders because it's not overboard it's
not phew me I've applied all of these
powders up very close to my eye area and
there's no like sensitivity there it's
just SuperDuper soft but the vanilla
rose is said to be a soft powder with
pink tint that helps control green and
blue tones in the skin then you've got
the vanilla and this is the one that has
the slight yellowish cast to it and this
says a velvety powder with yellow tint
that helps control redness and has a
light vanilla scent and then your violet
is a translucent violet powder that
color corrects yellow and red tones and
brightens any skin tone has a subtle
violet fragrance I really think what was
probably holding me back from purchasing
a full-size of one of these before was
just not being sure which one would
really be best for my skin which one I
needed the most so a $25 sampler that
gives me all three I think is the
absolute way to go if you have any
unsure feelings about which might be
best for you what I found and I think I
mentioned this in another video I feel
like the vanilla rose and the violet so
your pinky tone powder and your very
very light lilac powder are super
brightening not that they don't all have
a brightening quality to them but these
kind of go next level in terms of being
a great powder under the eye area the
vanilla one works there too but I feel
like I enjoyed this one even more just
all over my face and that might be
because I can use it around my nose this
is supposed to counteract the redness a
little bit more so if you notice like
redness peeking through on your t-zone
this can kind of mattify and perfect
that area these are not glowy powders
they are matte however I don't think
they look unnaturally heavy on the skin
and I was paying attention to some
videos from the brand
where I could really see these products
being applied and see what their
intended use was and it seems that they
I wouldn't call it baking but they put
on a healthy amount of the product like
with a puff or you could use a sponge or
a brush whatever application you really
want to use but they put on quite a bit
they just kind of set it all over the
skin like you would see a good amount of
powder and then they sort of dusted it
away with a finishing brush which is
actually sold by this line it's like a
$50 brush it looks so cool it is
inspired by the exact kind of brushes
like the old Hollywood starlets may have
had on their vanity table I so want that
I may have to ask for that for Christmas
but they kind of just lightly use that
all over the skin to sort of blend in
slash dust away excess so what I feel
like they're doing is maybe a lighter
less intense take on the baking trend
that we see a lot of people doing these
days for me for everyday wear I find
just a light dusting with a brush just
boom boom boom just hit the under eye
area
either of these two powders I really
like in that way and like I said this
one lightly all over the skin today I
really wanted to follow a little bit
more like their traditional application
so I went with the vanilla rose on my
under eye area today and with this one
it does say it can control green and
blue tones and you know I have a little
bit of a bluish tone on my under eye
area so I just used a sponge I use the
flat side of my mini Real Techniques
sponge and dab this on and then once it
was on I just gave it a light dusting
away and I do feel like it was nice and
brightening however I don't really feel
the need to apply that much product on a
regular basis they're just my opinion on
that product and then I lightly applied
the vanilla like I said around the
t-zone area anywhere else on my skin
that I wanted to you know set my makeup
but I totally enjoy the experimentation
the variety that you have here you can
kind of mess around with them you can
mix the colors if you want to really
just figure out what is the perfect
shade for you and in what parts of your
skin can you most take advantage of a
lilac powder or the rose but they're all
pretty dang brightening so that's nice
to see and then I think outside of this
little collection I think they do have
some deeper shades available as well
that this little trio I think is a total
home run
we pleased with the way my skin looks
where I have applied it and I think it
wears well throughout the day doesn't
look too heavy now let's move on to the
mini lipstick set and I've got the
lipsticks out of here but this is what
that little packaging looks like and you
are getting five of Besame cosmetics
signature vintage colors in this special
holiday set and they are all minis and
they are in plastic packaging I don't
have a full-sized Besame lipstick and
I've heard those are in more of a metal
packaging so these are plastic but you
have that gorgeous gold tube with the
red floral design and then there's a
little lever right here and can you see
the cut of the lipstick bullet I like
that they kept their signature cut the
same even though these are downsized you
know little minis they've got this like
flattened edge on both sides that sort
of comes up to a point in the center and
that's very interesting and that does
take a little getting used to if you're
used to just the classic pointed
lipstick bullet but I like it and I
think once you get used to this it sort
of helps you really shape a nice Cupid's
bow and it gives you a really nice clean
line around the like outside of your lip
these lipsticks have the best like mmm
just soft vanilla scent to them nothing
obnoxious but to describe the feel of
these going on your lips four out of the
five have a really like creamy
consistency it's not creamy greasy it
just transfers to the lips with such
full color and maybe it's because every
shade has I think an element of boldness
to it so you really get the satisfaction
of just kind of going once across your
lips and seeing a lot of color lay down
very rich now when I said four out of
the five the one labeled cherry red in
this lineup the 1935 inspired color that
one seems to be more of a total matte
finish while it's still a cream lipstick
I can tell there's a little more dryness
in the formula and it just doesn't have
that same like little bit of shine that
all the others seem to have and another
useful thing I found as I was perusing
their YouTube channel the other day was
the actual suggested way to apply a
Besame lipstick so I want to show you
that
I tried that with the red velvet shade
which is right in the middle of this
lineup so really true red this is very
creamy and they say to apply the product
all over your lips then you're going to
give it a quick blot onto a tissue then
you apply a generous amount of the
lipstick all over the lips again give it
another blot and that is the way they
say to apply their lipsticks and I have
worn several of these with that
application process and it makes a huge
difference because it's almost like
you're locking in sort of a stain on
your lips you're helping that product
kind of start to stain even before it's
had a chance to have any wear time at
all I really think that method helps
them wear evenly helps take away any
sort of slippery feel on the lips which
not that these even feel slippery at all
I mean the creams really adhere as you
apply them they don't feel like they're
weak and thin and too light if I'm
wearing a red like this I want to trust
that that red is going to stay in place
for me and I think doing that double
blot technique really helps so I wanted
to show you one applied that way but as
far as the rest of these just going
through and trying each one on for you I
just did like one application all over
the lid because I wasn't looking to lock
these colors in as I do
lips watch after lip swatch you know I
want to be able to remove it and remove
it as fully as I can so I can put the
next one on for you just FYI I think
double blot is a great method and can
definitely be used with any of your
cream lipsticks that you may be worried
a little bit about staying power wise do
that and I feel like I can easily get
through half to two-thirds of a date
with a pretty fresh looking lip these
are not really marketed as long wear lip
products and if you want the freshest
look you're probably going to want to
touch up by about midday but you know
what who cares these are adorable and
they take up like no room in a pocket in
a purse in a clutch and frankly I feel
very glamorous putting one of these on
so yay but I'm going to take you through
all the colors I would normally go light
to dark and lip swatches but here I feel
I must stay in the order of the years
that they give here so I will start with
the 1930 inspired noir red really really
dark gorgeous color my goodness applied
to its fullest extent it looks
super dark but as it fades you start to
see more of that red coming through in
the color next one is 1935 and that's
the cherry red that I described as being
more of a matte finish just feels like a
classic matte lipstick as I apply it's
got a little more dryness to it I like
having a different finish because you've
got a couple of Reds in here and the
1935 cherry red is giving you a slightly
cooler look and a matte finish and then
we move into the 1946 red velvet shade
which I've been wearing throughout the
video and also demonstrated in the
double blot technique but this one is
creamier and it's a little bit warmer
and I just think it's an unbeatable read
oh do I feel so glam in this color and
then we move into the 1969 shade called
dusty rose this I love as well I can't
decide if I like red velvet or dusty
rose better in this collection
oh my gosh is this a beautiful saturated
deep rosy shade I love it and I think it
adds a lot of great variety to the set
and then chocolate kiss which I was
wearing in a recent video had so much
great feedback on this shade this is
like a deep caramel II kind of brownish
dusty red did I throw in enough
adjectives they're very very creamy well
we've had the Reds we've had a dark
color we've had a pink and now here's
something that's a little more a neutral
you know what I love about each and
every color in this set they all have
their own unique glamour they really all
are a statement type of lip product when
you put them on they do stand out on
your face they are designed to and I
like you know doing this simple I
putting on some lashes maybe getting my
brow done got my matte finish on my skin
and then just let that lip color steal
the bangs show I love it and what better
time to experiment with shades like this
then wintertime fall holidays love $25
samplers particularly when samplers
allow you to try things that actually
exist in the regular line so you're
getting a sense of what the brand truly
makes and if you use one of these up
fell in love with one certain shade you
could go back
after it in a full-size I love that
that's one of the most useful things
brands can do for themselves I think
people can learn about their lines spend
some time with it in their own time not
just at a makeup counter or in a Sephora
and really understand what they like
best so I am thoroughly impressed with
BES MA I am kind of infatuated by this
line as I've said thank you guys so much
for your time and for just spending a
little bit of your day with me if you
enjoyed this video I feel like we have
kind of a soul connection here because I
am just I'm geeking out makeup wise on
these products and yeah if you've tried
anything from this line you've got any
recommendations you want to share with
me and others please let us know in the
comments section and I will talk to you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
