hopefully will be my last day not
knowing whether it's a boy or a girl
I say hopefully because I guess there's
a chance since this is happening through
an ultrasound that they won't be turned
or positioned in a way that we can see
but I really hope they are it's 5
something in the morning I just got up
our appointments at like 8:40 so we
won't have you know long to wait at
least to move where this all goes down I
have a pretty strong feeling right now
that it's a girl Tyler last night
thought girl my mom and dad thought girl
and then I asked on Twitter and I feel
like a lot of people that are rooting
for a boy so it's just it's interesting
because you know I've really settled in
my mind but it's it's good news either
way we're just hoping that whatever they
see on the ultrasound is you know the
size it should be doing whatever they
think it should be doing you know that
kind of stuff that's what I'm really
like keeping my fingers crossed for cuz
I I know I had these feelings when I was
pregnant with Belle too like I just
really do not take any of these little
milestones and these little steps for
granted like I remembered when she came
out and she had all the right amount of
fingers and toes I was like wow you know
it's shocking to me it's like when I
hear about another person having a baby
I expect everything will be just fine
but if everything is just fine with me
I'm like especially in awe how did it
all turn out that way or whatever I'm
just gonna sit down and do a little
editing and stuff before I finish
getting ready and get Belle up and get
ready to go
all the whole gangs here we're on our
way to the appointment thoughts you're
like the Chinese gender predictor said
girl it was right last time
however I've heard it doesn't have the
best reputation for accuracy
oops
there's your little person yeah
correctly around me
Oh
tonight is amazing no we don't know I'm
still thinking now we're waiting on our
just standard doctor appointment now our
first we'll sit down after finding out I
can't believe it I can't believe we know
now like I don't know that I'm so
shocked it's a girl or that I'm just so
shocked that we've passed this threshold
so it's official it's definitely going
to be a girl it's such a good experience
with bail my life change anything you
know it's kind of set in a little new
level of excitement and anticipation
like January seems just really really
really far away yes I mean I actually
come pretty fast but right now it seems
like it's now we're gonna get here yeah
and so far again we are at 16 weeks now
so if you want full details on kind of
what's progressed in this last month or
so I'll have a video on my vlog channel
up in the coming days just kind of going
a little bit more in detail some things
have definitely changed for me symptom
wise in that time so and it's been good
thank you guys so much for watching we
cannot be thankful enough for the
support the prayers all of the positive
vibes you've been send in our way
throughout this pregnancy so far yes we
will talk to you guys very soon fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
