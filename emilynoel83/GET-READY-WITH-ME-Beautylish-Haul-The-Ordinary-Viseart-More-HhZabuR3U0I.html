being here good morning it is as you can
see very dark and early behind me just
getting going on my coffee but I thought
I would bring you along with me as I put
on my makeup this morning and I have
some new things from Beauty lish I tried
some stuff I guess a brand that's
totally new to me called the ordinary
I'm sure you've heard of it they do
really inexpensive stuff like we're
talking six seven dollars for the
foundations and primer that I got so
I've been playing with those also I've
got some new things from visi art
Charlotte Tilbury I'll fill in the
blanks with other things but I thought
you know we could just do a little get
ready with me and hang out so I've
already got my moisturizing serum on my
Rodan and Fields active hydration
concentrate was that what it's called I
got that on in my eye cream and so I'm
ready for some primer and this is one of
the things that I have from the ordinary
it's called high spreadability fluid
primer and I thought that that meant
that this was just really easy to spread
but it actually I think means that makes
your foundation easy to spread out on
top it says spreadability enhancing
lightweight surface smoother and primer
so yeah the ordinary I've been asked for
a long time to try this stuff out and
I'm finally getting around to it
actually there had been several times
where I tried to buy from this line but
the foundation especially was always
sold out so anyway I'm gonna take some
of this primer and it is super duper
runny like you got to find that perfect
golden moment where it's just dripped
you can get it onto your skin here
without dripping it all over yourself
which I have done a time or two but it
does like spread across the skin so
smoothly and I have had a really good
staying power actually whenever I have
had this on underneath like yesterday
okay that brings me into my next thing
on foundations I got two kinds I got the
coverage foundation and the serum
foundation I have been impressed really
with the look on my skin of both of
these the staying power has been good
too and like yesterday I was wearing the
serum foundation and I put it through my
whole day and I thought okay you know
maybe I didn't do anything like super
strenuous today other than KidCare which
we had that is strenuous but like I got
to the end of my day and I thought okay
it's looking fine and then we went to
the SIU game and it was raining outside
so we were walking mainly back from the
game in the rain and I remember thinking
to myself I'm gonna be really surprised
if that stuff still looks good now
because it's not a real heavy foundation
to begin with but it did look really
good on my skin and then even through
that it wore so well so props to the
serum foundation it's definitely proven
itself to me and I wear that in
one-point-two in light but today I'm
gonna do the coverage foundation this
says high coverage foundation formula I
wouldn't call this stuff full coverage I
just don't feel like it quite goes there
but it's good coverage you know and all
this stuff is kind of thin like very
liquidy so you want to shake it up I
guess whenever something spin I feel
like I really need to shake it just in
case you know the thinness is caused by
something separating but did I say what
I am in this 2.0 in light neutral and it
does say shape before use thank you very
much
I've also wet my Nix Beauty Blender
which just to address a quick question
on this NYX has a couple of different
black Beauty blenders on the Ulta
website but the one that I love is
called the flawless flawless finish
sponge-on is linked to everything below
so if you're ever confused like what was
that specific things you said blah blah
like this is the one that I like I'm not
saying the other ones bad but I haven't
tried it and it's a little different
shape and cut so the flawless finish is
the one I like but we're gonna take some
of this foundation I'm going to do like
a full pump that this thing dispenses
I'm going to just kind of patch this on
like I normally would
looking a little yellow but again
everything pulls a little yellow on this
camera I feel like to begin with but
this does seem to blend in nicely with
my skin and maybe you can see what I
mean here about it being yeah definitely
fuller coverage than the last one like
relatively speaking or than the serum
one it covers more than that it has a
little bit more of a matte appearance
although it still looks pretty natural
on the skin but I feel like it's medium
coverage overall because just like I
have a little zit for example cropping
up there this doesn't totally cancel out
the redness that's coming from that I
can still see freckles I can still see
any areas where I tend to be maybe have
a little darkness dark spot so I'm not
getting on the foundation over that I
still think it's it's quite good
coverage if we're as natural as it kind
of looks when you get it all blended out
I think the coverage is really nice so
I'm just trying to be as descriptive as
I can for you and I would say I've
gotten a little bit better coverage when
I've used like my Real Techniques expert
face brush to blend it out on my skin
but I'm so just really getting back into
Blender sponges these days you like out
what I'm talking I just you know go
right over the lips this early in the
morning the coffee hasn't really reached
my hands so it's just doing its own
anyway the things that I've tried from
the ordinary I think have been pretty
freakin awesome
then a concealer that I've never tried
before I don't think it's especially new
correct me if I'm wrong if it is new I'm
not sure it's from Inglot and it's the
cream concealer and I have this in the
shade
21 and this is just a little squeezy
tube a very classic type concealer I'm
using maybe half of a pearl sized amount
here and it's not quite as potent as I
was expecting I don't know what I was
really like expecting this would do for
me oops I got an eyelash in there like I
don't know you'll see I'm gonna blend
over it here it adds some brightness
it's just a touch up from my skin tone
so it does you know kind of give me a
little life for their little brightening
I don't know maybe this is doing a
little better than I first thought
because if any day I'm gonna have a dark
circle it would be too
I was up at 3:00 in the morning with a
teething baby didn't get to bed
especially early but I just think that's
a really good tone and I can still see
just the faintest maybe hint of a little
darkness there but I mean come on just
as far as a general concealer goes like
that's good enough for me and then I'm
gonna take a little bit more of this and
I'm gonna dab it kind of around my nose
just hit a little redness there and this
wore very nicely for me to yesterday and
I've been wearing this I guess for about
a week now so I don't have too many
complaints there have been a couple
times when I've paired it with the
peachy corrector and I liked it my
results even better but I just wanted to
show you how it goes as is the game last
night I was posting some stuff on
snapchat as I you lost to Loyola they're
so good and I just don't think SIU
really had their best game and they they
had to perform at their best the teams
were ranked number one and two so as I
use number two they had to have like
their best game ever probably to beat
these guys so but I went with Tyler and
my dad we had fantastic seats it was
still a blast you know like when you're
in the game day atmosphere you got a
packed arena and everybody's feeling it
and having a good time win or lose it's
gonna be a good time I've always thought
that like being in Busch Stadium for
example the atmosphere it's so fun but
there you go guys concealer on I feel
like the coverage is pretty nice it
looks natural like to touch it now that
it's been blended in I can tell there's
some moisture there it doesn't feel like
super tacky I don't feel like I'm
lifting product off of the skin as I
touch it I think you could opt to set it
or not set it depending on your
preference but there's a nice like
little bit of richness to this that I
think a lot of wand applicator
concealers don't have and so it has been
looking pretty fresh as its worn through
the day now here is another exciting
thing that I got busy art has come out
with a loose setting powder so it's got
the little visit art logo there little
director's chair on it and then this is
what the inside looks like you know how
some products are putting in that little
like mesh barrier right here so if you
wanted to tap some out and really
deposit a lot of product into a cap you
might not use this scab
use something else it the way this is
created and then you got the little mesh
there it sort of keeps too much product
from coming out and here's how I've used
this I've just dabbed my brush and I
haven't really baked with this it's like
a super fine just I don't know setting
powder and I've set the under-eye with
it and I've also used this around my
t-zone and I think this does wonderful
stuff for pores as in makes me look like
I don't have them right there around the
nose so I'm kind of just hitting the
t-zone and the under eye area with this
loose powder stuff and I feel like now I
have kind of like a softness but sort of
a silkiness to the skin I'm gonna keep
using this but so far I guess I feel
like yeah it's doing it's doing the job
of a good setting powder but I don't
know that it's like essential to buy
this one because I've also had fantastic
results with like Maybelline fit me
powder you know and I can bake with that
I can just lightly apply it if I want to
so so far I'm not seeing this as
absolutely essential
I also got this little pressed powder
and it's the airbrush flawless finish
skin perfecting micro powder from
Charlotte Tilbury a little petite
compact here like it's nice and thin and
I just love her packaging I got this in
fair I can't remember exactly what the
shade range was that caused me to get
this particular shade because I feel
like this is the lightest one but I'm
just taking a little bit of this kind of
running it elsewhere across the face I
think I'm going to use a little larger
brush just to set everything from what I
can tell so far like this is a fine
powder it looks nice on the skin but I
guess I'm wondering under what
circumstance does this become an
absolute must-have because I've got
several really good powders I've got my
L'Oreal True Match I've got my LA Colors
mineral powder and lonny prep set and
glow I mean I've just got tons of things
that are working for me and I'm not
blown away by this although it's nice
enough for the bronzer that I'm gonna
use today I did not get this on Beauty
lish I got this just sent to me in PR
and this is from the balm and they've
got their new take home the bronze but
that little Oscar statue on there I mean
isn't that sweet and this is the one
called Oscar and so this is the lightest
one this is actually very exciting that
the balm has
out with a line of bronzers because
previously they had Bahama Mama which
was nice like as a great bronzer but
it's pretty deep and so they didn't have
much range wear bronzer was concerned so
this is a line of matte bronzers they've
got a couple other shades and I believe
this one is the lightest and I've been
surprised at how much I've loved this
like I want to show you the impact this
has like just for a little soft contour
right here like just for a little casual
everyday look I love the way the balm
does powders powder products of any kind
really and so there i shadow czar great
their blushes are great and these
bronzers are really nice too if you're
much deeper than my skin tone I don't
think this lightest shade would
necessarily be for you if you want to
hear more about these in a video and
just see me show everything if you're
interested in that let me know this
shade is just really cool toned really
easy to use just a definite contour
friendly shade for sure I also didn't
get a blush from Beauty lish but I got
this I don't know did they sell I think
they do sell a BH on you delicious
website but I got this a blush kit I
don't think this is a brand new thing
but this is in the shade called radiant
and I just felt like trying some new
blushes these look so pretty this pink
is so fresh I've been wearing that you
know I'm all for kind of a murky blush
that's a little bit dusty a little
bronzy maybe rosy this kind of Orange e1
here too I'm gonna take a little bit of
the fresh pink this does have a little
shimmer right there on the Apple I'm
just kind of covering this whole zone
I'm trying to take it just a little
higher than I have been coz this is just
one of those shades where you want it
right in here you know you don't really
want it coming in off the side this was
me last night when I just came into the
arena from the outside and I was like
whoo you know kind of cold got this nice
flush on your cheeks you know what's
interesting while I've really been
enjoying this ah Nastasia palette like
it's causing me to think to my Shanny
blush palette and I see overlap here you
know I see similar things happening and
I love this and it's definitely less
expensive than this one but we're gonna
Ford your head here I'm gonna use this
shade the dusty rose and this one I am
applying a little lower and a little
further back on the cheek
so you guys Eve is doing the cutest
things ever these days like she loves
animal sounds like animal sounds were
definitely some of the first things
outside of like the mama dead baby those
basic little words Belle was always all
about animal noises and Eva's getting
into the same thing so like I put out
little you know animal figures and
she'll say what they say and I'd say
she's operating on about 80% accuracy
right now but it's so cute and she's so
like loud and enthusiastic with it it's
precious
I'm gonna use my Milani radiant loose
powder here it's the make it last powder
but the shade is radiant and I'm gonna
use a little bit of this as my highlight
if this sounds at all familiar I did
review it in my video where I talked
about quite a few new Milani things this
is that powder that gives that beautiful
like almost kind of do a wet look to the
skin it's just loose powder you know
what's great and they don't give you a
lot in there little loose powders but
this one I thought was worthwhile
because I wasn't gonna be like baking
with this shade it was gonna act more as
a highlight as you can see like I think
it makes a very good pinpointed
highlight powder not something I would
put all over my skin but just you know
tops of the cheekbones and whatnot you
know what maybe I should point out that
last night when I had that great staying
power with my makeup I was wearing my
covergirl setting spray the look lockups
was it the serum foundation was it the
setting spray I tend to attribute more
staying power stuff with the foundation
because that's something that's going to
interact with your skin type and either
be like too greasy or too dry or
whatever and I don't think a setting
spray is always gonna save that I think
it can enhance and sometimes improve
here and there but if your foundation is
gonna like goop off your skin and
wearing a really awful way I don't think
a setting spray is gonna save it but
this continues to be under review I'm
gonna keep playing yeah and then I'm
gonna do my brows I'm gonna just use my
Anastasia brow Wiz I told you guys I
found this in my collection I thought
I'd used it up but it definitely has
product and it medium brown so I'm gonna
do that real quick and the
we will do the eyes browser done I start
thinking while I was doing them should
I've just done that on camera then I'm
like no it's kind of boring and it's a
product that you've already seen me use
a lot of times before nice video
somebody turned out to be super long
anyway but thank you guys who always
seemed to support the long videos I
appreciate that
another new busy art thing that I have
here is the eyeshadow primer so it looks
like this little black tube shaking it
definitely helps you really want to
shake it especially the first time you
use it because they're like it kind of
hung together a little bit but it's a
really transparent looking primer and
very different from the texture that I'm
used to from say a Milani eyeshadow
primer Urban Decay primer potion - Faced
shadow insurance not going to really
like mask the look of discoloration or
anything on your eyes I would say my
eyeshadow has hung on there pretty
nicely when I wear this but it's just a
really different texture than what I'm
accustomed to it's another one of those
things yeah it works fine and my
convinced that I need to be using it
everyday and like have it in my life
forever
not really and then this beauty the visi
art tryst palette this is their latest
thing I've used this now a couple times
one time I did a very natural look with
it I don't think I got a photo of that
but then I did a kind of pretty sultry
nighttime look and I really enjoyed that
we have three that are matte there's a
matte peach and matte like soft coral
and then this shade here if you look
really closely you can see some little
flecks of shimmer but it performs like a
matte and it's just this dark a kind of
a wine brown mix type color when I was
first using it I was thinking it might
have been nice to have more than just
that one option as a really deep color
in this palette but I'm not quite sure
this isn't like a full review just yet
yellow cuz I'm still I'm still trying to
figure this one out here's what it
reminds me of an expanded version of
bare minerals the happy place quad you
know what I'm talking about that one had
the peach it had the plums so this has
like a purpley shade a dark plum this
shade here also this color in the middle
you see it here on Cambria might just
like oh that's just a light color it's
very peachy as well actually like when
it's hitting the light it looks quite
gold when it's not you can see a lot of
each in that color you got a like a
bronzy gold down here so it's without a
doubt a pretty palette like they've got
me on the color scheme what I'm still
trying to figure out what this one and
what the look that we do today may help
me with is you know the uniqueness of it
how essential are these colors I got
this mug for Tyler for Valentine's Day
I'm drinking out of it it's a nice man's
mug it's there's got a good weight to it
you know it'll hold a good amount of
coffee I also got him a nice set of ties
and neckties and like came with a couple
of little tie bars they actually looked
really good it was a beautiful
presentation you opened the box and you
got these like five or six little
rolled-up ties I don't know I was proud
of myself for that one because Tyler
like for Christmas for his birthday too
he gives me no indication of like what
he wants like no I don't I don't really
need anything you know it's okay what
you care about right now is this palette
that can maybe be a blush too you know
that I'm gonna put it in my crease this
matte coral this makes me feel so
springtime II putting this shade here so
I'm using my Sigma e25 because that's
just where my comfort zone is I've got
some great Wayne Goss brushes and I need
to work those in a little bit more here
in there because I really like the
brushes but I just feel like you know
you get your brush comfort zone going
where it's like I know what this brush
is gonna do blending it ever so slightly
upward toward the brow now brow now and
then I'll take some of this shade here
which is a very light peach and I'll
just use that kind of on the border and
under the brow like a highlight now what
now what are we gonna do with this look
I'm gonna take some of this shade that I
said was kind of peachy peachy gold and
this actually looks really pretty on the
edge of a look too so I'm kind of
bringing that out just above that coral
and it's giving this pretty light kind
of golden edge to things at least I can
see it in person that's a subtle effect
that's a very very soft effect but it's
pretty then I do it for my purple lovers
out there we got to see what this is
about
I have you know played with this
yesterday and yeah it's pretty it's a
pretty shimmery mid-tone purple and it's
going all over my lid
did you see the busy arts also gonna be
coming out with a new petite Pro palette
and that color scheme looks really
gorgeous too
I wish I had it to compare with this
because I feel like it's got more
purpley stuff going on so I wish I could
try them both and let you know which is
better that or this okay so that's been
patted all over the lid
I've wedged it you know just kind of
gently nudged it into my crease - gonna
clean off my brush here for a second and
then I'm gonna take this lightest color
here and we're gonna dab some of this
around the inner corner for brightness
don't you love this lid like what they
did here it's kind of like a hint of
rose in that you know it's so pretty now
I'm taking this darkest shade here and
I'm gonna work this into my outer V
I must say I love the way these colors
are kind of playing with one another and
looking side-by-side the peaches the
plums you know what else actually drop
everything oh yeah okay
makeup revolution neutrals versus
neutrals this has a lot of things that
are happening here it's got some of
those shimmery like mid-tone shades it's
got a peach it's got a dark plum but it
doesn't have a dark like matte plum but
there's a lot of similar things
happening there
okay it also doesn't have maybe as true
of a purple it's got like kind of a
lilac II shade and then a deep sort of
sparkly plum maybe those two could come
together to be a little more purpley for
you but just to thought just throwing
that out there where you first put your
brush with the shadow is where the most
shadow is gonna go so I'm starting it
right here in my outer corner and I'm
just kind of blending it up it's all
kind of going in the direction of the
outer tip of my eyebrow that's what's
keeping me in line here that's so pretty
but I think what makes it different from
a lot of palettes is the little purple
splash and I want to make that even more
pronounced so I think I'm just gonna go
in with a little bit on my finger and
just really lay that purple down because
sometimes when you blend you overlap you
start to lose things a little I don't
think any brand of shadow is immune from
that happening and then I want even more
of this even more than quarrel oh it's
just yummy like this is so fun guys I am
having a blast this morning with you
I feel I need some brightness in my
lower inner rim so hard candy or mark
candy wet-and-wild ultimate brow
highlight I only use this thing like
every other day or nearly every day I
would say nine times out of ten with
this color scheme this warmth rosiness
purple enos on my eyes nine times out of
ten I like the look of a light lower
inner rim with this it just keeps your
eyes looking more alive I think I need a
really good plum liquid liner that would
be nice but since I don't have it I'm
gonna be using a black today I'm gonna
go across my lash line with the black
liquid liner I'm gonna use some Coco
lashes these are 201 so these are kind
of rediscovered I had used these quite a
bit like I don't know maybe a year or so
ago they're really nice lash not super
loud and huge but kind of a nice
everyday type lash it will pop those on
and I will join you for lips okay so
here's the eyes with the liner on and
the two oh one last as far as kind of
finishing off the eye shadow all I did
was take some of this shade with an
angled brush and I just ran it right
under my liner and a little bit down
onto my lower lash line but that's it
now for lips I got to Charlotte Tilbury
glosses this one's called hall-of-fame
and this one is called high society Hall
of Fame I knew it was going to be a
sheer style gloss but from the picture
on the website and they're pretty good
about showing pictures of how either
swatches or application looks with
different things and I swore this look
like it had more color on but it looks
basically on me like a clear gloss not
that I can't use that but I was hoping
for more colors so I'm gonna use
high-society today it's a very
traditional like little doe foot
applicator here this color is quite
pretty though and I do like the texture
I like you know the cling to the lips
this is one of those very like your lips
but better shades for me and it kind of
plays off of this type of color we've
got kind of working up out of our crease
with the eye look
but I feel like I have to dip back into
that tube constantly because this little
applicator doesn't carry hardly any
product I feel so springy with this look
today guys finished look I'm super happy
with it I would say some of my favorite
things that I got I was really impressed
with the stuff that I tried from the
ordinary the primers nice but especially
the foundations and I meant to tell you
guys I did get on the 100% organic
cold-pressed Moroccan argan oil because
I'm a big fan of the Josie Maran kind
but this is a lot more affordable so I
thought I could compare that haven't
used it yet though but just heads up I
really like the Inglot concealer the
triste palette from visi art I really
love the looks that I've been getting
from this it's a beautiful color
selection beautiful quality I'm still
kind of trying to determine if I think
this is a total must-have or maybe I
should also sorry this hair like
sticking to my gloss move away here but
I feel like I should go through more of
what I already have in my collection and
see what other similar things I have I
guess I really didn't get anything from
this haul that was a total fail here the
loose powder the eyeshadow primer this
Charlotte Tilbury powder here also the
glosses they're kind of like you know
they worked okay I'm gonna definitely
keep playing with these just to see if I
have some sort of revelation with them
but they're not seeming like immediate
must-haves in my book got a little left
over wave happen in there in my hair but
thank you guys so much for watching I
