doing a little get ready with me style
video today just kind of realized I had
a bunch of products that maybe you might
like to see in action a few things I
have mentioned some that I haven't so
yeah we're just gonna have a nice little
enjoyable get ready with me session and
one thing that's new to me this is from
Tarte and this is a clean slate
timeless smoothing primer I've not even
tried this on my face yet it looks a lot
like the Mallee perfect prep poreless
primer feels a little thicker though so
I'm gonna try that all over the skin
it's got some egg
I mean it's smooth but it's thick
so how the heck are you guys I'm doing
good the pregnancy is going well so far
I am approaching the 20th week the
halfway point as of Thursday I'm not
exactly sure when this video is gonna
get posted probably Saturday so yeah I'm
at 20 weeks and actually this weekend I
will be back home at my parents house I
always consider that back home you know
my parents are celebrating 50 years of
wedded bliss as they say so they're
having a little shindig there to
celebrate that which I'm very excited
for so I think that's gonna be fun and
I'm also just I like taking Belle back
home to like where I grew up and I don't
know it's just you see things through
new eyes you know the playground I used
to play on and all these different
things that was the house I grew up in
and no let me start saying Miranda
Lambert the house that built me but that
is the house into foundation now I'm
going to be using this boots number
seven airbrush away in cool beige and
did I it was a whole video I think where
I talked about this and I was wearing it
and a lot of you thought it looked
pretty good so I'm gonna apply it and
it's got the little dropper so this is a
very thin like lightweight product here
like a super liquidy consistency but
it's pretty concentrated too why did I
just oh okay let's just get it on my
face right before it drips all over the
carpet although it would probably be a
nice match for this carpet not that
anyone's ever looking to purposely drip
foundation on their carpet you know what
I do want to get though under this
makeup area and I should have done this
a long time ago is one of those nice
like plasticy things that chairs roll on
really easily in an office that wears a
Kleenex when you need one those things
would be so nice because it would be
such a catch-all for any like dropped
hood lord knows I've had some drips or
some breaks where you just have that one
little nugget of broken eyeshadow that
gets nicely crushed down into your
carpet
so there's that foundation very lightly
all over and then I'm just gonna get a
little bit more on here and show you
just the build ability of it a little
bit because I feel like the redness and
the under eyes can be helped a bit by
this when you just add a little bit more
see the difference maybe don't see a
difference in my cavern there but you
know places are looking better
you ever see get ready with me videos
where people have like perfect hair
already
I'm always to do the hair second and by
do the hair I mean you know sometimes
it's just a matter of combing through it
with my fingers and taking it down from
the bun foundation is on it's it's a
nice finish you know it could be more
coverage than this by the way look at
this what am I an ice cream cone up
there but we're kind of at this medium
buildable coverage but the finish is
really nice because it's mattified but
not like intensely crazy man new product
I would like to use that I have been
mentally comparing to my Tarte shaped
ape which I love so much I did a video
devoted to a heart-shaped ape and my
Urban Decay all nighter foundation and
then a bunch of you said but try that
Kat Von D lock-it concealer so I got
this in L eleven neutral and I've been
trying it and it's really freaking good
coverage too but I feel like this is
just a little stiffer a little bit
harder to blend across the skin anybody
else with me on that I feel like the
Tarte was just just slight bit easier to
work with but they're almost on par with
one another in terms of coverage - very
exceptionally full coverage concealers
and I'm a little paranoid about how fast
this can set on my under eyes so that's
why I'm doing one eye at a time because
I can take my time blending this one
side and not worry about the other side
solidifying I really see a considerable
difference on the under eye compared to
looking over here and over there so it
does make me happy for coverage
but also probably the most important
thing to me is the difference in the way
these where I feel like the Kat Von D is
a bit drier than the Tarte like I see it
more as the day wears on it just I can
see the fine lines a bit more kind of
what I would expect out of a full
coverage concealer the Tarte was really
exceptional in that way and that it kind
of defied my expectations and it stayed
looking so fresh and so smooth and even
on that under eye area I'm gonna do a
little dab of concealer right here
because sometimes I get red right
between those Browns and then I also got
at the same time I ordered that
concealer I got this translucent setting
powder and I'd heard so many good things
about this Kat Von D translucent powder
also like there's a little star you see
the star sifter points I love that okay
I'm gonna get a little bit out here and
I have baked with this you know it seems
to do well in that respect but let's
face it more often than not this is all
I really want to be doing is just a
little light weight setting powder here
just want that concealer to set and be
locked in for me all day long it's a
very lightweight powder though very fine
really doesn't look like much on your
skin but it does certainly does mattify
then I'm gonna use some of my favorite
powder this is my Chanel double
perfection Lumiere powder I wear the
shade thirty-two beige rose and this is
just a great great powder for not
looking like powder and I do want to do
a video powders that don't look like
powders I'm just having a really hard
time coming up with several you know
because it's sort of hard to gauge
foundations that don't look like
foundation it's like just by nature of
the consistency of the foundation it's
gonna be more likely to easily achieve
that goal than a powder not looking like
powder but I do have you know I've got
some candidates I'm just kind of
whittling with field right now
hey bub there's bub mum's got a trial
how you doing bub good you feeling up if
you want walked in committed I think
you're gonna do awesome mmm
love and even if you don't I'll still
love you anyway probably there's a lot
of different things that you know
lawyers are tasked with doing but the
courtroom trials stuff is is pretty dang
exciting I got to say and I love when
bub will practice his opening and
closing statements on me and I can be
like oh but what if he is that you know
I am tweak it a little bit it's fun I
like that it very intrigued but now it's
like I'm watching an episode of a great
legal drama and he's gonna go off and do
it and I can't be there to you know
watch it all go down so I'm waiting for
the phone call how'd it go
I probably looked like I applied just a
crap-ton of this powder for as much as
the brush was slipping over my face but
I really put on very little I realize
this is powder foundation type coverage
and so I just like it really lightly all
over even the whole thing out and it's I
like the look can I say I'm gonna do a
little bit contour with my ELF
contour palette I love this little thing
I'm just gonna use my deep contour color
there give myself a little bit of a
cheekbone
any Olympics Watchers in the house what
did you think about the way everything
ended up I love watching the gymnastics
and the swimming and the diving and my
mom and I you know we talk on the daily
on the phone and I swear there's been
like several times I get on the phone
with her and she'll be like yeah how
about Michael Phelps you know I'm just
amazing I just can't get over that
Michael Phelps
no Ryan Lochte I'm not gonna touch that
one no you a little bit of the bronzer
shade but with a slightly larger brush
my ELF brush just kind of warm up the
face a little bit there that can make a
nice little blush too if you just wanted
barely there blush but on this day I
want blush blush so I'm gonna go into
this palette that I haven't really used
enough of it's that Too Faced love flush
blush palette and what's the shade I
should use when I really don't know
where I'm going with my look probably
like this neutral one here this baby you
love mm-hmm I can't decide if that's
quite doing anything maybe not so much
you like get ready with me because this
is really what getting ready with me
it's like though you guys have this too
you know not everything really goes
exactly how you might map it out I'm
gonna do a little love hangover actually
I know I really like that shade little
peach never hurt anybody
I made the other night a pretty
fantastic concoction I am on kind of a
roll with Pinterest recipes okay I've
made like five things that I absolutely
love and one thing that I hated I know
you guys probably want to know the thing
that I hated first all right
it was a mug like a mug pie no a cake
and uh it was a cake in a mug that you
microwaved three ingredients an egg a
ripe banana and like three tablespoons
of cocoa powder put it in the microwave
consistency was great after a minute you
know like oh this is like chocolate lava
cake and I'm getting all excited and
then I take a bite and like this is the
most bitter thing ever
three tablespoons of cocoa was way too
much
you want to toss in a little stevia or
Splenda in maybe just go 1 tablespoon of
cocoa I don't I had to throw in like 5
marshmallows to even make that thing
work highlight is this L'Oreal Lumi True
Match in the shade rose I like to go
between those light shades there but
yeah needless to say unless I alter that
would be quite a bit I'm not gonna be
making that again but the thing that was
really really good recently that I made
and loved was a chicken salad pie it's
kind of like a fusion of potpie and
chicken salad it was so good I'm going I
swear I'm gonna write a blog post about
like these four or five recipes that I
made that I really thought turned out
great I've also got a go-to cookie
recipe that could not be easier that my
mom the cookie Queen thought was just
outstanding so that was great little
hard candy sheer envy primer mister
and then for brows did you know NARS has
some new cream like brow pomade ziz
called brow defining cream there's a
dark dark brown I've used both of these
one is like a near black and one is just
a deep brown this is the one in Elle LSU
I don't know if we've got both a silent
D and a silent F in this word I know
anytime I can't pronounce something
there will be a bunch of y'all in the
comment section who can so you tell me
give me an easy clear pronunciation
guide on that one would you but anyway
this would be the lighter of the two
shades that I just mentioned and I'm
going to use this little brush from
Tarte
so Bell has started going to a little
kids like it's like 18 months to 3 years
old parent me type gymnastics class it's
just kind of like taking them through
the paces of different fun little things
and you know they've got just utilizing
all the different things that they have
they're in the gym like the tumble track
and the foam pit thing is is that
there's usually a lot going on in that
gym at the same time I mean picture this
toddler wide open space you got
cheerleaders practicing over here you
got tumblers working over here I mean
it's like her instinct to just want to
run over to those people and I don't
know like get knocked out by a tumbling
pass maybe just she would just stand and
watch when she gets there but you got my
pregnant self chasing after her like
left and right that's the thing about
this age you know she's not just in
there her and the teacher the parent is
expected to get involved and they really
 you know at this age the the kid
needs some guidance some help some
direction but I can tell you what she
loves to be there and she loves her
teacher Miss Hannah and she loves saying
Miss Hannah do you had a funny situation
last week when I was like she's wearing
her Yadier Molina st. Louis Cardinals
shirt with a number four on it and I'm
like who's number four for the st. Louis
Cardinals it's like when asked any
question the default answer is Miss
Hannah and she's such a little
ringleader because she'll start doing
something at gymnastics and then she'll
make sure you know I'm participating
mommy - Miss Hannah - he's a little boss
already I tell you so I've gotten my
face and my brow done and I'm going to
do a little eye primer why not just go
with what works right
I think for the I look I'm going to
combine a couple new things I got this
little when I had my Sephora order with
the Kat Von D stuff I ordered this
bizarre Theory palette in minks so it's
so pretty
it's got your three shimmers your three
Matt's now I do already have the sultry
music some of these shimmers seems
similar to what was in there but they're
not exactly the thing but anyway I think
I'm gonna need at least the mats from
that palette because I want to use my
metallic or foiled or whatever they were
called shadows from makeup geek here I
think I might Center this look around
the olive because I just don't know I
haven't worked with that type of tone in
a while it feels like but the first
thing I'm gonna do is take this light
creamy matte which I am excited to have
a few matte neutrals from this brand
because while I have the matte vies art
palette that is like what's it called I
have this one the dark matte but I don't
have their matte neutrals so it's nice
to just have a few of those real basic
shades and kind of see you know how good
are they really they're nice and I'm
just working that all over as kind of a
base shade that lightest color very
sheerly then I'm gonna use this brown in
my crease shocker I know
and this pretty green that I have it
says spoiled eyeshadow yeah and the
shade is called gesture and this is my
first time using one of these so I'm
gonna Pat this on my lid
Oh
okay tell the truth who has already
purchased pumpkin spice flavored coffee
and creamer
I have drinking it currently I'm in that
fall mood but I don't want to shut the
pool down you know I want the best of
both worlds okay yeah this is pretty
this is some color I can really get down
with wearing all of greens
beautiful and then I do have this shade
which was one of their I think it was
labeled as a duochrome eye shadow maybe
it's this color called karma you see the
little bit of orange ii yellowy hint of
green almost in that shade I'm gonna
pick up just a hint of that I'm gonna
put it a little bit around the inner
corner it just kind of looks yellowish
I think I want to use my darkest matte
color on the outer part of the eye the
contrast just makes that lid color pop
even more
I'm using now kind of
shade but just this fine crease brush
just to really get it exactly where I
want it i shadow control freak
man just blend and then just a touch of
this again bring that up lightly on the
border
I wore this um a little palette when I
went to the Carrie Underwood concert and
I thought it looked really pretty last
thing I'm gonna do on the top part of
the eye is I just want a little more
green I almost always do this if I've
got kind of a spotlight lid type shade
whether I really need to or not
sometimes I go back and just
re-emphasize that color cuz you never
know you know when you've been blending
around it even if you haven't been
raking over the color sometimes it just
needs to be brought back to life just a
bit staying with makeup geek here this
is the full spectrum eyeliner pencil in
nude just a regular sharpener Bowl nude
shadow pencil or eyeliner pencil it's
been requested that I do a video all
about eyeliners just best in every
former fashion so if you're interested
in that let me know down in the comments
section and then on the under part of
the eye it's gonna be kind of a mix of
my two
matte Browns gonna softly blend that
here and then upper lashline I think I'm
going to do brown it's the deep espresso
shade of the Too Faced sketch marker
I got a brand new mascara that I'm gonna
try in this video it is the l'oreal
voluminous feline instant volume full
density lash must say I love the emerald
green packaging on there here's what it
looks like fairly large wand but the
bristles are pretty short so hopefully
I'll feel like I can really put it in
there with it but I need to curl first
I kind of like that it's not loading on
too much product all at once it seems to
separate pretty nicely see what another
coat can do I'm one of those where a
mascara sometimes the first time I try
it that could be like the worst
experience I have and then as it dries
down and dries down a little bit the
formula thickens up slightly I'll start
to like it even more so that's why you
don't see me doing first impressions on
mascara a whole lot actually don't do
for impressions at all just because I
value the researched and like tried and
tested review you know I don't want to
see that go by the wayside in this
YouTube world
I really respect when people get on and
they've been trying something for you
know days or weeks or heck even months
and they've really got something to
share on it I really value that because
that takes time and you know that time
is valuable and the things you learn
trying a product over time or just flat
out different from the things that you
observe as you first use something
tried-and-true clump crusher water
resistant on my lower lashes just
because I know I can trust it
who'da beauties Samantha false lashes
okay my lashes are on and I think I'm
going to do this
hardest lip paint it's one of the glossy
lip paints and the shade is called
double tap so let's see how this goes
this is like my lip color but a little
bit more brown and a lot bit more shiny
lot--but somebody please use that phrase
today
well there is my finished look I hope
you guys had fun with me here trying out
I guess we had some old things some new
things and just kind of a late summer
glam so thank you for tuning in and I
will see you very soon in my next video
