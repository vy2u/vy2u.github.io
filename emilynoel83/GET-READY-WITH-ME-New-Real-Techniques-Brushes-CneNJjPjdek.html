today I thought I would sit down and do
a little get ready with me video and the
twist on this one is that I'm going to
be using all new brushes from Real
Techniques I placed an order on altas
website they've got a lot of interesting
looking new brushes and I played around
with them a little bit prior to this
video so I have a clue about what I'm
getting into and the way I think I want
to you know work them into my look but
somebody just told me yesterday I miss
your get ready with my videos and so I'm
at least that's the way I thought their
voice sounded in my head so like I miss
them too I want to do one here's the
thing about Real Techniques though it's
like okay they are a drugstore makeup
brush brand you know that they're
drugstore brand and when they started I
feel like everything was in this kind of
like $5 $6 sort of low cost price range
or you might get like a $10 set of
brushes now it's kind of like they're
pulling an elf on us they're getting
some things that are really kind of
pricey I mean I spent $20 on this one
brush from Real Techniques so a
fantastic product is a fantastic product
if you come away feeling like yes it was
worth it then I guess that's fine like
they're just gonna cream but up there it
was the price of some of their things
but I do think you know the brand is
evolving there are still a lot of really
affordable brushes and they're lying
don't get me wrong but they're just
introducing a lot of things that fans of
Real Techniques are gonna want but then
they're gonna be like am I ready to
spend $20 on one brush you want to take
this opportunity to talk about a little
foundation eight splurge and it's the
YSL all ours foundation with SPF 20 got
it here in
b40 sand and this foundation has been
really good for me I don't think it's
like super one-of-a-kind the coverage is
great it's thin it wears really well I
think I might even prefer the staying
power of it over that Giorgio Armani
power fabric but I did put it through
some stuff last weekend and that's why I
wanted to talk about this went to
Dueling pianist thing to which I wore a
sweater dress and I decided I was gonna
dance quite a bit too it's like and I've
got this foundation on and I could feel
the sweat like around my hairline coming
up around my nose and stuff but my
foundation actually looked really good
still at the end of the night I mean my
makeup is a whole and you know the
foundation has a lot to do with that so
there was that the next day I go out to
a football game
yes it's October but it was like upper
80s temperature-wise
sitting in the Sun again with this
foundation and it also wore well and you
guys are saying I thought this was a get
ready with me not just to sit and chat
video but okay I'm gonna put some of
this foundation on and normally you know
I like to patch the product around on my
skin a little bit and I like to do that
because I feel like whether I'm using a
sponge or a brush it's like the product
is there it's not absorbing into my hand
while I wait to blend out a certain area
but I went on the Real Techniques
website and I was watching the little
how-to videos and the ways they
recommended using their certain new
brushes they did say put your foundation
on your hand pick it up with your brush
buffing and circular motions so this is
one of those really dense like this a
little chalk little chunk brush that's
me of my sisters terminology for like
little chubby animals chocolate pen so
this is a chunk and it's the blend and
blur line that's what this is and it's
the base foundation brush and I would
say like I don't have a whole ton of
these brushes I don't have the super
expensive what's the name of the really
pricey ones that came out like this the
paddle style brushes I don't have those
but I've tried like a few knockoffs here
and there I've tried the moto ones which
are really good but I feel like I'm
picking up on with the Real Techniques
first off this is a good size for
foundation it's not massive there's a
lot of taper down the sides too so you
can kind of like work the side of the
brush and feel like you're still getting
blending action anyway I'm going to do
me
and 3/4 pumps of that stuff on my hand
pick up a little bit and we're just
going to start putting it on this way
it's so soft that's going to be a
stiffer feel you know compared to if you
blend with a sigma f80 a lot or
something like that there's some
movement to the bristles but not a ton
get the nose okay screw it I gotta get
some of this on here
hit the tip of my nose as we've talked
about but it really is efficient
blending I feel I think I do actually
still like putting it on my face first
and then blending with this but using a
brush this size your foundation is gonna
be blended out really really quickly I
dig the brush but I look at a brush that
I have kind of similar to this from my
Kate house and it does have a really
similar feeling application and similar
softness to the bristles is this one
worth twenty dollars I'm not so sure the
other thing I wanted to talk about real
quick is the YSL concealer the all ours
concealer which I have in 40 PA - this
is a great consistency of concealer it's
so thin and amazingly full coverage my
problem with this is that it seems to
like dried down a little bit more the
under eye area looks absolutely flawless
like right after I put this on and then
there's just this dryness I feel like
I've talked about this I think I talked
about this in new luxury brands or
luxury products that was trying video so
this for me coverage wise consistency
wise great product but performance wise
keeping my under eye looking nice and
fresh all day long I would say shape
tape wins over this one and here's
something I love I love taking my race
paste I'm gonna call you a race based
even though you got that boying name on
there I might call you a race basis this
is number three I accidentally picked up
number three out of my drawer I usually
use two but this will be fine I can use
either there's just a little deeper
peach but what I was gonna say is this
product under just about any concealer
does not get things cakey um it really
like adds some coverage to under-eye
darkness and just camouflaging the
under-eye darkness really but it doesn't
mess with any concealer that I put on
top and I love that and I also have the
cheek brush from this line but I'm going
to use this first as a concealer like
see how small it is they had a few
different sizes like I think they had
they have a contour one or one
specifically labeled contour I can't
remember but this size appealed to me
because I thought maybe I can use that
for concealer too so I'm letting out the
array space
we're gonna top it off with some of the
shake tables it's like my full coverage
under I that I'm currently loving so
that helps darkness tremendously then I
take my light medium doesn't take a lot
stuff as potent a little bit out in
there a little bit out here and a tidbit
around the nose then I'm gonna tried
this brush for that as well this is my
first time using this brush with shape
tape mm-hmm it's getting me a great like
spread all throughout this area like I
didn't apply much product but you can
see it's really covering a large surface
area with this brush because you know
the brush is sort of big for concealer
then I'm going to kind of blend around
the edge
thought this was gonna be harder to get
around my inner corner of my eye but
it's actually totally getting there the
cavern folks it's getting in the
catalogue okay this has been good it's
been a pretty good experience here with
this breath how much was this one
compared to the big honkin twenty dollar
foundation brush okay yeah they do have
one that's called contour that's a
little bigger than this that's 1699 and
this cheek brush is 1699 as well and
then they have something called blended
blur shadow brush that's smaller yet
compared to this the other line of
brushes that's new
it's called insta pop and these I think
are designed to work really well with
loose powders but if you go on the Real
Techniques website which I highly
recommend doing going on there and
looking at the different videos that
they have made that accompany the
brushes like I mean they're really good
about showing you the actual tutorials
and like this is the insta pop face
brush they were using this I think with
liquid foundation for example but this
is also for concentrated coverage using
loose powders designed for full coverage
setting baking and powder application
there is an extreme taper for
concentrated application look at that I
love that shape I actually have a brush
from Tarte that I talked about years ago
and I don't know that this was I think
they sold this alongside a foundation
once that it's this fabulous shape
really really steep taper but extremely
soft I'm sure I would like applying
foundation like a liquid foundation with
this but I'm gonna try it today for
stamping on some powder so I got my
Laura Mercier this is probably my
favorite loose powder for baking
purposes I'm gonna just pick up a good
amount on this brush and see how how it
does like I'm getting a decent amount of
powder on there but it's not really in
here there's a little more I think I
just picked up more on my brush here I'm
in a small powder cloud right now
for me I actually I would see this it's
kind of adequate for baking or as I like
to say I sometimes microwave I don't
always use all the product many people
do for baking on their skin but it
doesn't really like just straight up
pack on the product like a sponge does
you know if I take a flat edge like the
Real Techniques you know sponge and dip
into here and went pat pat pat I would
have you know that thick layer of baking
going on and here I was dipping into a
lot of powder but as you could see it
was still giving me I don't know a light
ish amount I still suspect that this
brush is gonna be fantastic for a
foundation application and this is
$10.99 a little bit closer to what I
would expect to pay for a Real
Techniques brush and it's a big one too
there are a lot of bristles there so
while that's semi baking right there I'm
gonna go ahead and do my eyebrows and
this is my ELF
instant lift brow pencil and the shade
is neutral brown if you need to just
like pick up a quick super cheap and
because this is two-dollar brow pencil
this is a great option it's so good for
my hair color the other day I did that
video about like blending mistakes I
sometimes make and just oversights ways
you know you get kind of casual with
putting your makeup on and in that very
video like as I was editing I was so
frustrated with my eyebrows because one
of my eyebrows just looked totally off
from the other like case in point here's
another thing I do wrong but I could
didn't even realize it until I was in
the editing stages
you know what I am loving to listen to
either in the early mornings like when
I'm nursing Eve or you know whenever
there's time maybe during a nap time
where you've got another task you're
doing when you can kind of just turn
something on and listen I love listening
to Oprah's supersoul podcast so good so
many just wonderful insightful points of
view I feel like when I listen to one of
those I come away with like just some
tips on how to live a more connected
life to the people around me gaining a
better understanding of why I do the
things I do you know just explain it but
she just talks to some really really
wise Souls out there and people who have
had a lot of different experiences and
of course I love Bernie Brown to I've
listened to her book the audiobook on
her new braving the wilderness book
which I would really recommend I think
that one's great also the book I can't I
don't know when she wrote this I think
it's quite a bit older but it was a
pretty quick listen and the gifts have
been perfect parenting that's a really
good one too lots of great insights for
some reason when I'm facing this way and
doing my brows into this little mirror
with this light in front of me like I
feel like I've got different brows than
I do when I'm looking that way and just
getting ready I don't normal day you
know what is that does your setting ever
totally throw you off when you're trying
to do different makeup stuff so I just
kind of get them get them evened out a
bit brush through grab some sort of gel
I'm kind of in a stage of just trying to
use up some brow gel products so this
makeup forever
number 35 it has some tint to it and I'm
not using it because I'm like wild about
it I'm just trying to sort of up and
there's what I do with it like every
time I'm having deja vu it was there not
another video where I did that exact
same thing the brush is huge
we don't need that size of brush I get
like browse stage-fright
you know and I've also noticed when I go
back to edit videos what I'm trying to
narrate myself doing something like I
got quiet down my voice gets quite a bit
quieter I think it's like I'm just so
into whatever I'm doing I can't quite
like
talk in full voice so this brush as I
touch it here it's like it feels so
light even though this is a dense brush
you know but compared to the feeling you
get off of one of these this has so much
you know movement and flexibility so I'm
actually just gonna use that to sweep
across my under eye here and just get
rid of any excess powder that might have
been there and then I think I might do a
little cream contour because I want to
try this brush the same one I did for
concealer on just some contour around my
face so I got this stick from Maybelline
I've used this before this little half
in half stick I don't like it's super
practical because I think if you really
use one side more than the other it's
gonna wear down kind of funky but I do
like the tone of this cream contour and
then just take this little guy buff it
in really easy
but back to the Oprah podcast when
people are discussing happiness the
thing that comes up again and again is
gratitude and appreciation and the
ability to just really feel that
appreciation at all levels like not just
for the big things in your life like
your family or your homework whatever
but the little things too just seeing
that beauty and that wonder in you know
the sunrise in the morning or the leaves
on the ground or whatever it might be
the people who are operating in that
state of appreciation and gratitude tend
to be the happiest and I think that's
really just I don't know a good point to
keep in mind there's so much to be
thankful for and you spend too much time
on social media it's just there's a lot
of noise you know it's not bad noise
sometimes it's a lot of great noise and
a lot of uplifting good feelings but
then sometimes I get on Twitter and I
feel like it's an outlet for youtubers
to complain to their followers about
their followers in a way does Twitter
not feel that way to you at times it's
just become kind of this dumping ground
for a youtuber to make some kind of
vague statement about negativity or
whatever and it just kind of makes me
feel like blah I know we all just want
to be heard we all want to be understood
the way we're feeling and things like
that but I think sometimes the better
way to work with that energy is to come
at it with more of a like look at all
the things in life there are to
appreciate I'm not gonna send my
negativity that I'm feeling in this
moment out to thousands of people I'm
gonna try to really walk the walk and
focus on positive things I don't know
just something I've been thinking about
just the thoughts that are going through
my head I right now I've got the contour
on I want just a little bit of bronzer
but I don't know that I have any brush
that's quite loose enough to give me a
soft look with bronzer so I'm gonna use
my ELF complexion brush use that that I
use this all the time and I'm using this
trublend bronzer from covergirl just you
know light bronzing this bronzer has
kind of a glow to it it appears to have
that baked look in the compact but it's
surprisingly soft you know it's not too
dry
the other instapass that I have are one
of the others is this cheek brush and
this again says for concentrated
application of loose pigment blush but
then again on the tutorial video I'm
pretty sure they just used regular blush
and I don't use a lot of loose blushes
anyway so I think I'm just going to use
this with standard blush I do think the
way this brush is this could potentially
pick up a lot of product even though
there is a taper there's just a large
surface area there that could pick stuff
up so I think you do want to be careful
about the intensity of blush your going
into it this guy and I am going to have
probably very soon some tarte holiday
reviews so I'm sort of getting a feel
for this blush palette here I think I'm
gonna go for this more neutral kind of
dusty peach oh yeah that did pick up a
lot of product
it's a nice application of blush for my
cheeks eyes this is a good it's hitting
a good surface area I'm not so sure I'm
need to brush this against for blush on
the daily
actually you know what I'm picturing
this brush being great for like this
particular size concealer like stamping
on the concealer spreading it out would
that not be really perfect right in here
yeah now there's gonna be a part to get
ready with me where I use these brushes
in other ways but yeah that's a pretty
blush shade I think I want even more
depth I mean go down to this one here's
Mavi shade both of these are matte by
the way
I think I'm going to go ahead and use
this for a highlight as well so I'm
going to use this highlight that's on
the same side as those blushes and I'm
using like part of the brush I only
loaded down like the top tip of the
brush
not as good for highlight as a smaller
brush like my Mota highlight and glow
brush but this wasn't precisely designed
to be a highlighting brush either so
there's that
then my Milani make it last look how
much I've used of this lately like I've
really truly been trying to give this a
good shot the last I don't know week and
a half or so and it did use it on both
of those days where I mentioned I had
really good staying power of my makeup
the event where I danced my ass off in a
sweater dress and also the 85 degree
October football game I was wearing this
both of those times and it's like where
does the credit go does the credit feel
mostly to the foundation I mean I've
seen that foundation do good things even
without this but did this help did this
play a role I think it might have and so
many of you by the way when I was
talking about this in my target
best-sellers video you were like yes
that stuff is amazing I saw so much
positive feedback for that spray in the
comments section okay so the insta pop
line also has I brush is I'm pretty sure
I've got the entire instant line the
face brush the cheek brush and then add
I brush duo and it says for concentrated
application of loose pigment shadows but
again I watched the tutorial on the Real
Techniques website you can use them
really for anything so the duo that you
get is an insta pop shade brush and an
insta pop crease brush turn them
sideways and you can see you know the
characteristic of this whole line is
that great little angle and that is kind
of unique right let me get you in it
truly is a unique shape I think for eye
brushes compared to a lot of what I have
and as you can see they've got shadow on
them I was using them a little bit
yesterday I found there some really
interesting ways you can use like this
smaller one in particular on the lower
lash line I may be doing some of that
well I'm going to try to do is see how
much I can stick to just these instapass
brushes just to see how much they can
handle on their own and I do need some
eye primer so this guy coming out to
play
I think I'm gonna hit up the pumpkin
patch for the second time this season
how what I'm gonna use here is the
tartlet toasted and honestly like it's
pretty okay it's a pretty color scheme
you look at it and you think yes that's
all wearable not particularly uncommon
stuff but I don't know I've only used it
once I'm just not as head-over-heels for
this as I am for a lot of other palettes
that are coming out around this time of
year I am going to have kind of a big
palette round up over a very specific
type of palette I'm seeing coming out
again and again it's gonna be a good
video keep an eye out for it but this
one it's like yes I like it but what I
really advise people to spend their
hard-earned money on something with
shades that are pretty dang common in
the scope of today's eyeshadows I don't
know but I'm taking the bigger of the
two instapass brushes so I'm gonna go
into the shade called latte and I'm
going to just flip that brush over and
start wedging this shade in the crease
this video truly I'm trying to
concentrate a little bit more on what my
brushes are doing than exactly like what
the shadow is doing I really like the
way this brush wedges in there you know
I'm just dabbing and the brush is sort
of doing the work
I hear an owl outside oh it's full we've
got a lot of trees behind our house and
we see so much wildlife back there
you're just walking through at any time
a day okay see that I think that's a
decent crease situation there and then I
just kind of rubbed the brush off on my
hand a little bit and I'm using this to
buff over my edge and then I'm going to
do a highlight it with smore right up
here
now I'm gonna wipe off this smaller
brush here real well and I'm going to go
into sunset so this is my smaller of the
two insta pop brushes and I'm gonna use
this for lid shadow I love the size of
this brush and I like how what I'm just
kind of using that point it can get me
anywhere like that can take me around my
tear duct and then this shade called
sunrise seems to be kind of a satiny
finish I'm gonna take that around my
inner corner that little splash it right
now I also want to put some flame on
there to put some flame kind of right
here in the middle so we're overlapping
the gold a bit too this is my pumpkin
patch clamp
both Bella and Eve seem to love that so
much and Belle likes picking out the
pumpkins and there's like a play area
with the slide and everything like that
she's all for it and then Eve just likes
riding around in the little pumpkin
wagon cart I think it feels weird to
call him Belle and Eve in this video
honestly their names are Nick and a
little bit
yes let's give the children beautiful
names and then just nickname them
everything else under the Sun now fire
side down here I thought maybe that was
gonna be a plum and I thought it was
really gonna love it it really is just a
very dark brown fYI I'm gonna use the
same brush that I've been using with
that color nice and dark I tell you what
this brush is a dream if you've got
small eyes - I think you would love this
for placement precise placement the
ability to work that just the end of it
around in different ways is so nice
okay now I'm think I'm going to take the
larger of the two and just kind of hit
the edge again of what I just did
so I'm practically using the larger as
not only a crease blush brush but also a
blender sort of I also want just a
little bit of warmth this color is
called warmth right here I'm gonna take
a little bit of that right out in this
zone oh so pretty
yeah like I can't deny the palette is
pretty but dang there's so much of this
thing out there this kind of thing okay
now for my lower lashline I'm going to
use the dark brown and I am using only
the tip to pick up this product so just
like that and then look at how great
this is right in here oh this is my
answer like I was just talking about
wanting a really nice soft lower
lashline a lot of times and look at how
quickly and easily that did that that
feeling when you're falling in love with
a new makeup brush I think I'm gonna
blend in a little bit of warmth as well
just right over that oh it's so smoky so
nice
except I need some black liquid liner
I'm gonna use my NYX matte liquid liner
because I'm running out of my Jordana
and I don't want to open a new tube yet
and this one as I said in my best in
beauty video I'm gonna come a little bit
ticked about the way this brush is
because I feel like I have to hold it
just so it's flat sort of on one side if
you hold it at one certain way it's
gonna be a little wider instead of just
being one fine point I'm picky about the
eyeliner I know
this morning Eve slept till 5:00
it was great she's got this thing where
she just wants to get up at 3:30 and
start just not in an all-out cry but
sort of like a Moni sort of like but the
goal for her I guess for me you know to
get work done in the early mornings is
for her to wake up around five or five
something would be nice and then I feed
her put her back down she goes ahead and
sleeps until about 8:00 and that's when
I do work I get a lot of questions like
are you filming at night or in the
morning and I shoot videos in the
morning truly though if I tried to do
these videos at the end of my day I
think I would be really sucked for
energy
I think I'm reaching that point where I
need to step away from the eyeliner
that's as good as it's gonna get I'm
gonna do a little brightening on my
lower inner rim this is my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight if you're
looking to wake up your eyes put that in
your inner rim boom I'm just waking up
my soul that move yes don't tell I'm
bringing in one more brush I do need my
angled brush and this darkest color just
because I don't like the way the edge of
my eyeliner looks over here was a little
rough the edge of this wing so I need to
smooth that out at least they put in a
nice dark brown shade in this palette I
tried quite a few palettes these days
and they're lacking something really
really dark it can just be one with your
eyeliner when you're looking to blend it
out a little foreshadowing there from my
upcoming review on several ballots then
we're gonna curl the lashes this is like
the mascara that won't get used up like
I use it and use it and I feel like it's
still super rich with product in there
it's the essence lash princess sculpted
volume and it does kind of make my
lashes look really long and big but it's
not as good about holding a curl but I
am gonna put on some falsies today
anyway so it's okay we go to a weekly
story our thing in our library is really
great and Belle enjoys it to pieces and
the other day we were at
and there's you know one segment of it
is the stories there's little songs and
stories and whatnot and then you go into
another room for crafts and a snack and
we're walking between the two rooms and
Bell kind of stops in her tracks like
there's a flow of parents and kids and
she just kind of stops and people are
kind of looking at her like what kind of
moving around her and she's staring into
these rows of books in the main part of
the library it's just like there's no
ladders here and I had forgotten that
she has one of these little toys as
little people thing that has a sliding
ladder that goes across a bookshelf and
we got into this big discussion about
how you know sometimes in libraries you
can't reach the top books so they have
ladders and they roll and she was really
expecting to see one of those in the
library and when she didn't it was like
she was kind of shocked and maybe
disappointed I don't know because she
was like holding up all these people who
are just trying to get from point A to
point B and this kids like flabbergasted
that there's no ladder in the library
For Lashes today I'm gonna use some of
those number 43 s what was the brand
cream shop that I talked about in my eye
Kate House retail therapy Hall video I'm
going to clip those on and then I will
join you back here for lips okay guys I
would say that's not too bad for a to
brush I look like I mean considering
that's crease that's lower lashline that
was everything but just like that little
part under the wing there pretty happy
with that now for lips I got this
bareMinerals send send nudes set that I
want to try out it's the gen nude matte
liquid lip color which I love this
formula you're getting three full sizes
the shades are Swank that's the deepest
the middle one is XYZ and then the
lightest is hint and I thought that was
gonna be like crazy light on the website
but it's still I think a very wearable
shade in itself yesterday I wore the
middle one today I think I'm gonna do
this and maybe I will work in a little
bit of the lighter one too so this one's
called Swank hmm look at that this is
gonna be pretty
I just love the texture these are so
velvety
now what do I do do I mess with it do I
add a little bit of the lightest color
right in the center I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to hold myself back I'm
gonna try to do it with my finger though
cuz I don't want to mess up the product
that's on the inside you know by
blending the applicator into the darker
stuff okay it can be done with the
finger real look at that see I love a
matte lip
that doesn't look crusty or strange
that feels good does anybody else do
that anytime they take their hair down
from something it's like you just get in
there to the scalp
happy with the finished look I feel very
fall I think I could have gotten the I
look from any number of different
palates I don't think you need to like
rush out and buy the tartlet toasted off
the lip color
love love love I'm gonna get so much
good out of that trio but as far as the
brushes go that's really kind of the top
story of this video yeah we had these
two which I use for foundation and then
concealer and my cream contour I'm not
like jumping up and down for these I
think there are so many affordable
knockoffs of this style of brush I think
you could spend less and really get the
same kind of effect elsewhere this one I
kind of liked a little better you know I
did enjoy the effect on my concealer and
I thought it lended well it got to my
inner corner surprisingly well but I
still really like just using a flat
foundation brush to blend out my shape
tape so I don't see it as super
essential these brushes the insta pop
though like these and this duo - this
could have been my whole face because I
could have used this for foundation
which I'm very eager to do because I
know I like that shape for foundation
and then this could have been contour
blush highlight this really I think
could be nice for concealer as well and
heck I probably could be content with
this size of brush for foundation too so
if one of these two had to go I mean I
might use this for all sorts of stuff
all over my face ooh maybe that'll be a
future video of this brush for every
face thing I need to do but I do love
the shape that they're working with here
I don't think I like this as much for
baking as I would for a foundation
application though but the real MVP as
they say I think is the I brush duo the
insta pop eye brushes I really wanted to
see you know if these could do a full
eye look and they totally could the
shape is fantastic I mean I think you're
gonna get a lot of use out of the bigger
one for hitting that crease area and
then just kind of blending around your
look and we haven't even mentioned the
fact that these synthetic brushes are
great for cream shadows - so you're
working in some of those L'Oreal paints
or whatever cream shadows you like to
use these would be great for that as
well
but this smaller one is an absolute
godsend like this was great for shadow
on the lid the outer corner the lower
lash line it can do it all and these are
probably yeah the most affordable thing
okay these are 990
and so was the cheek brush 999 but here
you're getting two and they are just
rock stars so thank you guys so much for
taking time to hang out with me today
I'm sure this will turn out to be a
really long video so if you're still
here at the end thank you very much I
would love to have you as a subscriber
to my channel if you want to get
continual updates when there's a new
video go for the alerts as well that's a
big key because sometimes YouTube just
keeps people out of your subscription
