me in this video I'm going to use some
products from this big stack of makeup
that's sitting in front of me are so
many new products launching for summer
so I wanted to just kind of take this
opportunity to try a bunch of them on
for you a lot of the stuff I've actually
been using a little bit here and there
so I may have some experiences to share
along the way that I've had with these
things and I feel like these kinds of
videos are coming out like left and
right on youtube so I wasn't really sure
if I wanted to do it but I thought yeah
I do personally want to do this I know
I've got a lot of drugstore here but
there may be a few high-end things mixed
in
case in point I'm going to use this
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
the radiance version with hyaluronic
acid so that's the newest one that
they've come out with it says
illuminates perfects and enhances
radiance while hydrating for a better
makeup application and this does have a
pretty I don't know pronounced glowy
look to it yesterday when I put it on I
thought wow it's kind of reminding me of
maybe like a Mac strobe cream type of
texture maybe a little bit less
moisturizing than that but I already do
have some moisturizer on today I'm
wearing my Kiehl's SPF 30
now foundation I'm using I'm really up
in the air about this one cuz I wasn't
really a huge fan of it the first time I
put it on I don't know the application
which is kind of funky but we'll just
we'll just experience this together
right now it's the Revlon Youth FX fix
and blur foundation here I go rabbit
mode I'm going to sneeze bless me this
has SPF 20 I have it in the shade nude
it is a squeezy tube foundation okay
something about that voice that I just
made it reminded me of the that
caterpillar character and Alice in
Wonderland like there's a movie I had
not watched for god knows how long like
I must have been a child when the last
time I watched Alice in Wonderland just
the cartoon you know the Disney cartoons
and the other day like I was noticing
that that was available on Apple TV and
so I got it for Belle to watch and that
movie is so freakin weird like the that
caterpillar is creepy as heck Tweedledee
and Tweedledum like what I mean it's fun
and all because it's so imaginative and
everything but it's just like some of
the things like who thought this up and
what were they doing while they thought
it up you know okay so I patch this
around all over the first time I applied
it I really wanted to feel the texture
of it you know so I blended it in with
my fingers and this definitely has like
some thickness to it and so today I
thought maybe it would benefit from
being bounced in with a Beauty Blender
or this is my NYX sponge which I love so
much
the coverage on this is really not
terrible but it just it has a thick feel
like when you touch your face even after
this is all blended in it's like wow I
really feel some makeup on there if it's
going to actually still as it says fill
some areas I guess it needs some
thickness right
up some fine lines here in my forehead
so maybe I'll be able to assist whether
or not those are getting filled
and this is the way I felt the first
time I put it on like it's hydrating as
it seems like it is it's as much
richness as the foundation seems like it
has when you first start putting it on
excuse me like my dry areas around my
eyebrows it's definitely kind of clay
into those and it's for sure like a
medium coverage product too because I'm
seeing a lot through it a lot of redness
still through it a lot of just like
little discoloration through it I don't
really want to pile on and build up more
product because of how thick it feels
but the odd thing about this was the
other day when I was wearing it and I
looked at myself later in the day my
makeup actually seemed like it was in
pretty good shape
you know like it didn't seem like it
totally melted off my skin which was
what I might have expected for as thick
as it feels let's move on let's try this
Revlon you that bags still in blur
concealer and this I got in the shade
fair because I wanted it to be super
brightening and it clicks here and comes
up through this little spongy bit right
at the top which I click it way too many
times first and I because I just used to
having to click click click click click
and it was like streaming down the sides
the first time I used it and I'm just
going to dab this around here it's kind
of feeling like the Maybelline instant
age rewind but a little bit smaller you
know just this application style and
since it is so like so much lighter I'm
going to use a little bit up here a
couple more clicks I just don't like it
when things don't immediately respond to
the clicks and you're like how many
times do I have to keep clicking and
then this sponge this next sponge is so
cool I like to kind of put my finger on
the flat side when I'm doing concealer
and use that other side to blend in the
product and then I may use something
else to get at that innermost corner
last time I used this little foundation
concealer combo I kind of preferred the
concealer over the foundation I mean
don't you feel like that kind of covered
and brightened pretty well
bring in this little Sigma brush here
like so much is happening in my life
right now my parents who you know they
live about normally five and a half or
so hours away from me they bought a
house near us down here so I think
that's a really basic it's gonna be so
great to just have them closer and they
can see the girls more I don't know just
kind of help me out a little bit more -
I'd certainly welcome some grandparents
near us and they still are keeping their
house back home you know back in our
hometown which is cool because you know
they'll go back there periodically and
be some family gatherings up there I'm
sure it's kind of like a home base I
suppose but it will be awesome to have
them down here and they just yesterday
closed on it so they got some things and
they're getting some furniture in and
then I'm not sure when this video is
going to get posted but the following
week then we're going on vacation to
Florida so I'm kind of preparing for
that as well and in the midst of all
this I know Bub's got a trip that he's
got to make to Chicago for work so I
feel like I just got people constantly
going in all directions around here so
okay there's that concealer um a head on
you know pretty good effect pretty
brightening I can't take that away from
it but I'm still seeing a little
something darkness wise here so I'm
wondering if I can get away with
building it up just a little bit more
the first time I used this I had
actually used a corrector first like a
peachy color corrector and that helped
but today I was just wanting to see how
well it could do on its own some days
the circle they're just a little worse
than others but it wasn't like I didn't
sleep last night I actually got a great
night's sleep Eve you know slept through
the night and I just I didn't get to bed
all that late I just was really in the
sleep because if I got up I feel like
I've been sleeping for days okay here's
another drugstore new thing that I'm
going to use it's the Maybelline fit me
loose finishing powder and I got this in
the shade fair just because I really
wanted it to kind of be brightening and
maybe be something that could be similar
to the Laura Mercier you know and this
is what it looks like so you know I just
has a hint of color basically as
with this and it was good but not great
on top of like three different
concealers I was feeling like the
initial look was pretty good but it
definitely developed more dryness than
I'm used to as the day goes on so I'm
going to just try to do a little light
amount of this powder using my Smashbox
number 10 dress here shaking it off and
I'm just going to lightly go over this
and we'll see how we like the finished
look and I'll definitely keep an eye on
the way this looks as the day goes on it
seems to be kind of a nice feeling
powder you know it's very lightweight
adds a little bit of coverage which I
like and it's definitely matte
and then all over my face I got this
infallible pro glow long-wear Demi glow
finish air light texture with
highlighter I've used this a few times
I'm not sure if I'm really seeing the
effect from it has a little guide here
on the back and it says the finish is
glowy but it's not said Danny Matt Oh
Demi glow
Chloe Finnish medium coverage air light
texture you can see this sort of beige
colored powder and then up top it does
have a little powder with some flecks of
sparkle in it it's not like a pearly
powder it's not like you swatch it out
and you see like a ton of glow you just
look really closely at it looks like a
matte powder with little flecks of
shimmer that's probably why I'm not
really seeing a ton of glow for this on
my skin and then it does have a sponge
and a little mirror underneath there I
think the packaging is cute I'm going to
use a little bit of the bottom part here
and just kind of go over the parts of my
face where I didn't do the under eye
setting powder
and I think I'll kind of I guess use a
little bit of this top part that seems
to pick up a little more heavily on my
brush it's like the other powders a
little more firmed but honestly I'm not
seeing like a super glowy effect from
this are you guys I think that was more
like a true highlight with a little more
pearlescent quality to it then I think
you'd really see something but this just
looks like it just looks like matte
powder actually if I do look close I can
see some of those little sparkles and I
also have a couple shades of the pro
glow concealer but I couldn't like use
every concealer Under the Sun today so
I'll save that for another video so you
remember when Maybelline came out with
that master blush palette and I thought
like wow they're really stepping up
their game blush wise well now they have
a master bronze palette and this one has
four shades one is kind of like a cool I
think contour type color on my skin this
one's a little bit warmer bronzer and it
does have some little flecks of shimmer
and then - glowy shades one that can
definitely be a highlight and one that's
more of a beige a little bit of a peachy
beige subtle glow I'm going to use this
to contour with since this shade is
clearly able to do that I mean I've been
using this for about a week and a half
now and it definitely does the job in
that way it's kind of subtle
you know I feel like the powder is
pigmented but I don't have to be ultra
careful about like just barely dipping
in you know I'm just pixel up casually
and get it here on the hollow of the
cheek I am so excited for Destin I
cannot wait to be sitting on the beach
getting buried in the sand just various
Beach shenanigans what's your favorite
thing to do on the beach
we've got like some buckets for Bill and
II like little five-month Eve's going to
be building the same castle but it sells
going to get a kick out of that for sure
and like looking for shell and if you
live in or visit the Destin area very
awesome like do you have any favorite
little restaurants or local places to
check out let me know okay so again I'm
just taking that same contour shade and
just working it around the perimeter of
my face the under the cheekbones and
then I like to take this Fuller Brush
the self complexion brush and go into
the shade that seems like the official
bronzer of the group and I take that a
little bit more on top of my cheeks I
think this product is a strong like for
me but maybe not a love simply because
I've already I feel like I've got a lot
of different bronzers I've got a lot of
different contour shades and highlights
I don't know while it's a nice little
product to have some of these different
tones all in one it's not one of those
things that's screaming like a necessity
at me but I'm just trying to warm up the
face a little bit so I'm putting that
bronzer shade everywhere and I kind of
like mix across the two and I use that I
just kind of down my neck and chest I
will tell you a bronzer that I've really
been impressed with lately I just
recently got it because it came in a
package from Too Faced and I had never
tried it it's not like brand new on the
market but it's their baked luminous
glow bronzer in sweet tea um kind of
interesting tones in this now this seems
a little bit golden but it seems so
perfect on the skin and it's like really
pigmented and just enough glow and I've
heard some people say great things about
this but now after I've tried it on
blanket
there's something to that's a really
nice bronzer like it makes my skin look
downright tropical and exotic but
without too too much shine but certainly
not mad either it's just a nice level of
globe next I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my skin I think from this
palette and then pop some blush on top
so I've got this glowy astrayed here I
recall really liking the highlight that
was in the blush palette and this one's
pretty good too like can give you some
shine there
so until that blush palette that I
mentioned I've always kind of criticized
Maybelline on their blushes I've always
thought they were really hard to pick up
any color from well mount guess what
they've reformulated the whole line of
those fit me blushes and they're coming
out looking like this and there's no
brush included they've realized like
they're not going to deliver on a good
brush so it's just going to leave it out
that I got two shades I just looking at
these on ulties website and pick the
ones that I thought I'd liked the best
and I really do like these this one is
nude right over here and it's got kind
of a satin finish they both do you know
I wouldn't really call it tons of
shimmer because it just doesn't
translate that way on my skin that's
just a you know a soft little tiny bit
of glow and this one is called wine love
this this is a great just rosy glow this
is the blush Snow White would have
bought definitely a might a mother of a
two-year-old girl yes I am okay this is
nude I'm going to pop this on first I
mean these are leaps and bounds better
than what they used to have and see how
this is giving me just this nice little
I don't know very very natural just hint
of blush color here it looks like such a
natural glow man doesn't blush just make
you happy like you see blush on your
skin versus no blush and like yes that
was necessary and then I'm going to use
a little bit of this wine color
like I said Snow White's favorite shade
and take this just right here really
working that outer part of the Apple and
kind of pulling it back just a bit oh
that shade is gorgeous oh my gosh like
nude is pretty but that's doing what I
think a lot of colors can do this the
row thenis of this other shade is just
mmm juicy now here's what I want to do
since I got a little excited I'm going
to take just a bare brush or brush that
might have a little remaining powder on
it and just cut it you can go over that
a little bit it's easy to get a little
intense when you love a blush
but again I was going on top of
highlight with this blush so I can still
see a little bit of glow but it's not
too crazy while so excited to find those
blushes for sure then I want to take
some of my Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe cucumber and
green tea just miss that about for miss
all over my skin think some of that's
fallen down in my coffee over there okay
and a couple more like basically pointed
directly over my eye area
despite the light amount of powder I put
over that area up close things are
looking a little thick on the under I
can tell you about a new brow product
that I'm not going to use in this video
it's the brow stylist kabuki Blender
it's like a really soft kind of like
waxy pomade stick and on the other end
is kind of like a thick little brush and
you're supposed to you know take that
over your brows and my brows just like
eat this stuff up there's I get so much
product in there they end up looking so
thick might be a good thing for some
people but just not for me
so I'm going to use one older favorite
for brows in this video and one other
new thing but this is the precisely my
brow pencil number four I've been using
this a lot from benefit just because I
think it's a very OnPoint shade for me
and it's just I don't know really easy
to use I feel pretty much the same about
it as I do most of the fine tip pencils
like if this were a brow Wiz or this
word NYX micro brow I feel like I could
kind of you know switch them out there's
nothing like over-the-top different
about this it just happens to be the
right shade right now and this is the
one that I have you know so that's the
one I'm using
oh and L'Oreal has those brow stylist
definers which are great too and they're
a skinny pencil
so I just add a little bit of that in
there and I use the brush side to go
through my dealing with allergies I'll
feel like I gotta sneeze all the time
this morning
we've got all systems go finally with
our pool we had a new part put in and
that water is the clearest cleanest most
wonderful like there's something that
just makes me so happy when I look out
there and I think yes everything's
working oh man but did you hear about my
water heater adventure yesterday good
lord if we go down in the basement we'll
actually um mom was down there because
she had a few things she was getting out
of our like furnace room area the area
of our house was like the controls there
you know it's got the big AC unit it's
got two water heaters she had her shoes
off and she stepped and she comes
upstairs she's like you should know that
there's some water and then Jay smells
like totally the last thing you want to
hear at 10 o'clock at night so bubs
immediately likes shop vac in water up
and putting down a fan next day called
three different places and there was a
guy who could come out and see it that
afternoon and he was great shout out to
a NW in that grade my favorite brand of
diet root beer is also a plumber and he
said we were definitely in for a new
water heater the one the other one was
still working fine for now he got us all
fixed up and now we're just in the
process of drying out kind of a section
of carpet that's I don't know it's a
pretty decent section that got wet but
fortunately there wasn't anything
sitting on it we just moved a few things
out now we've had got three fans blowing
on it and just shot backing water up
periodically so if you ever dried out
carpet and it's a little bit of a
process but it can be done the new thing
I mentioned using in my brows is this
makeup forever brow gel this is the kind
of thing I think somebody with really
sparse brows might love because and by
the way I have this in shade 35 goo I
just got some goop on my fingers but I
feel like this thing has a ton of little
fibers in here that would attach to your
brows and make them look thicker that's
kind of a long brush and it's more
tapered here toward the end so I kind of
use that little tapered end and just
take that part through my brows that's
kind of nice hold and
some tint I just try not to get too much
product in because just like right there
I happen to lay down too much so I have
to brush that on through so that was
definitely my point with this is that
the size of the brush it can hold a lot
of product
whatever this is real life we'll see how
the I look turns out and see how much I
need to redo that I'm going to pop on
Old Faithful here Milani eyeshadow
primer is it just takes a little bit of
this product sometimes I think people
way way over use eyeshadow primers like
put on way way too much and then wonder
why it's creasing so just do what you
need to cover the surface go into your
crease up to the brow to the point where
your skin only feels lightly tacky and
then you're at the sweet spot of eye
primers even if you're not using Milani
like whatever you're putting on there
don't overuse it doesn't take a lot if
you like this brow is like screaming at
me right now
got a little micellar water on a pad
here oh that's definitely picking up
some product
I'm trying people I'm trying and off my
brush here fair brush and brush through
it didn't mean to bring you guys like a
major brow fiasco in this in this video
I really kind of wanted brows to like
just naturally happen and be kind of a
back seat but routs decided to jump up
and say hey I want to be the star of the
show who want to take over this video
okay maybe the less I touch them the
better today maybe that's what they're
trying to tell me
revealed matte palette Coastal Scents
has put out another palette
how many shades are in these anyway one
two three all think there are 20 shades
in here and you got your rich colors
your like and transitioning kind of
colors there are berries there are warm
shades there are topes they're Browns
but not too heavy on the Browns you'll
notice like I'm not picking up on a ton
except for like these couple here and
maybe just like a little bit of a light
brown I'm going to do first is just get
like some base color going on my lids
and go use this shade right here and
just kind of brush this all over I've
used this palette several times and I've
been really really impressed they've got
some great pigmentation here and really
nice light shades as well
I took a dark shade the other day over
most of my lid and decided I would just
kind of pop one of these brightest
colors like maybe it was this pinky tone
shade right here
just pop that on the inner part of the
lid now it's like that almost looks like
a shimmer because it's so strong it's
like glowing on top of my lid but it's
not sure you know it's a matte shadow
it's just a really pronounced matte that
was creating so much contrast but I just
picked this brush up off the floor with
my toes okay what direction do I want to
go I haven't used this plum yet so I
think that plum is calling my name today
but I want to work in some warmth too
I think I'm going to go with this um
this brown a little bit in my crease I
was truly deep down loving the all matte
looks for quite some time here and then
I just had different shimmery things
that I wanted to try you know
so shimmer sort of worked its that way
back into my eye life but getting this
palette out I'm like yes I really do
love a good all matte I look now Urban
Decay had that naked what they call it
ultimate basics
I don't talk about that one a whole heck
of a lot like I liked it but no it
wasn't like an instant love affair
happening this one you know for the
value of it what did I spent on this
$9.99 I got it like right when it came
out so I think they did have some kind
of deal going I mean you're just getting
so much here so I think the value is
certainly better than buying the Urban
Decay one okay so I got my crease go in
there and I think I do want to work that
purple in with my flat brush this brush
is the e60 I believe from Sigma and I'm
going to use that plum that plum right
there okay let's see what you're made of
this is really nice and purpley
okay
think I'm going to go over most of my
lid with this let it come into the
crease a little bit as well
so got like smokey plum blended in with
a little bit of warm Brown yes
sometimes you got to cheer yourself on
when you're doing makeup because like
nobody else is sitting around the room
with you you're doing great
this looks awesome well no lack is no
such thing as a broken huh
blonde is on the lid I'm just kind of I
didn't really put anything else on this
brush I'm just wanting it to all blend
together there in the crease
I'm going to buff out that edge even
more this efore tea and then I think I
will do this I love how brightening
the shade is the one with a hinted pink
that'll be my highlight
and then I'm going to clean off this
flat brush and show you what I mean
about how brightening these lighter
shades can be I want you again this one
like look how I'm just dabbing over
overlapping with a shade that is much
darker than this and it's so like bright
and nice look at how full color this is
I love it
and with it overlapping some of that
purple I practically look like I put
lilac on my lids or something but I
haven't you know it's just the overlap I
know not like a super complex
complicated eye look if that was what
you're coming here for I'm sorry but I
just you know I can't take forever on
this stuff going back to that same brown
that I put in my crease at first I'm
just going to use that for a little soft
like you know that nice barely
identifiable definition on the lower
lashline to shadow that area just a bit
see how that finishes the eye off way
more
no no I hear somebody in 20 minutes
later I'm back somebody a little bit
hungry so the eyes you know that's just
my simple look for today and there was
something I wanted to tell you guys as
far as a brightening shade for the inner
rim this wet-and-wild ultimate brow
highlighter this transfers on here is
more easily than anything like I even
have a brand new like Tarte pencil and
it does basically nothing for me in that
lower interim but look at the difference
that makes it's like the perfect shade
just like a little bit off-white just a
slightest bit of peach in this color
and it really just rounds out the eye
shape you know then I'm going to use my
favorite tweezer Minh Pro curl lash
curler here and I'm just going to do a
lashes with no liner mascara only look
here no eye liner or anything and I have
been really liking that look not only is
it quicker but it just I don't know it
feels very fresh very still wide awake
and I'm using this voluminous Lashkar
dice which it's good folks I am really
liking it and it's got that like just
ever so slight hourglass shape to the
brush very much like two faced better
than sex but it does hold the curl for
me better than the Too Faced and so far
anyway let's see how many times have I
worn this maybe four five times now I
have not had any smudging with this but
it builds up really quickly the only
difficulty is I'm getting super nitpicky
about this is like accessing that
innermost corner if this were a tapered
tip brush it would be a little easier to
get to those small areas as far as this
formula goes and the size that it seems
to give my lashes I mean that's pretty
good I don't have great natural lashes
but this is doing good things for them
a little bit on the lowers here as well
now I had also recently tried this Almay
one-coat mega volume that's their new
mascara and they say it has a megaphone
brush so in fact I have a megaphone
tattoo but that's what the brush looks
like like way way out at the end and
tapered toward back toward the wand did
not work well for me it just didn't look
like enough on my lashes number one and
number two it wouldn't hold the curl but
I am always willing to give an alum a
mascara a shot because of the great luck
I've had in the past with things like
get up and grow and the one coat
nourishing triple effect you know those
were some great mascaras for me so I'll
always try what they put out but I was
not so happy with that
but yeah this is a really really nice
mascara here I mean I would say it holds
the curl in my lashes most of the day
but anytime I'm really talking about a
mascara this is what I've learned on
YouTube like when you really want to
focus in on what a mascara is doing
don't put a bunch of eyeliner on because
that totally takes away the effect of
fully seeing what that mascara is doing
so that's that literally just a minute
left on my memory card this is the hook
color the vivid hot lacquer it's like
just a really glossy gloss and the shade
is more pink than I thought it was going
to be whoops
I'm getting sloppy too it almost smells
a little bit like coffee to me it's kind
of strange but very very shiny decent
texture on it but thank you guys so much
for getting ready with me today I hope
you enjoyed this little Tryon of a bunch
of different products and I will talk to
you again very soon fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
