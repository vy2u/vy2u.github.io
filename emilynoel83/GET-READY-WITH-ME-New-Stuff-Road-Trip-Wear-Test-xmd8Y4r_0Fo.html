is the first video I've done after the
Emily Awards and man I'm still exhausted
like a huge project that was whereas
that took a lot of thought and a lot of
time and just a ton of energy I thought
I'd hop on here and do kind of the
opposite and just do a little like get
ready with me just casually trying new
things a little make-up playtime we're
about ready to leave for a little family
gathering with Tyler's side of the
family so I thought this would probably
be my last chance for a few days to go
ahead and shoot something so that's what
I'm up to
I am moisturized but I'm not yet primed
so I'm gonna use my Maybelline master
prime right now for a little added
hydration and I just want to say again a
big thank you for the amazing and
comments and support and just all the
goodness that came with the Emily Awards
this year it really was fun to kind of
you know carry it along right with the
holidays and kind of have the whole
holiday theme to it I really enjoyed it
so much for my foundation today I think
I'm gonna use my la colors truly Matt I
do use this in the shade natural and I
believe I mentioned before how this is
like the second to lightest shade in the
whole line and there are quite a few
shapes in the line but I think they run
just a little bit dark
and then I've got this cute little guide
this is my Real Techniques expert face
brush but it's that little holiday
ornament size I decided be fun to test
it and see if it's as good as the actual
full-sized Real Techniques brush and it
is and yes I'm in a robo mode once again
I'm just loving the robes kind of chilly
fluffy robe feels great and this one
when I just took it out of the dryer
last night like can you imagine it felt
so good have you used anything that's
scenting it a little bit like I love
those dreft blissful when you you put
those in when it's in the washer draft
itself smells amazing with those little
things smells so good
I'm gonna use a little bit of this Becca
concealer that I had mentioned in the
Emily awards it's the ultimate coverage
concealing cream I feel like this is
just really good stuff it's nice and
smooth and creamy kind of emollient and
I'm using this did I say it's in the
shade banana right now so I find this to
be pretty brightening
and then I've got one of these brushes
from my tart set and I actually really
like it for concealer it's very fluffy
like I don't know I would typically
think to use it for highlighting is what
I would do but it actually it blends out
concealer really nicely
and who else is drinking out of their
Santa mug right now I've got the
Starbucks holiday blend in here for the
Keurig and I think it's international
delight frosted sugar cookie creamer in
it mmm so good quite tasty now from the
Patrick Starr collection that came from
Mac a gorgeous collection by the way a
lot of lip products in this one and a
couple of little eye palettes but
there's also this powder and so I might
be trying the powder for the first time
you know me and loose powders and my
love affair with the Laura Mercier loose
powder so we'll see how this one goes
I'm going to tap a little bit out here
into the lid so we can see what sort of
tone we're working with it it's a little
bit and it's a little peachy beige and
I'm gonna do a little baking with it
does it a problem when the only baking
you speak of in a video is the baking
done with a powder or perhaps the only
sugar cookies you've been involved with
is the sugar cookie flavoured creamer in
your coffee no we are gonna actually be
back home here on Christmas and we're
gonna make some cookies for Santa Phil
and I are gonna try our hand at some
gingerbread I think that's gonna be fun
okay so I've got some powder there on
just kind of the the typical baked area
took me kind of a while to build it up
and it's looking incredibly dry right
now so I hope that improves once it's
all dusted away usually you know gets
better from there but my word a little
bit on the nose to just kind of like for
mattifying sake and then I'm gonna do
the brows and I've been really excited
about this little brow pomade I got from
makeup revolution this is my best pomade
and the Emily awards and comes with the
little angled brush and I wear it in
medium brown just like the perfect shade
and I'm really loving this so much you
just get hardly any on the brush or at
least that's that's my policy because as
you can see I've got some existing brow
here that I'm working through and you
just kind of carry it through and it
creates just a really nice natural quick
brow has a little hold to it also added
bonus I just can't do the pomades that
are too goofy I feel like I used the
word goop a lot in the Emily Awards but
sometimes that's the only word to
explain what I'm trying to say you know
like when you
you stick your brush in it's just like
way too much product getting involved
you need just a little bit of dryness in
the palm bay to make it something you
can control with your brush you know and
it just basically goes along with my
philosophy of you can build up little by
little but it's much harder when you
have to start taking away and I would
have my hair pulled back right now by
the way but it's still kind of drying so
we don't want to get a bump in it got a
deal with my hair before I leave and
you've got to deal with my nails before
I leave I'm gonna do a fresh layer of my
color street which that was covered in
the finale if you want more details on
that
I almost feel funny doing a get ready
with me style video I'm using a little
gel here just because it's been so long
I've been doing the Emily awards since
like before last week at this time I
started on like the Wednesday or
Thursday before they ever started
getting posted you want to know what
just happened there with that covergirl
gel I just over gooped because that gel
will do that to you now I want to dust
away some of this powder and just see
what kind of thing we're left with
it's looking really dry out of the gate
to tell you the truth I might bring it
on in here and let's hope the camera
focuses in feel like I'm just seeing
every little bit of texture under each
eye already that's kind of thing that
doesn't usually show up right after
baking that'll be like what I end up
seeing toward the end of the day with
some powders that don't perform quite as
well as the laura mercier so mmm but you
know what props to Patrick and Mac for
trying that because I think that's a
really tall order to come up with an
amazing loose powder that's gonna do
everything that they want it to do you
know and it might not look quite that
drawing on some people I'm gonna do a
little contouring with my makeup
revolution Pro HD did a big haul from
Ulta that included a lot of things I
actually haven't done a video on the
home but it was one of those things
where like stuff came in multiple parts
they had a lot of new Maybelline stuff
back when I did that video and then you
know some makeup revolution stuff kind
of fill in there too but I'm gonna try
out this contour palette because I love
their ultra contour the one that has
like little round pans so we're gonna
see how these powders do as well and I
got a terrible zip right back here I'm
not trying to actually layer too much
product on top of it but a couple days
ago it was just one of those really deep
awful zits and now it's just the awesome
crusty aftermath so it's beginning to
look good I wish like Christmas song
season lasted so much longer like I wish
it was appropriate to listen to and just
jam out to Christmas music all the time
I love Christmas song okay so I've just
been using like this color here and a
little bit of this one too and they're
giving me a nice kind of soft natural
contour for blush I got something kind
of cool that I'm gonna pull in I got
this off of QVC this is the
collaboration with Disney and malley
she did a frozen collection one is Anna
and one is Elsa and so far I've only
gotten the onna one in so this is what
it looks like it's so cute and you take
the top off and you've got a bunch of
Mally goodness in here we've got mascara
a couple shadow sticks and eyeliner lip
gloss and this little like double
did blush and highlight thing and
there's a mirror here and it says
powerful beauty follow your heart
double-sided like regular and magnified
mirror there and I don't know part of me
is like being a girl mom I kind of
really wanted to get that so I don't
make up obviously but just the thought
of it you know I just thought it'd be
fun and I love these kinds of products
that malli does well hot in here had to
ditch the robe had to unload the memory
card but as I was saying before I was so
rudely interrupted I was blushing
brilliance blush and highlighter wand I
think all the shades by the way are
exclusive things in these little sets
but this is definitely something I
haven't seen malli do before or that
I've never tried from her so I'm gonna
try the little cream blush stick here
and just give a little swirl of this on
the outer part of the cheek
blush sticks can make life easier they
can make life harder this one is not my
favorite it's kind of tugging just a
little bit let's it's a little more
pressure than I'd want to apply and I
want a little bit more so I'm gonna
apply more and this time try blending it
out with my small stipple brush see how
that goes yeah like I'm having to press
quite hard with the small stipple brush
actually the color looks like it would
be gorgeous this pretty kind of Coralie
shade
that's a tricky thing cream blush sticks
you don't want to apply too much
pressure to where you're messing up your
under underneath layers of makeup right
but you do definitely want to get it
fully blended let's try the highlights
to go see if that has this feels like it
might be smoother actually it's a soft
kind of pearly shade and the honest set
seemed to be the warmer collection of
the two and Elsa was cooler which makes
sense you know if you know the movie
like I said still waiting on the Elsa
set to come in I think it's basically
the same types of what was that same
types of products but um different
shades so yeah that highlight seems to
be blending in a bit more easily it
seems like a little different texture
perhaps awfully soft and subtle there
I'm thinking about layering on a little
bit of this this fun little becca
compact this is called light waves a
highlighter palette and this was the one
I was referencing in my Emily Awards
blush bronzer highlight video this has
prismatic amethyst in it as well as
moonstone and then the center one is
called pink sapphire I think I might try
throwing a little of this pink sapphire
like on the apple of my cheek
woo yeah it's very blushy that's a very
blush e-type shade I would definitely
use that more as a blush than just a
full-on highlight but that's pretty like
that I dig it sometimes you just don't
know what you're gonna get with makeup
playtime but this is the kind of thing I
would just do on my own but it's fun to
turn the camera on now and then and then
I think I'm gonna do a little moonstone
as my primary highlight with this part
of that I think it's clinging to the
Mallee a little bit and kind of layering
up some but this is also just a really
vivid highlighter just in itself so yeah
it seems essentially what you have here
is a blush type shade and then two
completely different directions of
highlight because the prismatic amethyst
has that little bit of a pinky lilac
shift and then the moonstone is more
just like glowy soft champagne and now
I'm gonna get myself a little Marvin
Mario Badescu setting Mystere this is
the facial spray with a little cucumber
and green tea and did you guys hear
they're gonna come out with
lavender one or maybe they already do
have it out I really want to test that
too but frankly I can't imagine liking
anything as well as I like the scent of
this like just rain down on me hmm so
good for the eye look I really have a
lot of different directions in which I
could go but one thing that I really
want to try is the Too Faced gold
chocolate bar chocolate gold as its
called
it's basically a selection of metallics
it says foiled eyeshadows that are
created with real gold for an epic shine
finish but then you know they've given
you a few little sensible mattes over
here to pair in with it I think I will
use that and I'm first gonna prime my
lids with a little Milani and then I
might use like one of these Mally shadow
sticks for a little base I think what
I'm gonna do first is use so bougie over
here and that's gonna be my lid or my
crease that I'm gonna start building up
here I told you I hadn't done any kind
of tutorial thing for a while what is
this life here okay so yeah I'm just
getting that all blended in you know I
love my Too Faced maths this feels like
home here okay we're good somebody asked
me in the comments section of a video
recently I think it was before the Emily
Awards about like a lot of times I show
up here on my videos and not every time
but sometimes I appear to be very
glammed up and she was asking do I wash
all that off just for a regular day of
mom life or whatever I'm gonna go do and
the answer to that is definitely no I
leave it on for the day a lot of times
I'm wearing stuff and whether or not you
see a wear test on a video or you see me
talking about it on snapchat or whatever
I am a lot of times taking pictures and
analyzing the way a product actually
wears on my skin over the course of a
day so that's kind of in a continual
state of happening but also like I just
I like being glam I like having makeup
on when possible that's just really
something that I genuinely enjoy in life
and yeah I'm gonna show up to story hour
some weeks and I've got a full false
lash on and
something metallic happening and a bold
dark vampy lip or something and I know
some people know what I do and then some
people don't but I think part of loving
what you do and being fully invested in
what you do is being able to go full in
doing it without really caring what
anybody else thinks about you so I have
no problem going out full glammed up
with under whatever circumstance it
might be and I fully get that that's not
gonna be everyone's Jam I'm using this
what is this rolling in dough shade now
it's a little bit of a highlight and but
I know that's not gonna be everybody's
style and that's fine too you know if
there's something you like doing in a
video but you really don't feel that it
works for whatever part of your
day-to-day life that you're going out
into into the world then by all means
you know take it off if that makes you
feel better and I hear from plenty of
people who have a very conservative you
know workplace where they really
wouldn't feel comfortable at all doing
things like that so everybody's got
their story in their situation but
that's just a little explanation on that
then I'm gonna take a little cocoa
truffle right up here and yes this does
smell smells chocolatey I want to see
just a big fat montage of youtubers
smelling their palates
now I was gonna bring in a Mallee shadow
stick and kind of layer it down and put
a metallic shade on top but now I find
myself wanting to see how well these
could stand alone
so I will likely revisit the malli
Disney frozen collaboration at another
time if you guys are interested for this
I look I kind of want to work in some
green this money bag shade right up here
these are really speaking to me so I'm
gonna pick that up with a flat brush
we're just gonna go in and see how this
how this goes
got a little fallout from it just right
off the bat here
I'd say it has kind of a soft metallic
sheen building it up that way I think
maybe if you did layer it on top of
something creamy it might shine a little
bit more but it's not like insanely
metallic I don't know if I'd even glance
at that and call it metallic I might say
it has a soft shimmer to it
but I do love the color tone of it I
love that kind of green it's kind of
deep and jewel-toned very emerald
and then I think I'm going to do a
little bit of rich girl here which just
seems to be kind of like a silvery
taupey color and I'm going to pull some
of that into overlap this inner part
this palette is most definitely going to
take more than like this one use for me
to understand how I best like to use it
and all that business but just initially
simply from looking at it I do like the
fact that instead of packing it 100%
full of metallic shades they did put in
a few mats so you could complete a look
with it that has always mattered to me
so I like to see that I'm just popping a
little extra green on here now so I
don't lose that bub is downstairs like
coughing his head off I hope he's okay
thinking a little more cocoa truffle now
and I'm just kind of finishing off my
crease area here that Brown really does
look nice alongside the green very
earthy and there is a matte black in
here as well next up I'm going to do a
little Jordana color Envy and black Envy
across the upper lash line
you know what guys I got some major
major fallout from that light shade that
I put on the inner part of my lid whole
week
gosh dang okay just a warning I didn't
see that at first like kind of referring
to my look in my little camera screen
but one up close
wowza I hope no more shakes off as the
day goes on
sorry things got a little careless over
here on this left wing yeah we're kind
of getting it back I think something
that could be kind of pretty on the
lower lashline with this look would be
sort of a brown lower inner rim blended
outward with maybe one or two of these
coppery looking shades this is my m60 as
mentioned in the Emily awards from Make
Up For Ever you know any brown liner you
like just kind of get that going in the
lower inner rim and make it sort of
smudge able you know down here in
between the lashes
so I'm gonna grab for this love and Coco
shade first and we'll see what that does
that's pretty
and then I'm gonna take old money and
that's gonna go inward
Wow that seems like pretty solid shades
like that's holding it sound just
applied with a little angle the funny
thing was when I sat down I said I was
gonna do a natural look I'm gonna use
colors inspired by nature we'll put it
that way and I'm just gonna curl my
lashes here and I'm gonna apply the
mascara that won't die this is my
essence lash princess the sculpted
Volume one the one that I saw them
talking about on The Today Show like oh
this is God's gift of mascara I don't
love it as much as lash paradise just
because of the lack of curl holding but
I'm trying to use it because I really
you know I started it it's not like the
absolute worst when it comes to holding
curl but it's not this for me anyway I
do not feel like my lids look very
pretty like I like the color of green
don't get me wrong but that little
sprinkling of dust that came around the
inner corner there is not like I don't
know it doesn't look very polished to me
I have a feeling there's gonna be
certain shades in this palette that
require just some special treatment and
I may or may not always have the
patience for that I swear I still hear
him coughing down there like it hasn't
been continual but you just can't quite
get done with it got some major specks
here but the covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant always kind of dabs away
easily
I'm gonna use these lashes here says
kick some lash and it's from Eileen I
found these at Walmart and I've used
them once they seemed kind of on the
flimsy side I don't know I like the
lightweightness that they had they just
didn't seem super durable but I'm going
to give these another go see you like
that I just pulled one off the band and
a little segment of the lashes just came
off on my thumb there see I'm gonna need
to give that a trim now to make that
work I try to be gentle but goodness oh
I need to remind bug to wrap something
just a second okay don't you guys worry
bubs just fine he just swallowed wrong
he said he's gonna wrap this stuff just
the two things that are left i wrapped
everything else who does the wrapping in
your family do you split it up evenly or
just wanna yell just take over doing all
of it for me I just feel like I know I'm
really fast at it so if I just can do it
and you know be really efficient at it
and get it done I'm good and plus I got
this cool little caddy thing you know
you're an adult when you're starting to
get excited about things like this I got
this holder that holds my rolls of paper
and then on the other side I've got my
bags and boxes and then there's a little
zippered compartment for the tags and
the scissors and tape and everything now
I can really wrap stuff fast cuz I know
where it all is okay we're just putting
these lashes on they're a lot like a
demi whispies maybe a little bit longer
throughout the whole lash like a little
longer in here little bits up she's
getting vocal too
now you know what I'm kind of cold again
so am i happy enough with the eyes you
know yeah they're they're good enough
for a day spent mostly in the car
they're really not that bad it's just
you know the desired effect that would
come from a palette like this I would
have expected thanks to maybe lay down a
little more smoothly or a little more
metallic you know the shades that
appeared to be clearly the metallic ones
in the palette as I said before it's
gonna take a lot more experimentation in
time to really understand that palette
fully I think now for lips I was sent a
little something here from Laura Mercier
which I am going gaga over and I really
want to try one of these today they are
the velour extreme matte lipstick and my
lips are feeling like they're in pretty
good shape right now I'm just wondering
which color I want to use I think I'll
go for one of these berries this is the
shade fatah so they look just like the
caviar sticks oh but they're so like I'm
barely touching my lips with it lots of
color
I kind of like pairing green and berry
how about you this is a nice texture
really smooth and the thing that really
took me by surprise most was how lightly
I even touched my skin with that but
yeah that's my little make-up playtime
get ready with me for today can't really
say I was super excited about everything
I used today honestly like my LA Colors
foundation I like the idea of my eye
look overall but you know those textures
weren't exactly the best the lip is
definitely setting like as I put my lips
together I can tell it's really kind of
walking in there so we will see how well
that wears throughout the day but thank
you guys so much for watching I'll see
you later bye okay just a little real
life check in on the look right now the
complexion looks pretty good I've got a
lash already starting to come up here
you can see the type of where that the
lip color hasn't it's one way way down
below my lip which is I don't think I
put it on that way but we just went
through the rat-race that is trying to
pack up with two little kids that are
just it's like you're swimming against
the current kind of like you're you're
trying to make progress and then you
keep getting sidetracked so it's a
pretty good wear test for makeup I guess
it yeah it's only like 1103 and I think
I
everything put on at like seven I got a
little frustrated with my lash so I went
ahead and tack that down and then after
I ate a burger when we stopped I kind of
smoothed out my lips on the board to
even out the color something but it just
it's not a super long wearing like
resists anything type of lips so not too
upset about how the eyes are looking I
don't feel like I have uncovered a bunch
of surprising additional fallout on my
cheeks so that's nice but skin wise I
think you face are hanging in there so
we'll check it later
don't worry I am supervising this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
