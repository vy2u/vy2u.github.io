morning because it's extra early here as
I shoot this video but it's going to be
kind of like a get ready with me
tutorial style video on a holiday look
and this holiday look is inspired by the
old Hollywood glamour and my love for
this type of look really came back as I
tried some of those Besame products and
I really got into n-- with what that
brand was all about there's just a
certain simplicity I think to the
overall look but yet it's just
undeniably glamorous with usually a red
lip and a kind of simple eye but yet
everything is just really finished and
defined so I wanted to bring you a look
like that today and I think it really
does lend itself to the holidays if
you're thinking about trying something
like that out if you're a person who
tends to shy away from like the really
complex eye makeup looks you might enjoy
this too because it's really going to be
pretty basic and understated on the eyes
aside from maybe some lashes and liner
I think skin and lips will really be the
star of the show so for starters here
I've already got an eye cream and a
moisturizer on and I'm going to apply
some of my ELF hydrating face primer
which I really do like it's got a nice
little slip to it but yeah it just adds
something extra what can I say oh and
the hair today this is going to be just
as much of a surprise to me as it is to
you and as to how that turns out cause
this is my first time putting hot
rollers in my short hair and I just
thought you know it might just give me
that little you know different glamorous
look that I want foundation wise I am
using this Fiona Styles luminous finish
foundation concentrate I wear it in the
shade 0-4 and I've just really been
impressed by the coverage of this
foundation and also the natural look on
the skin I mean I think this was one of
the foundations I included in my
foundations that don't look like
foundations video and then it's kind of
been more recently rediscovered in my
collection and I've had a lot of
rediscovered products lately an unusual
amount given
you know all the new things all the new
holiday stuff that there is to try I've
kind of still been settling back into
some things that I have had around for
some time but as I typically do that
around everywhere I used about a pump
and a half of that and then does anybody
else clean off their finger with their
beauty blender and I'm just going to use
this beauty blender to dab this all in
and of course the the beauty blender has
been dampened under the sink but I
always like to wring it out really
really well so it's not depositing
moisture back on your skin as you use it
so yesterday I was watching a video from
lipgloss Leslie it was her Dollar Tree
holiday haul like home decor stuff that
she found at Dollar Tree she had so much
cute stuff and I am really really
inspired to run out and see what my
local Dollar Tree has and it's really
like luck of the draw you know like you
can see what somebody else found at
Dollar Tree and then go to your own and
be like well where you know did it all
get picked over or what so hopefully I
can find at least some of the cute
things that she came up with but I have
already done my decorating and I do I
feel like more interior decorating for
the holidays than I do outside the house
like our kind of statement thing I feel
like outside the house and I got the
wreath I've got like some sort of
wintery looking poinsettias flowers on
either side of the door but kind of our
statement is the tree that shows through
our kind of front window area and I feel
like I've gotten the place pretty fully
well decorated but there are a few
things that I would like to kind of add
to from the decor I put up in years past
and it really is the smartest thing to
do to go ahead and decorate with all
your stuff before you start going
through the odds of the stores and
picking out new stuff because then
you're like oh yeah at the end of the
season I bought that other garland and
blah blah blah and you'll forget so it's
really good to kind of be in this place
before I hit up Dollar Tree or I'm
thinking about checking out five below
as well and just seeing like what little
extras might be there but I love a good
bargain and I love when you know the
things that you end up finding at these
stores just don't look cheap you know
they look like you could think you could
find anywhere for ornaments or little
you know things that you plug into your
garlands to sort of fill them out and
make them look pretty that stuff should
not cost an arm and a leg anyway so
that's what I'm going to do and moving
on makeup wise so I got the whole
foundation look on but I still do have
some areas I want to conceal around the
under eye and I'm going to
my Anastacio 2.5 concealer I have been
loving this stuff this is what I took
when I travelled over the weekend and
just got so much use out of it I'm going
to apply a little bit around the nose as
well so this can just be all-purpose
easy concealer and then what I sometimes
find myself doing just for speed you
know I'll dab over it
the where the concealers in like the
larger plane of my face I can just dab
over that with the same blender I used
with my foundation but then you know the
caverns still hanging out there waiting
and if I don't have like a micro mini at
the ready I'll just grab my Sigma p84
because this is like one of those nice
little angled brushes fits that area
really well it's like no problem I'll
take care of that for you I'll blend
that in this shirt I'm wearing I just
wanted something like a little bit
different or festive for this video and
it totally does not cover my bump at all
like I've got a good I don't know six
inches of underbelly hanging out under
this guy it's a good thing it's head and
shoulders here right the pregnant
underbelly I will not be leaving the
house in this shirt as I go to Dollar
Tree I will put on something that will
cover that and of course there's
something I didn't see in the corner of
my eye I'm sorry sometimes you just got
to get the mirror all up in there to see
exactly what's happening now I am going
to set the under eye and I'm going to do
this sort of heavily um this is kind of
the way I've seen it done or similar to
the way I've seen it done in some videos
on the Besame channel and i'm using my
brightening vanilla powder today this is
my little sample size and I'm going to
kick a little bit of that out into the
cap here comes out kind of unwillingly
sometimes but ya get it decent amount in
there I'm going to pick up some on the
sponge again video should be called how
many ways can I use my Beauty Blender
and I'm just going to dab this very
generously right here on the under-eye
sorry to bore you with all the Christmas
chatter but can I just tell you how
exciting it is for me like all this kid
related stuff that comes about at
Christmas time like I'm gonna do the Elf
on a shelf I'm gonna do like my little
advent calendar stuff that I got for her
I'll have to like be snapping daily
about the little you know day-to-day
Christmas countdown type stuff that's
going to be going on here and my mom saw
this neat little thing online about
every night like 4 well you can kind of
decide how many days you're going to do
I think we're going to do it the 15 days
leading up to Christmas she has gotten
and individually wrapped 15 little books
that she has picked up in various places
and he put them under the tree with a
blanket and every night you know for the
15 nights leading up to Christmas as a
light kind of a bedtime routine you go
under the tree and the kid grabs out a
book gets to unwrap it and read it that
night and I think that's such a cute
idea now well that sits there I am going
to go ahead and do my brows and I
thought I might do them in maybe a
little bit more to find away perhaps
than usual I'm not sure how it's going
to turn out and but it's the benefit
kabrel I'm going to work with this in
the shade for I have used this
occasionally um I've been using more
pencils these days but this always seems
to give me a little bit deeper more
precise look I guess
and then I'm just going to brush through
what I've done with the spoolie just in
case any you know like too much product
got settled in one area when you browse
their forest it can happen
aside from the whole like aesthetic of
Besame cosmetics sort of inspiring this
type of look you know what celebrity I'm
kind of keeping in the back of my mind
as well as I do this Kacey Musgraves if
you've seen her she's really taken on
such like an old Hollywood kind of Dita
Von Teese esque look these days and I
really love it I think it's beautiful on
her
maybe it's really catering to some of
the holiday performances and stuff that
she's done recently but like the red lip
and the dark hair is really really
working for her
whatever I just did for this brow though
is not however working for me I'm
softening the brow a bit with this brush
that I actually did concealer with
little wet and wild clear brow gel here
and then I often use this little Sigma
spotlight duster brush and I'm sweeping
away any excess powder the Besame
vanilla brightening powder that was on
here in that area looks really nice and
matte and even right now and then I'm
going to lightly dust a little bit of
this Physicians Formula
youthful wear translucent matte finish
powder elsewhere on my face just to kind
of make sure that that foundation which
doesn't feel especially sticky or
anything on my skin but it just kind of
gives it an even more even look helps
the staying power then I really want
just a nice subtle contour today and
something I have not reached for very
recently at all is my Charlotte Tilbury
and film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow very very
subtle yet effective contouring product
and there's a gorgeous highlight in here
too that gives you I don't know a very
classy looking highlight
I'm going to do the highlight in a
second but look up both I got a Besame
blush this was sent to me by Bess ma
after I did that video and they sent me
this wonderful little sampling of some
of their products and one of them is the
1915 Rose blush so you twist it open
actually this is going to be my first
time using it and that's what it looks
like judging by my swatches this could
be kind of intense so I'm going to just
lightly dab tap off excess the little
tap aroo on the hand and just build up
this nice soft rosiness
see how interestingly that blush kind of
sheers out on the cheeks I'm digging
this color because it does really make
me think wintertime like kind of just in
from the cold type of look so that's so
cool and I really like the packaging too
I don't want to look like completely
exaggeratedly highlighted today so I
mean I just want a soft look right on
the top of the cheeks that's exactly
what this gives
I'm really disappointed because
yesterday I was in Walmart and I was
looking to repurchase my hard candy
sheer envy primer mist and guess what
they were completely sold out so I'm
going to have to go see their stock a
different Walmart or wait or order
online but I do have other settings
sprays I just really like that one this
is the Urban Decay just a small size
that I got of the b6 vitamin infused
complexion prep spray oh that does have
a really nice fine mist to it now since
the lips are going to be making such a
statement with today's look I thought I
would do them before I do the eyes and I
have a beautiful full-sized Besame
lipstick here and this is in the shade
red hot red I need to look up and see
what year this is inspired by because
I've got the what is it the 1910 1915
blush on and I'm going to apply this
with a lip brush I'm going to do the
double blot technique that they showed
in their YouTube video
this is a beautiful red or what super
glamorous very comfortable and by the
way the smell of these lipsticks this
vanilla scent is so pure and so real
seeming you know it just does not seem
like artificial fragrance at all now for
the eyes I'm going to use some of my
Milani eyeshadow primer just a little
bit something I love so much about it is
that it doesn't change consistency on me
even though sitting there in a squeezy
tube like it doesn't separate or get
thin or watery and then on the eyes I
just wanted a very like kind of subtle
naturally contoured type look so I
pulled out something I haven't used in a
while it's my covergirl true naked nudes
palette these are really nice pallets
that covergirl has come out with and
I've talked about them in past videos
and stuff but this shade right here is
really a nice matte crease color so I'm
just going to pop that lightly in here
another thing I kind of like about this
look or this type of theme is that you
can substitute so many other things in
for the kinds of products that I use you
know use your favorite foundation use
the blush that you like or the red lip
color that you enjoy it can totally be
achieved with with other products if you
want to you know I'm just kind of using
partially some new things that I wanted
to try out and bring back some old faves
kind of thing but don't feel like you
gotta use ever you know exactly what I'm
doing okay soft subtle easy crease
you're just following the natural you
know contours of the eye here no big
whoop then I'm going to use this shade
right here which is also matte and
that's going to be my highlight
and I can also just use this little
sponge tip that came with the palette
and apply some of that right here but
see how pigmented these shadows are like
that for that light shade to sort of
stand out as much as it does there it
gets kind of cool and then I'm going to
use the other side of that sponge tip
with the same color that I put in the
crease and kind of dab that on the outer
part of the lid just so I don't look
like I've got one solid stark light
color all over what's that called oh
yeah blending when I said simple eyes
you guys I meant it I don't really
intend to do too much more shadow wise
than this although I may do a little bit
on the under part of the eye and second
and then for my liner I'm going to use
might artist
eyeliner that I've been talking about
this is just my little one that came
from that kit and it's in black and I'm
just going to use the brush that came
with the kit too because it's fantastic
as well one side is just like a fine
you know cream gel liner brush and then
the other has a very tiny angle if
you're into that but what I really love
here is you look at this little kind of
built-in palette that is part of this
tube right at the top so you squeeze
your product out and then you can kind
of spread it around in there and you
feel like you've loaded up your brush
with just the right amount of product
never too much can easily brush off any
excess and it applies so easily so I'm
going to do that now
getting it loaded up sort of one time
takes me all the way across my lashline
and I get just a little bit more when I
want to do a wing
here bub downstairs doing his yoga bless
his heart he's been doing yoga every
single morning except when we were gone
his body continues to feel the effects
of old like college football type
injuries and you know it's hard on the
knees and being as big guy as he is you
know you're gonna feel that so I think
he's found that Yoga has really helped
with the just the feelings of soreness I
really can't wait to take these rollers
out and see what the heck my hair is
going to do with this curl and this is
just my little travel set of rollers I
did review them like quite a while back
on the Express channel what's cool about
it is that it's a travel roller set with
varied sizes so I've got like bigger
rollers right up here kind of at the top
of my head and the smaller ones down low
but the set did not come with the clips
the these particular clips that I'm
using I think we're from my Calista hot
roller set but you can buy clips similar
to these go to Sally's just get them on
their own
okay I think I'm going to quit well on a
head on the winged liner they look you
know good enough for me right now lower
lashline I'm going to do a little Rimmel
scandaleyes and nude here on the lower
inner rim
and then we're going to integrate a bit
of this dark brown just under you know
how I like to do this and part of it
might come back to eye shape you know I
started thinking that sometimes I feel
like I've got a little roundness to the
shape of my eye and sometimes for the
wing to not look so much like it's just
kind of sprouting out of nowhere it
looks a little bit better when I enter
it and just go slightly below it with
some shadow and even if you don't carry
that shadow in very far see how that
just does something for it
gives it a little something extra
anytime I say something like that it
reminds me of Legally Blonde when she's
giving um she's given the dude her a
scented resume it gives it a little
something extra I always joked to bub he
is also legally blonde I'm just gonna
curl the lashes I'm going to be putting
mascara on my upper and lower lashes I'm
using my essence I love extreme crazy
volume on top I'll probably use my
covergirl on the bottom just you know
for safety covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant
and I could totally see this being a
really pretty look no lashes involved no
extra lashes but I just I really want
the added glam
I mean it's holiday we're going to kick
it up right now I'm thinking what's my
excuse for lashes the other 364 days of
the year
I dug up some good old red cherry number
43 z-- these are a nice long and also
very full lash also a little bit flared
out lash so I think it's going to be
absolutely perfect for this look so I'm
going to apply these and I'm going to
take my hair out of these rollers and
join you with the finished look um the
volume is real you guys it cannot be
contained so well the hair was just kind
of going every which way out of the
rollers I just kind of flipped my head
over went like this and then sort of
pieced it in place with my fingers I
kind of like having part of it behind
the ear just so I don't feel like my
face is being completely overtaken by
hair but it works it's fine it's
definitely a very like glammed up look
to go along with the face I think but
yeah this is my take on the old
Hollywood holiday look really very basic
in terms of techniques maybe you just
got a few ideas in terms of using
different things together certain
products that I would recommend but that
Besame stuff is totally the real deal
and loving this red hot red lipstick any
of those lipsticks from that set would
have been great in here I think red
velvet could have been gorgeous also the
more like kind of matte cherry red would
be very pretty too does not sure what to
do about this hair but thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you're having a
great holiday season so far and let me
know if you've got any video requests
please put them in the comment section
below and I will talk to you very soon
