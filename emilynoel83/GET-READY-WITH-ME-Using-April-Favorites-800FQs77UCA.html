morning because it is not even 6:00 a.m.
a right here right now I am just getting
started on my cup of coffee and I wanted
to do a get ready with me style video
and it's about that time that I should
be putting out a best in beauty video as
well so I thought I would just combine
the two got a really like wide range of
things I've been enjoying and also just
like a general look do you ever feel
like you settle into kind of a zone of
this is my best look I mean a lot of
times I'm switching up little things
here and there always doing a different
lip color blah blah blah
but I feel like a look that I really
like on myself involves getting my skin
as sort of perfected as I can get it no
brainer there everybody wants that but
kind of a simple I and a bold kind of
rosy reddish type lip I feel like that
look works well on me it's a very
classic type look but you know whatever
any time I go with a red lip somebody
without fail in the comments will be
like you remind me of Snow White with
this makeup and I don't know I think
that's kind of cool
first off I need to run and get this
damp so posted a video on foundations
that don't look like foundation really
like all of those foundations so I'm
just kind of choosing one to use in this
video that I don't think you've seen me
apply yet and it's the Fiona styles
luminous finish founding foundation
concentrate and zero for doesn't the
packaging kind of make you think of like
a skyscraper or something I love like
that architectural kind of cool thing
going on there so I am using a pump of
this I'm going to use my Real Techniques
sponge and pick up a little bit of that
yes I've already moisturized already
primed and I'm just going to start
dabbing this all over it's one of those
foundations with luminous in the name
but it doesn't go too crazy with that
concept you know it'll it looks natural
it looks nice it looks like okay that's
believable
you know like skin could actually look
that way so that's what I like it
I always kind of like start with the
under eye type area it's like that's my
biggest issue that I like to get all
covered up and then I can make sure I
get enough foundation there and if it is
thinner like down the sides of my cheeks
or somewhere you know I can be okay with
that and if I sound a little froggy this
morning I'm sorry it's simply because I
have not spoken to anyone yet today it's
you guys
so while the Beautyblender can take a
little longer and sometimes it feels
just a little more tedious than a big
thick brush and with certain foundations
it just seems like the perfect way to
apply it so I go with it and I really
love my Real Techniques sponge by the
way got two of them so as I was saying
at the start of the video I think
everything I'm using in this video could
be classified as a best in beauty type
favorite so my next thing is my Tarte
palette here it's the wipeout color
correcting palette and I use these
shades a lot and sometimes a little bit
of the yellow and if I'm feeling like
doing some cream contouring I've got
this guy over here too so I I mean
really have just been going in like with
a finger and applying some of that where
I feel like I need it so there's some
darkness around the inner part of the
eye down in here
dab dab dab talk more about this in my
peach correctors video but I think
they've got a really nice consistency in
this palette it's nice to see so many
shades that really like there's enough
creaminess there's enough coverage you
know it's not too thin and oily and then
I think I'm going to do a little added
brightening with this yellow I think
I'll just take it like down the nose up
into this zone might do a little a
couple babs of it sort of right on top
of the cheek area
boop-boop-boop and a little bit right
here under the
oops or wearing and down here I'm going
to blend that out with my sponge and
this concealer responds really well to
the sponge I think I feel like it's been
so long since I've actually applied a
full face of makeup on my channel it
seems that way to me anyway like I've
done a lot of demos and videos which I
think are valuable and necessary you
know but to just to show how certain
things work and just little bits of
pieces of the makeup routine or whatever
product I'm talking about but need to
get into more you know full face type
stuff too and whenever I blend in
concealer with the sponge I kind of do
it another read AB with the fingers and
it just kind of makes sure okay as that
as blended in as it can possibly be
because I think I'm going to do just a
little bit of baking right now cuz why
not I've got this L'Oreal Hydra perfect
loose powder which I really like I've
got it in the shade light and I'm just
going to use my blender sponge to dab
some of this right in this area and I
feel like I don't know I don't ever use
like as much powder as I sometimes see
people use when they bake but we're
using a fair amount of powder here and I
don't do that every day but one
circumstance where I think it's valuable
is when your concealer on the under-eye
is really really creamy I think that's
where like I can totally feel that kind
of reaction happening there between the
concealer and the powder and everything
is going to look super nice and
perfected when that's all done
so I'm going to let that sit on there
for a while um I don't usually like put
a timer on it but I kind of get going on
my eyes and do part of my eye makeup and
then dust it away and sort of bounce
back to the face makeup on the brow
product that I've actually been using
for like it I think it's two months now
I should probably be running out of this
soon as my color pop a little pencil
here in the shade dope taupe and dope
taupe is a shade that you might see a
lot of blondes pulling out and for me as
you can see I've got a lot of brow you
might even look at and be like what
needs to be filled in well you know I
know my little places there's a couple
of like those you know a little spots
where I feel the need to just go over
them and when it's just those little
places I really think a less intense
shade like this you know a cool taupey
color can really be just perfect so
that's what I've been using it's a fine
pencil it kind of reminds me of like
brow Wiz and the NYX micro brow only
it's a little softer that's why I feel
like I'm going to be using it up soon
because every time I get it out again I
always have to click it up a little bit
more like it just wears down a bit
faster so just something to keep in mind
but it is a really nice little brow
pencil and if you do have you said thick
dark brows and you're just going for
minimal fill-in and you don't want that
to look too intense it's a nice little
option so last weekend bubs parents came
up from Texas to visit us we had a
really nice weekend they got to do a lot
of hanging out with Bill and gosh we ate
like kings we went to Bob Evans I don't
know if you guys have a Bob Evans in
your area but Bob's dad loves Bob Evans
and it was I think might have been one
of the first things we talked about was
the fact that yes there is a Bob Evans
nearby and maybe we should go there and
they just got great like they serve all
kinds of food I think all day but
breakfast t food is just amazing and we
had Belle there and she
just went to town eating like any kind
of breakfast food that we had on the
table like she went after the scrambled
eggs she went after her pancakes they
brought out these pancakes that were
shaped like a pig's face for her and I
died they were so cute I think the only
thing she really didn't get into was
like sausage or bacon or anything like
that but literally anything else so
hashbrowns any kind of potato yet she
was getting so I guess she got some love
for Bob Evans from her grandpa but that
was so fun to take her there and this
has the little spoolie brush on the end
by the way if you can kind of brush it
on through and I guess I didn't really
pull a brow gel that was a favorite this
month so I'll just kind of randomly this
is what I've been using and it looks
nasty it's one of those like I don't
really want to see the inside of my
eyebrow clear Jill because it turns not
clear like instantly but this is that
ELF wet gloss lash and brow it's like
one dollar and I already used up one
side and I'm about you step on this
other side but that's kind of been what
I've then taken through the brows it
might be two dollars it's a nice little
gel but I do go through it really fast
so onto the simple eye my Milani
eyeshadow primer I feel like this has
been solidified in my mind even though I
use this all the time like it's a
constant favorite for me I don't even
really need to mention it because it's
just one of those like yes always a
favorite but I had um Kaylee here
recently and I was singing its praises
to her I was singing its praises to
Tyler's mom you know a couple days ago
so it just I don't know I'm realizing
that for anyone who may not be using an
eye primer like it really is an
important thing and maybe I should
mention it a little bit more so I'm been
churning it and I'm using I use it all
the dang time and I just Pat it all over
the lid just to shear them out you know
and then I kind of get it up into the
crease and dab it up under the brow you
could use this kind of thing under the
eye too if you wanted to but most of our
action today is going to be happening
above the dress a under the brow under
the eye most of our activity today on
the eyes is going to be happening on the
top lid and something that I think is
just so great these physicians formula
quads okay I've talked about the one in
Canyon classics and quarts quartet for
some reason I never got the third one
until more recently and this one is
called classic nudes and yet might seem
like boring as all get-out as you look
at it you may be like okay
most basic shades on the planet but the
textures are really really nice I've
loved you know the pigmentation on these
shadows and it is just a nice little
easy basic quad like use it alongside
something more shimmery or just use it
on its own and I don't know it looks
really finished really natural if you're
just wanting that naturally contoured I
look this is the way to go so I'm going
to take this brown right here it's a
little bit warm and light d25 we're
going to crease it up it kind of looks
like the shade of my coffee right now
speaking of coffee do you guys have any
favorite like K cups that you're
drinking lately
I got a it's it was the target house
brand white chocolate macadamia pretty
good pretty good
I also think maybe one of my favorite
like flavored coffees of all time I
don't always have to drink a flavored
kind you know I can go with just like we
had the Maxwell House singles those are
fine but the Gloria Jean's wears it
Gloria Jean's I've always thought of her
as Gloria Jean and it's the hazelnut
kind that is so good I mean the
fragrance the aroma that's coming out of
my Keurig when that stuff is coming into
my cup is just a beautiful thing
I love it ever feel like a I shadow
blender that doesn't know when to quit
like you could keep going and going like
oh I need a little more on this side now
a little more on that side it's like you
got to be decisive with eye shadow at
some point and just feel like yeah I'm
done I'm stopping there I don't care
okay then and I'm taking a little bit of
this shade and this by the way in
transit I ordered this alpha Voltas
website and this white shade like
cracked like half of it is gone but I
still think it's very usable there's a
lot there still so I'm still going with
it but yeah it only takes a little bit
of a cracked powder shadow to make a
huge mess in a box or a bag or whatever
and I think I am going to apply a little
bit of that light shade here on the
inner part of my lid and yeah these are
all entirely matte no shimmer
I like shimmer but sometimes I just get
in matte moods speaking of shimmer and
matte I was quizzing Belle the other day
she's got this like pretend play makeup
so that we ordered some was sent to us
and it's it's really fun and it looks so
realistic like the little compacts that
it's very adult looking you know and I
was laying out a bunch of these sparkly
ones and there was one that happened to
not have any sparkle on it
and so I was trying to like teach her
the lesson which ones matte which ones
shimmer and she actually ended up
getting it and then she'd say matte
matte and there are people out there who
are probably saying like why the heck
are you teaching your 18 month old 19
month old about the difference between
matte and shimmer and the answer is
because she could play with that stuff
for like a straight hour and a half and
I'm sitting there like need to teach the
kid about something while we're up here
so I don't know if I really narrated
what I just did there but I put this on
the creamy shade on the inner part of
the lid and a little bit of the
Brown just on the outer part of the lid
and I think I'm going to take some more
of this slightly deeper Brown and just
take that right here in the outer part
of the crease just to deepen it up a bit
more you can do this kind of look if you
don't have this particular quad I'm sure
you've probably got these shadows
floating around somewhere in your stash
so check it out try it out what else did
we do long bugs parents we're here I
mentioned we ate like kings and Saturday
night we got Dairy Queen I don't know if
you guys have seen the Dairy Queen
commercials where they're taking
blizzards now and they're filling them
with a core of some sort of goop you
know like a sort of goop like they're
going to put strawberry sauce in one of
them they're going to put hot fudge in
one of them they're gonna put
marshmallow cream in one of them so
that's what I went with it was like a um
sorry I need my brush here um it was a
rocky road blizzard so it had brownie
bites peanuts
maybe something else and it was like in
a chocolaty seeming ice cream and in the
center there is a legit core of
marshmallow sauce and it was so dang
good I did not need to eat the whole
thing because it was so sweet you know
sometimes I I feel like I've got as much
of a sweet tooth is anyone out there but
I still have my limits you know it's
like I could only do so much sweet
sometimes and I need to hand it off to
somebody else and I don't know if it was
too sweet for Tyler because I don't
think he had even finished it a product
that I'm using for my liquid eyeliner is
not necessarily a favorite I'm just kind
of using it for this in fact it might be
kind of a non favorite because I started
using this NYC liquid liner again and I
have been kind of disappointed a time or
two like it's definitely transferred
around the inner part of the eye like
transferred down onto my lower inner rim
and weird stuff around my inner corner
and I don't know why I don't ever
remember it doing that in the past but
I'm not really digging that about it but
I'm just kind of using it because I have
so not a real favorite just going to use
it now I have to take a break from the
chitchat and really concentrate here
okay
birdies are chirpin outside like crazy
I'm loving springtime great temperatures
it's actually been a little bit cool
this week which I'm not complaining
about because our a/c went out on Sunday
afternoon we're getting an entirely new
system dudes like yep the motor burned
up okay wonderful and it's getting I
guess the age of the system was getting
to where you know we could replace it
and we're going with something very
energy-efficient so we'll probably see a
real change in our power bills too which
is good but they're not installing till
the end of the week so it's a good thing
it's been a pretty mild if not cool week
around here but the flowers outside like
there is so much pretty landscaping
around our place and it's nothing I can
take credit for because it was kind of
like planted there by the people who
owned the house before and beautiful
stuff like flowers little trees little
shrubs I think the roses might be my
favorite
lots of roses around that are blooming
in this I put them on snapchat a time or
two but this hot pink like absolute
bright magenta like the perfect lip
color you know in a flower form that's
what they are it's just they're gorgeous
um I'm at that place where I'm like I
don't know if these wings are like even
distant relatives here going to use
another thing that's pretty much right
up there with the Milani eyeshadow
primer in terms of being like a constant
favorite that I don't always mention but
I am gonna mention now it's my shadow
eyes and almond cream I'm going to take
this right here on the lower inner rim
because like I said there's going to be
most things happening with this look are
going to be happening kind of above the
eye and there there we go there's a
little bit of transfer already over here
on this side that might just be operator
error then I'm going to dust away some
of this powder that's been baking the
under eye and yeah it looks real smooth
Matt and even now yes it does and then
I'm going to smudge a little bit of this
brown just under the lower lash line
here
just keeping this on the very outer part
of the eye like just under the wing and
like the outer fourth of the lower
lashline and taking a little break from
the eyes I'm going to do some bronzing
this is my Physicians Formula butter
bronzer and it's one that I think I kind
of maybe I hold it and I knocked it a
little bit because I didn't really see a
lot of color coming off of it
it smells like absolute suntan lotion to
me 100% but it is kind of a nice little
light bronzer / light contour for me
like I can kind of take it down in this
zone
it looks really soft but kind of
realistic I'm kind of all about the soft
barely-there contour right now just put
that right in there and it's maybe got a
little bit of a satiny finish but
nothing too shimmery by any means so I
like that take it down the neck a little
bit up around the hairline as well can
we talk about this this is the benefit
dandelion do so this is there like
liquefied pink type liquid blush okay so
yeah it's liquefied it would be a liquid
I have said you know I don't really like
the dandelion blush because I feel like
it's too light it's too subtle and an
odd thing is happening cuz I got the
cheekathon palette and i swatched the
dandelion in the cheekathon palette side
by side with my old dandelion that I
have in just a single and I swear the
cheekathon palette one is more pink and
more colorful than the other the other
is a little more dull like just kind of
a light barely-there pink and the one in
the palette seems like a different shade
to me so let me know your thoughts does
anyone else notice that but outside of
those powder products I'm really liking
this product because look it's very
pinky and it just it has a lot of nice
pigment on the skin it's not going to be
a real glowy thing I pumped out way too
much I should have known better but I'm
going to pick some up with a small
stipple brush and just kind of DAB it
here on the cheeks and see how much
color comes off of this and it's so
pretty and just fresh looking I can't
get over that shade hmm
like is this a fresh springtime cheek or
is this a fresh springtime cheek and the
packaging on this is so cute I love that
my favorite highlight which I believe
was my favorite last month but it's
still a favorite I love this stuff has
anyone tried this over the course of the
past month and can tell me how much they
liked it too it's the filter finished
setting powder and universal from laura
geller so it looks kind of like almost
color corrective but it's just the
prettiest glow and you could totally use
this all over the skin but there's
something about the look of it when it's
right on top of the cheek that just
makes me love it and it's kind of nice
to pair with that um dandelion Dew
because there's really no shimmer in
that product so I kind of take it down
the nose as well
make it a little bit up in here about
the brow area and then I'm going to
spray all over with my glossy a soothing
face miss my rose water spray I think
I'm kind of running low on this now
actually I might need to pick up another
hmm a lot of sprays let's go into my
coffee next up I'm just going to curl my
lashes garbage man's here yay this is
covergirl super sizer of course I'm
trying the newest one kind of reinforced
my love for the original so I'm just
going to apply a little bit of that and
then I'm going to do a really thick lash
with this look see that's why I kind of
like like a really thick lash but with a
barely there kind of eye shadow look
paired with it I think it looks really
pretty
can't remember where this came from my
bin lady mass comm I got this cute
little like eyelash holder case here
some of them don't exactly like to stay
in their place but that's what they look
like in there that holds three sets and
I'm going to use these I believe they
were the Koko lashes in Queen B they're
really voluminous sometimes when I put
them on I'm like oh no they're too big
they're too much but eventually I seem
to you know be okay with the fact that
they're huge
said one of those moments where you look
down you're like where's the other
hoopla hash I don't know where I said it
that happens to me all the time these
lashes really do kind of make me feel
like a fairy princess though so that's
always nice sometimes you need that I'm
also going to just dab a little mascara
at the base here and a little bit on the
lower lash line yes I was reminded as I
was retesting this to compare it
alongside the super sizer fibers I can
get away with wearing this one on the
lower lashes and it won't smudge I don't
know what TV shows you guys are enjoying
right now but I fully binge on Bates
Motel for a while there and now we are
totally caught up and I just I love it
but there's just there's always
something going wrong you'll have like
maybe two minutes of something seeming
normal and right and that should then
like this somebody does something I just
I don't want to talk too much about it
or else I'll give something away but the
whole sheriff Romero thing I had tweeted
about his um eyelash isn't how fabulous
his lash line looks it's so thick and
apparently he was like born with an
extra row of lashes you know bummer for
him but I had tweeted about it and I was
tweeted back countless times from people
who you know thought yeah does he wear
eyeliner is he just blessed with an
amazing lash line and then finally
someone had tweeted me a little clip of
a makeup artist working on him and it
was showing them going in with some
concealer on the lash line to actually
lessen the effect of his natural lashes
can you imagine and yeah it is pretty
amazing but not to take anything away
from his acting because I think he's a
fabulous actor but you know when you're
into makeup things like peoples amazing
eyelashes tend to stand out to you and
all that is left is lips and I'm going
to go with the shade that I think is
like the shade of my past month that I
really liked and it's kind of I don't
know I might describe it as like a soft
red or maybe even a red with
a little bit of pink in it a great
example of that shade is this one from
Mac it's a cream Sheen and the shade is
called nice to meet you and this is
really comfortable on the lips as well
but you'll see what I mean like when I
get it on here the color it almost looks
more reddish in the tube and you can see
a little more pink when it's on the lips
you know it's just like a reddish pink
and it's kind of bold and I think it's
really pretty this time of year it's
kind of the color I associate with the
word poppy if someone says poppy likings
you think of this kind of pinkish red
but aren't crime scenes for MEC like the
best I love that shine you know it's
maybe a little more sheer than some
other lipsticks like you tried a matte
lipstick from Mac it would come off
probably more opaque and intense than
this but it's just I don't know fun
springy summery type color and at this
point I do want to mention a few things
that are favorites that didn't get used
in this particular look and that would
be the kind of girl outlast lipsticks I
could just as easily went with one of
these um I love all those shades that I
mentioned in the hidden gems of the
drugstore video I tried them all on in
that video so check that out but I just
pulled out fireball which was the first
one I got and it's a really pretty
orange and also I'm kind of an everyday
easy shade is magnetic mauve and so
that's going to be a little bit cooler
deep pink and then just a couple other
things for cheeks that I love this
makeup revolution the one highlight
contour stick and it just has a
beautiful sheen on the skin it's great
for if you really wanted an intensely
highlighted effect you know dab some of
this on the cheek and then follow it up
with a powder highlight and you would
just be glowing for days like it's
gorgeous
and then another blush that I like
because I just can't use all the blushes
at the same time but this Milani baked
blush in bellissimo bronzed very very
pretty
summery kind of peachy golden blush is
the way I would put that that's ringing
a bell I also mentioned that in the
hidden gems video too so yeah this is
kind of my general look that I'm really
liking some glowing skin sort of a
simple eye shadow very exaggerated
lashes and a bright lip that's kind of
my springtime go-to right now so thank
you guys so much for watching I'm
probably going to put a bra on and a
different shirt and maybe redo this bun
not necessarily take my hair out of the
bun but just neaten up the bun a little
bit and then I'll be good to go for the
day so thanks for watching guys we'll
see you later
