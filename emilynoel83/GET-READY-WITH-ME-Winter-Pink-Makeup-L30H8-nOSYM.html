this look that I'm calling winter pink
and I have referred to some lip products
here and there as like a wintery pink
type lip color and by that I mean a pink
that is not too a you know bright and
Barbie pink and cotton candy and all
that stuff but something that's just a
little bit more muted maybe a little bit
more like dusty and mixed with a neutral
so today's look is a very monochromatic
look we've worked the winter pink vibe
into the eyes cheeks and lips and on the
eye look while I've got a lot of like
blingy sparkle happening on there there
is kind of an option on this I think
where you can easily take this look in a
matte direction too so I'll point that
out as I go along in the tutorial but
this look was requested on the last
video that I did to get ready with me
with the old Hollywood look and I
thought it was just a perfect idea for a
little bit different kind of look this
time of year so thank you guys so much
for joining in and here we go all righty
how the heck are you everyone I am going
to shake up my foundation today I'm
using Rimmel lasting finish which is
always a favorite all it needs is a pump
or maybe a squeezy tube you know back
the way it used to be and it would be
like perfection foundation I'm just
dabbing this around I really just want
my foundation to even out my skin today
I don't really need any other special
functions you know and I wear the shade
soft beige in that foundation and I'm
going to blend it out today with some
classic f80 action Sigma f80 flat top
kabuki every now and then you just want
to go back to the old stuff that you
know that works that you know works
I am wearing the softest little sweater
here ever thank you so much to Bub's mom
who gave this to me they stopped through
the area over this past weekend dropped
off some early Christmas gifts so thank
you so much and next I'm going to kind
of combine a couple of concealer steps
I'm going to take some Tarte shape tape
and with that I'm going to give myself a
few dabs like just kind of right up in
here don't need to over use this product
but that's pretty much where I'm going
to stop with that but I am going to also
dab a little bit of erase paste which I
wear in the shade medium right around my
innermost corner here just for a little
correcting I don't always feel like I
need that every day but you know when I
do I do
and then the lucky sponge of the day is
the Real Techniques mini sponge so I'm
just going to dab this out
and then I'm taking my physicians
formula youthful wear this is the
translucent matte finish powder and this
is a nice little setting powder either
just for the under eye or all over the
face sometimes I'm just in a hurry this
is the setting powder that goes
everywhere I'm not especially in a hurry
right now but it just seemed like the
right thing to grab for you know and I'm
using this Sigma it's called the spot
light duster it's actually a
highlighting brush but something about
the fullness of it sometimes I just will
use it as an all-over powder brush thus
far I've used a lot of tried-and-true
products but I am going to sort of play
with something that just came in the
mail yesterday this tardis Pro glow to
go it's so funny because the in the
video where I was messing around with
the larger ProGlide I remembered saying
I think this could be condensed you know
into something a little bit smaller with
fewer highlights and maybe just one
contour and then this is what they
apparently already had in the works
here's what really would have excited me
just one highlight the powder contour
but also that cream contour I think
Tarte did a really nice cream contour in
the larger palette so anyways I'm taking
some of that layer contour shade and I
am applying it right here I don't know
how many of my viewers I know I've
talked about Erica before I don't know
how many of you have headed over to her
channel but she's doing vlogmas she's
putting a heck a lot of work into doing
these daily vlogging videos well tons of
vloggers are you know this is that's no
joke that's a lot of work to put in
every day to pull out the camera
non-stop and not to mention
excuse me edit it all together
I'm loving her video she's doing an
awesome job so I will link to her below
I would like to say thank you so much
for all of the incredibly incredibly
sweet feedback on the baby name reveal
video you guys are the best just the
nicest sweetest people and we are so
thankful for you I feel like when I'm
sharing info about that little tidbits
that are so close to our you know
personal lives I really feel like I am
among friends when I share that because
I've been at this YouTube thing for a
long long time you know it's been nine
years as of November so when I'm getting
on there and talking about stuff I know
there there are some people who have
been with me for the long haul and your
kindness just does not go unnoticed I
appreciate you so much and I'm just so
thankful that we're all you know in it
together and I trust that you'll show up
on my doorstep ready to you know relieve
me in babysit whenever necessary like
yes just kidding although that would be
kind of cool but yeah as of this
Thursday we'll be down to exactly four
weeks left in the pregnancy for weeks
until we hit that forty week mark you
know so if we make it that far my blush
today we're talking winter pink I love
this one this is Milan ease romantic
rose from their Rose blush lights a nice
matte blush pigmented but goodness works
for everything just gives the softest
blushed look I can't think of too many
people who wouldn't enjoy this one but
it's really going to work with the sort
of monochromatic feel we're going to be
pulling off with this look today about
time I talked about the actual makeup
look of the day huh I've been playing
with this look on and off for a couple
nearly a couple weeks now and I was
planning to use a different highlight
but I think since I have this little
palette now I'm going to just go ahead
and maybe use this Galena shade right up
top it's a little cooler sorry it's
everything so mirrored eighty percent of
the products are packaged with this
mirrored casing you know
there's some of that well that's pretty
okay tell me in the comments what is the
song that you right now cannot get out
of your head for me it is that one dude
who is on the voice the country guys
sorry I haven't been watching all season
but my mom's like you've got to start
watching The Voice this was like two
weeks ago so I start watching and it's
the guy with the beard who sang even
though we ain't got money
I'm strong enough with you honey but the
part that sticks with me about that song
is the way he says and tail me if like
it look that it's that really really
countryside place with that song and I'm
always like and I can't hear that
without trying to mimic it is anybody
else that way like you are literally you
want to make that sound with your own
voice but you can't entail me and I just
find myself a randomly throughout the
day and doing something totally like
different and then I try to sing that
line I'm recording this by the way
before I know the winner of the voice
because that's gosh that's tonight I'm
shooting this on Tuesday okay so that
song has been like non-stop running in
my head and then pretty much any like
Christmas tune I sing a lot of oh holy
night while Belle's eating her dinner
like she'll say sing Christmas songs
like a lot of times she likes me to talk
about a different story like whether
it's a book she's read or a you know a
Disney movie she likes me to kind of
rehash what happened in the story I
don't know and then she likes to come in
and sort of fill in the blanks about the
story you know but lately she's been
like sing Christmas songs so I put on
full-on concert around dinner time so
setting mouth do we finish entail me
I've still got some brow Wiz left and I
go through these skinny pencils faster
than just about anything in my makeup
collection a skinny brow pencil I just
excuse me breeze through it for a while
I thought I might have run out of this
but I was getting confused with some
other ones that I
I actually run out of and I still have
my brow wiz in the medium brown so I'm
going to go ahead and use some of that
here's another fun fact about the voice
this season
Billy Gilman's on their back when I
worked at the TV station I interviewed
Billy Gillman yes I did it was in 2010 I
found that interview on YouTube and this
was when he was kind of trying to break
into the country music scene again and I
don't think he's sang live on the air
but we were it was just a quick
interview kind of promoting an
appearance he was making in our area and
so I thought that was funny because when
I was having that discussion with mom
about to say no you should watch The
Voice you know Billy Gilman's on there
he's really good and I'm like Billy
Gillman
I've interviewed Billy Gillman I haven't
interviewed a lot of celebrities so
things stand out you know certain people
stand out some time
I had another night last night where I
slept on my eyebrow buddy
it isn't that ridiculous but it I do
that and like I'll be laying on this
side and then I'll wake up and be like
the whole outer part of my eyebrow is
going in every every direction I tried
to take that thing down when I was
moisturizing you know tried to to keep
it in line a little bit this NYX tinted
brow mascara and if you don't have your
control-freak on hand NYX control-freak
brow gel or if you don't have a control
freak in your life no you can just put
this on and it holds really nicely too
so I'm going to see if I'll take some of
my wild hairs make them lay the heck
down sometimes you see makeup tutorials
and nobody's struggling there's no
struggle of any kind are their struggles
really or they just cutting that stuff
out and where is my Milani eyeshadow
primer excuse me
okay I had to do some digging in that
drawer the other day Milani eyeshadow
primer and this eye look is really not
too tough I would I wouldn't say it's
not super challenging and I think
there's and I think they're it but and I
think there are a couple of ways you can
go with it you could keep it like an all
matte eye very easily but I'm going to
show you how to kick it up and make it
like ultra glam and sparkly on the lid
as well but start thinking about any
palette that you have that contains some
matte dusty rose um
type shades here so like a Naked 3
palette has exactly what I'm talking
about with the shade called limit and
the shade called nooner there those
kinds of colors um lorac pro one has
that color called mauve these kinds of
shades are becoming very commonly
sprinkled around in palettes these days
I thought I'd reach for something sort
of old school that I hadn't used in a
while but the colors are out there
certainly so I'm going to build up some
of that madness first and I'm going to
start with limit which would be the
lighter of the two kind of pinky colors
here
yeah that color applies certainly a
little bit darker than you might even
think but that's cool I'm fine with that
now that I've got it in the crease I'm
going to think about lightly bringing
that shade up even higher a lot of this
is dependent on the amount of space you
have between your crease and your
eyebrow but if you've got some there to
work with I say go for it pull it upward
quite a ways like almost to the brow and
then I'm using just a little brush that
comes in this palette and again going
back to the color Kolb limit and I'm
going to get a little bit of that going
on my lid also it's funny because
packing that shadow directly on um you
know just your eye primer that's there
it kind of looks lighter than it did in
the crease
and then I'm going to go to nooner which
is even deeper and dustier and we're
going to work this up into mostly the
outer part of the crease today
so we got this beautiful
the Rosie dustiness happening here and
so I'm just gonna blend over the edges
of that and take a little bit of this
color called strange at the end funny
how they give the name strange to
perhaps the most common color in the
entire palette but I'm going to take
that right under the brow very very
lightly and then a little bit of
darkness right on the lid we're going to
this deepest color you can just use the
flat brush that comes in this palette or
any flat brush you like but it's the
color called black heart yeah black
heart and you want to dab a little bit
of that right on the outer part of the
lid not wanting to take it in too far
maybe get really right up into that
crease zone too
now we're going to have a little fun if
you want to build up some sparkle
continue on this step with me otherwise
you know you can leave this look pretty
much matte like it is and that'll be
just fine too I'm gonna take a little
bit of this elf smudge pot and the color
is called ain't that sweet oh that
follows my little country theme that
seems to be chasing me around this video
and pick some of that up with a small
flat brush and I'm going to begin laying
this down right on the inner part of my
lid and pull it about two-thirds of the
way in yes I realize this is cream over
powder but sometimes when you want to
make a little statement with the
shimmery shininess of a certain product
you can do that don't be scared and then
I'm going to do that on the other side
real quick too another cream shadow if
you got it that would be good here would
be the Maybelline Color tattoo in the
color called inked in pink
okay so you got that brightness now just
on the lid kind of coming to where that
darker shadow was applied on the outer
part of the lid and then for a real dose
of Sparkle I dug up this urban decay
space cowboy
look at the shine you know if your brush
a little bit and pick up some of that
and then pack that directly on your
light pink and oh is that shimmery and
fun sparkly goddess
don't be shy with it if you're going to
go there with colors like this really
pick it up and tack it on but having
that little base on there will really
help you from having a ton of fallout
with a color like this because if you
were just to use a space cowboy dry I
think you might struggle a bit now I
think this is my opinion here but when
you got a really highly shimmery um
thing going on on your lids what makes
it look so clean and so finished is a
very nice dark black liner I've got my
Jordana color envy and black envy here
you ever have a dessert that's so good
you're still thinking about it like a
good five days later I recently had from
one of our local restaurants the best
tasting slice of coconut cream pie
who was it good but there was one flaw
never enough crust almost anywhere you
go out and you get a pie and they just
don't give you quite enough crust
thickness I'm not saying I need like a
chicago pan pizza type crust on my pies
but I mean nobody does pie crusts like
my mom and I actually had gotten on the
phone with my mom the following day and
said mom could you start trying to make
some coconut cream pies because I think
it would be perfect with you know the
the filling tastes amazing but on her
crust it would be so good because she
makes such a good crust and now I'm
going into dangerous territory because
the first wing needs to be a little
thicker wala just realized I wasn't
recording that last step at least it was
just one little thing but I put Rimmel
scandaleyes in nude on the lower inner
rim and I'm going to do just a little
bit of shadow on the lower lash line but
I kind of I kind of want to keep it
light down there so I'm going to go back
to dark art or black black art which is
right next to dark side and I'm just
going to get a little bit of that
rocking right over here the shade
reminds me so much of Mac beauty mark
I remember when I was like head over
heels for that color still a pretty
color I just don't think about it as
much couple little adjustments on the
look I just want a little bit more
visible rosiness above the eye because I
know I'm doing a very full lash so I'm
going to take limit and nooner here here
just kind of get some of both and you
could use your a 25 again or you know
this is the e36 which i think is really
nice about diffusing color and just kind
of get that all over that space above
the crease
so what I'm going to do next you guys
have seen me put on mascara about a
trillion times and so I'm going to for
the sake of keeping this video from
being super long I'm going to go ahead
and apply that off-camera gonna put on
my lashes as well and then come back to
yet and the lashes that I'm wearing are
these are del-one 13s which are
absolutely fantastic and I found these
in my lash lookbook which is a great
like I think it's been marked down now
to 20 dollars it says 25 here but look
at this you get all these styles of
lashes to play with some are natural
some aren't you know this is toward the
more dramatic in the 113 but really fun
little set okay so I've got my lashes on
and for my lip color I am using
something that I've kind of been
experimenting with a little bit lately
it's the Kylie lip gloss and coke okay
I don't have a really long time before
drying this brand and I actually tried
to dry it a few times but things are
always sold out it was some sort of deal
somewhat recently and I was able to
actually get a few things so I've been
trying a liquid lipstick and eye palette
and also one of these glosses so this is
coke okay as I said and the gloss it has
a brush tip applicator and it really
truly is the perfect kind of pink for
this look and it's a fine line with
pinks because for a quote-unquote winter
pink what I'm looking for is a pink
that's not too light also not too coral
I want it to have just the slightest bit
of neutral kind of mixed in with it
so that's really what this is and it's
nice and soft but with a lot of glosses
I might you know line the lips first and
you certainly could with this situation
too but it's a very opaque gloss so it
does give you a lot of full coverage
color on the mouth
so thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this look maybe this is
something you can work into your holiday
fun makeup if you like a little sparkle
on the eyes definitely different from
the classic old Hollywood red lip look
that I did a while back so thanks again
and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
