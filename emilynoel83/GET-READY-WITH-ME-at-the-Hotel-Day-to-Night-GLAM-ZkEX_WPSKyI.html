room this is actually the JW Marriott in
downtown Chicago we are here for bubbies
got some trial lawyers association stuff
going on this weekend really special
honor for his boss mark who's being
installed as the president later tonight
so big event and I thought I could do
maybe a little special occasion get
ready with me here even though I don't
know that I brought specifically special
stuff I just kind of you know packed
pretty quickly actually left a bunch of
eyeshadow at home but magically
subconsciously I packed a little vizier
petit pro palette just by miracle that's
the only eyeshadow I have but the
lighting is not ideal here because my
view is really just a giant building you
really got to look up to see any sky so
I'm working with what light I have I
have my camera propped up on bubs hair
pomade and anybody ketchup bottle and I
just enjoyed the most delicious
breakfast doesn't my Chicago chicken
biscuit that I got for breakfast biscuit
some like crispy chicken in there right
hitmontop gravy oh my gosh and I got to
tell you also we did something very
special here yesterday involving me that
I can't share yet but it was awesome and
it was unforgettable and I can't wait
for you to know what I'm talking about
there so yeah well he's doing some stuff
this morning I thought well I could do a
little video here so this is just my
blog camera it's probably not gonna be
like ideal quality I feel like I'm
turning blue a little bit in the
viewfinder but okay Smashbox photo
finish primer I'm putting some of that
on I brought that because I recently dug
that out of the back of a drawer and
remembered how much I liked it also look
at this I thought to bring this with me
finally somewhere this is a little thing
that I think I got it from Nordstrom
like a Nordstrom sale maybe a couple of
sales ago and it's this neatest little
pouch it's got a magnetic closure there
and it came with two Beauty blenders in
it and also a Beauty Blender solid
cleanser but it's open you know so you
can put your Beauty Blender back in and
it's gonna dry out but it's not gonna
get all gunked up with other things you
know because it's protected in the pouch
and I thought
a brilliant thing we need that kind of
thing right for our beauty blenders it
came with a peach one and a like
lavender colored one and I also decide
to bring along some laura geller cover
lock foundation here this looks really
good on my skin and it wears a decently
long time and this feels kind of
rediscovered too from my video where I
was talking about full coverage
foundations and you know when you're
going for a special occasion look
generally like to bust out a little
coverage can looks real peachy on my
skin but something about this once you
get it all blended in it looks really
really nice
it's amazing how dark it can really look
in Chicago though I guess it is sort of
a partly cloudy day here but when you're
in the midst of the city and all these
buildings like you can just feel kind of
dark not seeing a lot of nature right
now
I gotta say though this sponge doesn't
feel like a classic beauty blender it
feels more like a real techniques sponge
I feel like there's a special texture to
a pink beauty blender like it's just a
bit more porous I think that now put it
in here I can clean it out later but
it's got a little place to be and I'm
looking across and don't you just wonder
like what's happening in all the office
buildings there I can see somebody's
gotten out a 12-pack of Diet Coke
somebody else is looking at their
computer I think they're looking at
Facebook um
spy on Chicago with me that's what this
video really is we had so much fun last
night we went to dinner at this kind of
like seafood type restaurant
and before that there was a mixer for
the you know the trial lawyers group
it was a lot of fun as you might have
seen on Maya Instagram story
but I'm putting on a little bit of
erased paste and I'm looking for my
brush this is the Sephora airbrush
concealer works really great in my
melasma areas not that I feel like I
have to apply a lot of it with that type
of foundation that I applied but I'm
kind of moreso doing it to cater to that
inner corner as well and you know I took
some shape tape because I really haven't
used my light/medium shaped tape in a
while and I thought you know is there
anywhere I could put this I think I
might put a little around my nose just
you know for the heck of it for old
times
we're just playing right now just bang
it out motel room but no makeup
so I feel as though the skin is looking
pretty good and even and I'm gonna take
some of my coverfx powder this is
usually what I travel with because I
like the capping system like even though
I prefer my Laura Mercier or my
Maybelline fit me powders they don't
have this nice little thing here I'm
using my ELF a small tapered brush and
I'm just patting some of that powder
right in here on the under eye not
really baking but just kind of lightly
setting that texture that I've got going
there
smooth it out even it out I also find I
have better luck with staying power if I
really make a point to set my nose
sometimes I just casually dust over it
and I'm like I set my t-zone but I
really like did I because then I will
have some product breakdown there from
time to time and then I'm taking a
little bit of this Milani powder and I'm
just gonna set the rest of the skin the
laura geller foundation is not really a
problematic like super sticky product
but I just feel a little more
comfortable that I've got a light bit of
powder so I'm not really picking up a
lot on the brush but I am just dusting
that around Oh somebody's talking to
that one guy I think he's off Facebook
now because I know you cared I have this
I brought my honest hacia blush trio
here and there's kind of a bronzer a
shade bronzer II and I'm gonna pick a
little bit of that up on my brush I feel
like it's a bronzer that has a lot of
red in it I mean putting it on about as
light as one can possibly put it oh it's
so quiet here like I mean I can hear
traffic and stuff down below but I mean
just in the hotel so quiet and then I
will also go ahead and use the blush I
think I'll do the pink and it's morning
as I sit here and do this but I want
this look to really last me through
dinner time you know like all through
the evening and now I hate to be a
little of the coral - why not
and then everyone he also brought this
my makeup geek highlighter in starlight
love it a little bit right in here
dreary lighting not doing it justice I'm
trying Oh lights are turning on people
are getting to work and the floor above
and I'm gonna do a little brow with my
ELF instant lift brow pencil and a ton
of fill-in but just you know evening
some things out in a few places
it's just such a good texture like it
really works through the brows so easily
I had my first sushi last night I know
I'm in my early 30s and I have not had
sushi yet but I loved it it involved
Lobster and avocado and I'm sold
what's so good very enjoyable
so she is just one of those foods that's
never really like deeply intrigued me
you know like I just got to try that
like I just I don't know for some reason
I just wouldn't have really predicted
that I like it that much but I really
really do I think it's fantastic
we'll do a little eyeshadow primer I've
got this urban decay on the anti-aging
because it makes me feel good that I'm
putting anti-aging stuff on my eyes
like I said this magically is the only
little eye shadow think that I have on
me I had a little baggie of some others
but it just didn't make it into my tote
bag somehow this was in my travel makeup
bag so yay for that I'm going to use
some of this shade right here which is a
little bit of a kind of a dusty rose
soft brown mix and I'm gonna apply that
to my crease yesterday I did have kind
of a purpley thing going on my eyes and
the dress that I'm wearing tonight is
black it does have a little like purple
floral splash on it sort of toward the
bottom but I don't really want to do the
same I look two days in a row and I feel
like I've never used this palette and
kept it completely neutral but that
might be what I do today so I'm gonna
take the light shade you know simple is
okay you can still do a really glam look
with liner and lashes eyeshadow doesn't
always have to be the centerpiece of the
look so I'm going to take some of this
again the matte kind of pinky tone shade
applies really nicely here inner part of
the lid brightening so weird shooting a
beauty video in a different environment
you know different camera I'm talking to
you um let's do a little bit of this
matte plummy Brown sometimes the shade
gets away from me a little bit I kind of
am appreciating mattes more and more
that allow me to build them up and can
ultimately achieve nice darkness but
aren't just like zero to a hundred you
know
so I'm getting a little plumb in this
look from the shadow but it's not like
the the purple pop from yesterday
I feel like it's gotten even darker and
cloudier outside because just my ability
to see/hear to do my makeup in the room
like it feels add in I got my eyeliner
on I had to stop the camera because
something was flashing at me I don't
know what but just curling the lashes
and then I'm popping on some L'Oreal
lash paradise mascara which I love I
think I saved this little disclaimer
every time but don't get the it's not
exactly the mystic black
I always think exotic but but don't get
the mystic black because for some reason
I feel like it's a completely different
formula than blackest black
it seemed so dry to me and I even like
dry ish mascaras but that was just on
another level
the lip color I think I'm gonna put on
today is Snapdragon here from Becca and
what I think I'm gonna do is leave this
look sort of for day and I'll put my
lashes on later right before the big
shindig so they can really be fresh on
there and you can see just how much that
sort of transforms us into a nighttime
look and then I can also go over any
ways that I'm touching up my face if
necessary but I also bit my tongue the
third day and I feel like I'm talking
funny because I am like compensating for
the fact I'm always doing stuff like
that
I love this color of gloss
that's my look that's the look I'm gonna
wear today and then we'll see you again
for next time hey guys so it's later on
in the afternoon now and I've moved my
camera in here to the bathroom because
the light is actually coming off a
little bit better than I thought it
would and also both taking a little nap
and the other room probably better shut
the door but after doing the first part
I had a fun morning I went out with some
of the other ladies we went out to Navy
Pier which was really cool and walked
around there for a while and grabbed
some lunch
as well it was kind of windy and pretty
cool I think it was in the low 60s or
something today and it's been very very
hot and down in Southern Illinois so
it's strange to get this sort of climate
shift just within the same state but I
do have something that I thought might
be kind of fun to try touching up with
here it's the hourglass of Vail I have
it in the shade natural has called
retouching fluid it says apply anywhere
on the face for instant illumination and
sheer coverage to perfect and refresh
the complexion and for best results
gently Pat into the skin with fingers so
I thought maybe I could try that a
little bit I know this isn't like the
best shot ever but it's the only place
at roughly eye level where I could sit
my camera and I can already see like a
little bit from earlier today like
blemishes kind of coming back through
maybe a little under-eye this shape
should be pretty good I really didn't
want to go to too light we're just gonna
tap it in and see what happens I played
with this once before and I really feel
like the product was well described like
a shear you're going to put it on like
as a touch-up over existing makeup and
it's not going to really take up I
didn't notice any like unattractive
finish to the skin before I don't think
I'm seeing that now either but it's not
gonna do like heavy duty concealing if
that's what you need I'm just patting in
with my fingers like they said it might
be doing the best around redness I think
I mean things look smooth but you know
the under eye isn't totally perfect
there but it seemed either we were able
to handle like a little redness around
the nose pretty well but there are some
kind of hard-to-reach places where I
might prefer a brush
actually I put a little bit on out here
with a brush and I think that might
improve your coverage actually I mean if
you really like using a brush go for it
I say I'm also just repowering a little
bit I think that pub staying power
throughout the night because it may be a
bit of a late night and I just don't
want to have to even think about
Dominica so that's just a little more of
the cover ethics one thing I do like
about the powder is that I can just use
a very light amount and it's still
effective it's just not my favorite look
on the skin compared to warm RCA or the
fit me thicker I also have a bit of my
makeup geek bronzer and so that can be a
nice little way to sort of liven up the
skin again late in the day when you're
looking for a little change
not doing big contour just you know a
little depth in the right places totally
different forgot door I had like the
best burger weight at the Harry Caray
restaurant there on Navy Pier and I had
a burger that had some kind of like
bacon jam or something on it and fried
onions and it was so good I could only
eat half the fries were great too I'm
gonna pop on a bit more I stopped it
flush I almost always do touch-up blush
like if I'm really making a point to go
day to night with my makeup i I just do
never want to lose the blush that color
and life to skin and while I'm at it
since I think I lost some highlight
whatever highlight might have been there
due to the hourglass veil I am going to
grab my makeup geek star light again
that might not always need to do this
just depending on how much you're
touching up it so fools the eye I will
see this product on my skin and I'll be
amazed that my skin is not like actually
wet you know because it gives us such a
dewy appearance with just a light amount
and then I think I am going to rev up
the eyes just a little bit I got the
petite Pro a couple of brushes here this
is the MUA 315 that I really like to use
in the outer corner and instead of
lightly buffing in that crease shade
like we did earlier now I'm kind of
pinpointing some color in the outer
corner and lifting up and just kind of
taking the shape the eye and making it a
bit more dramatic and again this is that
plummy Brown it has a lot more plum in
it than I think I've ever given it
credit for
this'll vlog camera I think what's
trying to focus it almost sounds like a
cat purring likes just making a little
pretty okay so let's see let's take some
of this kind of bronzy brown shimmer
here just just touch of that on my light
wispy brush don't have a lot of counter
real estate here I've got my t3 rollers
in by the way and when a staying power
you know so holding and curl is really
important to me I try to make sure I let
those heat up an extra long time and
also leave them in an extra long time as
well as it's just a bear brush I will
take a little bit of my pink
another great way you can take your look
from day to night is to instead of
having like a light liner in the in the
lower inner rim like I had my wet and
wild ultimate brow highlight there I'm
gonna put a black liner there for
tonight this is my Marc Jacobs blacker
it's a very nice really rich black eye
liner in the lower inner rim and don't
just leave it at your lower inner rim
kind of pull a little bit of that color
coming like right in between your lashes
and then grab a smudge brush so you can
buff that a little bit and adding some
shadow on top will also soften the look
you look kind of part of you will feel
like gosh and adding in more shadow more
product you know I do I really need to
make it any more dramatic but actually
the addition of more eyeshadow in a soft
way will make this black look a little
less intense sometimes you got to add
more to look more natural yeah I know
that is just blend it along it looking
kind of smoky add some edgy but again I
think the shadow kind of cleans up that
look and softens it so for that I will
use some of this again the dark brownie
plum and we'll bring that in under my
winged liner from earlier
and then I think all that I will
probably do to complete the I look is
pop on some false lashes I've got a
really nice thick glamorous pair I think
these are the Soho style from Coco that
I can double check the website and you
confirm don't want to lead you astray
but they're nice and full really long
there may be a little even longer and
fluffier than the risque and I'm
definitely feeling a dramatic eye for
tonight's looks I'm gonna add those on
and I'll be right back so here we go
guys here's the night I look a couple of
other things that I did I should
probably point out I of course got the
lashes on there and then I also popped
the inner corner with some of this shade
and even though I didn't really think
this was going to be a super purpley
look I added some of that shimmery
purple just kind of right in here on the
lower lash line so that was that and
then I had bumped up the lip color a
little bit
I had brought this Natasha to known a
lip color palette v rosy plum tints
haven't used this in the longest time
and I use that deepest color I really
like the shade but in terms of travel
friendly on-the-go touch-up putting in
my purse there's no mirror here and
there's also not like a what brush may
be my best mate lip brush will fit in
there I'm not sure but I'll probably
just take the gloss that I put on top
which is buxom kir Royale it's one of
the lip creams I'll probably just kind
of stick with that shade if I need to
reapply at any point during the night so
I'll keep you posted on the hair because
I'm gonna let me stay in just a little
longer and then we'll see how that turns
out okay guys so here is the finished
look with the hair down those hot
rollers give this very like old-school
type wave which I really like in my hair
I had to tease and smooth a little bit
to really get the volume I was after
because I'm well aware that my hair will
fall within the first couple of hours so
you start bigger and then it just kind
of settles in but I'm pleased with the
makeup look I think that little bit of
plum in there definitely Compline
so what's happening in the dress really
well and this is my dress it's not like
this little shear window I've just
waiting here like oh I don't care to be
in a video
keep tie my skein one like it and so
here we are in bub I haven't put my
heels on yet I'm wearing those they've
got kind of a substantial heel we look
cute Bob you do with the bells of the
ball yeah anything else I have to share
about the outfit any other details I
hope you guys had or are having a great
weekend depending on when this gets up
and we will talk to you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
