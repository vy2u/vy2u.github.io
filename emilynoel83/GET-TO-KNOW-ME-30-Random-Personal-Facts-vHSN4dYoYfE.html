little bit different on my channel today
this video was kind of inspired by the
fact that and this is an amazing thing
but I hear from people all the time who
are just now discovering my channel like
after all these years that I've been on
YouTube you know like a 10 year
anniversary is coming up the end of this
year I still see people in comments or
on Twitter or wherever saying I just
found your channel I'm so excited and
that like just fills my heart because I
just can't believe that anybody's still
coming across me I guess after all these
years I think to have longevity on
YouTube can be a difficult thing so I'm
very grateful for that but that being
said I think sometimes people just see
you know the person here talking about
makeup sometimes you might wonder or I
know I might wonder with other people
like what's the real story behind this
person what are some things about this
person that I might not know and so
that's kind of what I'm going to be
sharing here in this video I just
created this random list of 30 things
that you may or may not know about me I
don't know I think I've done maybe a tag
like this in the past or I've done
something on my vlog channel before that
was sort of along these lines but it's
truly been years so anybody who found me
recently and didn't really go back in my
stuff there's just a lot that you might
not know and so I thought it might be
fun to do this and maybe if other people
out there make videos and want to do the
same I think it would be fun because
this is really the kind of video that I
wish was my first video on my channel
just getting people a little insight
into who I am rather than just jumping
in and saying hey I'm going to review
elf brushes for you today a very brief
background here in case you really don't
know anything about me I live in
southern Illinois with my husband Tyler
I call him bub so if you've heard me
just random like to speak of a bub
that's bub and he's an attorney we have
two little girls Belle and Eve Belle is
- she will be three in September and Eve
is coming up on five months here in a
few days back in 2006 when we came to
Southern Illinois so Tyler could go to
law school I started at the local ABC
affiliate down here and I just started
part-time
the only thing available was to be like
a behind-the-scenes associate producer
as they call it you know renting cameras
and editing videos and stuff but
eventually I started reporting producing
weekend anchoring and for the last four
of my six years at the station I was a
morning anchor so that was 2006 when the
whole news thing started and about a
year into that in 2007 was when I
started my YouTube channel and that
became like my after work activity so I
started it then and it's continued till
now and some people think of me I guess
is just having one job now like I'm
YouTube's full-time well I am mommy
full-time actually and I also do YouTube
so I consider myself like a work from
home mom I guess so I'm going to get
into my list here it's really random I
wanted it to be that way and if you guys
have like some random facts about
yourself it doesn't have to be like
thirty of them or it could be you know
that's talking but if you want to share
in the comment section like some cool
unusual things about yourself I think
that would be really fun for me to read
number one going to talk about pet
peeves my biggest pet peeves would be
lip smacking like hearing somebody while
they're chewing their food hearing all
of the juices in their mouth like
smacking the food chewing with your
mouth open primarily like if you could
just chew with your mouth shut we can
totally detour the whole issue because
that just doesn't create the annoying
noise that I'm talking about when people
are like chomping gum loudly and
smacking it with their mouths open
that's that's horrible but I don't find
any smacking noises from babies annoying
and I don't find it annoying when like
cupcake eats from her dish and I can
hear her eating I actually think that's
adorable
also my other pet peeves would be
Drifters on the road people who can't
stay in their Lane you know I'm saying
like you're on the interstate and maybe
the person driving the car
sure let's say they're not drunk or
they're not texting and they know full
well where they're going but they're
just real casual
I don't like casual drivers you are
driving a huge piece of machinery down
the road you owe it to everyone to just
like pay attention be careful and stay
in your lane okay like don't be drift
and
a bit over the side so somebody passed
and you think that guy give you all this
room and life no just pay attention stay
in your lane
there's my public service announcement
they're starting this off on a real
angriness I'm not like a person with a
massive list of pet peeves or this
tremendous amount of things that annoy
me but I just got I've really strongly
got those two things number two I
watched the news every morning before
school and I wrote to the elderly man
who did the AG reports the farm market
reports he was my favorite and I think
there was like a school project when I
was like really young I don't know I'm
thinking like third grade maybe I'm not
sure what age I was but I was pretty
young and they asked what person would
you trade places with for a day and I
chose this man who had this segment on
the news every morning and I really I
watched the Morning News primarily for
weather I'm sure I didn't understand a
lot of things that were being discussed
on the news I just loved the routine I
would get up in the morning and I would
just lay down for I don't know 15 20
minutes or so watched the news
catch the farm report from that guy and
I just enjoyed him to pieces his name
was Bob Turek number three I have hip
dysplasia with my left hip it's been
something that let's see we found out
about it when I was in like fifth sixth
grade fifth grade I think you know when
you take babies to the pediatrician and
they always like kind of align the legs
a little bit and check for any hip
abnormalities like I passed all those
tests when I was a little baby it was
somewhere along the line I had gotten
into fifth grade track I remember and
they had me doing the distance running
like the 800 and the mile and stuff and
I guess I had picked up on the fact that
something didn't feel quite right and
they got me checked out from like a more
local doctor and then an actual like
specialist person and they were able to
determine that my left hip is not
actually exactly where it should be and
I remember them saying there was a lot
of muscle around it and it was that was
very strong in that area and so they
said that helped me and any activities
that I could engage in that didn't put
stress on the joint would be good for me
so like swimming and I was big into
swimming at that time as well just
anything that could keep me active
without putting
a heavy impact on my hip so distance
running was out which I didn't really
like the distance ruining all that much
anyway so that wasn't a big deal but
that was kind of the thing running long
distances and walking long distances
have always kind of been off limits for
me from there on out and if I walk
around too much I can just feel kind of
a stiffness there like it's not
something that affects me always you
know every moment of a day I'm not
really noticing it but if I walk or run
too much or if I sit too much and
sometimes bulk it up you'll feel a
little stiff like I've got to like move
around and loosen things up a little bit
I feel like I've been very fortunate
that this has not gone on and affected
my day-to-day life in a major way down
the road who knows maybe I'll be in for
some sort of hip replacement or
something like that
but I rarely if ever talk about the time
that I may have mentioned it one time on
one of my channels but that is you know
a part of me as part of who I am and
number four I am a nerd level
cheerleader I say this because I think a
lot of times people associate
cheerleaders with like popularity and
everybody wants be a cheerleader and you
know the air headedness or whatever you
know they're a bunch of ridiculous
stereotypes I think that follow
cheerleaders cheerleading is a very
athletic sport first up I'll get that
out there but I did it because I like
really loved cheerleading it was not
really the popular thing to do in my
school for a period of time I think our
JV squad had like three girls on it you
know just weren't a ton of people
clamoring to get on the cheerleading
squad you know competitive tryouts no
sir it's like can I find someone in the
hallway who might join me in this
endeavor
you know anybody come on but I loved it
when I got into high school we started
out with just a really amazing coach
named Nikki and she just got this fire
lit in me for cheerleading and it was
something that I could actually do even
with my hip problems knowing I had that
problem I still went on and I learned to
tumble you know I got standing back tuck
and I learned how to do all kinds of
things it was amazing really that I was
able to do it with this situation I was
a flier I mean we're doing things that
you know maybe people tell my mom and
the stands like how can you watch her do
that
I absolutely love cheerleading anytime I
can catch a competition on ESPN even
today I will sit down and stop and watch
it I went on to cheer for four years in
college
I love choreography I loved learning new
scents I loved seeing other people you
know pick up a new skill and getting
into college I loved it most because I
really overcame some fears but like you
know doing the two and a half I pyramids
doing flips and basket tosses and things
like that like I went once I kind of
came into my own there I loved that so
much I would not be surprised if at some
point in my life I got into coaching or
something like that because I just I
truly enjoy it and the love has never
left me when I graduated from college I
was not ready to actually not be a
cheerleader anymore but like you know
there weren't any adult squads I've to
seeing around number five I have a
bunion I have a bunion on my right foot
you know if you're not familiar with
what a bunion is it's kind of like where
your toes hook into your foot it kind of
bumps out a little bit I think a lot of
people it does to some extent but if you
have a bunion it kind of bumps out a
little more affects maybe some shoe
choice --is that I would make I tend to
go for more comfortable shoes it makes
wearing heels for a long period of time
kind of difficult but yeah bunion loved
all yellow barriers have them do number
six I got bullied in junior high yes
those days are still you know you just
think back to some situations and
they're as clear as day in your mind
like I wish they weren't but they are
and when I was in junior high well my
dad was my principal first off and I
think that may have set me up for some
things just you know automatically I
think people thought like maybe I was
getting special treatment or getting
good grades or not getting in trouble
because my dad was a principal and that
was a big hell to the no because I just
I was by nature not a kid who was going
to like stir stuff up in class like I
really stopped and thought before I even
raised my hand to participate in class
you know what I mean I was just a really
low-key kid so I remember some of that
like being a thing and to top it off you
know if I did do something wrong
I'd get it worse than anyone else
because my dad was my principal not the
other way around like
I wasn't getting breaks because I
probably had had it harder because of
that one key thing that really turned
the tide of my whole junior high career
was when I remember being in the locker
room and a particular girl was getting
made fun of and I could just I could see
her hurting I could see her just being
very upset by it but she wasn't really
sticking up for herself and I will never
forget his exact words that I said and
this is little I don't know I was tiny
for the class like I'm a 5 foot tall
person it's just like little speck of a
girl over here and I just said why don't
you just stop and everybody it was like
silence and with the flip of a switch I
was the new target and it remained that
way for several years it was like in
defending her in that moment which it
just it practically jumped out in my
mouth like I said I wasn't always quick
to participate in class I was pretty
quiet kid and those words it was like I
remember feeling myself getting hot you
know like as I was listening to this and
I just said why don't you just stop from
there on out it was like I was teased
they would just look to me everyday and
think you know what's a new way we can
we can tease this girl and make her life
difficult and I remember one day I
thought I would take the strategy of
like laughing with them instead of
letting them see me hurt I would just
kind of like laugh off what they said
and that didn't last long because I
remember a girl looking we squared the
eye and saying we're not laughing with
you we're laughing at you and I just
well son of them it sucks I mean it was
just not not fun times you know and I
remember so many days after school
coming home and unloading all this stuff
on my mom and you know her best advice
to me was that eventually they'll grow
up you know but you might just have to
wait for that to happen and I just and I
was a happy kid by nature like I I never
wanted to go around sulking or being sad
but I just felt really isolated I felt
very um just victimized and I guess as a
result of sticking up for someone and
calling them out on something that
clearly shouldn't have been doing but
that leads me into my next point on
number 7 I was a sweetheart dance queen
my senior year of high school the kids
did grow up
it was like once high school high school
was my goal it was like the thing in the
distance the the light at the end of the
tunnel I thought once I can get into
high school I can meet these some older
kids be friends with some other people
not feel so confined to this one class
that I'm in also our school was
consolidated with a neighboring school
in high school for certain sports so
like football and football cheerleading
and I thought you know once I get part
of that I can just get in with some new
people and everything will be fine and
really that's the way it all turned out
I felt like it was a combination of just
making new friends and then also the
people who used to tease me just kind of
got over it you know
my sophomore year of high school that
was when Tyler moved to said neighboring
school that we were combined with four
sports so I began cheering with his
sister and the rest is history you know
Tyler and I became a couple then but it
was kind of baffling how by the time I
reached my senior year of high school I
would have never thought I'd have been
on a homecoming court or on the
sweetheart dance or whatever like that
stuff if you would have told my little
junior high self that these people would
have come around and like I don't know
actually matured and been really sweet
to me by the end of it all I would have
been surprised number eight my hometown
is about 1,200 people and it does not
have any stoplights
very small town very rural I'm from west
central Illinois kind of where Illinois
Iowa and Missouri all sort of come
together there the tri-state area if you
will very proud to be from that area
honestly I mean I think back to some
very fond memories of my childhood when
I could just you know ride a bike
anywhere mom didn't really know where I
was nobody was concerned you know me and
my neighbors you know were my cousins
and we would hang out all the time I
remember so many summers just spent
riding our bikes all over creation going
to the town pool buying packs of big
league chew and finishing the entire
thing in one sitting like it just you
know stuff that kids should be doing in
their childhood and I look at the world
today and I think
man I don't know that there's a lot of
that going on but in that time it was
like it was all good you know and nobody
was worried about anything and he could
just throw about the town for a full day
I've got to check back in with mom at
the end of the day number nine I make an
amazing egg salad I really do
I think I learned about egg salad in a
foods class that I took in high school
and I kind of realized oh my gosh I love
egg salad and you know would make it at
home and I kind of doctored it up my own
special way and I have a secret
ingredient that I put in it that makes
it just perfect and yeah there's nothing
better than my egg salad on like a
saltine cracker or better yet a club
cracker it's really really good that is
so random I know member can I get
migraine headaches
occasionally with aura as they say oh
those are the good ones those are the
ones you get where you've got the
throbbing headache but then you also
can't see like your vision gets blurred
or you're seeing kind of double your
vision is a little bit off sometimes
that will get numbness in my arm or like
often times I can literally feel the
numbness moving across my body it's a
really weird thing I won't be able to
find the right word sometimes that's the
first sign of it it's like I'm talking
and I can't come up with the word that I
want to say I know in my head exactly
what I mean to say but I can't verbalize
it I think I got my first migraine
actually when I was pretty young in
school like maybe second or third grade
you can imagine how scary it is for a
little kid to have their first migraine
headache and have no freaking clue like
why can't I see why can't I talk right
like what is happening to me but my dad
gets these - my mom and my brother don't
my sister - I think maybe a lesser
extent severity wise she can sometimes
get them but me and my dad I think get
them with very similar symptoms so yeah
I've had migraines on and off throughout
my whole childhood and up till now I
think the last migraine I had might have
been I don't know a couple months ago or
something migraines in this way are
obviously they're debilitating I mean
you just
if you can't see and you can't really
speak like it really takes you out a
commission for awhile like
you got to just lay down the only
solution is laying down in a dark room
there's also a lot of sensitivity to
light and sound so you've got to just be
in a dark quiet place and try to sleep
it off and the headache pain is just
usually very intense as well and then
any combination of those other symptoms
if I stay active too much and I'm not
immediately laying down and just trying
to zone out of it all and I will start
to feel nauseous as well there have been
a couple times where it's made me throw
up because you know not seeing correctly
the terrible pain so those kinds of
migraines are just really really tough
with a high school or college I got a
prescription that would help more
quickly take the pain away of the
migraine take away the symptoms and that
was good but when you're pregnant and
when you're nursing you know you can't
really have that as a go-to so you've
just got to like pick up on the symptoms
pretty quickly and as soon as you can
try to lay down and sleep it off number
11 my first paid job with teaching kids
gymnastics at the YMCA I would lead kids
through a little warm-up routine known
as Mouser size and it would that was
really fun I really enjoyed that I did
it like a summer job throughout part of
high school and I think maybe the first
couple summers I was in college maybe
the first three summers yeah up until I
had an internship during my last summer
of college I loved working there because
in any times when I wasn't like teaching
a class I could practice myself you know
for cheerleading so that was great
number 12
my very first live report on the news I
forgot where I was when I signed off
like I thought oh my gosh I'm live all
the news for the first time like live
report on location somewhere and it
wasn't a big story it was like a little
fluff story about some you know
Christmasy event and I went through this
whole live report and I was just getting
to the end and thinking yes you know
like like the end of the tunnel I am
home free I have done it I've done a
good job for a live shot you know you
kind of ad-libbing on-camera and that
can be a very scary thing to do that for
your first time like talking off the top
of your heads live on the news and so I
got to the end where I was supposed to
sign off and say like reporting live
wherever blah blah blah and I couldn't
remember like my location where I was
and I had to look down in my notes and
it probably took me like four or five
seconds which seems like an eternity
when there's nobody speaking on live TV
and that I figured it out I signed off
and I was just like so ticked at myself
so I don't think I ever made that
mistake again and it was just nerves
really because I could have told anybody
at any other moment where I was you know
but that's like I froze right at the end
of the live shot that leads me to number
13 I did win a silver dome Award for
Best anchor in Illinois in 2011 so I got
my act together somewhat between the
years of 2006 and 2011 but that was a
really great accomplishment I remember
submitting a like a real I guess of my
news anchor stuff interviewing reporting
and got to go to this big like dinner
for it silver dome Awards and there's
awards for various things like station
of the year and certain kinds of reports
and stuff and there's an award for best
anchor and so I thought that was a
really neat thing I keep my little award
over there on my table in my office area
so that meant a lot to me personally but
it also I thought said a lot for the
team that I was working was at that time
our Morning News team you know it was a
very tight knit really great group
number 14 I have the best mom and dad I
really do they have supported me in
everything I've tried they have never
tried to I don't know be controlling or
try to get me to do a certain thing like
they're just honestly the most giving
and generous people I was thinking back
to those days when I was dealing with
the bullying situation and I'm not sure
what I would have done if I didn't come
home and have a mom to tell me that you
know you're awesome
you're a great kid and I chose to
believe that and if I didn't I think
that's where the bullying could have
really gotten in my head and potentially
deeply affected man in some very
negative ways but I chose to believe my
mom and my dad when they told me you
know like you're great and you don't
need to to listen to that as hard as it
was to go throughout years of school
ignoring it having that strong
encouraging force in my life and it
wasn't
my parents but my whole family that
keeps you going and that keeps you
feeling positive and it helps you
I don't know remember who you are and
not let yourself be defined by the mean
things people might say to you so yeah
my mom and dad or everything and
whatever I wanted to get involved in you
know cheerleading and new stuff it's
like they they just became the biggest
fans and I will be forever grateful for
for what they have done for me number 15
I'm gonna lighten things up with I love
the face
I love buffet style eating what can I
say is there anything better than having
like a zillion options in front of you I
mean I never get my money's worth in a
buffet because I just physically can't
like take in as much food as I would
want to eat but I love having options I
don't like to just be somewhere I have
like one thing I like to have a ton of
different things like to make a salad
with about 15 things on it you know but
yeah I love a good buffet good quality
buffet number 16 as a kid I would get on
the swing in front of our house and I
would spend a lot of time out there just
swing in and I would memorize car makes
and models go down the highway and I can
tell you even to this day I'm pretty
good with cars like just from a distance
I can tell you that's the you know
Pontiac Grand Prix or whatever number 17
I am sometimes introverted sometimes not
I guess the way I would explain this is
I really I do prefer to be around people
as opposed to being alone I love people
I have a natural curiosity for people I
think that helped me in News and in
interviewing interviewing was like my
favorite thing to do I like learning
about people I like understanding what
makes them tick I love to talk I love to
get into a good deep conversation though
over small talk I think what has made me
feel maybe a little more introverted
over time here is like becoming a parent
and just like once you get done with all
the day-to-day tasks and everybody's
needs are taken care of and you've done
your work once you get to the end of
that you're like exhausted and I think I
guess I value maybe a little bit of
solitude and alone time more than I used
to
I'm not like getting through the whole
entire day
than saying what social event can I get
to right now like I'm just kind of
wanting to just like close my eyes or
like a zone out with the TV show or read
something or I don't know like I'm
valuing the quiet time a little bit more
now that I'm in this stage of life where
everything seems to be just going going
going number 18 I love Carrie Underwood
I think Carrie Underwood is the bomb
like I love her music but them from what
I know of her as a person like I
obviously haven't met her but from what
I know of her she is a very like
down-to-earth celebrity I would say but
one of the pictures she posted recently
on Instagram tells it all like she
actually just posted a picture of her
family in her living room looking very
lived in you know as it should be and I
just I love that like there's so much
perfection out there so many people
striving to just put out this perfect
image and I love when somebody is
willing to be real I think of
celebrities or people who are really
popular maybe on on YouTube or just in
the music world or wherever like I feel
like I can relate more to Carrie
Underwood than most popular youtubers
out there you know what I mean like
they're just I don't know she makes
herself just seem very real and just not
one of those shout it from the rooftops
brash personalities I think she's
incredibly talented but she seems to be
very down to earth number 19 I do love
to sing around the house in addition to
Carrie Underwood songs I love saying in
some old-school Wynonna I love some Reba
I mean I just I love to sing number 20 I
feel other people's feelings very deeply
I can be very just affected by something
that someone has told me or something I
even just watch on on television like I
internalize feelings very very much and
I can feel deeply embarrassed for
someone who has done something
embarrassing I can feel very hurt for
someone who's been hurt I do think this
is a quality that helped me in the news
because I think when I would interview
people I don't know I just I felt them
sometimes that puts a big burden on you
mentally like it's kind of a heavy
weight at the same time like I feel like
I can connect to people very very deeply
even if I'm not going through what
they're going through I feel their
feelings I don't know
how to put that number 21 there are
certain things that my sister and I see
as hilarious and it's like we see it the
exact same way and other people don't
get it but we get it you like if you
ever had those people in your life work
you know like she'll send me a funny
picture and I know I am finding that
just as hilarious as she is but maybe
you know I'd show it to Tyler she'd show
it to Jeff and they would see it quite
on that let them look like we are crying
laughing over it like we just we share a
real similarity there in the things that
we could just cry laughing over so I
love that I think we will always have
that that connection where and she will
always say like you get this insane look
on your face and I do and I see that in
belt
when she starts laughing sometimes like
a little it's like oh my gosh you just
see something so funny I hope you all
have a person out there who is sharing
in the ridiculousness with you and never
judges you for your ridiculousness
number 22 I live for spontaneous food
runs I realized this recently like I
just some of my best memories are from
just spontaneously going out and getting
some meat and maybe this comes from
being like a kind of a country kid who
didn't have like any fast food
restaurants and downs so when you decide
to leave down and go get you a pizza
somewhere like on the spur of the moment
it was a big deal I'll never forget a
Christmas Eve it was definitely after
like dinner time hours and my sister and
I I think this must have been after dish
or no pizzas were kind of a new thing
and so we were one thing some of that we
had had one I guess at some point and
really liked it but stores and town were
clothes we're going to have to go like a
half hour to get to a you know open
supermarket and it was Christmas Eve and
we picked up and went and it was just so
freaking fun because it was really
spontaneous and I remember so much of
this happening in college too like
piling way too many people into a car
late at night going to Steak and Shake
or we didn't have like a Taco Bell I
know no Taco Bell in our college town
now they have one but they did when I
was going to school there and you know
just take a bunch of people go over
there and just your ridiculousness
always even today like you know let's
all go get some ice cream yeah let's
just do it like jump in the car do it I
love spontaneity really I think I value
that more than even having a well laid
out plan while I am a planner in a lot
of respect I would say like for my
professional life I love to have things
kind of planned out and put together and
well thought through when it comes to
fun stuff like if you can just slap
something on me like I'm probably going
to be down for it number 23 I love board
games and I am pretty competitive
Scrabble and monopoly would be a couple
of my favorites or treble you know the
pop o matic bubbles yes I didn't get big
into that I love engaging people in a
board game normally I'm the person who
has to say hey you know family when you
come play this game with me but then
everybody's having a great time and it
gets very competitive and I love that
number 24 I have really really talented
siblings you know my sister you while
you may know that she is an incredible
watercolor artist I mean as I sit here
in this room I got a picture here I got
a picture back here a wonderful artwork
from her all over my home she is off the
charts good at what she does
Kelly Eddington comm check her out she
is the definition of a person who it has
been gifted you know she's put a ton of
hard work into it but she has a gift you
know with her hands and her eyes she
just did such realistic detailed work
with watercolor and she does just
amazing work and my brother I have
brother and sister both and there's a
big gap between us like mom had them and
then time pass a lot of time faster in
like junior high in high school and then
high I came along but their names are
Kelly and Ryan and so I love that now
Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest are
together and it's live with Kelly and
Ryan and so every time I hear that I
think of my brother and sister but my
brother is an engineer he has traveled
the world doing things that he's done in
terms of pin design and now he's gotten
into a little bit different line of work
but just the technical knowledge that he
has is just would blow your mind and
they're just the best people to my
sister and brother my mom and dad like I
have been when I came about like in this
family like I had all these great
examples of great people around me and
my mom says we're all special my mom
says we all have our special talents
so I'll listen to that but my brother
and sister are really exceptional number
25 I love being read to as a kid and I
love reading to my own kids now I mean
there was just a lot of book reading
going I'm sure Pupkin vouchers it's like
she read to be a lot and I do it a lot
for Bell and she wants it a lot to like
books are probably her main main thing
so even if we're not reading straight
through one like she loves to kind of
look through and just kind of narrate
something a little bit with their own
words which i think is fun too number 26
if there's any kind of food sold at a
bar carnival or ball park
that is my jam if you can fry it yes
I'm probably going to like it cotton
candy ice cream
nachos hot dogs corn dogs preferably
mozzarella sticks that bar type food
like I love that get that obviously I
can't eat it all the time because I'm
only five feet tall I would turn into an
absolute ball if I just ate that status
constantly but that is what I love
number 27
eyebrows kind of run in the family if
you look at my dad now or back when he
was younger you can see the brow I have
his very same brow shape and my sister
got some brows and my brother got some
brow we are eyebrow people I was trying
to come up with another thing for my
list Tyler reminded me of this one last
night with
when we were in high school and we were
getting chased by someone in a car we
had gone out he lived about half an hour
away and so we kind of meet in the
middle at this area called the junction
and then we would go off and like you
know get something to eat or shop or
something and so we met in the middle
and we're heading back to that area and
we began getting followed by someone
following us very closely and like when
we would speed up they were like on our
tail and it wasn't like a cop car it
wasn't somebody you know with any
purpose trying to like lawfully get us
to pull over something it was just if
it's a person and they're in a truck I
think and for the longest time like we
were going at a very unsafe ly high rate
of speed
like not sure what to do when we stopped
was this person going to come after us
what was happening here and we ended up
like going out on some really country
roads and there was a jog in the road or
something and I remember Tyler kind of
like we jumped this ditch sort of area
into a field the airbag is deployed and
we were fine but this guy basically ran
us off the road you know it was so
dangerously fast so then we did get out
of the car and I think he immediately
called his dad because that would have
been the closest person to us who could
come to us you know probably called the
cops as well I'm guessing I don't know
but we just took off running through
this field because we were a certain
distance away from the main road and we
knew there was a house up there and so
we're like running in the night through
a field hoping this guy didn't come back
around to us because he scared the crap
out of us and before long and Tyler's
dad was there and I remember they took
me home and it was just a scary scary
freaking weird night number 29 I do love
pranking people specifically Tyler not
like the super intricate pranks that you
would watch somebody make it YouTube
video how you know but just like
bouncing out from the side of a wall or
something like it's something to get him
because he's hard to get he keeps a
really good like you know safe the best
stuff so he's hard to genuinely scare
but so
sometimes I make it my personal duty to
try to scare him prank it was in some
way and number 30 last but very much not
the least and Tyler is likely balance
that I need in this world he his
personality and mine and I know they say
like you shouldn't you shouldn't look
for love like for someone to complete
you you should try to be your own
complete person but I do feel like our
personalities the way we see things way
think about things like we are very
similar in a lot of ways but also he
completes me in so many ways he you know
rounds off my edges in so many ways I
don't know why I put it that way when
I'm nervous about something when I'm
upset about something he's like this big
hug this big protective hug I don't know
how to put it on but he is the best he
came from North Dakota his family moved
from North Dakota when I was in high
school like how did I end up with this
person but I was lucky enough to you
know have this person in my life and he
is just amazing and I you might see
snippets of him I don't know on my
snapchat or in videos here and there and
you're getting a taste of what he's like
but he is a true class act gentleman
wonderful person just as good as it gets
so anyway that's it that's my 30
my 30 things I would love to see other
people do this on YouTube I feel like
there's probably a tag like this back in
the day but it's just been a while since
I've seen people do this and sometimes
the Q&amp;amp;A videos you know I've done those
I built this more recently probably and
they bring about I think a lot of
similar questions but if you can come up
with a random list of things that you
don't maybe think people know about you
I think that's the really the really
juicy interesting stuff so thank you for
watching guys and I will see you again
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
