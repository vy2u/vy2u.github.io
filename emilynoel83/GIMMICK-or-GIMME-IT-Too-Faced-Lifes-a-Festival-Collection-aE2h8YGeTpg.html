this video we've got a lot of
interesting things happening we've got
this new two-faced collection life's a
festival there's an eye palette there
are some different face products we've
got highlighters a very unusual setting
spray some interesting sort of
iridescent lip products here everything
is extremely whimsical it's very like
two-faced the sort of vibe you expect
from them
but at the same time I was a little
surprised that they did this because I
felt like things like rainbow
highlighters and some of these different
ideas I thought they practically been a
little bit played out in the makeup
world so far but with this collection
they are hitting it hard when this PR
package came and the products were like
most of them were enclosed in a pinata
you know like a unicorn pinata these are
the kinds of PR moves that will make
your three-year-old and one-year-old go
nuts when you open them up but what I
thought I would do here I'm starting
with just foundation concealer powder
and brows on and I thought we could just
play and kind of chitchat as we go about
these different new two-faced things so
let's just jump in we've got this
unicorn tears this is called the
iridescent mystical bronzer so pop this
compact open and you have an actual
unicorn and then sort of a shimmering
looking bronzer around the outside both
elements if you kind of want to treat
them separately are very very shimmery
if you were to kind of blend over all of
it you get sort of this muddy kind of
beige almost taupe looking shade it does
smell good I instantly think of the
chocolate Soleil bronzers when I smell
this but it might just be a general
sweet scent that I'm getting off of this
but I'm gonna dab my brush into what
mainly looks like bronzer here and I'm
just gonna add some of this to the
perimeter of my face here I was playing
with this yesterday and I was thinking
the bronzer almost gives me a little bit
of a vibe of Too Faced Sun bunny you
know a bronzer with some Sheen there's
just gonna be so much shimmer and glow
happening just using all these things
today so if you aren't particularly a
fan of shimmer watch out you may just be
watching this for your own entertainment
and K I'm thinking
that down the neck is well gonna
continue picking up some bronzer hitting
the cheekbone area just lightly here
it's not like a drastic super dart
bronzer and then maybe we hit the
unicorn just right here at the end and
we dust some of that part on the top of
the cheek because I don't know to me it
of course looks really cute you're gonna
hear me say that about a lot of the
products in this line but I don't think
it's super practical I feel like when
I'm reaching for a bronzer I generally
just want the bronzer and I would be
constantly like avoiding the unicorn
anise now I'm gonna go ahead and apply
real quick a little bit of my own blush
because there's not really a blush in
this line so I'm gonna grab my covergirl
soft sable just get a little bit of that
going on here
next up we've got a major highlighting
situation here we've got our little
highlighter compact here this is called
rainbow strobe rainbow effect
highlighter and it's one of those things
that I thought was really like popping
and a super trendy hot item
I don't know months ago but Too Faced is
putting their spin on it so what we have
here it looks very metallic and shimmery
kind of rainbow striped highlighters
you've got tones of purple blue golden
colors that kind of take up the bulk of
the compact and also kind of a rose gold
up top to feel it it feels pretty
powdery and this explains my experience
applying it yesterday I thought it was
kind of flaky sort of hard to manage
they also have this brush which is a
gorgeous brush just to look at I like
the rainbow in the hairs I like this
sort of pearly periwinkle thing going on
the handle but there's a special
instruction here on the back first off
they're gonna tell you to pull out their
setting spray this is called festival
refresh mystical effects setting and
refreshing spray so you look at it here
and it's looking almost like clear
liquid maybe if you look down toward the
bottom we've got all kinds of stuff
settled down there sort of an iridescent
purpley looking I guess some sort of a
powder maybe within it you're gonna need
to shake it up and then can you see
what's happening in there the liquids
are swirling you're getting this sort of
colored spray or tinted spray the
instruction on the brush is that you're
gonna spray this on first allow to dry
and then load your rainbow brush by
following the arc of the rainbow strobe
highlighter like it's gonna match up
shade for shade so you're gonna do that
and then apply it to the tops of
cheekbones pink on top purple on the
bottom near the hollow of the cheek
yesterday when I was playing with this I
use the spray less so we'll see how this
goes I'm just gonna do some miss here
miss out great it feels like a really
fine mist but look what's happening do
you see what's in my hair and on my face
like initially right after this goes on
before it's really had a chance to dry
you think okay just kind of a typical
setting spray right with the exception
of the very visible droplets in my hair
as it dries and I don't know if the
camera will reflect this at all you can
see like these little flecks like little
dots of blue toned shimmer all over your
face and I have proof of this on my
chair I sit in a black chair here and
you can see still from yesterday all
these little like bluish droplets what
does it smell like I'm gonna have to
spray one more time to reflect on that
scent it's also a little a little
grapefruity in there maybe actually it
smells like sweet tarts that's what I'm
getting personally for me I just I don't
really like the idea of a setting spray
depositing actual sparkle on my skin as
it dries I can just see like a fine
glitter sort of all over but I'm going
to do is the instructions say and I'm
gonna take this brush which I used
yesterday I found it to be a very dense
brush for any sort of highlighting I
mean I know this is a different kind of
compact a different method here but
you're gonna sweep it across the rainbow
and then you're going to use the pinky
part toward the top
can you guys see what this is doing here
like yes as I move my head a little bit
you can see that there's highlighter on
there but it really just looks like
flaky dusty highlight just sitting on
top of the skin like it's just it's just
hanging out there it waiting to be maybe
buffed in a little bit like I'm dying to
buff that in but I'm going to do the
other side too and then we'll work with
things
you'd never really know that was a
rainbow necessarily although maybe it's
intended to be applied a lot heavier
what I'm going to do is take my normal
highlighting brush and I'm gonna try
sort of buff this and it's really funny
I can see like this little cloud in my
peripheral vision of the powder eNOS
kind of kicking up practically off my
face as I try to blend this in I'm not a
fan guys this is a cute brush it's a
very like novelty sort of thing but I
would never really apply highlight with
a brush this big and dense so it's
definitely a Miss for me on these
products and I'm also not into the spray
but the highlighting options are not
finished yet here for this Too Faced
collection we have a unicorn tears and a
unicorn dreams stick highlighter the
packaging is adorable you see on the
each cap they're metallic and color
overall and then there's a glittery
unicorn on there and that says unicorn
tears or unicorn dreams the stick itself
I absolutely love what they've done
there to make it look practically like a
unicorn horn so as you look at the
swatches here the unicorn dreams comes
off with a very golden vibe and then
unicorn tears if you're familiar with
that initial lipstick they put out years
ago called unicorn tears it has this
sort of blueish iridescent quality to it
I'm gonna try the unicorn tears
highlight first I'm just gonna swipe a
little bit of this on the stick feels a
little bit dry it does smells like
vanilla but don't take too much time
getting distracted by the scent because
it it just seems to set practically on
contact and it's a little stiff to blend
I feel like like the color is actually
pretty the level of shimmer just like
the look of it on the skin I don't
dislike but just kind of be ready for it
to be a little bit stiff and I really
don't like to have to work to blend a
cream product out on the skin I hate the
thought that I'm messing up what's
underneath you know I feel like I've
blended it out to the best of my ability
maybe if I take like a Beauty Blender
sponge over it a little bit it just
really wants to lock in there I'm gonna
try a little bit of the unicorn dreams
maybe a little on the Apple just to
double-check and see if the formula is
the same because I haven't tried this
one on until now this one I was playing
with yesterday so I'm gonna dab a little
bit of this golden e color right here
apple of the cheek I think it's the same
texture actually I just applied a little
bit more of that one and it was able to
move a bit more for a second but it's
definitely also setting in there I don't
think these products could be cuter but
realistically it's not the easiest
highlighter to use they're better cream
and liquid highlights out there for sure
despite using a setting spray the
setting spray midway through I feel like
a very odd thing is happening on the
texture of my skin like even though I've
got a lot of shimmer and glow and maybe
from a distance that's what you're able
to pick up on when I look at myself
really closely I feel like I look rather
dry and kind of powdery and I used an
amazing foundation that I love that
doesn't even tend to look that way on me
and it's the NARS radiant long wear so I
think I'm gonna pull in a different
setting spray that always tends to make
me look a bit more hydrated and dewy and
it's the Mario Badescu with a low
cucumber and green tea I was really
surprised that the festival refresh
spray didn't have more of that tendency
to it you know even though it contained
the glitter I was surprised it overall
like in terms of the texture of my skin
didn't make me look more dewy but you
know what we're gonna move on we're
gonna try this palette it's kind of like
puffy a little bit feeling it looks like
a rainbow and it's the life's of
festival peace love and unicorns palette
it does have a little mirror there
so a lot of warmth and coolness in this
palette just at a glance shades that
appear to be matte would be young and
free right here this pink and also
desert vibes and that's kind of where
that story is everything else has some
element of shimmer and I did a look with
this yesterday and I must say I
absolutely loved it
that being said I don't know that this
particular palette it was like it kind
of exposed me to maybe pairing some
different colors together but I don't
know that it necessarily takes this
palette and this palette alone to pull
it off but I'm going to begin where I
think everybody and their brother is
going to begin with this palette and use
desert vibes first this is your matte
kind of warm brown soft warm brown and I
did prime my lids by the way I'm gonna
get that going here in my crease a
really nice crease color no complaints
about pigmentation
by the way the PR materials came with
this little booklet and that's raelynne
they're on the unicorn she's a country
singer I do really like some of her
songs by the way I like her voice then I
think I'm gonna work in some rainbow
life this is like a kind of a unique
looking shade here it's sort of a mix of
rust and pink and it does have shimmer
but something I did notice yesterday was
like different shimmery shades that I
would work into my crease they still
totally worked you know you don't have
to go for something completely matte if
you think oh I need to have something in
my crease it has to be a matte that's
not always the case then I'm gonna take
beam-in
right here and this one has kind of like
a golden sheen to it I mean it looks
just sort of creamy here in the palette
or even white but once you apply that to
the skin see how much golden shimmer it
has really shimmery but yeah we're going
there this is a rainbow palette then on
the lid I'm gonna grab some young and
free this pink kind of a matte pink I'm
gonna put this right on this part of the
lid see how pigmented and nicely that
transfers on I'm leaving a little space
around my tear duct because what I want
to put there is mystic rein this color
while it looks kind of purply it's
actually like it shows up almost like a
blueish shimmer
I feel like this palette is gonna be
straight-up some people's alley and if
you like a lot of color and shimmer I
feel like the quality of the colors are
actually pretty darn easy to work with
and nice it may not be the one and done
palette for everyone though even if you
do enjoy these shades you wouldn't
necessarily come away thinking like I
have absolutely everything I need
because like you've got all this
brightness and all of this shimmer and
yet you don't have like a Blanco or a
dark brown or maybe even like a dark
plum or just some really deep dark matte
shadow that can anchor the look I'm
gonna use fantasy over here love that
word purple it's got a little bit of
shimmer in it and I'm gonna start
dabbing this sort of on the outer corner
overlapping some of the pink this purple
is great though I love it yesterday I
did a look with like this purple all
over the
lid I thought it was awesome today you
know just kind of setting it up with a
warm crease but still working in some
purple on the lid looking my brush a
little bit just to get some of that even
further into the crease they might even
take a hint more of that desert vibes
and sort of work that around as more of
a transition shades kind of reinforcing
that
like look at this look at this kind of
sunset II really pretty look ah did you
see what I mean guys like where's this
palette might inspire me to do some
different things in terms of shade
pairings I don't necessarily have to
have this palette to pull it off like
you could find a lot of colors sort of
like this I mean while there are some
very unique pops like mystic rain that's
a very different kind of shade like it's
got this bluish Sheen yet sometimes
looks pinky purple there are clearly
some unique things happening here but if
you didn't want to take the plunge and
buy a whole like new high-end palette
depending on what's in your collection
you could pull off this sort of a look
but I actually love the fate of that
warm brown into the gold that golden
e-beam in shade that we got here up on
the lid like that looks so pretty and
that's not something that's not a look I
often have I'm gonna go very bright in
my lower inner rim I'm going to use my
wet and wild ultimate brow highlight
and then we're gonna get to work on the
lower lash line with some more color I
have not played with the fireflies
yet so I think I'm gonna dig in here
this really pretty kind of spring green
so this is a nice look you know to take
to the office you know a little job
interview glam a little meeting your
future mother-in-law glam well honestly
it depends on the job and it depends on
the mother-in-law doesn't it it really
looks like a beautiful kind of pistachio
green that I've got going on here it's
not an unwearable green shade and like
worn alone you could do a fairly like
saved warmish neutral look here and then
just choose your pop like you wouldn't
need to be combining all this but I just
really wanted to see what that shade was
made of if I wanted to see if it would
pop without like having a certain kind
of liner or face shadow underneath and
there's this massive shade in the
palette which I probably should have
shown it's called unicorn tears and it's
like the official I guess unicorn tears
shadow it's very pigmented it's a really
beautiful like it has a softest lilac
sheen to it and you know what I'm kind
of tempted to do I want to work this in
as a highlight on my cheek and just see
if it works in that way since I didn't
really yeah I was about to say I didn't
really find a highlight I was in love
with from this line yet but there's no
reason why you can't do that it's kind
of like Becca's prismatic amethyst but a
little more like glittery a little more
obvious I think that's the best
highlighter this whole collection has
going is the one that's kind of being
dubbed as an eye shadow I'm gonna go
ahead and just do some mascara real
quick and they'll come back and we're
gonna play with some lip products okay
guys so there's the completed eye look I
really just wanted to keep it kind of
focused on the eye shadow so all I did
again was curled my lashes and applied
some mascara and I did do that light
liner in the lower inner rim and now
we're gonna move on and talk about some
of these lip products so check this out
this is a whole selection of kind of
what I would call accent lip colors I
don't know that there are any of these
that I would pick to wear necessarily
full-on all over my lips but what you
have here are I think
a couple of different finishes to work
with in these different shade families
so I've got all the things that are in
lipstick form they look like they're la
creme lipsticks like this everything in
a lipstick form is swatched below and
then everything that comes in a gloss
type look is swatched above so right
here we have angel tears there's the
lipstick and the lip gloss
this is faerie tears lipstick and gloss
then we have unicorn tears with that
bluish tone and then mermaid tears here
with the lipstick and the gloss angel
tears has a really soft like kind of
rose gold feel to it and the loss is
very pearly faerie tears while the
lipstick version is very pink the gloss
is a little more gold and really than
anything that's happening over here with
the angel tears and the unicorn tears
the bluish tone is coming through there
and then the mermaid tears that lipstick
shade kind of gets deep it's a little
bit bluish there's a little bit of rose
in that shade and then the gloss is
super green looking I feel like the
swatches on my hand like really give you
a sense of what these would look like on
the lips just as is the thing that I
think I can best offer you here is what
these might look like paired in with
another product like how i realistically
might actually wear these so i'm gonna
take a little yo s lip balm here prep my
lips and i'm going to put on a very
neutral lip liner this is mats it from
the l'oreal color riche matte line so
i'm gonna go ahead and fill in with that
now i was playing with this a little bit
yesterday and i thought this would just
be the funnest way to show off some of
these shades because I really did like
how a couple of them looked at this
method so what I've done here with the
lip liner is I've gone I filled in the
whole top lip and then most of the
bottom lip but I left this whole gap
here in the center then my favorite one
of all this would be the angel tears and
the thing about the lipsticks like
they're a little more metallic looking
they're not as shiny at all so if you're
wanting a real shine finish on the lips
you want to look more toward the glosses
or the transforming lip toppers as
they're technically called but the
lipsticks while they have a lot of
shimmer and sort of a metallic nature to
them they just don't have a lot of shine
but you do have a lot of control with
them so if you want that metallic look
in just a very pinpointed part of your
lips
whereas gloss can travel a little bit
more like bottom lip to top lip these
lipstick versions kind of keep it a
little more centered or targeted so like
see what that angel tears looks like you
know just kind of Pat it into an already
matte lip and then take your angel tears
which is your most just sort of
pearlescent looking gloss out of this
lineup take some of that over top like I
love this shade as a lip topper idea
here I concentrated in there and
everywhere else I just kind of gently
blend it out with my finger blend it a
little bit into your upper lip I think
that's gorgeous I think I would find so
many uses for these too because this can
look very pronounced you know and
shimmery but I like having that option
of an accent shade in a lipstick form
and then I also really appreciate the
look of this gloss it gives such a bold
effect right I'm gonna do a similar
thing here I'm gonna use touch of spice
matte lipstick from Maybelline this has
a little more warmth than that lip liner
I just put on this lipstick of - so
loved and worn down um but I'm gonna
play now with the fairy tears so that's
our next one in the line up we're going
to take a little bit of this lipstick
which comes off surprisingly pink for it
look how buttery it looks in the stick
look at that pink tone okay just gonna
dab that here it seems like if your lip
color has any amount of pink you put
this on top and it almost looks hot pink
or something once you add this to the
top and then let's try a little bit of
that gloss which again looks very golden
the fairy tears gloss sorry to keep them
all straight Angel's fairies mermaids
well I'll be that is a mmm that's
actually a republic gorgeous look as
well it's fun to take these sort of
neutral basic lip colors and really
change them up with these shades
I'm still thinking I would probably get
the most use out of the angel tears but
that fairy tears it's a very pink
transforming color next I'm going to do
lust for blush this is another
Maybelline matte shade
so I forgot to leave myself a little gap
there in the center and then I think it
would be fun to layer in the unicorn
tears which looks a little bit like
bluish purple II and try some of this in
with this lipstick and this again was
the thing that was around before all of
this collection like this came out kind
of alongside some of their la creme
lipsticks I believe
instant kind of bluish tone like the
blue really shows in it for sure
kind of dab it in realistically I'm
probably not going to be mixing in a lot
of blue tones shimmer into my lip looks
but let's see what the gloss does mm the
gloss adds a little more look of purple
while it looks so much more in person
anyway blue than this then the unicorn
tears lipstick it's actually bringing
much more of a violet thing to this look
maybe because I'm overlapping with pink
I know there are like a zillion
different color combos you could do with
this type of trying to give some ideas
and give you guys a sense of how these
would work not just put on full-on all
over the lips because this look let's
face it I'm not gonna wear them that way
and then finally what to do with the
mermaid tears I wanted to see what those
kinds of colors would look like sort of
paired in with a darker lipstick so I've
got this Rimmel Kate Moss number 30 here
it's a real plummy berry color I feel
like what the depth of this lipstick is
just not gonna play that well with a
lighter shade so it's God have a certain
amount of darkness I did not apply that
very well okay let's try lipstick first
this looks really interesting mmm
tons of purple in that yeah and I guess
I probably should have expected that
that's the way it looked on my hand lend
it out a little bit I don't hate it
and then the gloss I'm fearing I'm
scared this looks really green oh my
gosh
Wow it's making that lip look look very
blue and when you look really close at
it I guess you can see there's some blue
toned like shimmer there's some blue
iridescent in that green while it looks
like straight-up seafoam green there
it's pulling a lot of blue on the lips
gosh this was fun guys you want to just
sit here all day with me and layer these
up on top of different lipsticks for me
I think one that still gives a very
profound look but as the most versatile
and most wearable would be the angel
tears both the lip topper and the
lipstick and I kind of want to see what
those look like with touch of spice
which as I said is a little warmer than
the lip liner I originally put on with
them I love what that lipstick does it's
so interesting to have a lipstick like
this and I am kind of wiping it back off
to clean it off so it's not to
compromise there to have a lipstick that
can act as the accent instead of just
being a gloss because so many glosses
will do this I'm going to add a little
extra look what the the gloss takes it
over the top though
taking my hair out of my clip now to
make this all official but absolutely
100% my favorite part of this is angel
tears the lipstick the lip gloss I think
I will find a thousand different ways to
wear these you know one or the other
it's not that you have to like anytime
you put the lipstick on you have to top
it with the gloss but like the lipstick
gives a totally different feel it will
alter so many lipsticks and give a fun
effect and then I think the gloss is
just next-level pearly beautiful bright
the others I think have some beauty in
their own way my next favorite might be
the fairy tears the others I don't
really see myself reaching for that much
the biggest like blatant misses for me
in this line would be the brush and the
rainbow highlighter I just that's just
not my channe the bronzer also I would
totally skip and the festival refresh
spray again it gave me like this sort of
blueish toned Sparkle all over my skin
but it didn't give me the due eNOS like
the the change in texture to my skin
that I often look for in a setting spray
and it did leave little like weird
droplets all over my black chair these
stick highlighters I wanted to love
these for just how cute they are
but honestly they're not a super easy
thing to blend across the skin and the
palette
I thought surprised me and I liked it a
lot better than I thought like I think I
can do some beautiful looks with this I
love the amount of warmth that they
included here then some other fun things
to pair in I think if you don't want to
fully commit to this palette you might
just draw some inspiration from like
some of the shade pairings you could
come out with and try to create your own
with other things that you have on hand
and bonus here the best highlight that's
kind of like a eyeshadow here in this
palette this unicorn tears that applied
better as a highlight on my skin than
any of the other actual highlighters so
guys that's my take on this whole new
Too Faced collection so much to talk
about but I hope this may be made sense
of some things we know what you're
