some beautiful lip products such a
fabulous line here you guys I mentioned
this as one of my five new drugstore
products worth trying and I'm talking
about the l'oreal colour riche shine
formula this is what was sent in a PR
package and yes beautifully done
beautifully done l'oreal the individual
packaging on these i think is gorgeous
these are kind of like belted and gold
and then have this plastic yet somewhat
crystallized looking tube here you twist
them up and I really like how the outer
tube hugs the entire stick because
sometimes with softer lipsticks like
this like these are very creamy very
rich give off a ton of shine on the lips
they're like lip gloss in a tube
basically and the softer stuff like that
you know how with some lipsticks you
apply a little bit of pressure and then
the stick starts to move and kind of
lean up against the outer twister well
here your twister for lack of better
terminology is already hugging that
stick so it's like supporting it and
keeping it in place so that's a really
good thing something that I think is
kind of pro and con depending on the
shade is the fact that these aren't
formed into exact like typical lipstick
bullets that kind of come to a point or
even a slightly more precise tip at the
end they're just kind of rounded and cut
at that slanted angle but guys you are
catching me in a phase of my makeup
using life now where I am really getting
back into glosses I love that finish on
the lips I'm just starting to appreciate
more like how much that shine does not
just for my lips and the smoothness and
fullness that they can appear to have
but just my entire face like I feel like
a shiny lip color just brings everything
to life somehow oh by the way it's a
very dark and stormy morning out there
you might hear some thunder in the
background I don't know why but it
always feels right to like be up here
and doing my makeup or working on a
video and it's stormy outside I just
love that feeling but what I alluded to
in the video where I did recommend a few
of these shades was the fact that I
don't feel equally good about everything
in the line there are Sun that I would
skip over and as you hear my
descriptions you'll see why and maybe
you'll agree with my reasoning or may
you want you'll want to try them anyway
but overall here we've got 16 shades in
the line altogether and there are half
that I feel a strong YES on and what was
really interesting to me was when I got
this package and I started trying
everything on and sort of deciding like
how I would lay them out and sort of
categorize them and sort them to display
them to you they were actually already
sitting in the appropriate spot you know
and that's normally something that I go
through if I get sent a big massive
amount of lip products the first thing
that I try to do with them is categorize
it's like okay where are my nudes
wearing my Pink's where my bright shades
my dark shades and here everything was
really perfectly put together so I'm
gonna go row by row and try these on for
you in our bottom four here I'd call
these the Naturals they're very neutral
could possibly naturally occur from the
lips very soft neutral shades the next
door I'm going to call those my lights
just light soft colors you might even
call them pastels and then we've got
brights in this next row everything
there has a little more punch and then
deep rich shades I would say is the last
section got my notes I took notes on
everything a couple of things to know
about everything in general buildable
buildable buildable when you go over
your lips with one pass you're gonna get
a sheer color if you do two passes in my
opinion it's like perfect it doesn't
create too much goop or too much weight
on the lips with that method but it just
amps up the color of every single shade
here a little bit more there's maybe one
exception to that where the first pass
is just everything you needed more all
in all a really nice formula very
comfortable I compare these a little bit
too like Revlon lip butters I really
love the texture of those going on the
lips that really great not too thick not
too thin feeling very very moisturizing
I would say these as a whole are shinier
though like just a brilliant shine
staying power not gonna be amazing with
this texture of product you might even
find some literal lip glosses that last
a little better simply because they're
thicker and a little more tacky perhaps
these are very soft and smooth and
creamy and
there's enough thickness to make me feel
hydrated and not super concerned about
them sliding outside my lip line but
still these just aren't a long wearing
lip products so they are gonna wear down
after you eat you are gonna definitely
want to reapply if you've gone through
good Chuck your day now with some bold
shades I could even blot off a little
color probably from this which was from
the brights row I could blot off a
little color and I still have some
intensity left your lighter nudes just
because they're a softer color they're
gonna appear to be the weakest in terms
of staying power but something I do like
about everything here it feels like
you're treating your lips because even
as color fades and the product itself
just kind of wears away I feel like I've
given my lips some good hydration
through this I think that's enough about
the formula now let's jump into the
Tryon so Row 1 as I said are natural
colors so the first one here is dazzling
doe doe a deer a female deer this shade
would be the cool nude of the bunch I'm
really impressed with the fullness of
color that this does have like I said a
couple of passes sometimes in the Tryon
it may not look like I've made two
distinct passes but like just kind of
going over the same area twice if you
tend to like nudes that aren't so peachy
and so warm and this might be something
you want to check out and while I really
do like that shade I would say the nude
I like best from this collection is the
next one and this is glossy fawn this
has a little more golden peach in it I
love the shade I really like it with my
skin tone and just the concept and the
packaging design really works for colors
like this that are natural you don't
really have to think too much about
throwing them on I would feel confident
enough to put that on without a mirror
it's all kind of working for these more
natural shades then we have varnished
rosewood this was another one I gave a
shout-out to in my 5 new drugstore
products video it's my lips but better
it's that Mavi little bit of rosiness
but it just like perfect the look of my
lips it's like the lips I'd like to have
all the time just walk it around live
this will be the color I'd like to just
be built with you know and again there's
ease with this the aesthetic of this
whole line that rounded kind of like oh
I'm just throwing on a lip balm type
design works with these more
low-maintenance colors the next one in
that same row which I also love is
burnished blush
and this is perfect spring pink here
like if you haven't even been a big pink
lip color wearer
this is the shade to dip your toe into
that world with because it's not too
light not too bright it's just like the
perfect spring rose and in this formula
with this level of shine it's just an A+
from me I love it so that first row like
the sector of these products that I feel
probably the strongest about those
natural super wearable shades that in
this format are so easy to apply but
next we're gonna move on to Row 2 and
the way I feel about these is that
they're kind of Milky shades and the
milkiness of them the pastel nature of
them can kind of lend itself to a little
bit of a streaky application on the lips
I tried to do my best to make my
application as even as possible so you
can get the best sense of the color but
just in casual throwing it on not paying
too much attention I don't love the look
of these as well as like for example the
first four that I showed so here we go
with sparkling Rose probably the least
worst offender of these the best of what
I'm talking about from this row it's not
too light to work but I do have to watch
that shade and if I'm being really
selective about pinks I like that
burnished Rose even better next up
shining peach very milky very pastel I
think you got to be very careful with
this color or else it will look awfully
streaky on the lips that's just my take
on it just calling it like I see it and
then we've got this super light pink
called dewy petal thought I was gonna
love this just at a glance at the tube
but no I'm running that same kind of
streak risk that I've spoken about so
not really feeling it sugarplum where
did that quote come from Luke Bryan on
American Idol glazed pink another one of
these creamy really light pink shades a
little more intensity than the last pink
I don't hate it guys I'm just being kind
of picky here because not everybody's
gonna buy every single shade here and
again my top pink from what I've tried
is definitely that one from that first
row these as you can see softer cooler
Pink's all around now we're getting into
some brights and there are a couple of
these mid tone but yet kind of bright
shades that I really really freaking
love the first one in the row
luminous coral yes spring in a tube
absolutely give it to me baby I love the
way this comes off there's why this is
working it's not too light it's not
trying to be too pastel it's also not
too dark it's kind of right in the
middle in terms of a color spectrum and
it's just perfect for this formula also
I'm not too worried about precision with
that either honestly it's just kind of a
sweet spot with this line and I love
that for spring and then the shade I
have been wearing throughout the video
is 9:18 polished Tango and it's right on
par with that coral one in terms of
being not too light not too dark it's
just that one's more orange this one's
more pink
it's just dazzling and then on top of it
all it feels amazing on the lips but if
you look at those to see what I mean how
they're not so milky like some of these
are they're just the exact proper
intensity level for this line the next
couple of shades in the brights category
I would say are verging on a little hard
to control I would have really
appreciated a formed tip because these
shades are so bright we've got lacquered
strawberry and it kind of breaks my
heart because this is a gorgeous shade
but it's sort of hard to just toss it on
you know I mean there's a casualness to
these products with the way they've been
designed in the tubes and you give me a
shade that bright it's kind of hard to
apply truly is a gorgeous color though
and then the next one is laminated
fuchsia and this has even more
brightness more richness than the last
shade I think they're pretty colors but
just be careful as you apply those if
you are really drawn to those shades
just watch yourself a little bit my last
row would be the deep sand these are
shades where you've heard me say before
like sometimes with bright really rich
colors all want to sometimes reach for
that in a matte formula because I just
know it's gonna stay in place and I'm
not worried about that very pronounced
color seeping outside the lips or making
a mess or whatever and then you run into
situations where the color is just so
gosh-darn gorgeous it's undeniable like
you can't turn your back on this color
it is that exact situation my friends
with the shade enamel red this is the
color in the
we're one-pass absolutely does it and it
is such a beautiful red and the
juiciness that it does have on the lips
like I love that I really do love that
look I'm willing to be careful I'm
willing to check this in the mirror
periodically like it's just it is that
undeniable to where you kind of overlook
some of your principles and your goals
for lip products and you just say nope
that's pretty I've got to wear that
lassi garnet is pretty if I had to
choose I'm still loving enamel red the
most I think the thing about glassy
garnet is that I just have a ton of
colors like this in my life I Hamlet
hooted with berries so I don't
necessarily need more and more and I'm
gonna be kind of selective about it next
up this shade is so unique and so
beautiful its gleaming plum and this has
just that bit of purple that makes it
fun and just makes it different and a
little unexpected but not so unexpected
that you're scared to wear it around but
it's like another one of those
situations where yes it's bright yes
it's kind of bold but I'm willing to be
careful with it I'm willing to run the
risk that comes along with it because I
just love the color so darn much feel
like this is like the color of my soul
like I love that shade so deeply and the
last shade is so so dark guys it's
splendid blackberry and this is so dark
that it's streaky honestly I've got to
spend too much time messing with it
don't want to overdo it with these like
a couple of passes and then hands off
kind of because you will start to
develop a streakiness here I feel like I
spent so much time trying to get even
color I'm becoming my own worst enemy
because I'm just layering on more and
getting streaky because of texture but
here's a look at the entire swatch
family here so again our natural shades
this is really like a great place for
this line because they're easy to apply
no fuss they look beautiful they even
out the lips they're not sheer and
streaky
in the next row these light colors the
lightness of them can make them a little
bit streaky to apply the brights this
end of the spectrum I think is a really
awesome because they're not too dark or
not too light giving you that little fun
splash of springtime color I really like
the coral shade and the Tango color
there there's that undeniable
beautiful red I love this sort of
purpley shape there is a nice berry if
that's something you need but that
darkest shade might give you some grief
in this formula so what do you guys
think I'd love to hear in the comments
section which colors appeal to you most
which ones have you tried that you liked
the most the natural tones in this style
of product I think are really really
working just the bestest the bestest the
best of the best I really like to say
bestest when I'm really feeling
something here's what I cannot peg with
these the scent of them like what is
that it is nowhere even remotely close
to what standard L'Oreal color riche
lipsticks smell like because those have
like a a scent like an iconic scent and
it's pretty strong and you know what I'm
talking about if you you feel me on that
these don't smell like those but there's
something a little bit sweet trying to
come through on this and I don't know
even what to compare it to because it's
not vanilla it's not like fruit stripe
gum not coconut it's not like a cherry
lip balm can I just sit here and say all
the things that it's not and then
eventually you and your mind will narrow
it down to the proper step to touch on I
don't know I don't know what it smells
like
whatever this scent is I don't think
it's strong enough to be highly annoying
to anybody maybe something baked
something fruity that's been baked like
the lightest hint of jelly donut just
but just the lightest bit I'm throwing
my hands up on that one if you've tried
these and you know what they smell like
please please tell us in the comments
section we will thank you I hope this
helped you out thank you again for your
time and I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
