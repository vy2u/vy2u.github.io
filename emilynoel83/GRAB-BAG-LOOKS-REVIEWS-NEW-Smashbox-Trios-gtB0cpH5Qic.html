is gonna be so much fun different kind
of video because it's gonna be like a
five-day thing we're gonna keep tacking
on a new look everyday of course you're
gonna see this all edited down into one
video but this was the way I really
wanted to approach a new eyeshadow
product that Smashbox has come out with
they're calling these their photo edit
trios they actually look like little
camera lenses it's sort of a cute detail
around the outside they say there are
three perfectly coordinated shades
they're giving you a double dose of the
color you use most half the palette is
that shade and they say they're super
blendable and highly pigmented my ears
really perked up when I got this PR
package because I'm like oh man I love
smash boxes photo op formula is this
really gonna be the same and I have
played around a few swatches here and
there think you really hate to like
judge something before I've put it on my
eyes but I'm not really sure about every
single shade in this bunch and I'm
thinking some might be better than
others but we'll see what I want to do
is just totally randomly draw into the
bag every day pick one out and try to
put together a look with that trio alone
and see if they really are like
perfectly coordinated and easy to work
with and I did a little pull on my
Twitter page and an overwhelming amount
of you said you usually use three to
four shades and your shadow looks so
even though we have these massive
palettes sitting around a lot of
people's sweet spot seems to be like
this amount of shades so the looks are
gonna go by pretty quick in this video
I'll draw out the shade every day for
five days and then we'll do the look
then at the end I will definitely show
you like all the swatches and I think
might then I'll have a really good
perspective to review these and just
have an overall take on it I'm not gonna
look as I draw one
let's grab this one okay what do we have
here we're starting nice and basic
although this one does have shimmer
there are several all matte trios but
this one is hashtag goals got a shimmery
brown down here a sort of metallic
looking old gold and this champagne
color on this side so we'll see how this
comes together nothing in this trio is
met I took the darkest Brown even though
it has a little bit of shimmer in it it
seems to not really translate a whole
lot when you put it in the crease let's
say so I diffused it out in my crease
really concentrating my brush first on
the outermost corner and blending inward
then I decided to lay down the middle
shade on most of my lid it's kind of a
gold with just a hint of copper thrown
in and that applied really well and next
I used the lightest shade in here which
is a very light kind of champagne gold
and I put that on the inner most part of
my lid I decided to take the darkest
Brown with my Real Techniques
IPOP brush and just very very softly
apply that across my lower lashline I
think that brush gives just the softest
application and then I wanted to see
what it would be like if I took that
middle shade and applied it kind of as a
transitioning color just up above my
crease color and it kind of worked
nicely in that way I don't think it was
like mind blowing but then I use my
lightest color up under the brow as the
highlight and to pull it all together I
did a light layer in my lower inner rim
my when wild ultimate brow highlight and
then I used my Jordana color Envy liquid
liner in black Envy across the upper
lash line with a wing I did mascara top
and bottom and applied some Ardell
whispies false lashes and so that's the
finished look I mean I think it's great
I actually think that the textures in
this trio are very much what I know and
love from Smashbox so that was nice to
see I thought the world probably having
here is that this is just a very basic
thing for a trio like to seek it out in
a trio you know because we have so many
shapes like this within larger palettes
but I really do like the look and it did
work just fine and I will fill you in on
what's on my lips I'm wearing my true
matte lipstick from Broadway this is a
Dollar General product and the shade is
lemon pie I believe yeah
I thought a nice fun pop would be
appropriate with this very tame I look
and then on my cheeks I've got this
Shanny blush palette really fantastic
quality blushes and I am wearing this
one right over here so that's all for
this look and I will see you tomorrow
hey guys it's day 2 set the day one trio
to the side so that's not as a mix
anymore and I'm going to not look oh
good yeah I was hoping I might get this
one sometime this is the nude pic deep
and this might be one of my favorite men
I was playing with this one before I
decided to shoot the video but I was
using it in conjunction with another
trio but today we're gonna see what kind
of look we turn out with this just using
it on its own so we've got a really
super dark rich brown this rusty
terracotta orange and then I'm just a
matte cream shade okay to start out the
look I used a fluffy brush with the
cream color and I just kind of used that
to lay sort of the foundation for the
look all over the lid and up under the
brow then I decided to Pat the orange
shade all over my lid leaving a little
gap on the inner part but mainly wedging
it kind of in the outer corner as well
so some of this would really concentrate
up into the crease then I blended that
out a little bit and added some of the
darkest shade with a fluffier brush so
it wouldn't go on too heavy and just
applied that in the outer part of the
crease as well I blend it a little bit
of the orange shade kind of over the
border of the look also just to make it
look all nice and diffused and blended I
padded that cream color just on the
inner most part of the lid and then I
smudged the dark brown just really
really close within the lower lash line
and since it is so dark I thought it
might be fun to see how that would act
as an upper liner so I used an angled
liner brush and I really didn't want to
muddy up my lids too much so I just
started at the halfway point across my
lid and pulled outward and just created
a little gentle wing and then to finish
the look I used a light liner in the
lower inner rim that's the wet-and-wild
ultimate brow highlight i curled the
lashes and applied mascara top and
bottom that's the Marc Jacobs velvet
noir I actually think this look is super
pretty these mats were so nice to work
with
and like I said I've used these
alongside different shimmers before I
even started this little challenge for
myself they're so rich they really do
balance out the shimmery shades well and
they really remind me of mattes from
Smashbox that I've seen in other like
photo op pallets so it seems kind of
consistent with their usual formula
grabbed for my Shanny palette again on
the cheeks and I've got this kind of
neutral dusty rose just right in this
general zone it's my highlight I'm
wearing the new Becca it's called
vanilla quartz and I've just got a
little bit of that right here on the
tops of the cheekbones for my lips I
just went for a very wearable soft berry
shade really classic color here from
Clinique it's their black honey I think
a berry like this that's not to like
toward the purple and pinky side really
looks so nice paired with any kind of
orange e tone on the eye okay guys it's
Wednesday day three time to pull out yet
another trio to work with today okay
this one has the little bit of lilac on
it it's got some lilac and maybe yeah a
navy blue and then the largest part of
it is this white shade and you know what
that one's kind of iridescent it has
like a little bit of a pink shift to it
so first off after applying primer I put
the light purple shade just really Pat
that on like the inner third of my lid
and kind of went around the inner corner
as well and then layered on that sort of
iridescent white pink shift shade and
then using that same flat brush I went
into the navy blue and started patting
that all over the rest of my lid and I
noticed that as it overlapped with the
purple it really took on more of a dark
purple look than a Navy look which I
thought was interesting but I work that
up into the crease a little bit and then
got everything blended out with a fluffy
brush I even tried taking a little bit
of the soft purple and putting it around
the border just a little bit although I
didn't really feel like that did a whole
lot and then I used the lightest shade
up under my brow as a highlight and I
smudged the navy blue under my eye and
that's where I feel like I do see the
purest blue out of that shade because
it's not overlapping purple there but I
finished off the look with a dark liner
in the lower inner rim
I used soft black from Jula and then I
did a pretty dramatic wing with my
Jordana color Envy and black envy and
put on a very full lash as well and
elsewhere on the face I guess this could
be like five days of Shandy I've got
this deepest dusty rose shade on my
cheeks here and just a little pop of the
coral right on the apple of the cheek I
am again wearing my Becca vanilla quartz
highlight which I'm still kind of trying
to figure out but I think it is looking
really soft and beautiful and then on my
lips I'm wearing one of my two-faced
peach lipsticks in
Dollface so a really really nude color
and then for a hint of shine I've got
you a skinny dip on top of that that's
my Wednesday look everybody I hope you
enjoyed and if you didn't I'll be back
with a different Amaro good morning
everybody it's already day 4 so I'm
gonna reach into my bag you'll see love
this one I'm so glad I got this one this
is tag me it's got kind of a satin
finish raspberry color than a rose gold
you know kind of a peachy gold there and
then this other shape wow that's really
creamy just sort of a buttery shade that
might have a little hint of a sheen to
it as well after priming my lids I went
in with the shimmery rose gold shade and
I just started patting that on like the
inner third of my lids and then also
using a flat brush I decided to just
build up that really ruby red color all
around it so all over the lid up into
the crease as well and once I felt like
I had enough color packed on I used a
fluffier brush like my e25 and use that
to sort of just buff the color outward
even further and I think that worked
pretty well that shade was very very
easy to work with I also used the kind
of golden e color as a bit of a
transition between the crease and the
brow then I kind of wanted to reinforce
the rose gold that was on the lid so I
added more there's this kind of pearly
buttery shade as my highlight under the
brow and also a little bit of a
highlight around my innermost corner I
found that color very very soft and nice
and then just a smidge of that red
smudged on the outer part of the lower
lash line yes just a smidge of a smudge
and then I finished things off by doing
a light liner in the lower inner rim
which I think really
it's nice when you're pulling in reds
because it makes the eye look fresh and
alive even though you've put some
redness on so that's the wet-and-wild
ultimate brow highlight I did Jordana
color Envy liquid liner in black Envy
across the top but not winged out and
then I did a very full fluffy type of
lash there the rest of my face I'm still
keeping it rolling with my Shanny
palette I kind of want to prove to
myself that this is also like every
shade that would need for the week so
I'm wearing this color it's kind of a
deep dusty coral on my cheeks today just
very lightly my highlight is the new
Bonnie lou manizer from the balm so this
is like a little more golden just a
little bit deeper compared to mary lou
manizer which still has a hint of gold
in it but it's very pearly I kind of
feel like well this is giving me glow it
might be a little less dramatic looking
compared to mary lou manizer and then my
lip is the julep whipped lip mousse
matte lip mousse in bisous so rosy eye
rosy lip I do love the color but I will
say I was kind of disappointed texture
wise with the shimmer in here this shade
I felt like was kind of dusty and light
and even when I would apply it to the
eye like looking really close when I put
it around the inner corner I felt like
the color was kind of everywhere and it
didn't early cling in it I mean think of
it like snowfall you know sometimes the
snow falls and there's the kind that
really clings and it's hard to get rid
of and then there's the kind that just
dusts away with the air and this is more
like the light and dusty kind but y'all
know that's a color scheme that I really
do enjoy so I'm glad I happen to draw
that one out today and we'll see what we
get for the last day hey everyone it's
Friday man I look so like strange at the
start of these videos I was noticing as
I was editing with not having any blush
on yet I need my blush but I'm kind of
wait until after the eyeshadow to see
what shade I want you know so so last
day and I was thinking the other day
what if people think well why don't you
just choose like the five best shadows
and do looks with those part of why I
wanted to draw out randomly was I
thought it gave me a more like okay if I
just pulled anything out of the bag
could it work like maybe it doesn't have
to be my most favorite trio or color
scheme or whatever but can it go ahead
and create the look and just you know
it's an element of surprise it's fun
we're gonna draw in today
see what get it is okay okay it's called
day rate we got some dark teal with
shimmer a really light kind of unusual
all of greenish taupe color and then a
golden a shade that has just a little
sheen to it so first thing after primer
I used the lightest shade and I kind of
patted that around the inner part of the
eye and just up onto the lid a little
bit although I was kind of unimpressed
with this the lightest shade really
seemed to do very little for me so
moving forward I grabbed that dark teal
and I patted that all over the lid
really wanted to make this shade the
focus of the look so all over the lid up
into the crease a little bit I found
that when the shade is packed on you see
that teal intensity out of it and the
shimmer and then if you shear it out a
little bitter like diffuse it into the
crease like I did with a smaller brush
it just kind of looks dark so I really
found that to be kind of like a
two-in-one type of shade and so I got
that all blended out around the edges
and I sort of reified the teal that was
on the lid just dabbed a little more of
that on also added some of this misty
kind of olive green just with my finger
for a bit more glow on the lids and I
thought that was actually really pretty
I did use the lightest shade as a
highlight under my brow and then across
the lower lash line I smudged a little
bit of the teal and also the light all
of us like that closer to the inner part
of the eye and then to finish off the
look I did a very dark brown liner from
julep on my lower inner rim
I used Jordana color Envy and black envy
across the upper lash line I did winged
that out mascara top and bottom the
lashes I'm wearing are these kiss looks
so natural in poise and I actually
ruined that pair that I tried to pull
off they are so adhered to the packaging
I like what's pulling segments of the
lash off of like no but they are a very
lightweight very natural looking lash
then you guys know I'm keeping it
rolling on the cheeks all week with the
Shanny palette I'm wearing the peach
shade just kind of popped right in here
for a little healthy glow my highlight
is this makeup revolution strobe
highlighter in moon glow lights so it's
got just a little pinky tone to it just
wanted to try that out today and then on
my lips I'm wearing this L'Oreal color
riche matte lipstick in matte
so little sweet innocent soft pink lip
to pair with this dark murky green eye
and again I found this light shimmery
shade to be very underwhelming the
middle shade was okay but not amazing
definitely the strength of this trio is
the dark teal just a pretty color a lot
of intensity to it but one out of three
when you're just get in a trio I don't
think that's too impressive so just sort
of reviewing all the looks we did we had
hashtag goals which was that kind of
bronzy brown very very basic look but I
thought that one worked well really
enjoyed the next all matte look it was I
said it was nude pick it's nudie pic
deep and that one had a really awesome
matte orange hashtag repost of course
that's got the purple in there the lilac
I really did enjoy that one even more
than I thought I would tag me while we
worked with that gorgeous ruby red I
thought the rose gold was a little
underwhelming again I'm finding some
inconsistency with some of the light and
mid-tone shimmers and in today's again
the strength is with the boldest richest
deepest shade and then the other things
were kind of take it or leave it
but just putting the whole line back
together and looking at it as a whole
and thinking about strengths and
weaknesses I think Matt's across the
board performed really well out of these
trios I think any kind of deep shade be
it matte or shimmer seem to be intense
rich applied easily to the eyes built up
nicely on my eyes there are some lighter
shimmers that do but it's more hit and
miss among those and I think when you're
thinking about buying a trio and a trio
alone having a dead shade in that trio
is worse I think than having a dead
shade in a palette of 12 shadows let's
say it stands out a little bit more
right especially when you're perhaps
looking to that trio to create the whole
look and I do think this week I have
been able to create full like
well-rounded looks looks that seemed
like nothing was really missing even
though maybe for my own preference sake
I would have drawn in like one more
shade here or there I think the look
seemed really complete and I think most
of these trios allow you to do that but
I do want to take you through some
swatches and I've separated them into
three different color families they have
four different all matte neutral nudie
pic trios so that's one then I've got
neutrals and then I've got anything that
works in some
elements of colors so looking at the
matte neutrals there's nudie pic fair
light medium and deep beauty Pickfair
really really cool light shades then we
have a little bit more rich Brown
options in the light
I love the tones in the nudie pic medium
trio because I think those would pair so
like universally with so many other
trios if you were looking at maybe doing
to love the tone of the brown in that
one and the cream is really nice as well
and then the one that I created a look
with the deep one is very interesting
because the lightest shade is more
peachy there's a rich orange a really
really rich dark brown so I think these
mats could be potentially very useful in
thinking of taking one of these and
pairing it with you know a more flashy
single that you might have or a palette
that you just don't feel like has enough
basics these could be very useful
potentially because the quality is
really good moving on to what I'm just
calling neutrals and these do all have
some element of shimmer in them but the
first one that's in the lineup is called
it's fire and yes these shapes look
strong I'm not in love with it simply
because this is one of the few where I
kind of feel like something's definitely
missing here and for me to create the
full look with only these three I don't
really see that happening
hashtag goals is in there that was my
Monday look of the week night shoot very
cool topi perhaps a hint of plum in the
deepest shade the next one the lineup is
double tap and here's another example of
a great dark shade but then to some what
week shimmers that accompany it
holy crop love the shade name two shades
that are definitely right up my alley in
there with the shimmery rest and then
the dark plum and the lightest shade
while it's not showing up amazingly
there in the swatch that's a pretty
decent color also
and then our darkest neutral trio does
have a matte black and kind of a matte
grayish taupe and also a silver and I
really expect a lot when I see shimmery
silver shades and this one I felt was
pretty pretty weak and then the last
family of these trios that I want to
look at are the ones that incorporate
some element of colors so popping these
up now we've got showmance and this one
has some olive green some gold I feel
like in a lot of these trios there's a
light shimmery kind of champagne gold
that is underwhelming but I do love the
olive in there
it's only one out of three there's
de-rate which was used for today's look
you were able to see exactly how that
came off on the location is pretty
decent that light a shade has like maybe
just a barely there Sheen to it and it's
actually a really strong color the gold
looks good a teal there is really
pronounced I truly like each individual
shade in that trio but I feel like I
need to pair it with something else to
complete the look something matte
something deeper tag-me we use this one
yesterday wasn't it I'm the light shade
in here is strong the deepest shade was
good that shimmery rose gold I expected
so much more out of I thought that was
rather flakey got our fun little hashtag
repost trio in this bunch and I like the
purple in there the white is not simply
white it has a pink shift dark navy plum
really did some interesting and unique
things on the eye so I do like that one
and then lastly here we've got snap
queen and here we've got a light shimmer
that didn't really come off amazing in a
swatch but I think it might do better
built up on the eye it's a little softer
than some of the others and the other
trios a really pretty dusty mauve and
then a very dark plum so guys take what
you will from this little round up here
I hope you enjoy the random grab bag
draw one out who knows what we're gonna
get a type of look but I think it
definitely caused us to take a random
cross-section of what was here and kind
of see whether any of it could just
create the full look with the trio the
thing that makes me feel a bit letdown
is that I felt like the Smashbox photo
op eyeshadow formula was one of the most
consistent things out there like so many
palettes have come out over the years
larger like masterclass palettes
different small things here there or I
really really love the formula and here
I feel like it's just not quite as
consistent at least with the shimmers I
think they could have done a better job
there but still some exceptional mattes
as you saw some great matte basic trios
here let me know which ones you like
which ones you're interested in trying
and if you'd like to see this style of
video done with any other line of
product let me know because I thought
that was really fun and yeah thank you
guys for watching I'll see you next time
