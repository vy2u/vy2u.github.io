some green blush and lip gloss today
that's the topic of today's video a
couple new products from lipstick Queen
they had previously put out the Frog
Prince lipstick which is like a green
lipstick and it's supposed to kind of
customize or adapt to your specific pH
and turn out to be like the most
flattering shade of pink on your lips
and so they kind of come out with the
same concept with a cream blush that's
supposed to do the same thing on your
skin and a green lip gloss this truly
looks just like a shimmery emerald-green
gloss I had been playing around with
these Sun but I really wanted to try
them on for you in this video so you
could see how it goes so I'm gonna start
with this blush and it is a creamy blush
it looks straight-up green but as you
can see and I've been using it some as
you sort of swirl your finger in it you
can already see it turning to a little
bit of a pinkish color and it changes so
instantly like you can see as I swatch
here you know instantly pink there's no
like waiting for it to turn pink it just
immediately looks like this kind of deep
kind of a deep rosy shade I guess is
what I describe that as and there's no
shimmer in it but I kind of started to
think is this really just pink and
they've got some kind of like a green
you backdrop to this you know what I'm
saying that's just making it look great
in the pan but immediately turn out pink
but I actually did take a little chunk
of it out and if you do like get a
little bit of that under your fingernail
you're looking at it it does look like
this kind of solid green product so this
truly is green but the color change
really happens fast and then I had been
swatching some of these before and
that's sort of the stain that's left
behind so once you blend it in this
really does have some decent staying
power but I'm going to apply this with
my finger on one side I'm going to use a
brush on the other side just to show you
whether or not that makes any difference
so I'm just gonna start dabbing this
here on the outer part of my cheek so I
mean it's kind of maybe a little bit
anticlimactic because it's just so
immediately pink I really just feel like
I'm applying any pink blush to my cheeks
you're not waiting for some kind of
major color change surprised to go down
you know but I do find this to be a
really like flattering color I didn't
feel like I had to use a lot to get to
that color
it was very pigmented like as you could
see that's a lot that comes off then it
doesn't feel super sticky on my cheek it
really kind of feels to me like it's
melted back in with the texture of my
makeup now I'm going to try applying
this with my ELF small stipple brush on
the other side just to see if that makes
any difference and it does totally pick
up pink on the brush as well so it's not
like this is requiring skin contact in
order to turn pink so I'm going to apply
that to my cheeks here
I feel like I've basically gotten the
same look same level of intensity I
thought it was really easy to apply with
my fingers though so if you got this and
you didn't already have a small stipple
brush like it's not a really sticky
feeling blush there's no difficulty
blending it into the skin so either way
it seems to work fine and seems to give
off the same kind of color which I don't
know it seemed like a little bit deeper
pink on my finger and on my cheeks it
seems like an even lighter and brighter
pink and like I said I've worn this
before staying power has been good it's
not something where I feel like oh I've
got to slap a powder right on top of
that to make it last or to make the
color stand out more or just you know to
set it and undo some kind of weird
texture so I like that it feels like my
skin and it does do sort of a staining
effect now we're gonna try this gloss
which as you can see it looks very full
on green here there is some sparkle to
it there was no sparkle no shimmer in
the blush you take it out you've got a
very classic doe foot applicator and
then you know it clearly looks green
there on the wand and if I were to just
take a little bit of this off with my
finger on contact as you can see it's
not immediately turning pink and then
you swatch it out it really does kind of
look green but now you can see it's
turning color especially in the areas
where it was most sheared out now in the
areas where the green is still kind of
thick they're like I can see that it has
started to change color a little bit
I've noticed this on my lips as well you
put on a thick layer of this gloss and
it looks like just a little ashy you
know it looks a little greyish if you've
got a real heavy coat of the green and I
really think the reasoning for that is
because of the shimmer in this product
because that kind of transparent or
greenish gel aspect to this gloss is
able to you know easily be sheared out
and turned to pain but the sparkle or
the shimmer in this gloss isn't really
changing colors so if you've got that
applied in a more concentrated way on
your lips you're just gonna see more of
it you can see as it's been sitting here
on my hand there that part remains
looking kind of green so let's go ahead
and apply it to the lips and I'll show
you what we get here again a little bit
more of an interesting experience
when you apply this because it does look
green right away and then you're waiting
for a little bit of color change to
happen
so this they said would change to my
perfect shade of pink
I feel like I've gotten a really even
layer of it on there and it is very
shiny it's not too sticky and texture it
feels a little bit on the thick side
though as far as glasses go and isn't it
interesting how the cheek color seems to
go to a really kind of fresh light pink
and then this shade on my lips it's kind
of like a deep mom don't you think it's
like more of a berry type color I think
this is definitely the kind of thing you
want a mirror for for your application
because in the past when I've worn this
if I've gotten more in one spot I'm like
kind of waiting for the green to turn
and if there's too much goofiness in any
one area it's gonna continue to look
green so you've kind of got to make that
effort to get it nice and even so you
get kind of one solid color on the lips
as with the blush once you kind of rub a
lot of the shine away you do have this
pinkish stain left behind and it's it's
sort of a gimmicky idea here yeah I kind
of think it is I mean they're gonna
charge you $24 for the blush $25 for the
gloss um for me personally I think the
gloss really isn't worth it to me just
because when I look at the finished
shade and I've got a lot in my
collection that gives me this type of a
look so I'm not gonna see this as a
total must-have personally but if you're
really intrigued by the fact that you
know this could look a little different
on different people or you're gonna get
a kick out of like going out in public
with your green lip gloss and then
putting it on and letting people see the
color change like if that really really
appeals to you that's kind of the cool
thing about the glosses it truly does
initially go on a little bit greenish
and then it changes the blush truly does
look pinky immediately so you don't have
that real color change thrill but I
adore this shade on my cheeks it's just
really fresh you got a cat joining us
right now
Oh cupcakes Eric he's very concerned
about the new flower in the background
she hasn't totally approved that yet but
I think this color just looks so fresh
and alive on my cheeks I see myself
using this a lot and I love the fact
that it has a good staying power and I
don't need to set it oh yeah I forgot to
tell you
nice little magnetic closure on that
blush you know I love that so if you've
tried these products or anything else
from this frog prince lipstick queen
line please let me know it's kind of fun
to try something new and
different like this but in reality just
keep in mind the ultimate result is
something very normal and very like
typical of products that I do have in my
stash you know a pink cheek a berry lip
we've all seen that on me before her
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
