early my coffee it's still too hot to
drink
so I think you are seeing me in my real
natural state right now and I just
wanted to do like a full makeup
application how to start to finish
you've seen any of my other get ready
with me videos you know they're very
casual I'm not always specifically
talking about each and every little
thing I'm doing but I will have all the
products that I've used listed down
below if you need any additional
information or specifics and also in the
natural aspect of getting ready with me
I have a vague idea of where I want to
go with this look I don't know
specifically each and every product I'm
going to use just kind of figure it out
as I go but I do know I want to do a
matte eye because I have had some
requests for that and I have a palette
that I'm really enjoying using that will
give a great matte look it's a Kat Von D
shade + light eye palette the first
thing that I want to do my hair has like
just a little like leftover wave I'm
taking this Tresemme it's the perfectly
undone wave creation seafoam suitable
for use on straight or wavy hair and I
just use a little bit of this I find if
I use too much my hair will start to
feel crunchy and I don't like that so I
just use like half a pump maybe and I
just kind of work it between my hands
and work it through the ends of my hair
what I'm going to do is twist this up
into a bun on top of my head and then
when we take it down we'll see some nice
like kind of beachy waves now makeup
wise I've already got my moisturizer and
stuff on but I need a little lip balm
because my lips are so dry and using
this Burt's Bees pumpkin spice if I
still sound sick you know there's a
little there's a little cold remaining
here but I really I feel so much better
than I did before it's a little bit of a
primer I'm using my NYX pore filler love
this stuff it has an interesting
consistency that as I was saying in my
last video reminds me a little bit of
benefit Porefessional but it's even like
lighter and fluffier and I target that
right here and then just kind of work
outward
for foundation I'm using two different
products that I haven't used together
before my Sonia Kashuk perfecting
luminous foundation in cream and these
are my cover FX custom cover drops in in
35 so I thought it would just be good to
show how I use those drops since I have
reference liking them so much so whoa
here we go honey all right I'm gonna use
pretty much a full pump of the Sonia
Kashuk foundation and I shake these up
because if you don't you might notice
them getting a little separated and then
I'm gonna go just like two little drops
and then I just sort of mix it right
here on my fingers and then I begin
patching this all over my face and this
Sonia Kashuk foundation does have kind
of a dewy look to it so I think the
custom cover drops will bring it
probably about exactly the finish I want
which is just slightly more on the matte
side but not dry
extending a little correcting and
concealing I'm using my pixie correction
concentrate and brightening teach and my
maybelline superstay better skin in
light/medium and lately I've just been
kind of like putting on one putting the
other right on top of that and then just
blending it all together let's test the
coffee mmm yeah that's perfect now
very good I'm drinking the pumpkin spice
I think it's just the Green Mountain
brand that makes that yeah good stuff
gotta have it every fall of course now
last weekend we went to the pumpkin
patch we took a bell it was very fun
it's not merely a pumpkin patch you know
it's one of those places where they
they've put out all kinds of little fall
activities and cute stuff to do for kids
and stuff like that so there's a corn
maze there's a petting zoo but we got a
couple pumpkins and I find myself
checking every morning to see that the
pumpkins are still on the front steps
now is that still a thing kids do or
like teenagers do is steal pumpkins and
smash them on the street because I
remember when I was growing up that
happened does it happen to like all
kinds of people just these little local
prankster kids I guess and I grew up in
a very small town
you think maybe things like that
wouldn't happen there but maybe there
just wasn't enough to do but I remember
being a little kid and seeing the
pumpkins we had gotten smashed on the
road and feeling so like deeply offended
by that like I remember just feeling
very shook up about it now we have
pumpkins on our porch and I'm checking
everybody I'm still there okay pumpkin
police here
just kind of dabbing this around you
know anywhere I need a little extra
brightness
I am going to set the under eye I'm just
going to use this NYX HD finishing
powder this is the banana one so it's a
little bit can you tell it's got a
little yellow tint to it
so you guys know I'm like a huge Carrie
Underwood fan right so she's come out
with the new album and I bought it on
iTunes and I really really love it like
there aren't a lot of albums you know
where almost every song you really
really enjoy and you can just listen to
it straight through and be so happy with
it but I do feel that way about this one
but there are so many like little songs
that are like soap operas are little
mini movies or something like that there
are some really dramatic songs some very
heavy subject matter you know the song
church bells is really the one that like
I can't stop playing I love just the
sound of it but it's got kind of a
spooky feel kind of the way
Reba's that's the night the lights went
out in Georgia did or fancy you know not
look that it sounds like those songs
that's just got that kind of heavy like
dramatic vibe going on I'm just gonna go
ahead and pull out a contouring palette
I have not used very much and it's my
honest Asya
contour kit I don't feel like I love
this as much as some other ones I has
but I'm gonna go ahead and use it
because I want to get some use out of it
so I'm gonna kind of go between these
two shades as a cheek contour
oh and another great song on there is
the one called what I never knew I
always wanted and she's kind of talking
about her marriage with that she's
talking about her baby with that mindset
of you know I didn't spend my whole life
dreaming about these things but now that
they're here I couldn't imagine not
having them and I kind of feel that way
too like especially about Belle and I
think how many years I went through you
know like doing the news and in you know
being in college and just not really
thinking about babies at all at that
time not that I didn't want them but not
really thinking about life with one at
all either and maybe I think part of
that might be birth order too because
like I'm the baby of the family and I
never grew up with like another little
baby around me so I don't think I ever
really knew how much I would enjoy it
until it was here but I don't know I
just feel like I really relate to that
song the first time I heard it I cried
like it just it's a beautiful song just
in general just to listen to whether you
feel any attachment to it or not
and just mainly using this shade up
around my hairline is this the thing
everybody does after they do contour
they look themselves like this in the
mirror I feel like I want just a little
more warmth overall to my skin I'm gonna
use my give me Sun powder that you may
have seen in my products I want to use
makeup drawer and I'm just gonna start
dusting this we go forehead first Hopps
of the cheeks I think I've mentioned
using this kind of like a blush and I
really feel like you can go there if you
like the more bronze you look less of a
pinky look I love doing makeup I really
this is such a nice time to be able to
give yourself just some time some quiet
like everybody's still asleep they'll
still sleeping Bubb sleeping cupcakes
probably sleeping somewhere here I
really kind of savor these quiet times
in the morning where you can have your
coffee you can sit down it's like yeah
did I have to wake up a little early to
do this I did but I just really am
enjoying this time blush and highlight
I'm gonna do my highlight first I am
using this makeup revolution the vivid
baked highlighting golden lights and
this is my little highlight brush from
the complexion set from up and up so I
pick up some of that tap off the excess
and take it right here on the top of the
cheek hmm is that a yummy highlight yes
it is oh man I got way too much I didn't
tap off enough excess it's too shimmery
no maybe it wasn't that I got too much I
just put it too high oh well I think
what I'm gonna do is take the brush that
I used from the under eye setting powder
and just kind of blend over it yeah okay
that's a reasonable fix there we're all
right okay I don't teach me to get
excited about my highlight this is my
laura geller Dreamsicle i hope this is
still available because this is a
beautiful blush it's like a pink with
actually yellow swirled throughout it
it's very pretty
picking some of that up
always feel better once I get my blush
on how about you especially if you're a
little under the weather
blush makes a massive amount of
difference and blush some mascara makes
a big difference in lifting the eye a
little bit of like white liner in the
lower inner rim can work wonders and
lipstick lipstick lipstick lipstick if
you're feeling sick those are the things
you should make sure you don't skip the
brow thing I've just found myself
wanting to reach for lately is my
Maybelline brow satin so that's the one
that has like the pencil on one end and
then a powdery thing on the other so do
you guys have like a favorite season for
doing your makeup like a favorite time
of year for makeup I know a lot of
people love fall and I really do too
I really like the summer to fall
transition because I feel like so many
tones that we like in the fall maybe
outside of they're really like deep
vampy lips shades on the eyes like
bronzes and plums and burgundy and burnt
orange and stuff like that it really
goes well from summer to fall and I love
at the end of summer you know my skin's
maybe got a little color in it and I'm
still like piggybacking off of that but
I'm working in some fall tones I love
like that particular stage of makeup
okey-dokey so Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette I got this I've seen several
people really raving on this and I just
had to go ahead and get it and I must
say I really enjoy the way a lot of
these different shades blend like even
though some of them are very deep and
dark I find them easy to kind of pull
one into the next and get a good look
with them I'm going to start off with a
little bit of this shade and I'm just
gonna put this on the lid I want to do
something a little different today than
what I've done the past couple times
with this palette which I've been very
drawn to like this peachy color and that
really kind of rusty warm brown so I'm
gonna go a little cooler today but when
I was asked recently to do something
with matte shadows I thought oh okay
sure and then I started thinking about
it and it's like it's been ages since
I've done a matte shadow look like I've
been using so many palettes that have
you know like a shimmery pop to them and
really haven't been doing a 100% matte
look lately then I'm taking a little bit
of that same shade and I'm gonna go up
under the brow then I'm gonna take my
nice little handy dandy elf blending
brush which I used in a recent tutorial
and I'm gonna go to this shade here
never use this one yet I'm just going to
apply that to the crease yeah that works
is a nice like soft crease color
then another shade of never used this
one right here I'm going to use that in
a similar way really blendable matte
shadows when you find some that you feel
like are easy to actually blend out and
blend one on top of the other and really
get a nice stuff and look with them on
the eyes when you find matte shadows
that can do that hold on to them you
know remember what they are because not
every matte shadow is this easy to work
with let's see I'm going to tap into a
little bit of black and a little bit of
this and that's gonna be my outer corner
on the lid
the shade that I think really helps
blend things out is this peach just
because for my skintone it just really
helps go back into your skin so I am
gonna use a little bit of that just on
the edge of this darkest stuff here
want to do some powder as liner from
this so I go into the black with just my
angled liner brush and just go across my
upper lash line you guys have probably
seen if you watch my snapchat Belle
really likes to dance kid loves to move
you know put on some music she really
loves to move to it and lately she
started doing this thing where she'll
take like a big step like like like this
big wide stance kind of stompy thing
I've got to get bad on camera guns and
what another thing she'll do is do like
really really fast steps but then now
the new thing is this this big wide kind
of stompy step it's really cute but the
thing I just really enjoy watching I
guess is the fact that she dances to
anything you know it doesn't matter what
kind of music it is I mean if you just
give her a beat if you use clap your
hands you know that's enough that's
enough to make her wanna wanna dance
so I just think it's so great and then
I'm gonna move out with a little ray
right here
and then an even softer brush and pencil
brush I'll go to this shade
the lashes I'm gonna put on are these I
got these in what are they a five pack
yeah from Walmart and they are the zero
ones from kiss
do you ever get two lashes going at a
time just holding them between two sets
if it curses get them drying for speed
mom hacks right here I'm pulling out a
couple of these high voltage lipsticks
for Nick's mint put on this lightest one
first this is in the shade called the
Mirage very nude then I'm taking flutter
kiss and just kind of going over it now
let's see what happened to the hair so
we had that wavy stuff in there and now
I take it down and I've got some nice
and it smells good too
I've got some little loose waves from
being in that bun just kind of style it
with your fingers
so that's basically what I'm working
with so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this was a fun video for
you let me know what other kinds of
tutorial type videos you like to see or
if I've been reviewing some products
that you'd really like to see in-depth
tutorials on I'd be happy to do those so
