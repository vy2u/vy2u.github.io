me for this game day tutorial this is
the second one that I've done so far the
first one was the Ohio State look that
was the one that kind of first prompted
me to do it because somebody sent me a
message and they said will you do a look
for Ohio State and I said well sure so
it kind of inspired this whole series so
basically on beauty broadcast dotnet you
can go there you can vote on a weekly
basis one of two teams teams that are
actually facing off in a game you can
vote for one of those teams to see the
tutorial in those colors so this week it
was LSU it's gold and purple and I will
walk you through how I did the look
alright step 1 i'm going to apply my
palladio herbal i shadow primer all over
my lid you can use whatever primer you
prefer this is one of the least
expensive options that works really well
I'm just blending that all into my
eyelid there if there's any extra kind
of pull it up through the crease next
I'm going to be using some of these
shadows their coastal scents hot pots
and they are individual shadows that you
can buy and make put into your own
pallets or you know use them however you
want and basically they're they're just
like this and I have put a little magnet
on the back there so they stick into
this elf palette which you can find
these elf palettes for like super cheap
at Target or wherever but anyway put a
magnet on the back this one on this gold
shade that's really really vibrant and
metallic is s36 so I kind of left it so
I could still see that number but it
fits right in there and I've put you
know four shades together you can switch
them out you can do whatever you want
but that's just an idea for using shadow
so anyway I'm going to take a sponge tip
applicator and just get this metallic
gold shade all over my eyelid you can
see it really pops it almost it's like
borderline bronzy um but I kind of
thought this made a prettier match with
the purple then just flat out yellow all
these shades that I use i'm not going to
really pry them each out and tell you
right now what the shade name is but i
will have all that information in the
bottom bar so to see specifically what
colors these are look there otherwise
they'll kind of refer to them as
shimmery purple or matte purple or
whatever i'm going to use my essence of
beauty crease brush which is the larger
of the two that come in the kit and
we're
stay with the shimmery theme for now I'm
going to be using this purple shade here
just dab a little bit of that on on your
brush with these shades a little bit
goes a long way I'm looking down into my
mirror and I'm just going to follow my
natural crease they're just going from
the inner corner to the outer corner and
you can see it just really kind of warms
up it's kind of unusual to see that
shade right next to gold but i think it
is kind of kind of pretty kind of
different from normal so again i'm not
doing an outer v with this just to kind
of make it a little different kind of
making it look sort of like a sunrise
effect almost so yeah just cover that
area from left to right and then if you
want to buff that out a little bit take
a fluffier brush kind of buff over the
ends and then I'm going to take this
really great be kind of matte purple
shade it actually may have a hint of
shimmer but it's not nearly as sparkly
as what I just put on and you can kind
of see the tone of the purple change as
you put that on that was something as i
was doing this other I I was kind of
adjusting this throughout like adding a
little bit more a little bit less but
then we have kind of a matte buttercream
kind of yellowy shade here it really is
in line with the gold think of like that
gold shade really lightened up and take
them take the sparkle out and that's
kind of what you got here so I'm just
running that lightest shade the shade
right here under my eyebrow next you
don't you know you can use any plum
colored shadow that you have that you
like one that I and joy comes in my wet
and wild color icon palette unless this
is a great matt plum shade right here so
I would recommend a matte shade since
we've been working with so much shimmer
right now using the smaller of the two
crease brushes now you can see that
one's a little bit smaller than the one
I use the shimmery purple for and if you
look on this I you can see it's just a
little darker in the crease
and I like to create a little bit of
contrast and dimension there so i'm
laying down that shade just left to
right really basic and then just kind of
swirling it out you can make that crease
shade as dark or as subtle as you want I
just kind of wanted to do just enough to
create a real division between gold and
purple next thing I want to do I'm going
to go back to my larger crease brush
there and I'm going to go back to the
purple I'm just going to sort of keep
layering on top because I did darken
that up somewhat the key here is just
blending I mean you don't want that
purple to come to an abrupt stop
anywhere you just want it to look like
it fades right into skin so I'm kind of
going between the two purples here
adding a little bit of the matte shade a
little bit of the more shimmery shade
and just letting it fade there and then
you know your best friend for this look
will be fluffy brush just to buff it out
no harsh i'm going to start working with
some liner i'm just using this mini hard
candy walk the line liquid liner it came
with something i bought and i actually
really like it i think it gives a really
bold black line i'm just going to go
from right to left on my upper lash line
not really winging it out just making it
a little thicker towards pace so there
you can see just went from the inner
part to the outer part made the liner
just a little thicker on the end but
didn't really do anything fancy there
then take any black liner that you're
comfortable putting on your waterline
something that's long wearing something
that I think is really creamy is the
Maybelline de final line hmm I felt like
I was going to sneeze there um just a
rich black liner I'm kind of pulling
down slightly and gently there on my
lash line and just renting it right
there to the inner corner it's drawing a
little bit down here on my natural lash
line just so I can make a little
connection with
the outer corner and then if you want to
smudge that out go right ahead next take
any smallish brush you have this one
happens to be the Smashbox smudger brush
number 33 going back to the shimmery
purple it's a little bit deeper getting
some just on the tip of that brush and
then as you can see we're just going
underneath to bring out the purple
brightening up that area a little bit
again it's up to you how bright you want
to make it just with you know any other
small brush or a q-tip I'm taking the
gold right around the inner corner and
get brightens it up a little bit and
then basically you're done you can make
any other adjustments you want to but
I'm just going to curl my lashes and put
on a coat of this almay one coat dial-up
mascara it's on the three setting um
i'll be reviewing this at some point
soon but i'll get that on and then i'll
join you with the finished look
alright everyone here is the finished
look really not too hard of a look it
just incorporated sort of a wide range
of shades with going from gold to purple
but I think it's a look that will
represent the LSU fans well thank you so
much for taking the time to vote we got
lots of votes on beauty broadcast net
that's my blog and that's where i post a
game of the week and this week you know
it was the ESPN game of the week first
official you know college football
weekend so chances are maybe you'll be
watching that game later on but I hope
you enjoyed the look on my lips just
went kind of light I actually used the
shade it appears very gold and the
packaging here it's one of the Coastal
Scents smacks in sheer tan so I'm
guessing something big just happened
there in the other room i'm not sure
what i'm not sure if there's a game
already in progress but anyway this is
kind of a sparkly sheer shade and i
think it just works well with the look
because it doesn't detract too much from
the eyes as for the face i mean some
bronzer some neutral kind of blush i use
the elf blush and bronzer duo quite a
bit in this use the bronzer to contour
and the peachy shade as a blush and yeah
that pretty much does it so thanks so
much for tuning in have a great day and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
