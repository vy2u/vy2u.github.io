this new series it's going to bring you
some really creative colorful fun looks
I am so pumped they're going to be
coming to you in school colors in time
for football season I'm so excited
football games are going to get started
and on the college level are going to
start next weekend so ahead of that I
thought I would do the look that
inspired this series I was actually sent
a YouTube message from a girl named
Danielle she's been watching my videos a
lot and she goes to Ohio State
University and she was saying how you
know they she goes to the games I she
probably tailgates or does this for that
and gets ready she's got a cute outfit
on but she wanted a pool I look that
would sort of you know go along with her
school's colors which are scarlet and
grey she said so I played off of those
colors to create this look she also
specifically said she likes the cat eye
effect so I incorporated that and the
school colors and it kind of got me
thinking you know we're coming up on
football season what if I posted a pull
on my blog beauty broadcast net and had
people vote you know on between a couple
of different teams each week and then
that would determine the colors that the
next tutorial would be so i'll have the
colors in the team on my blog on a
little pull on the right hand side and
then you can go and vote for what the
next week's look will be and of course
something i think it's important to keep
in mind even though i'm using different
colors yeah i mean for the basic concept
of the look you could substitute your
own team's colors I was a cheerleader in
college so this really appeals to me I I
like the idea of something that's a
little more flashy a little more
dramatic can color full for game day or
you know any other event that you want a
little more dramatic makeup for I think
it's going to be so much fun it's going
to test my creativity a little bit and
so I will do my best to bring you some
fun and exciting what
so if you want to see how to create this
one keep on watching
so the first thing i did I just put on
my Urban Decay primer potion use any
kind of primer you like just get that
all over your lid then i'm using one of
the Coastal Scents double-ended like I
crayon things there this is the one it
doesn't have a name but this one has two
silver ends ones glittery and what is
just metallic and I'm going to use them
it's the metallic side and basically
just kind of start drawing that all over
your eyelid doesn't have to be neat or
anything right now but just kind of go
from inner corner all over the lid and
all the way over to the other side and
then just take one of your fingers once
you're done and kind of blend it out
this is going to make sure there's not
too much product it's just going to
really smooth it out taking my quad from
covergirl in drama eyes we're going to
be using this wonderful silver shade
right here and you can just use the
sponge tip applicator there and we're
just going to apply this on the inner
part of the lid here so you can kind of
look down into a mirror and just use
that sponge tip applicator to sort of
set the creamy part you might think well
that looks almost the same but this is
going to kind of boost the intensity of
the of the silver look there and it's
also going to help that creamy part stay
put so just kind of blot that on there
and then I'm going to take a Mac shade
in cranberry now I was kind of
contemplating using the red reddish
shade here in drama eyes but we're going
for more vet like sort of like crimson
red type shade and this one is a little
more burgundy it has a little more
purple in it so that's why I'm using
cranberry or if you have a favorite red
shade that you like I mean go for it
whatever you prefer or switch out this
color entirely and use whatever color
you want but anyway take any sort of
medium crease brush this is my Smashbox
number 15 and I'm just going to get some
of the cranberry on there and we just
want a light dusting of this shade right
now in our crease we're going to use
this shade with some more in
to be here in a little bit but for now
it's just a matter of warming up the
crease and we're not winging it out or
not you know doing an outer V or
anything just once you get in the crease
though start kind of blending it up and
you'll see that warmth going all the way
up towards your lashline feel free to
take a larger brush and just kind of
dust that out a little bit blend it out
okay and then if you want you can go
back to that sponge tip applicator and
we can go ahead and do the highlight
which is going to be that silver shade
again pick some of that up and since
this is you know we're going for game
day we're going more dramatic you know I
am kind of laying this on a little
thicker than I might normally here with
the highlight you can take this all the
way into under the brow area if you want
and if there are any areas you want
super light go to the white and kind of
use that to accent you know any
particular deepen the crease just a
little bit go to the black shade and I'm
using an even smaller brush this is the
smaller of the two essence of beauty
crease brushes that come in the kit
together picking up a little bit of that
black there but not too much because all
we want to do you can see the difference
between the crease in both eyes and now
we're adding a little bit of black just
so you know it has a little more more
drama to a little more emphasis there in
the critically we've just layered some
shades there to get the effect we want
and now I'm going to go in with the
liner and then we'll start constructing
this cool wind look I'm going to go
ahead and use my L'Oreal carbon black
liner intense shake it up and basically
we're going to go from inner to outer
and do a small wing there as you can
keeping it close to the lash line the
wing I'm just going out to the corner
here and drawing it up to what looks
like a little check mark there and then
I'm just going down a little bit and
connecting it
and there's your way next I'm going to
take an angled liner brush and we're
going to kind of surround this black
part with a pretty red border using met
cranberry so this is going to apply it
in a really concentrated way so pick up
some of that on your angled liner brush
and we're going to go from about halfway
in we're going to just kind of start
going right on top like you're drawing a
little red line on top there this is not
not difficult at all working with this
powder shadow it's somewhat forgiving
but and then we want to come down from
the boss coming down and come down
actually quite a ways because we do
still have some black to put in there so
it's going to seem kind of awkward but
leave a little gap kind of going for me
it's going almost in that little crease
area under the lower lash lines I'm
grabbing my maybelline define a line
eyeliner and I'm lining my waterline
here just like that and kind of go all
the way there to the inside too there
you go then we're going to also get a
little bit of this and connect that to
our black and as you can see we're just
getting a little bit of this in here
right here right on top of the red not
we're not fully covering it up though
you didn't feel free to take that
blender tip on the opposite end of this
liner give that black a little blend out
and then we're going to take our angled
liner brush dip it in black the black
that's in the drama eyes and just top
that off and if you want take it all the
way under for a kind of blended a little
bit smoky look ok guys I just realized I
was not
according a part of the thing that I
just did but basically I went in with my
drama ice palette okay I used another
kind of liner brush it's the Sigma 2 14
um just kind of a flat brush but sort of
a little bit chunky you know whatever
you want to use will work I dipped it in
the silver and I kind of went right
under sort of underlined that part and
silver and also went around the tear
duct so that was all I did there then
I'm just going to apply some mascara
curl my lashes and then do some steal a
major lash on the top and Maybelline
lash discovery on the bottom and then
I'll join you with the finished look
alright guys here's the finished look as
you can see you know that can I look
that Danielle was going for but also
incorporating the school colors of Ohio
State the Reds some kind of Silver's for
the gray and also a little bit of black
obviously with the liner to highlight
everything but this was really really
fun for me and I'm looking forward to
doing more of these they'll on the lips
I kind of kept them sort of I guess you
could call it a little more matte I just
used one lip liner I used my Coastal
Scents lip liner in cabaret which is a
gorgeous gives you this very red look I
mean that's the only product I use so I
lied and to give it some dimension I
actually left it a little bit there in
the center and then so I kind of like
put some liner on the outer part put
some liner there and then I took my
finger and just kind of blended so it
sort of overlapped the center but wasn't
as intense it makes your lips look more
full that way so yeah that was what i
was going for there and if you can't get
your hands on that coastal scents one in
the drugstore rimmel sells an
exaggerated lip liner in ravish and
that's also very very close to this I
was just running low on that one so I
needed to to you know find something
else here that I had on hand so anyway I
hope you like this look guys keep
checking back on beauty broadcast net
for a poll that will be posted so you
can I guess pick the next colors for the
game day I look I think it's really fun
on my face basically i have used um my
actually my temptu airbrush stuff also
my own bronzer and i say my own i guess
it's my tipsy stuff but it was you know
a different bronzer that i've been using
for a while i actually will post all
that information on my dailybooth page
so you can click the link down in the
bottom bar to find out more about its
specifically what else is on my face
I've been doing that daily and it's been
fun I think you can see if you look
through the looks you can see what I've
used you can kind of see what different
products made the look stiffer
I you know from one day to the next so
anyway thank you guys so much for
