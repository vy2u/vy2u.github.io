again this past week on the blog you had
to vote between Duke which was blue and
white and army black and gold those two
teams are facing off this weekend and
the army look one so it's a black and
gold look that is really pretty dramatic
I actually recorded a full tutorial
doing this look a different way the
other day and I just didn't like it as
well I don't know it just looked more
neutral than actual black and gold so I
want a real look for a second time today
to try to sort of make some changes and
tweak it a little bit and I'm really
happy with this one so I hope you enjoy
it as well it's definitely got a few
different little techniques and that are
a little bit tricky so hopefully I made
them somewhat understandable in this
tutorial so I hope you like it and keep
on resting i did i applied a shadow
primer all over my lid then i'm going to
take one of the double-ended pencils
from Coastal Scents the one that's
basically black and white the black has
some sparkle to it and I like that but
you could use any you know just flat
black or a metallic black any of that
would do but I'm just basically going to
draw this from inner to outer corner and
all over the lid you don't have to do it
in a neat way but just get it all over
your eyelid up to my crease here with
the black I'm trying not to like go back
and forth over areas I've already put it
you know I'm just trying to get
practically dotted or just do little
short strokes and then we're going to
kind of basically see this outer view
we've got going on here we're going to
get that going on here think like you're
going to draw right up to the corner of
your eyebrow there and just draw it out
like that and then connect it over also
taking this pencil down on in more of a
traditional liner since right under my
lower lash line just a little bit great
about to say
right there a really important step
before we start putting shadows on we
want to make sure that this is sort of
blended and just going over it with your
finger you're going to pick up some
excess product there that you really
didn't necessarily need on your lids so
I'm just going over it kind of like a
blotting just padding right over the
tongue for more precision I'm just
taking a q-tip to kind of soften up the
edge of the top part here keep this
bottom part straight like I mean I mean
it's going to be straight but I mean
don't don't smudge that out too much but
we do want to smudge out this top part
kind of coordinating with my black that
I put all over the lid but you could use
a matte shade or really any black that
you like but i'm using this sparkly
black shade it's a diamond shadow from
make up forever and i'm using my flat
brush here from sigma just picking up
some of that and i'm going to carefully
kind of Pat that all on top of what I've
got going on there and when I do this
put this over a creamy product like this
the sparkle in this shadow comes out a
whole lot more than it does when I just
applied it you know in a regular shadow
way like in Mike research i'm taking
this shadow all the way up to the crease
you can see they're just kind of
overlapping what I already did there and
also taking it right down here and
overlapping the bottom an extra blended
look right up here we want this to be
more straight which I will you know show
you a way to really get that look in
just a moment but first taking take a
fuller brush with a little black shadow
on it and just run that all over this
upper crease area just kind of on the
brow bone reason why we do that is we
want this goal to really transition from
kind of like an old gold you know like
more of the a little bit dirtier seeming
gold to really bright gold up to almost
like a a white gold practically so what
I'm going to do for
that is grab my Coastal Scents metal
mania palette it really has some of the
best metallic shades and you can see
there there are a couple of shades of
gold and I'm going to be using the
lesser bright one first and then I'm
going to go over to see if I can show
you here this one first and then we're
going to move on to the brighter one and
then we're going to go up to the upper
corner where you see that really light
shade and that's going to become our
ultimate right below the brow highlight
type shade so as we use these this is
all going to start to appear a lot more
blended so very interesting way of doing
it I'm just going to be using a sponge
tip applicator here because I feel like
packs on the most intensity and
decreases the amount of fallout that I
have with these colors all over my face
so take the old gold shade that's three
down and three over from the left side
of the palette get a generous amount of
that on a sponge tip applicator and just
overlap where we were blending out the
black and you're going to get a nice
metallic feel there but it's not going
to be you know that bright gold just yet
next dust off your sponge tip a little
bit go to the brighter gold that's just
to the left of the shade we just used
and layer that on the border of the old
gold that we just applied and go all the
way up to your brow bone with the
brighter gold if there's anything point
where you want more intensity all you
have to do is get a little more on your
sponge tip and build it up things are
very very buildable colors so that's
what I love about this you can make it
more or less intense you can keep this
really subtle and just have a really
nice smokey eye out of the whole thing
too um next go back to a fluffy brush
for the inner corner here it's just kind
of fading back to skin sort of so if you
want to just kind of buff over that a
little bit to keep it for
looking to stark and same with right out
here and then I'm going to take a very
small detail brush this one comes from
Coastal Scents you can find smaller
brushes in other brush kits or use a
q-tip and I'm going to the lightest
shade in the upper left hand corner of
the palette getting some of that on
there and this is just going to be
reserved for right under the highest
point of the eyebrow arch next we're
going to deal with this outer corner
just a little bit and this may be sort
of the trickiest part of this look I'm
going to go with instead of that sparkly
black now a matte black this is matt
carbon and i'm taking a pencil brush
this one's from sigma getting the tip in
some of that carbon and we want to do
whoa sorry want to just darken up the
outer corner here if we can so going
basically right here's my corner right
here of my eye and I'm just getting that
a little deeper and darker right there
this look to have kind of an edge on the
bottom you can see how we look blend it
up in here but an edge right there and
so for that I'm going to take a flat
somewhat wide flat a liner brush this is
the SS 212 from sigma going to use the
matte carbon get some of that on that
brush and we're going to basically use
this to define that we're comfortable
you could take a piece of tape and run
it right here from the corner of your
brow to the corner of your eye to really
keep that sharp line I just didn't have
it handy at the moment so I'm just doing
it this way but here I'm placing that
right along the corner there to get a
really black straight line I also do
want to take that to top off remember we
put the Coastal Scents creamy jumbo
pencil just a little bit under here so I
want to make sure that gets topped off
with shadow as well so going under there
just a bit if you want to blend that out
a little more you can bring in the
pencil brush and kind of do some
blending there just make sure you're not
blending on this side of the shadow keep
it up in here now I'm not really lining
the upper lash line it's so
dark and black I'm not doing anything
there but i'm taking my L'Oreal pencil
perfect liner and I'm going to line the
water line here so just get that nice
and black it's going to make the look
appear a little more smoking take the
brighter gold shade and go from inner
corner all the way around here I'm going
to take it below the I am actually going
down and all the way under and we're
going to sweep up right under that
weighing there you can use a liner brush
for this i'm just using a small detail
brush and go right we've wrapped up the
shadow i'm going to go ahead and apply a
couple of coats of the Loreal voluminous
carbon black on the upper lashes and
some maybelline lash discovery on the
bottom lashes and then i'll join you
with the finished look
alright guys here's the finished look
very gold and black and very appropriate
for this week's army inspired black and
gold gameday tutorial if you really
don't enjoy using that much gold in your
look you could definitely just do the
smoky black part and apply like a light
highlight shade under your brow or if
you had another color you wanted to take
in with the blacks a pink or orange or
blue or green or anything like that you
know you could definitely use a similar
approach just in blending and fading
different shades of a color up to your
brow so on my lips I'm using the l'oreal
colour riche lipstick in golden splendor
so this is actually this goes on really
sheer so what I did was I patted on a
couple of the gold shades that I used on
my eye area I just kind of blotted them
on top of the lipstick just to give it
an even more golden appearance and then
I what about my foundation and
everything like that in sort of a
typical way but to top it off and get
more of a golden glow I used a product
from Smashbox called flash powder and
this is gives you a really I mean it
looks just kind of like light yellow
there but if I were to get some on my
finger and show you it gives you like a
really golden e glow highlight all over
so I dusted some of that on to enhance
the look in that way but thank you so
much for watching and don't forget to
head back to beauty broadcast net so you
can vote on next week's game day
tutorial and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
