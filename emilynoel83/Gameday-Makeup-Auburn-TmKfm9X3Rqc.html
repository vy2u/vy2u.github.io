in for this game day tutorial this week
the winning look is the Auburn orange
and blue looks so yeah more orange even
after Tennessee's look I was going to
get orange either way this week because
it was all burned up against Clemson
which is purple and orange but what's
interesting here is that I think if you
wanted the Clemson look just sub the
blue stuff I'm using today in with
purple and you can get that look as well
but I really do like the combination of
the Navy and the orange here I had a lot
of illini fans University of Illinois
fans requesting the orange and blue so
here you go you've got that as well but
this is kind of a complicated look it
required me to kind of go go about some
things and maybe a little different
order than I might usually do them just
to make sure that we kept the orange
nice and pure and bright in this look so
if you want to see how I went through it
keep on watching and don't forget that
there is always that game day poll on
beauty broadcast net you can vote and
decide what two teams that are facing
off the following week you can decide
which one will be used as the game day
to 21 i just applied a primer to my lid
that would really neutralize the color
and even it out and for that i use my
smashbox photo finish lid primer perhaps
a Paint Pot from equifax really making
the tone you know any bluish or
discoloration that comes through on your
eyelid really evening that out because
we want this orange here to really pop
so that is the first step that we're
going to do and you're going to notice
we're using a powder product now we're
going to come in with some cream
products in a second so it might be a
little different sequence but it's what
we really need to do for this tricky
look to make the orange pop and have a
really dark shade all around it because
you know where when you're working with
Silver's grays and blacks you know all
those colors can kind of blend one on
top of the other but here we want it to
look pretty clean where that orange is
so one of the best oranges I have other
than like my double stack matte palette
from Coastal Scents is the creative me
palette which is a bunch of Matt bright
colors and you can see a great orange
right there in the corner
so I'm just going to use a flat
eyeshadow brush pack a little bit on the
brush and we just want to put this on
the inner part here so I'm just kind of
padding it in kind of build your way up
to what you want but we want all the way
to the corner and then just the intermix
is where things get a little tricky this
is probably the trickiest part of the
look I'm going to take a cream pencil
that's navy blue and we're going to
actually add that right here on this
side and we're going to sort of gently
blend that to make this look really work
here for us so i'm using this pencil
it's from coastal scents and if you look
on the website it's got two blue ends
we're going to use the darker of the two
this is really the only jumbo navy
pencil i could come up with here so i'm
going to just kind of start drawing that
basically and you'll see you know it's
not a super dark blue and that's good
for right now if it's going to help us
really blend in and i'm just barely i'm
almost using a stippling effect as i
sort of dot over just over the edge of
the orange and then i'm just taking it
out a little bit I'm building it out
sort of to practically an outer V and
then I'm going to take it under in line
all the way underneath the eye just one
line here it doesn't have to be perfect
you can see there i basically drew on
the outer V and i drew this all the way
in to the inner corner that looks like
kind of a fun like leopard look there
but we're actually going to go ahead and
blend it out just using your finger what
I'm doing is I'm kind of like putting my
finger on the edge of the orange and
just pulling out that way and then what
you slowly start to get is sort of a
look that's somewhat blended there and
just kind of dot it over the rest just
the only reason why I'm really doing
that out here is just to make sure
there's not too much cream product and I
don't get creasing but yeah then you're
basically good you what you want is just
you know not a chunky look not a a
you look that lacks smoothness you want
it to just look kind of seamless there
from one end to the other and just by
using your finger that's really the best
way to go to some shadow and there is a
really good blue in this palette right
here in the lower corner it looks a
little darker in the palette that I
think it might be coming off on camera
I'm going to take a flat brush this one
happens to be from Sonia Kashuk get a
little bit of that color on there and
then just kind of Pat over the cream
that we put there on the outside and I'm
mainly concentrating that on the outer
corner and then kind of lightening my
pressure as I get closer to the orange
remember we want the orange to be
relatively untouched in this whole
process it's kind of like we're doing
all this work around it but we don't
want that to have you know any blueish
fall out on top oh we wanted to be
really pure so basically yeah we want to
top that off there then I'm going to
take a smaller crease brush I'm going to
use my fine crease brush from the
essence of beauty duo get a little bit
of that blue on here and really
concentrated in the outer corner and
then slowly and carefully bring it in to
your crease and as you can see at this
point i am going just over the orange
but i'm not going down into it to stay
over the top the jet-set waterproof
eyeliner in midnight blue from Smashbox
so take a fine brush whatever works for
your you can use an angle brush and
we're going to take this all the way
from the inner corner to the outer
corner here on the upper lash line when
you're going under the orange try to
keep it extra thin so as much of that
color shows as possible now as I reached
the outer corner and I've got this dark
cream product I'm just kind of pulling
it out a little bit thickening it up and
letting it just sort of fade into the
rest of the blue so it's not really that
hard but if you're using a small brush
like I am which you're pretty much have
to use for liner I'm just taking short
strokes out
word and just allowing that product to
blend into the blue that we've already
put down this waterproof liner really
shines is when it's on your waterline
because it does really last well so I'm
just going to take a little bit more of
that gently pull down on my lower lash
line and just really quickly and easily
apply that right there and if you have
any sort of gap like if you notice that
being kind of light like you can see
right there there's a light between the
waterline and the natural lash line this
is a great way to kind of just fill that
in and just kind of smudge on top of
there until it's all totally filled in
using a liner brush I'm going to go back
to the blue shade here in the creative
me palette and just using an angled
liner brush on that jumbo pencil where
I'm when we first went under here it's
very creamy so I just want to make sure
I've got some powder on top of that to
set it I get lots of questions about
lower eyeliner and why it doesn't last
and that's because you know cream based
products are just going to tend to break
down a little bit throughout the day and
can pull downward but if you set it with
powder you're going to have a much
better shot at that lasting for you
another thing you might want to do at
this point is kind of take a final look
at your eye here and if you want to add
any more blue you can make this outer V
as dramatic and big as you want what I
notice is the more product you have on
your brush keep in mind where your first
placing that because that will be the
most intense so like I just had dipped
it in and I put it right here at the
outer corner where I wanted the most
color and then as you buff out you know
it starts to look a little more gray
smokey you know that smoky just dark
effect so it's kind of a common sense
thing but sometimes you do really need
to pay attention where the first spot on
your eye you place your brush right
after you load it up with powder because
sometimes you know you can run into some
problems there with getting it looking
blended and everything so now that I've
got the application I want just going to
take a fluffy brush really buff over all
of that um check out your orange and if
you feel like you need more I feel like
we kept it pretty clean we didn't do a
lot of overlapping there so I'm going to
keep that as is and take a light color
for this it's going to be my NYX single
in aloha which is just a really light
kind of shimmery shade and that's going
to be what I just place right up here
under the high part of my brow and just
kind of blend that right over the border
with the blue for my mascara I'm going
to use my L'Oreal voluminous carbon
black on the upper lash line just to
give a lot of volume and a lot of
darkness because the navy blue is pretty
dark in this look this is one of the
smokier looks that I've done for game
day so I want the lashes to be able to
kind of compete with that and really
stand out and then on the bottom lash
line i'm using maybelline lash discovery
a really tiny brush that's able to make
you look like you've got a lot of lashes
there just because it highlights
everyone so i'll put that on and I'll
join you let you know what's on my lips
all right guys here is the finished look
on my game day tutorial I hope you
enjoyed it it was a lot of fun to do but
it kind of challenged me at the same
time to try to work in a bright color
like orange while working with darker
shades to last week's with Tennessee was
just this big wash of orange it was
really well blended I thought but um
this was kind of a you know one more
challenge to add to the mix but just
keep in mind that you can always take
your school's colors and kind of sub
them in for what I did if you like the
pattern if you like the concept behind
it and really switch it up and make it
your own kind of look um on my lips I
just kind of found it I thought it was
fitting to use just a really light lip
with this look because there's so much
going on in the eye area so what I first
did was I took my mac lipstick in myth
which is just a really good lipstick to
use to sort of erase any natural color
in your lip and make it really nude but
at the same time I didn't want to be
quite that washed out so I took my NYC
lip liner pencil and naughty nude which
is just a little bit darker and I just
kind of um you know went around it right
at the top and on the sides just kind of
giving it a little more dimension so it
didn't look like just one flat color so
just kind of work that around the border
and blended it in and then for just a
little shine I used my NARS lip gloss in
Greek holiday which is just a really
really kind of had some shimmer to it
but a really light kind of peachy gold
and that's basically how the look comes
together you know go through your
typical foundation routine just make
sure you use some bronzer and a little
bit of a like a dart peach contour the
covergirl cheekers blush and golden pink
was really good for I think kind of
pulling this look together because it
had that kind of warm peachy tone and
then like a coral blush like the Milani
minerals in might I would be a really
good choice for that kind of on the
apples of your cheeks to give your face
a little more color with that nude lip
but I hope you enjoyed it again thanks
so much and remember you can vote on
