game day makeup tutorials this is a
pretty fierce look I'm gonna warn you
right now this is the game day tutorial
inspired by Florida State
the colors are gold and maroon could we
have gotten a better look for fall I
mean and that was kind of what I was
thinking about here so really this is
inspired by sports really in colors only
because I've made this a very what I
feel it's glamorous look feel free to
break the rules with me on this one I
mean I went dramatic on the eyes
dramatic on the lips you know throughout
the shimmery bronzers and went with I
didn't actually throw them out guys you
know I just didn't use them this time
around and I went with a pretty matte
face look for this so really some some
big changes here I will take you through
step by step how to get this look so key
step 1 with this gameday look I'm taking
my Mac Paint Pot in rubenesque which
gives you it's it looks kind of like a
peachy gold color give us a really nice
golden glow and put that a generous
amount of this all over the taking this
NYX trio and it the shade is golden rust
and walnut bronze that's the name of
each of these three shades actually so
with golden first I'm just gonna use the
sponge tip applicator that comes with
this palette get in the gold shade and
basically start dabbing that all over
the inner half of the eyelid here all
over the lid and also kind of up above
and into that crease area to also get
some of that gold around the inner
corner and just kind of take it down a
little bit below the inner part of the
eye these are kind of small sponge tip
applicator so they're really good for
getting in these small places if you
don't have a small detail brush then
we're going to go to the center shade
which is rust which is really really
pretty it's kind of like Mac's cranberry
so I'm going to use another side of the
sponge tip and we're going to cover the
other half of our lid so it really helps
to look down into a mirror if you're not
used to doing
a lot of shadow work on your lids
because it exposes that whole area so
you can really see what you're doing so
I'm getting that all over that half and
then like I did with the other shade it
doesn't have to be perfect at this point
because it is going to be blended out
but you can see I'm taking it up higher
and out like that just a little bit next
I'm taking my Smashbox number 15 brush
it's just kind of a fat crease brush
going in with a little more rust and
this time we're really going to
concentrate on not just laying a lot of
product down but blending it out I'm
kind of like kind of try to overlap a
little bit with the gold but not too
much we don't want a total blend of the
two colors we still want them to be
separate so this is sort of the look
we're going for clean off your brush and
then go back to the gold and top that
side off just to maintain its brightness
I'm going to take a flat eyeshadow brush
this is my ELF shadow brush and I'm
using this shade from wet-and-wild
called brulee and it is a matte just
creamy not total white kind of an
off-white shade and I'm going to pick up
some of that shade and get it all up
right under the eyelid so really the
only shimmery aspects of this look are
the true gameday colors which are gold
and maroon so it's really keeping the
focus on that portion of the eye look
next using a small smudge type brush
this is my number 33 from Smashbox I'm
going into the rest shade again again
that's that reddish shade in the center
of this palette and I'm kind of just
blending the red down and under the
outer part here under the we're gonna go
in with a black shade and this step I
kind of just did by accident on the
other eye but I really liked how it
turned out it's like this kind of angle
like this sort of triangular slice
coming right in there on that corner of
the eye so it's really not too hard to
do what I'm first gonna do is just get
some black in that area with a typical
crease type brush and then which is kind
of what I did at first and then I
noticed that the shape was taking on
kind of this triangular look and I just
defined it more with a shadow brush so
I'll take you through that real quick
using Mac's carbon just a true black
shade Matt because we want to have a
little contrast with all the shimmer
we've got going on remember the only
shimmery shades in this look and really
on the entire face are the gold and the
maroon that create the eye look so we're
not going all the way in don't go more
than half way in and just start building
a little bit of that black right here in
the crease just kind of like you're
making a straight line right here okay
and then pull that line down just a
little bit like he's gonna touch the
corner of your eye okay so I'm just
going down like that next up I would
advise you to use an angle liner brush
going back to the matte carbon really
get a lot of that product on the brush
and now what we're going to do is go to
the go to the crease right here lay the
product down draw a line do the same
thing on the lower part it's like you're
cutting across a portion of your lid
right there okay and we want it
basically you want the black to be
pretty concentrated throughout but most
dark definitely in the areas that are
right up here towards the top of that
triangle next up because we don't want a
big harsh angle you can see that this is
pretty blended toward the top of that
so take some rust the reddish shade on
your brush and just overlap that part a
little bit you're gonna get not only
more red but you're going to get the
black blended a bit then take that same
brush this is again my kind of medium
sized crease brush from Smashbox taking
it just slightly under like I said keep
a little more blended there we're gonna
do a similar liner and I'm going to be
using a really soft liner for this look
it's gonna be used on both the inner rim
and the upper lash line and it's the
pencil perfect from L'Oreal one of the
softest creamiest liners but it is
something you want to make sure you top
off with a powder so we will definitely
be doing that but not on the waterline
here I'm just gonna line the waterline
and just gently pull down you'll see
this comes off with a really rich black
color go all the way in and all the way
we're not doing any sort of wing or
anything on the upper lash line I'm just
get it really close to the lash line
just your natural lash line so I'm going
I just kind of started in the middle
here for some odd reason but going right
there to the corner and get it all the
way to the inner corner as well keep it
as thin and as close to your lash line
as possible
and then we smudge okay so it wasn't a
line major smudge smudging but we just
softened it a bit bring back matte
carbon bringing back the angle liner
brush and just top off that liner with
the powder shadow there and again with
the matte carbon on the liner brush
we're going to go just this is going to
be the only liner we put on the natural
lash line so basically think about
smudging this in between your lashes and
it's gonna be a nice kind of almost a
little bit smoky look there because we
went from dark dark waterline now to a
little bit of a smudged out lashline now
looking back on your shadow if there's
anywhere you want to buff out more feel
free to just take a fluffy bear brush
and go over that another way to kind of
clean up your look I mean you can
obviously take like a damp q-tip and
kind of run it across here for the
straighter line but what I just did
I took like a light pressed powder like
my Maybelline mineral power which has a
lovely crack in it there concealer brush
and just I just kind of went over it
right under it and you just kind of get
that nice cleaned up
line there I'm going to curl my lashes
apply the voluminous carbon black on the
upper lashes and the Maybelline lash
discovery on the bottom and I'll join
you with the finished look
alright guys here is the finished look I
hope you enjoy this gameday inspired
makeup tutorial it's inspired by Florida
State the colors are maroon and gold and
so I really had a fun time playing with
those shades on the eyes with the
thought that you know this could be a
fun fall I look as well what's
interesting is that the only shimmery
products I'm wearing are actually the
two gameday colors which are gold and
maroon on my eyes and the face is really
matte and so are the lips actually I
struggled a lot finding a lip shade that
was deep but didn't have hints of like a
purplish undertone or like a berry look
to them so what I ended up doing
actually is I used some Vaseline and so
I got some of that on my lips and then I
just kind of went in with my finger and
used rust out of this palette so I
really made sure I got the tone that
sort of went along with the tone of the
eye and it really kept the whole look
kind of cohesive in that way as far as
my face makeup I will list all this
under dailybooth but just to give you an
idea it's all matte I use no shimmer
really at all there may be a hint of
shimmer and the blush but overall a very
matte look I use the Maybelline Dream
matte mousse as my foundation I used a
matte powder on top of that I did do a
fairly heavy contour here but again go
to my dailybooth page for all that
additional info on the face stuff and
