tutorial the focus is on Michigan the
pool was another big ten matchup it was
iowa vs michigan iowa black and yellow
michigan is maize and blue maze yell is
what they call their yellow there in
michigan in case you're not up to speed
on their colors but michigan won so
that's the look i'm going to do today
i'm basically taking a really matte look
and just throwing in a little bit of
some shimmery smokiness in with some of
the outer V action there so it's really
not a hard look to recreate I had fun
using the pop of yellow with this look
and I think it really brightens up the
eyes as well and if you were interested
in seeing the Iowa look which would be
black and yellow you can definitely
instead of using blue for some of these
look so you could use a matte black
let's see how to get this look keep on
watching I just primed my eyelid I use
my Urban Decay primer potion any primer
you like to use will work then I'm
grabbing my creative me number one
palette and we're going to this really
most saturated yellow shade right here
and these are all really nice matte
colorful shades so if I need you know a
look where the color is really bold i
think this palette works great so i'm
taking my ELF I shadow brush and I'm
just going to look down into my mirror
and Pat this yellow shade right here on
the inner corner taking it just up
slightly into the crease just the inner
part there as you can see and then using
that same brush if you're comfortable
with this otherwise you could use a
q-tip or a smaller brush I'm getting
some color right on the tip and then
just taking it right underneath about
the same amount so about halfway under
there is I'm taking a different flat
brush this one's from Sonia Kashuk and
we're going to kind of go between two of
these different blue shades that we have
right down here in the bottom corner one
is more of a true it's coming off just a
little bit turquoise I feel like on
camera but this is just kind of like a
slightly lighter blue and then this true
um just almost a navy blue actually so
I'm taking the lighter of the two and
I'm going to put that
down on the outer part of my lid here so
we're just really getting you know that
primary color type look here with the
yellow and then the blue and then I'm
just going I'm just lightly taking that
up up to the crease and as you can see
I'm not really buffing heavily between
these two shades I mean you might
overlap it just a little bit but don't
do that much because we want as much of
the color of these shades stand out as
possible alrighty then I'm kind of like
working that into a little bit of an
outer V shape just by instead of turning
my brush like this where I was packing
it on turning a little bit out that way
and just using it to shape that area
there then I'm going to overlap that
with the darker of the two blue shades
and this is going to be really pretty
and I'm kind of concentrating that a
little bit more on the lower part and
then using this brush using that same
technique I used on the other side
taking that blue shade just under the
lower lash line using brushes like this
as opposed to a liner brush gives you
just you know a sort of a thicker swath
of color and a less precise placement of
color but it still looks really pretty
now that you've gotten the blue place
there about where you want to take a
fluffy brush and a light somewhat
shimmery shade i'm using a shade from
NYX called my favorite color and just
has a little sparkle to it and I'm just
adding that up just under my eyebrow
then after using all this Matt stuff I'm
going to take a darker shade that
actually has a little bit of sparkle to
it and it's like a dark dark navy almost
blind to shade from hourglass cosmetics
and this duo called it's called prism
and this is the shade i'm using it's
like a dark dark black blue with a
bluish sparkle to it any you know
shimmery navy shade that you might have
in your collection would
with this so I'm taking a small priests
fresh getting a little bit of that dark
shade on there and a little bit of this
color is going to go a long way but
we're going to start working that into
the crease starting basically where we
began with the blue on the border with
the yellow and then just working it
outward and a little bit upward as well
and you know I'm just working trying to
work really carefully with this because
I don't want it to muddy up the blue too
much but I do want to give it that
deeper you know almost like like it's
just kind of smoking out there thinks if
you want to bring bank any of that
bluish intensity you know just take this
is that my sort of medium-sized crease
brush from Smashbox and it's just nice
for kind of applying color just where
you want it I'm just sort of overlapping
that again just to make sure it still
appears you know the amount of blue that
I want we just want it to look a little
smokier on our liner on using my L'Oreal
pencil perfect a really soft black a
creamy liner and I'm going to be lining
my waterline with that I'm trying a new
product it's the maybelline eyestudio
cream liner in blackest black and I'm
just taking that really close to my lash
line I'm just going to use the little
brush that they give you and going to
start right here on the inner corner
when I get to the end I'm just kind of
winging it out just a little bit just
kind of taking it up and out and once i
blend it out I'm just pulling it
downward just down just under the outer
part of the lower lashes I'm going to
curl my lashes and I'm also trying out
the lash blast fusion mascara so i will
put that on and join you with the
finished look
alright guys here's the finished look I
hope you enjoyed this that definitely
pulls together Michigan's colors in a
little bit different way using some
really bright net colors so if you don't
have access to these you know if you
have something close to obviously don't
infuse the exact same products I used
but on my lips I just went with a really
soft nude lip to put all the focus on
the eyes for this look I say soft nude
and that's actually the shade I used
it's the revlon colorburst lipstick in
soft nude that's the only thing I have
on my lips and I just kind of like the
look this way so thank you guys so much
for watching and for watching all these
gameday tutorials they've been a lot of
fun to do it comes down to the national
championship maybe some of these bowl
games I may bring it back for a little
while but for now I'm going to be
working in some other kinds of tutorials
so it's been a super fun series thanks

day
