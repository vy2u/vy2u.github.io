me for this game day tutorial I'm so
sorry it's a day late but I've been
traveling over the weekend visiting the
twins Tyler sisters we had a great time
for Michigan State and Michigan State
was up against Wisconsin in this week's
game day poll so to Big Ten teams
Wisconsin's red and white Michigan State
is green and white I'd have figured
since i already had a red and white look
that you guys might pick michigan state
for this but i had a lot of fun with
this look I've used um the Maybelline
stylish smokes palette in Emerald smokes
which I've had a lot of questions about
to get this look with the interesting
liner there at the end so I don't know
if this is something you would do for
every day but definitely appropriate for
the game day a style of look I think so
if you want to see how I did it just
keep on Lars I applied my shadow works
primer from Coastal Scents it actually
has a little bit of Sheen and shimmer to
it as you can see there on my left eye
and then I'm going to take one of these
double-ended Coastal Scents pencils
which have been so useful to me for
these gameday tutorials because they
come in so many colors so I've really
been able to coordinate with the shades
I needed and get a nice shadow base and
kind of switch it up with the whole line
or look with these different tutorials
so there is one that is two shades of
green I wish he's had names but they
don't but then this one well actually
they do have names they're just not
written on the pencil itself but one
shade is a light kind of metallic green
and then there's a dark green and from
Michigan State we're going to be using
the darker green and some people had
said they wanted to see this as like an
olive tutorial and I kind of think
that's what it turns out to be very all
of the green great for fall type
tutorial um so what we're going to do
with this shade is just take it all over
our eyelid basically and we're not only
getting a color base here but we're also
going to be able to do some liner type
tricks with this as well so first off
just get it all over you right up to my
crease and then I'm like drawing it
straight out and creating a wing there
it's important that the wing that you
create does not go down to
far so like I'm going from my crease
right here and going straight out and
then I'm going straight out from not
quite the corner of my eye but just a
little above that like right here and
then going right out basically we want
to rim the eye in this green shade so
just go all the way under once you start
to reach the end here we're going to
also we're going to leave a gap
basically and just draw a line straight
out underneath just like that it's going
to look a little muddy right now and not
quite as defined as this side but it'll
get there so I am taking my emerald
smokes palette from abling lots of
people wanted to see this palette used
for a tutorial so I'm going to be using
the shade that's labeled crease it's the
brightest green and the look and just
using my ELF I shadow brush I'm going to
take that and top off everything we did
there with the pencil so all over the
lid and also on to that area with the
wing I think it's very important to top
of these cream products with something
that is powder and it also just the
shade of this pretty shadow really makes
it all pop I'm going to go in with a
medium sized crease brush this is the
larger of the two that comes in the
essence of beauty crease brush set and
there's a shade here that says lid and
it's compared to the one we just use you
can see it's got a little more than all
of the neutral tone to it but we're
going to take that and blend it right
above the brighter green here and you're
going to notice more vain neutral
transition up here that I think it's
kind of pretty next we're going to go to
the darkest degree in this palette pneus
right here and you can see it's really
pretty it's very deep and it has some
green shimmer in it so it's kind of a
unique color and i'm taking my smaller
crease brush that came in that duo i
just mentioned and i'm going to work
that just into the crease a little bit
here just to add a little more contrast
kind of blending it with the olive a
little bit to it just creates a nice
kind of fade effect from the bright
green
now Michigan State's colors are green
and white and so I am choosing to use a
different shade outside of this palette
because if you look there the lightest
shade and then this shade this one
actually has a little bit of a yellow
tone I mean if you didn't care about
being exactly on point with this
tutorial then you could use that because
it's a really nice shadow but I'm just
trying to keep it you know the contrast
going with white so I'm taking shroom
from Mac that's the shade right here
taking a fluffy brush and just applying
that all the way up under the eyebrow
and then we're going to do some fun
things with it taking a liner brush get
some of shroom on there and we're going
to take that and fill in our little gap
we left right here okay just like so
it's very easy as long as you've left
over the cleaner the gap is you know the
the less product that got in there the
easier it's going to be to make it white
but this white is so pigmented and so
shimmery you can really get that look
easily then I'm going to take or just
going to use this shade in a few more
key areas right below the lower wing
just like that to give it a little more
contrast and then I'm going to use a
small detail brush and you can use a
q-tip you can use any small brush you
have using shroom again with this little
brush just going right around here to
kind of make those inner corners look
almost glossy with their whiteness next
time wanting my little edges here to
look even more extreme so going back to
the darkest shade here in the palette
and this is the time i would do this is
after you've got the white there and you
can really get an edge on this so you're
taking your angle brush start right at
the corner and we're not worth focusing
on the upper wing just draw that out
with the darkest shade you'll recall it
was the brighter green that we first
went over that list so when you put the
darker there it's just going to have
even more of a contrast with the white
and just kind of
it out I just kind of blending it out
like it just fading up into nothing I
can do the same thing on the top part of
the lower one you know just giving it a
little bit deeper green one final
finishing touch we're going to line our
lower inner rim with white eyeliner
going to brighten up the eyes a lot then
I'm going to take a liquid pen liner
this is the felt tip I definer marker
from physicians formula as you can see
I'm ending the liner right here nothing
fancy with it just going straight from
inner to outer end then I'm going to
curl my lashes apply some voluminous
carbon black on the upper and just a
little bit of the last discovery from
Maybelline on the lower lashes and then
I'll join you with the finished look
hey everyone here's the finished look I
hope you liked it a lot i really i went
really simple on my hair by the way just
stuck a bobby pin in there it's so windy
outside here i just had to do something
to keep it under control but this is a
really fun look to do if you're looking
for something new to do with your liner
besides just winging it out or besides
doing a typical outer V I think it adds
a lot of interest to the look I think it
is the epitome of like a game-day look
because it's a little more dramatic a
little more eye-catching and I thought
the greens and olives and the stuff in
the Maybelline palette were really super
fun to work with hopefully this gives
you some ideas for this palette because
I've been getting lots of questions and
on my lips I kind of like the idea of
greens and pinks and so I thought it
would be fun because you've got this
really kind of extreme you know I think
of it almost like a superhero type I
look going on I thought it would be fun
to do the the lips very kind of light
and feminine looking so what i did i use
my revlon super lustrous lipstick this
shade is called pink in the afternoon it
is just a creamy pink yeah there's no
shimmer to it just a creamy pink
lipstick and then over the top of that
just for a little shine and this gives
you a lipstick gives you some shine but
I use this Sally girl lip gloss and
splurge which is just a super duper
light shimmery pink and I'm really happy
with the way it turned out I mean you
top this off with a pink blush I used
actually a sample Lancome blush that I
had this is called shear all morose and
it's just you know any kind of pinky
tone blush I think will be perfect to
tie the whole look together so thanks
for tuning in guys I hope you enjoyed
the tutorial and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
