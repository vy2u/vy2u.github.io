me for this gameday tutorial this look
is inspired by the University of
Tennessee that was the one that you guys
voted for the last poll on my blog was
between University of Tennessee orange
and white so that's what this is versus
Oregon which was green and golden it was
close this time I really had to wait
down to the wire you know to see what
the result was going to be but I did a
look and my idea with these tutorials is
really to make them something that you
could feel comfortable wearing out of
the house you know team colors or bright
colors and so you could go really really
super dramatic but I chose to make it
something that I feel like you know
whether you're going to a game or doing
something else this can apply to you as
well so I used some matte colors I used
the Coastal Scents 42 double stack matte
palette for this look so and also please
keep in mind that to vote on next week's
gameday poll just go to beauty broadcast
net there's a link below and you can
decide which teams which colors will
inspire next week's tutorials so to see
how this one worked out keep on watching
alright let's get started this is
actually yesterday when I first did this
tutorial none of the part where I was
actually doing the you know work on the
I actually recorded so this is the next
day so I'm just kind of doing up this I
to redo it for you but you can kind of
obviously it's gonna be the exact same
thing I did yesterday but so anyway I'm
gonna start off by taking my NYX jumbo
eye shadow pencil and cottage cheese and
this is a really shimmery white shade
and so I'm just going to go kind of all
over the inner part of my lid here you
can see how bright and shiny it looks
and then kind of circle around the tear
duct area just like that you kind of
want that look of it you know just a
really glassy look right there in the
inner corner and after you do that it's
very important I think to kind of Pat
over that just to make sure you don't
have too much product there that's gonna
make it wear longer and um make sure you
don't have any creasing so very
important tip there and then I'm gonna
take my double stack matte palette from
Coastal Scents these are some of the
brightest colors I own right here that
and the creative me palette but you can
see there's lots going on there but I'm
gonna be using the white just to top
this off top off the shimmer and it's
still going to kind of have like that
shimmery or really bright appearance
just because we are going over it with
white but that's just to kind of stay
and power thing that I'm doing in the
palette I'm gonna go for this peachy
orange right here so it's not quite as
bright as one of the next colors I'm
going to be using but it still is very
um very bold for what it is and being a
matte shade I just feel like the color
comes through so well my last couple
looks have been really shimmery and so I
wanted to do something that really would
give us something matte or at least
partially mint so there we go just
getting that all-over packing it on the
outer part of the lid and then I would
say take a larger brush and we're
actually going to get this orange all
the way in the crease and all the way up
to the eyebrow
so look down and kind of expose that
part of the eye for yourself and you can
see I'm getting that base color all in
the crease and I am taking that all the
way up to my eyebrow next comes the
brightness we're going to this orange
here you can see just for contrast this
is the orange we're using now this was
the other one we use so there's quite a
difference there in how bold this one is
and so I'm gonna do a little overlapping
with this get some on your elf eyeshadow
brush or any flat brush you like to use
I'm laying this down kind of on the
outer part of my lid once again just Pat
it on these are bright pigmented colors
and I don't really want it flying all
over my face so do that and then kind of
get it towards the tip and we're going
to go over the crease with that it's all
about layering with this look to really
make it look smooth and just like there
are no kind of there's there's no
division between the shades we're
putting on next get some of that orange
on an even smaller brush because we
really want to concentrate it in the
crease this is sort of a different
method because it's not you know a dark
crease shade but if you do pack it on a
little more it has more intensity just
depending on the brush you use so yeah
I'm just taking my fine crease brush
essence of beauty and just getting that
in there just a little bit deeper than
it was next we want to continue with our
sort of strategic pops of light with
this look we've got one here and I want
to do another under the highest part of
my arch here so I'm taking that pencil
and laying down some shine right under
the like here's my arch and then right
there so it's kind of like we've got it
here and here it's kind of like drawing
your attention all the way across the
eye so get a little bit of that on there
and of course blot it just a little
blotting is always good with cream
products and then clean off your you
know your shadow brush or whichever
brush you are using dip it in the white
again and
then you'll really notice a pop next I'm
going to line my upper lashline but I do
want to keep it very thin because I want
all the emphases on this color and I
really just want some definition now so
I'm using my Physicians Formula it's the
eye definer felt-tip eye marker in black
and just getting it really close to the
lash line starting at the inner corner
and we're just going to take it all the
way up click it to the outside we're not
doing a major wing but I am thickening
the line slightly and I'm just going to
extend it out just a little bit there
that way when I go to do my lower liner
I have something to sort of attach to
that's why I like to generally extend
the the upper line grab a creamy black
eyeliner for me I'm gonna use my
maybelline define a line and I was in
actually in the store looking for some
more of this the other day and I noticed
apparently since I first got this one
it's been repackaged and these are all
like the in the bright green looking
packaging so just so you know if you see
this and you're like what is she using
they do still sell it it's just it just
looks different so I'm going to gently
gently pull down on my lower lash line
and get some black in here just land as
we mentioned here we want to give it a
nice finished end to the look and so
just use the amount that you feel you
need to kind of hook that in and make
this all look blended step you want to
go ahead and take a liner brush and see
where I've kind of taken some orange and
just kind of dotted that basically under
the lower lash line don't get too close
to your right area you want that to
still really pop and kind of look over
the look see if there's anything you
want to add to it before you put your
mascara on otherwise you have powder
falling on top of fresh mascara and that
just takes away from the blackness of it
so I'm going to take a couple of
mascaras for this look I'm going to be
using my almay intense eye color mascara
in black which has a really big brush
gives a lot of thickness and then on the
lower lashes pretty much the mascara I
always like to use there's the main
define a lot not the final line lash
discovery really gives a lot of length
and definition without making these that
it never gets clumpy so I want a little
more length on the lower lashes for this
look so I'm gonna put that on curl the
lashes also before I do that and stay
tuned for the finish guys here is my
finished gameday look inspired by the
University of Tennessee the volunteers
sorry about all the weird glares gonna
hit them from my window making me look
really like patchy and strange but I
really had fun with this look and it's
something I've never done before really
taking a color taking it all the way up
to my eyebrows some of us have more
space here than others I tend to have a
lot of space between my eye and my
eyebrow but it was fun using the color
in that way and on my lips I went for
something that just kind of gave that
golden e bronzy sort of glow and so I
made my lips sort of nude first I used
Mac Smith which is just a really nude
lipstick and so any nude like that will
do anything that kind of erases a color
even concealer and then I use dribbles
vinyl bronze lip lip gloss and bronze
ambition and it just gives this nude
bronze kind of look on all over my face
you know I kept it really just kind of
fresh and light I actually didn't use
foundation I used my Aveeno positively
radiant tinted moisturizer and I'll have
a list of all the different products I
use for this look on my dailybooth page
link to that down below in the bottom
bar and I hope you enjoyed this look
have a great rest of the weekend and
thanks so much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
