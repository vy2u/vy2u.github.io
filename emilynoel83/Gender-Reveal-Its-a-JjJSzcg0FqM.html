oh yeah we redid that one this time
would you like to know if it's a boy or
a girl
we thought it would be fun to look at
some of the old wives tales
that tons of you have been talking about
this whole time and see exactly what
they pointed to first otherwise tails if
your baby's heartbeat is above 140
that's a girl we read about what 169
would be fun craving sweet that's for
girl salty mostly salty I would say I
would agree if you have morning sickness
it's a girl if you don't if you are
moody it's a girl if you're happy it's a
boy I've been happy have been happy you
can honestly confirm that okay it was
soft as a girl if it's dry too boy I
have actually battled dry skin majorly
for the first time in my life so yep if
you sleep on the right side it's a girl
left side boy you'd have headaches it's
a boy if you don't it's a girl I
actually have had so what do we think
judging by that it's wave everyone on
board and of course you don't really
know something until you find out what
people think on Facebook and Twitter
right right so we ask that these numbers
are just from about I don't know 12
hours a decent sample size underneath 32
votes for boy 127 for girl and that was
what people thought it was what they
thought 720 and it was also kind of
funny because people some people gave
specific reasons to to back this up
actually 31 people cited gut feeling
senses dreams or visions of their answer
and 19 people judged the morning
sickness because I'd said I hadn't been
sick and then six people specifically
said they thought it was gonna be a boy
but they were hoping for a girl I
personally had a dream that it was a
girl so that would have been one time I
also had several dreams it was a girl
after all this research all this
in-depth analysis we actually found this
out quite a bit earlier than we were
expecting to but we're going to talk
about that a little bit in a vlog and
believe tell that whole story how we
found out yeah over on Beauty blog cast
so join us there in the coming days but
thank you guys so much for watching
we're so excited and thanks for voting
to telling us all your answers even
though most of you world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
