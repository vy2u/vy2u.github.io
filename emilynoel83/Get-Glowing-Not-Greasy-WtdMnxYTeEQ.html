do I get the lowing skin I want to get a
dewy look but I already have oily skin
and so this video is going to share with
you how to get a glow without getting
greasy because I think that's a fine
line that we all try to walk especially
this time of year when you want to look
really radiant you're showing more skin
share a few products that I think are
key to getting that look and the first
thing I do want to mention is your
moisturizer is the moisturizer you're
using too heavy for you and should you
start thinking about switching that up
as the weather turns warmer and there's
more humidity in the air and things like
that so just really what your skin care
routine this time of year and think
about am I using something oil-free
should I use something oil-free there
are lots of options out there but that's
really a case-by-case basis so when it
comes to makeup I think you know whether
you use foundation or a tinted
moisturizer I think it is important to
set those things with a powder consider
using a matte bronzer I think it's kind
of about getting a matte canvas and then
you know getting a little bit dolled up
with the glowy products so one matte
powder that I think is great and it
works performs a lot for me like Mac
blot powder and it's the elf translucent
mattifying powder so that's great works
for all skin tones and you can just kind
of lightly put it on with a brush maybe
just focus it over your oily areas which
might be your t-zone and then I like
using matte bronzers number one I think
they look really natural they're great
if you want to contour and also you keep
from getting from overloading shimmer on
top of shimmer on top of shimmer say
your blush is shimmery and then your
highlighted shimmer and you've already
put on shimmery bronzer you know too
much so a good you know layer that you
can do might be to go with a matte
bronzer and here's one once from Rimmel
and it's called sunlight I've used this
one a lot it's a lot like NYC sunny
which is great and for medium to deeper
skin tones
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer is a
nice deep matte bronze you can use
shimmery bronzers as well this is just
sort of an idea that works in the scheme
of what I'm talking about for this video
blushes you might think I don't want to
wear a cream blush because I get oily
and I don't want to look greasy but
there are a lot of cream blushes out
there that don't have any shimmer to
them they can actually really give you a
nice natural glow
without adding any additional shine to
them so look for those cream blushes
that don't have shimmer if that's a
concern of yours like this is a blush
apple cream stick from New York color
cliche does applause a pink they have
several great shades but I mean this is
just a straight-up creamy product and it
looks great on a lot of skin tones you
just kind of blend that into your cheeks
and it's amazing the pretty glow you can
get so there's an option another thing
for blush is to maybe switch up to a
lighter and brighter blush than what
you've been using so this one that I
have for example it looks really bright
I know I've talked about this before but
it's the elf studio blush and pink
passion it is a really bright color but
I have that on today and I feel like it
is matte so you can find matte brighter
colors and it can give your cheeks that
pop without making you look like you
know you have dewy moist or oil possibly
oily greasy skin so wear your highlight
is concerned that can be really
difficult because highlights by nature
are often pretty shimmery so you kind of
got to seek out the ones that just
aren't too overboard shimmery one that I
love for that specific reason I think
it's very unique is from lorac and it's
called perfectly lit and the shade is
spotlight and to look at this you might
just think it was even a regular powder
but really it does have just the
slightest bit of a reflective quality
and you can see it there on my finger
and you can take these highlights and
you can put them on the Cupid's bow and
you can use a q-tip and get them around
the corner of your eye and put them on
top of your cheekbones and these will
serve you well because they will give
you a glow without getting greasy and
then probably the next closest thing to
that because some people have said
what's a low cost option for that and
something that's kind of similar from
the drugstore still a little on the high
end of the drugstore but it's physicians
for
and it's the happy booster just the
regular I think this is a translucent
face powder but these shades all kind of
blend together to be somewhat similar to
what this one is it's not too terribly
shimmery and you can also you know zero
in on certain ones if you just want to
use the lightest shade to highlight so
what do you do with your lips I love
really glossy lip glosses but sometimes
when you've got a lot of glow going on
on your face and then you slap on a
really wet looking lip gloss it can just
make the whole look a little too greasy
you know and so go for those creamy
lipsticks that give you a hint of shine
for example right now I've got kind of a
subtle shine going on and all I have on
is Rimmel lipstick in spotlight beige
it's a nice neutral it gives to your
lips moisture it hydrates them it gives
them a little shine without going
overboard
another couple good ideas for like
tinted lip balms
I like the covergirl nature luxe I have
this one in sandstone and it's really
pretty it's kind of a nice sort of
quarterly peachy neutral and then you
all know that i love the Palladio herbal
tinted lip balms these are all great
they're very creamy and they'll give you
moisture hydrated looking lips without
too much those are my tips for getting a
non-greasy summer glow I hope these tips
help you throughout the season thank you
so much for watching and have a great
day
hey oh I can't talk I keep like feeling
like there's food like I shouldn't have
just eaten and then sat down to do this
your skin tended okay why did I just do
