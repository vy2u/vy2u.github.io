and we are doing it drugstore style
today so it's 100% drugstore including
the brushes actually the brushes are I'm
gonna be using a lot of Real Techniques
brushes those are from Ulta still lower
price than you know a lot of brushes
high-end brushes that are out there so
update our heat had been out for a while
because well obviously it stopped
working and now it's working again and
I'm so pumped for that it is super
comfortable in here programmable
thermostat come in and huge I gotta say
love it I already put on a little bit of
moisturizer but I'm using this Rimmel BB
cream nine and one skin perfecting super
makeup and I've used this a few times
before and it actually has some coverage
to it it feels more like a you know
a makeup than some of the other BB
creams I think so I'm just gonna put
that on all over
so I had a little you know Super Bowl
fun times on Sunday yeah Super Bowl
Sunday and made this dip that I guess is
extremely common involving Velveeta
cheese and Rotel like the pan of like
tomatoes and and peppers kind of spicy
you know you mix it in I like put it in
the crock-pot for a couple hours and
you've got this wonderful like cheesy
queso dip or you could just buy a jar of
the Tostitos Brannan's probably
basically the same thing but anyway I
made that and of course it was way way
more than anyone could finish and I
asked on my blog the other day you die
do with all that leftover queso that I
made and somebody johnny-on-the-spot
probably within five minutes of me
posting that blog it was like give me
like a full recipe like water it down
with a little bit of milk and mix it
with some pasta add in some chicken and
some mushrooms and peppers and put it in
the oven for 350 for however long I'm
like wow this is such a good idea
rounded up some some pasta that I had on
hand and I didn't have all the other you
know ingredients she mentioned but I
missed it up in it like I made it into a
great kind of spicy mac and cheese so if
you're sitting around with some leftover
queso that you made that lady had a
really great idea
so I would normally set my under eye
with the bareMinerals bisque but I had
this elf HD under eye setting powder and
I haven't used it a whole lot because
when I first opened it up I was like oh
there's little bits of glitter in it and
I'm like I do I really want that under
my eye but I'm not really seeing it as I
after I apply it now I don't know it
just looks it looks kind of mattified as
opposed
ever think about the faces you make when
you do makeup you know like back and I'm
like wow I make some funny faces you
know when I put on mascara or I'm
putting on powder or something and it's
funny that then I'm like you know what
everybody else at home is making those
faces too so no big deal
somebody on Twitter was just talking
about karaoke and it reminded me a few
weeks ago actually maybe just a couple
weeks ago I went to Nashville with Tyler
and we met up with our friends Kayleigh
and Jonathan there I really wanted to go
to this karaoke place and Kaleigh sings
like all the time we go to this place
and everybody who's getting up singing
it's like amazing you know
probably a lot of people just trying to
like start their career in Nashville so
I'm you know thoroughly enjoying sitting
there watching all of this and then
Kaylee's like you should get up and sing
with me and keep in mind I sing but the
only people who hear me might be like
Tyler and cupcake you know I consider
her a person of course but like I sing
in the shower I sing around the house
I've never sang publicly and I'm
thinking the first time I do karaoke is
not gonna be in Nashville it's gonna be
you know it's some podunk place where
everybody's got you know a decent amount
of drinks in them and nobody sounds real
good that's that that's the scenario I
want to do my first karaoke you know I
mean I think I did do something like it
was my bachelorette party and you know a
bunch of us god I've been saying but you
know you couldn't really hear anybody
and there was like a whole big bunch of
us there
you ever start doing an eye look and all
of a sudden you're like well this is
shaping up to be more dramatic than I
anticipated that happens to me a lot I
mean I think a lot of people think maybe
you know you plan everything you're
gonna do and in a tutorial you know a
typical tutorial video I obviously have
a vision for where I'm going with that
particularly but today I mean I'm just
grabbing colors and putting them all it
uses palette a whole lot or these
brushes so I'm kind of just you know
seeing where this is all going
so I'm here at my desk and I have my you
know makeup mirror over here and it's
like an l-shaped desk so on this side I
have my laptop and I have a little like
wireless mouse and some stuff and the
mouse doesn't really go on my table like
it doesn't scroll around very easily and
so I have it sitting on a notepad
thinking I should get you know some
awesome mouse pad so I went to this
website and I can't remember what it is
but I'll I'll post it and I made the
coolest personalized mousepad it's got a
picture of cupcake on it I know crazy
cat lady here and it's she's like
sitting on my zebra print bench with the
pink blanket and everything looking real
cute and I put Beauty broadcast on the
bottom it's gonna be awesome
I can't wait for it to come in the
little things the little things of life
so here's a question to all you
decorative types I'm looking across the
way and I can see my neighbor's have out
like a spring wreath and it's okay it's
early February when do you start putting
up this the springtime decor you know
maybe I need like a Valentine's wreath
but I've still got on everyth on my door
that looks like I've taken down my
Christmas decorations and everything but
my wreath is more like it looks like the
Evergreen you know tree Glen's and maybe
a couple of red flowers on it all in all
like I get kind of bummed just taken
down the Christmas decorations and
you're probably thinking oh oh really
yeah
whoa okay I'm watching morning Express
with robin meade and monopoly just
changed the piece they got rid of they
got rid of the iron piece on monopoly
and replaced it with a cat why I have no
idea
sometime later this year she says it's
gonna be a replace talking so much in
this video I feel like you're probably
thinking when will she talk about
something actually interesting here
okay
oh then basically just put my hair back
with a headband through on the scarf
that has kind of this corally pink rose
pattern going on and that was kind of
the overall theme that color that I sort
of tied throughout the entire look I
just went like with the blush you know
it was kind of that coral pink that
shade was in the eyeshadow and then this
color whisper and pin-up peach brings it
all together it was all a hundred
percent drugstore and I'll have all
those products that I used listed down
below in the extra info box if you want
to see any more of these get ready with
me videos with a certain theme like this
was a requested one to do an altar on
store one but if there's something else
you want to see like maybe a you know a
five-minute look or something like that
that I can try to create for you and
those ideas would be great
so see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
