totally different location today I am
actually back home in my old room and I
am getting ready for my baby shower I'm
so excited I'm sitting at the same desk
that I used like back in high school
getting ready for school getting ready
for dances and games and all kinds of
stuff this is where I would do my makeup
using the same older Conair makeup
mirror the lighting I know is not gonna
be perfect here but I'm working with the
best I've got yeah this house in this
room is where I lived up until going to
college so I have a long long history
here also if you're interested in more
of the vlogging side of the baby shower
and kind of might weekend coming back
home I will have a video on that either
it's it'll be already be up on my vlog
Channel or will be up soon so I'll link
to that whenever possible down below
I've got my little travel set of rollers
in right now so those will be sitting in
there for a good long while don't really
cook in that curl and I've moisturized I
applied my mini Smashbox photo-finish
hydrating primer this is oil free and I
just keep a small size of this in my
travel bag and for a look at also
everything I took all these videos are
getting kind of related but I did a
video on what's in my travel beauty bag
using my Estee Lauder Double Wear
maximum cover foundation this is in
creamy tan and I made sure to bring my
sigma f84 brush so I'm just gonna dab
that all over and get my complexion all
even now
okay I'm trying some slight camera
repositioning and tweaks here so bear
with me this is not my usual setup by
any means but I am moving on now I want
to set this foundation a little bit
today because I've noticed it's kind of
humid I know my t-zone can tend to get
oily so even though I wouldn't always
feel the need to set that Double Wear
maximum cover foundation I am gonna do a
little bit of that today and this is the
new Too Faced cocoa powder foundation
I've been trying to test this out in
different ways either you know more
lightly on top of other foundations or
you know just on its own with a little
concealer so I'll definitely be
reviewing this one I feel like I
understand it one thing's for sure it
smells really good it smells a lot like
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil so
tonight we're going out and the family
is getting some dinner we're going to
this place called hotel Nabu it's kind
of a historic like type of dinner spot
that a lot of people in this area like
to go for their special occasions and
it's buffet style with like you know the
fancy beats and really good you know
home cookin type stuff so we're gonna do
that and then come back here for some
gifts and some cake and punch and all
that fun stuff so I have really really
been looking forward to this and it's
just you know as all these things
continue to happen throughout the
pregnancy it just makes everything seem
so much more real and it seems weird to
think that but you think of how long a
pregnancy lasts and it's like you know
you don't throughout that time it's like
are you ever gonna get to that point
where the baby's finally here and you
know I've still got a little ways to go
I am at 33 weeks right now as I sit here
shooting this but it's gonna be here
before we know it and we're so excited
so my love today is gonna be a little
bit bold and it is going to match my
nails and my toes the shade on my nails
by the way is the Revlon gel envy polish
and up the ante and so definitely
testing that out to see if it has some
of the longevity that I've become
accustomed to with other gel nail
polishes but for my lips I'm using this
Too Faced melted and melted fig it's got
a little depth to it as well you know
it's not one of those kind of bright
really lilac purplish shades
definitely some mauve in here as well
sometimes when I know my lip is gonna be
more of a statement of the look I'd go
ahead and apply that before the eyes and
then it kind of guides me as I do the I
look and keeps me from going you know a
little too far where that's concerned
alright so I finished the one I got a
few things working against me here other
than lighting I got my camera plugged in
now which kind of ways the back of the
camera down and tilts it permanently
this way but I'm just going I'm going
basic I'm going with something that you
know even if the lighting is not a okay
I pretty much know the pattern by now
and I'm using that cat ice palette from
Too Faced to start off by using one of
the great all-purpose eye products in my
collection is Milani shadow eyes the
shade is almond cream
puff is back you're singing on the
background I can't let you hear the
music is playing for copyright reasons
pop is there anything you would like to
come up and and chat with the the masses
about this is what my hair looks like
what I haven't cut it thank you Bob got
a pretty great gift for you later I'm
really pumped and Trump made those
awesome cookies yeah got them all lined
up on the tray now little girl cookies
in every different configuration I think
that's right look it's just like
concentric circles
it's funny sitting here it just kind of
takes me back and makes me think of like
the old days the high-school days and
the products that I used to use all the
time and I remember hitting pan on like
a shimmery light blue covergirl
eyeshadow so I know that was something
that got tons and tons of action in my
collection here's an epic shot looking
into the antique mirror so that's she
does not have black things on her face
it's simply it's part of history
anything new rearing its head
laser focus my eyes I say thank you
nice I believe these lashes are the eye
more texture is the name of them and I'm
not sure the number but I'll pop it up
on the screen when I find it
can we get pop and bub in here for like
a thumbnail
when am I gonna be ready um well I just
actually wrapped up the little tutorial
part of this alright guys so we're all
done here's the finish a little bit of
the purple on the eyes the sort of like
deep radiant orchid type of lip color
happening and this is my maxi dress
sixteen bucks t.j.maxx stretches
wherever you need it to would be 33
weeks right now guys so much for
watching this video I hope it was fun
and I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
