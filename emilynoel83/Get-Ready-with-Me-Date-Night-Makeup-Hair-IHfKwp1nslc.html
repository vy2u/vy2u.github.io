ready with me video as you can see I'm
in the process right now I've got my
velcro rollers and this is going to be a
date night look and I just feel like my
hair tends to lay really flat just
naturally so when I put some big ol
velcro rollers right up there kind of at
the top part of my head in the crown I
have a lot more volume and then I also
do curl these ends but it ends up being
just kind of a loose wavy look so we got
that cookin while we do our makeup
nothing on my skin right now I'm gonna
start off with my Clinique even better
clinical dark spot corrector I've got to
say I haven't noticed this having a
really major effect on my skin and spots
and things like that but I'm continuing
to use it because I have it and I just
want to see if eventually you know it
does some work for me so I used adding
this little complete eye renewal balm
for a brand called Al Genest
and this came in my QVC Beauty test tube
so I mean any kind of eye cream I kind
of rotate because I do have some of
these smaller sizes you know so just
kind of gently Pat it around the eye
area there I kind of concentrate on the
inner corner because I get really really
dry and then the outer corner as well
and the moisturizer I've been using
lately is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin
anti wrinkle cream it has SPF 15
it is a retinol facial treatment with
multivitamins it says so I just kind of
get that all over and I'm trying to
remember not to neglect the neck either
so do you guys have any special things
that you like to go out and do on a date
not us it's normally you know just going
out to eat or something not gonna lie it
typically ends at like Target or Walmart
or Walgreens or something you know just
cuz we're out and about and you know if
we need to pick something up we do that
but I find that it's time is gone and I
talked about this on the live show
Beauty broadcast live that we did this
past Thursday but it's like as time goes
on I think your expectation tends to
just be to have the time to like spend
time you know with your significant
other as opposed to feeling like it's
got to be just so for the day you know I
need to do this and we need to go to a
movie and it's got to be this way I mean
when Tyler and I were on very different
schedules it was like it's kind of easy
to lose touch with one another a little
bit just because our schedules took us
in kind of like opposite directions and
so you need to make like a conscious
effort even then you know we made sure
okay we're gonna you know Friday nights
we're gonna go out and you just kind of
take for granted
oh we're living in the same house you
know we're up to speed on what's going
on in each other's lives but sometimes
you can really like lose track of each
other so I think planning something out
having something to look forward to
really helped not that I'm trying to be
like a relationship counselor here don't
know what direction this video is taking
honestly I so far have gone with
products on my skin that I feel kind of
perfect my skin but really you can get
nice and close to me and it doesn't
really look like makeup the foundation
really comes off nicely on the skin and
I used the cover girl concealer balm and
then this is bare minerals well rested
and it's just a really nice product
around the eyes you can just use a
little bit it can really brighten
Tylar really thought it was sweet by the
way the nice things everybody said about
you know the IMAX video and the fact
that he went to me with went with me to
IMAX I mean you know it's makeup heaven
and he's there with me for both days and
I mean it was it was his idea he got me
those tickets for my birthday he knew it
was something you know I would love but
and he totally supports me in what I'm
doing and I'm so lucky to have that but
at the same time like it doesn't work in
a relationship if only one person is you
know supporting the other one and really
getting into what they're into as well I
really think both people have to be that
way so everybody feels appreciate so
with Tyler you know when he's talking
about golf or you know wanting to go to
a game or doing something sports related
or whatever you know I I make that my
interest as well or at least try okay
I've got some of these brand new blushes
called in stain from the balm they're
powder stain blushes it's very
interesting they're super long wearing
super pigmented and I will be reviewing
these very soon the shade I'm using now
is called what's it called lace
now for the eyes and I know it looks
really funny right now cuz I've got one
totally smoky and one totally undone
except I forgot to press record and I
just did my brows I use the elf Studio
brow kit and medium hit pan yeah yeah
this is kind of a waxy tinted wax thing
and so you put that on first and then
you top it with the matte powder and I
just used this little applicator that
comes with it so the angled tip with the
wax and then this little more like brush
tip with the powder it's very easy this
is a great little travel why is there
ever something that your friends or your
boyfriend or husband like tends to
comment on where your makeup is
concerned for me it's usually the I know
there are some people out there who are
like I love the natural look and that's
great you know but I feel like whenever
I do kind of a smoky eye or something a
little more dramatic on the eye Tyler
almost always will say point it out say
something give me a nice complement or
whatever mention he knows me yeah he
knows I like compliments about my makeup
but this is the lorac behind the scenes
eye primer so I'm just gonna any eye
primer you know that you like to use
this came with the lorac Pro palette but
I'm gonna put that all over and then one
more thing I want to say before I really
get going here on the eyes I've got a
really great little trio here this is
from Wet n Wild it's called don't steal
my thunder and this darkest shade is
very easy to work with like you don't
have to be so scared of it getting
overly dark like it's gonna be really
easy to use so outer V's winged liner a
lot of people have told me you know
especially those of you who have really
round eyes sometimes you're like I don't
like the way that looks on my eye can
you do a different style so here this
look is going to totally follow the
natural shape of the eye we're not
building anything big out here we're
just keeping it nice and smoky bright
around the eye
more of a traditional smokey eye because
it's really nice and dark and then it
kind of fades out whereas some other
looks I've done you know it's been a bit
brighter on the lid so this is a little
more nighttime a little more drama so
let's get started
they were just saying on TV people are
more rude on social media than in person
they're talking about Facebook
specifically you think it's so much
easier to let your attitude problem show
on on the internet than to you know
actually act that way in person I find
anyway
kind of overlapping the light part to
really make it kind of fade in and then
I'm wedging that dark shade right into
the crease I'm not really pulling it
outward I'm just getting right in the
crease
you want to be kind of quick when you
smudge this out like as in right after
you apply it because this does set to
kind of a smudge free mode and I just
like to use my finger because I feel
like it really just makes it look
natural makes it makes it seem a little
more you know lived in it I guess so
really close to the lash line the black
liner put it on and then smudge it out
I find that if I'm going out or
something I like sort of a
low-maintenance lip something where if I
want to touch it up it's not a big deal
and it just doesn't look like too much
on the lips like it was slaved over or
overly wet and glossy and that's where
you know these great little like
lipstick lip balm things from the
drugstore come in huge and I love the
color whispers this shade called broseph
attraction is really pretty and it's
just gonna give your lips kind of a a
sheer pink glow to them I guess I know a
nude lip is great with a smokey eye too
but I kind of wanted to have a fresh
cheek and a fresh lip with this really
dark eye and it kind of pops with this
tank top I'm wearing um this is wet seal
just a real simple tank top and a little
black sweater over the top over the hair
as I said I you know curled it all over
put rollers that means I put it around a
curling iron first then put it over a
roller and let that sit for a while so
we'll take those out
so there we go easy hair with some
volume up top and a little more curl
toward the bottom this is a style I do a
lot it's just very easy to wear casual
loose but still kind of glam that's just
how I roll so thank you so much for
watching and requesting to see this
video if you have a date night look that
you'd like to share feel free to submit
it as a video response and I'll as that
hope everyone has a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
