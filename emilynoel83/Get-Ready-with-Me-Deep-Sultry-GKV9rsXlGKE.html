for joining me for this video
it's morning it's early I've got my
coffee in my squirrel mug can I just say
that I think the Gloria Jean's hazelnut
is taking over pumpkin spice for me
I'm loving this kind of coffee it's so
perfect temperature too so I just go
through my face and chitchat a little
bit along the way the look today I'm
going for is kind of a deep and sultry
fall look I actually am getting ready
for beauty broadcast live this morning
and you know whatever else I do
throughout the day so got my covergirl
foundation I already put on my primer
and my moisturizers just to you know
speed up the process a little bit but
how's everybody doing what's been going
on in your life I feel like it's been a
while since I've done one of these got
morning Express with robin meade on at
the moment i'll let you know if any
important headlines come up so I still
have my little Halloween lights up there
I'm calling them Thanksgiving lights now
because you know pumpkins are good all
throughout the fall all right that's
what I say but I am really excited for
Thanksgiving this year because I get to
celebrate it normally I was working
usually on Thanksgiving or you know
working the day after so I couldn't
really travel so I'm pumped to be able
to enjoy a normal Thanksgiving this year
with my family going for a very flawless
undereye here so I'm using a little of
the mac prolongwear and I'll continue on
with that here on this area and
this is so much lighter than my skin I
use it kind of whatever is extra out of
that little pump you know how it always
like pumps out a little too much or at
least I feel like it goes I just put it
other places that I want to brighten
I had a root canal last week who know it
really was not bad and I think everybody
thinks root canals are bad but honestly
the procedure I didn't feel a thing I
mean I had like probably four shots now
in this area it was my Barre back back
to started to subside within the last
couple days but really sore just under
my jaw and then my tooth is still just a
little sensitive when I bite down on it
back there and I mean I've googled and
stuff and looked up that that's pretty
normal a lot of stuff is done you know
for a root canal they're getting down in
there right but anyways it's getting
better something I got during that
Sephora sale was something that a lot of
people asked me to review ever since I
reviewed the Tarte blush and bronzer
palette and it's this look from NARS the
guy Bourdin palette and that's what it
looks like y'all I don't have a ton of
NARS and I have just a little baby
Laguna bronzer um so I'm gonna just jump
right into this I'm gonna use the
bronzer I used a different bronzer for
kind of large to surf this area there
around my neck but I'll use this one
kind of as a contour
I'm not sure what the exact shade names
are here so I'll have to look into that
but I think I'm gonna go down to this
shade here is a blush that's pretty I
like and then I almost have to use this
highlight that's in here right this
looks pretty yours let's swatch it see
what it is
yeah that's pretty shimmery pretty light
so we're gonna use a real light touch
with this
I decided that I have been using so many
pallets lately testing out so many
pallets that for this video I'm going
back old school baby
old school to like some of the first
kinds of shadows I ever used this is not
the original palette I ever had
but shimmering sands anyone anybody had
this in their collection
so yeah that's what Baker I had the door
shut
I thought she busted through what up
girlfriend
this light shimmery shade is awesome
this is great to have for your inner
corner it's a little bit pinky tone
how about we don't lick that thank you
okay I'm gonna go for that middle shape
sorry about that nail what did black on
the waterline I did some brown matte
eyeshadow under the eye and on my upper
lashline is kind of a deep plum liner
and I think I want to make the lower
part just even more kind of smoky so I'm
gonna go to this shade because I used
brown smolder under there first so this
is gonna be a little bit lighter I'm
just gonna go sort of right below oh not
like that I made sure to turn my phone
off for this video I sincerely apologize
to those of you who've said oh it's
going off and making an email beep
during videos and I'm sorry like I think
I've gotten to the point where I like
hardly notice honestly and like I'm just
very in the zone doing my video and it
does not even register so I'm sorry if
that's been a distraction although we
can file that away under
firstworldproblems
oh my gosh I don't think I've talked to
you guys um in a video like this since
my area has gotten a new Ulta or wait
let me rephrase that
gotten an Ulta it's not like they had an
old mom it's amazing it's I mean I used
to go to an Ulta occasionally but the
nearest one was like an hour and a half
away so it wasn't exactly convenient
it's right connected to the mall so it's
just so handy I love it
I got this lip kit from Mac it's like a
really dark vampy lip stick a dark liner
and then a cream Sheen glass lip gloss
I'm not sure if I'm gonna go to the
gloss or not but I'm gonna start out
with this lip liner and it is in vino
I think I am going to take just a little
bit of this gloss I'm just gonna get a
little bit here on my finger and dab
that that's pretty
I put that one velcro roller in the
front because I'm very paranoid about my
front section getting a dent in it from
the clips so when I do a Velcro roller I
can just do this little kind of clip on
the underside and then I don't wind up
with any sort of dent there are these
hair extensions no you only see me every
day and focus huh
We Live Together you can pull on it it's
rail okay so I finished off the look I'm
just styled my hair went back to the
center part you know I just can't make
up my mind
put in some gold earrings these are from
forever 21 they're just like little
bitty spikes
I love the combo of leopard and the dark
live something about that just speaks to
me so I got this scarf actually when I
was in Germany is that toothpaste oh yes
sorry about that a little gold bracelet
this is also from forever 21 the nails
most of them are the Revlon perfumery in
Bordeaux except for the ring finger
which is autumn spice I was just testing
that thank you for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know if you
want to see more get ready with me stuff
and have an awesome day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
