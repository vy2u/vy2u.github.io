doing a little get ready with me video
again thanks for the great response to
the other one I had a lot of fun doing
it I think these are really fun quick
ways to show a makeup look in progress
so today's is going to be I'm putting
myself to a little challenge I'm gonna
try to use less products fewer products
and just kind of simplify the look a
little bit and still give it kind of
that glamorous you know finished
appearance not really leaving anything
out but just trying to do more with less
basically so I'm also gonna be doing my
hair in this video so I've got my little
um my bidding actually styling wand here
this is a Remington T Studio pearl and
it's the larger size I'm gonna kick
things off and just use a little eye
cream I'm just trying to use up this
Lancome stuff that came in like one of
those gift with purchase kits it's a
nice really hydrating eye cream but I'm
almost done with it so maybe maybe
you'll see it again in an empties videos
so of course Good Morning America is
talking about you know weight loss and
New Year's resolutions and of course one
of my new year's resolutions is getting
in better shape you know working out
regularly and all that and so last night
you're like a zillion bowl games on and
I decide I'm going to do some yoga first
time I've ever done yoga at all I know I
mean you'd think I would have done it
before but I just you know I've done
lots of other kinds of workouts but I've
never done yoga and so Tyler sitting
there watching the football game
whatever I'm on like the back side of
the couch they're like moaning and
groaning because I chose something it
was like extreme abdominal something
like it seemed pretty advanced I'm like
I can I can handle this and it was
pretty darn tough so I've put a link to
it on my on my blog post where I
mentioned my new year's resolutions and
all that and I think I'm gonna keep
trying it may be working it into some
other things I'm doing but I thought
yoga was supposed to be like some
calming relaxing experience
cupcake is meowing her head off from the
kitchen because it's a wet food day and
we don't give her wet food every day
like she gets dry food every day but
then like twice a week we give her some
wet food because at the start we would
give her both every day and she would
just get picky and not finish it all and
now when we just do it a couple of times
like she just numbs it all down and is
all about it you know like whatever we
give her she loves and she is not shy to
prompt you to refill the dish like you
don't want to feed a cat too much at one
time because they will they will vomit
it back up immediately I know this is
pleasant conversation for the getting
ready with me but like you you they just
can't eat too fast their stomachs can't
handle it so we give her a little bit at
a time a little bit at a time and she
just like always wants to let you know
when it's about time to have some more
so I think she can hang on here just a
few more minutes
feeling flush is so important like I
mean it's one of those things I mean
obviously when you do your eyes you know
you really notice after you put on
mascara and eyeliner and all that stuff
but as far as the phase is concerned I
feel like blush is one of those things
where you just look at yourself after
you put it on you're like yep that made
a difference you know new wet-and-wild
Fergie products that I'm playing with
here this is like a highlight shimmer
powder and Rhodes champagne glow it's
really light so I'm using it like a
highlight
another thing just with my makeup
routine that I'm trying to change is to
do my brows before I do the rest of my
eye makeup because I feel like you know
the times I do I don't know why I don't
do it that way every time because it
affects what I do on my eyes and I feel
like I'm I'm less likely to do as much
on my eyes when my brows are finished
and looking you know totally done but
when my brows aren't done I think maybe
I compensate for that by doing more I
makeup so just another thing I'm trying
to trying to tweak a little bit always
tweaking continually tweaking their
routine another Fergie wet-and-wild
products you've got an eye primer
it's crazy to look outside and just see
snow everywhere out there I mean we have
not in southern Illinois had this much
snowfall in a long time it seems like
and it's just hanging around because the
temperatures are staying so cold so I
look outside and I just see I mean
there's snow everywhere
someone on my vlog that I posted with me
and Tyler showing our Christmas gifts
was like your hair is so flat and and I
don't know that's the way I imagined it
coming out of their mouth like I imagine
all comments like being verbalized with
someone but this is how a my hair
naturally is like I have naturally
really straight hair so I'm gonna put a
little bit of a wave in it here today
get a little bit of a haircut um when I
went back home my mom took a few inches
off as you can see I'm not precise at
all when I do this I just kind of grab
some go around the curling iron so
here's the difference one side it's
these loose kind of waves on the side
very straight
got one a little lost I'm gonna do some
Revlon Pinkpop Super Lustrous I swear
this is how all my makeup ends typically
I'm like I need a little more lip gloss
a little more blush so that is kind of
my minimal more minimal product makeup
routine I tried to get away with just
using some concealer and my nearly naked
powder for my eyes I used even with my
even as my liner
I used this Fergie set this is
metropolitan nights didn't really mess
with the yellow too much but use the
other shades just to give a little you
know contrast and dimension there and
then a little bit of pink on the lips it
plays off of this top which is kind of a
little loose top it comes with a
built-in black tank top underneath and
do a little more bronzer on my neck area
here but I got this top from a Kmart
store that was closing down and they had
stuff at like 75% off so I got this I
got a few other things got some bras
because you know how expensive bras are
you know just even at a Walmart or
something I'm like gosh doesn't make
sense how expensive this is but I got so
much stuff like super duper cheap from
that sale and this top I just love the
the print I love the colors involved
with the blue and that kind of jade
greens on my last step is basically to
throw in some earrings maybe a bracelet
and the look will be complete so thank
you guys so much for watching these get
ready with me video see you again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
