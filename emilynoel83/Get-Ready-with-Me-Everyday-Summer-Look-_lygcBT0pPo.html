get ready with me video because I
haven't done one of these in a while and
I am getting ready to go to Belle's
nine-month doctor's appointment checkup
I know it's crazy where has the time
gone and I am just grouped together some
different products that I am thinking
about using but I'm not really sure what
overall whole look I'm actually going
for will kind of see how it turns out
but I do have a few new things from elf
and Mac so we'll get to put those to use
today trying a new foundation this is
the pro longwear nourishing waterproof
foundation a lot of you guys have been
asking me to do a waterproof makeup
tutorial or at least you know use
products that have that waterproof claim
and then see how they actually hold up
like go swimming or something and then
see what happens afterwards so this
might be one of the products we use for
that but I'm going to use this today
this is my first time using it feels
like a really typical liquid foundation
so I'm going to do my normal method I
have this did I say what color I am and
c30 is what I got this in
and look what I'm going to use I
dampened up my beauty blender I got it
all soaked and I'm just going to I guess
start dabbing around you'll see what
kind of cover just thing
I want to thank you guys for the nice
feedback on my Rose product video I
really like the smell of Rose product
I've accumulated a lot of them so I
really enjoyed doing that video and a
lot of you guys gave me some nice
feedback you were happy to see the try
this not that series coming back so
that's good and then the other new Pro
Longwear thing i got was a new pro
longwear concealer and this is in NC 25
i already had one of these but most of
it was used up it was getting kind of
old so i thought i'd just get a new one
and I went a little bit lighter than my
foundation shade for the concealer just
like a shade lighter just so this could
be a little more brightening for me
great coverage on this product though
this is a really awesome concealer and I
know a lot of people like it because it
doesn't have a real cakey appearance on
the skin for as good coverage as it has
I'm going to do a light bit of setting
powder over this I'm using my it
cosmetics celebration illumination and
my ELF complexion brush just a teeny bit
I'm not really sure what this foundation
is going to do with my skin just yet but
I have a feeling just by the texture of
it that I'm going to want a little
powder on top not really for coverage
sake a bit just for setting in so I am
on snapchat now and I feel like it's
taking over my social media life like I
love it so much and at first I was so
standoffish about like I've had that app
for about a year and I remember my
sister-in-law Rachel one year ago was
showing it to me and we were talking
about how to use it and I still felt a
little confused so when I felt confused
I just didn't use it at all then more
and more people are asking like what's
your snapchat what are you on snapchat
and then I feel kind of obligated to go
ahead and post some things there because
I told people what my name is and you
know you just do it and you figure it
out as you go and it's not that
complicated it's just I don't know it's
different but it's so like on the fly
and real life and Instagram I feel like
sometimes with Instagram pictures
they're so um premeditated you know like
okay this is the picture I'm going to
post on Instagram it needs to be this
you know perfect shot or whatever
I'm not saying Instagram pictures aren't
like a depiction of real life but I just
I don't know about you but I tend to
think a little bit more about what I'm
gonna put on Instagram and then with
snapchats like whatever best snap my
favorite snap that I have put up thus
far by the way do you just call them
snaps I don't know fill me in when my
sister was here over the weekend we have
this song it's the Macy Gray song
she's you know famous for her big hit
from back in the 90s I think and when I
was younger I always used to sing that
but I would completely exaggerate her
voice and kind of turn it into an old
woman woman and so over the weekend I
don't know how we started talking about
that song but we did and inevitably walk
away but that's the kind of stuff you
put on snapchat you know and I love it
so follow me I'm Emily Noel 83 and but
for now I'm going to go back to the
makeup I'm using my son bunny bronzer
from Too Faced cuz I legit just want to
use some bronzer right now I've got a
contouring thing that I'm going to use
but I want to get the skin a little more
bronzy so I think I think I'm just going
to do a little swirl enos here and just
blend these look the light shade and a
darker shade together and just kind of
sweep this as an all-over bronzer it's
got a little glow to it it's not
excessive so if you want to use this as
an all-over
natural bronzer you can
I really feel like I got awesome
coverage with that foundation concealer
by the way don't you think
but the thing about snapchat if I'm
talking to anybody out there who's not
familiar with it if I'm not the last
person to get on the bandwagon like the
your snaps go away after 24 hours so
that's another thing that I think makes
you feel a little more free with it
because you're like well I'm gonna be on
your permanently although people can do
screenshots I see people doing the
screenshots I don't know what I'm doing
I'm just mindlessly moving this brush
around and talking I'm not even thinking
okey-dokey um elf contour palette I
picked this up I did an elf haul don't
be surprised if you see an elf haul soon
or Mac haul what um
you see that real-life one just popped
out oh no and it's not just like the
magnetic part that popped out you guys
like it's the pan I need to reglue it
that won't be a big deal I mean I can
reglue but then anyway these are like
the little oh I'm gonna sit this puppy
aside here that's the one that's like
the light shimmery but these are little
pans that do pop out so you can
customize your own palette it's just the
same packaging as the blush palette
that's a big mirror here I'm going to
use this kind of cool matte shade and
one of my up and up brushes from little
complexion set oh yeah
kind of laying it on here for you so you
can see how intense it can be
the people who like and feel like they
need the super cool tone contours I
think are going to love this
what's in here right now totally reminds
me of my Smashbox contour kit by the way
you got this shave of some share but
this is like a matte kind of light beige
a warmer one a cooler one then I'm just
grabbing a different brush something a
little bit lighter using this more
bronzy color that could have really been
my bronzer step here go a little bit
above where I did the deepest part the
contour with this bronzy color love that
method practically like blush
this is my city color blush in dragon
fruit here matte blush feeling like
super matte with my skin right now I'm
using a little setting mist
that's my glossy a setting spray
another new elf thing are these
eyeshadow palettes I got them all this
is the nude one it's actually called
neat it nude and it seems like the smoky
palette is more overall cool palette and
this one's rather warm as you can see
here I'm feeling kind of a golden air
metallic color on the lid but I'm going
to go matte in the crease first so I'll
use this Brown right y'all
nicely pigmented I must say shadows are
pretty soft I noticed like really
needing to tap off the excess when I put
my brush in there then I think I'm going
to take this matte shade and kind of I
don't know just blend over just kind of
laying down the basics before the fun
stuff
well if I love that gold color it's kind
of a brassy gold I might take some of
this like pinky champagne color over the
top of it
because I just can't stop and I'm having
fun I'm going to see what maybe some of
this more yellowy gold would look like
add it in I'm not saying the other color
wasn't pigmented enough it just wasn't
like the tone of gold I really like I
feel like this look just really needs
classic matte black liquid liner so I'm
using my Jordana color Envy
you go real smudgy here on the lower
lashline I'll take this shade you guys
had a dream about snakes the other night
and I was awoken by a baby I think you
know who woken from the dream I remember
the dream and I was in my parents
backyard and I was trying to catch these
snakes there were several of them big
ones and I remember like hopping around
like not wanting them to catch me catch
my ankles you know um but I was trying
to catch them and then I woke up and
then of course you know what do you do
when you're awake at 2:00 a.m. nursing
baby you google the dream analysis you
know what does it mean what I dream
about snakes according to what I read it
could signify change it also can signify
like healing so I'm not really sure how
this comes back to apply to everyday
life part of me thinks it's just a
totally random dream about snakes you
know maybe it doesn't really have a
meaning to my life whatsoever I'm not
sure you give these lashes a curl
so I was totally speeding through the
end of this tutorial not chit-chatting
too much because I thought my memory
card was about to fill up turns out I
had like 40 minutes of old video on
there that I could have gotten rid of
which I just did but anyway that is my
look that's my what do you call this
everyday summer look paediatrician glam
I feel like this is going to be a super
long wearing look I just have the sense
you know I didn't use a ton of dewy
shimmery products I mean there's a lot
of matte happening here so I just feel
like it's going to hold up well even if
I get start to get a little oily I think
the whole looks probably going to hang
together I need to keep an eye on that
though because I did use some new
products that Mac Pro Longwear more
moisturizing foundation nourishing
waterproof foundation that's what it was
called and eager to see how that holds
up but I was pretty happy with the eye
look from that elf palette it's nothing
crazy different from what I would do on
the average day and the color selection
in that particular palette wasn't
anything super unique either but there
are several others that I still need to
try and then outfit wise I'm just
wearing this target tank top and I
popped on this necklace I got this in a
happy mommy box which is kind of a cool
like little subscription box type thing
which I should probably talk about in
the vlog or something but this necklace
came in one of those like a long time
ago like around Christmas and I thought
it's so pretty and I don't know might be
fun with this look with the blue stripe
top is anybody else obsessed with these
Maronna
tank tops from Target I really got into
him I remember last summer when I was
pregnant and they're just so comfy
they've got a nice stretch to them but
they don't get stretched out and when I
got this one and a couple others more
recently I think they were like three
for 24 bucks or something but right now
I've got of course some black yoga pants
on but I'm going to change into some
jeans but these tanks really like that's
what I'm living in this time of year if
there's time I might go on and do
something more with my hair but it seems
to be decent enough just straight today
but thank you guys so much for watching
this video
oh I'm glad you enjoy the get ready with
me it will probably be a video soon on
some new Mac stuff that I hold and also
the elf stuff just let me know you know
what are you interested in what do you
want to see keep up with me on snapchat
that's where I'm posted all the time and
thank you guys again so much I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
