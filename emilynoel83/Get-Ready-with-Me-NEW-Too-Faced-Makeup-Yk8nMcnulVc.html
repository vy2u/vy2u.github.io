this get ready with me because I was
sitting here doing just a real great job
applying this foundation for you but my
camera was not recording so good thing I
noticed now I am applying my Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation in light beige
and I am really just about done I'm
using my Sonia Kashuk flat flat top
brush and just blending that all in
sorry is it too late now to say sorry
okay that brings me to my first topic
for this get ready with me I have never
been a real Justin Bieber fan like his
earlier songs okay you know they're fine
but I don't really love them and then he
starts like acting ridiculous and I'm
like I can't I can't rally around this
kid and then more recently he puts out
some songs that I like genuinely really
love and I've been loving all of it like
his newer song the love yourself song
the one that's a little bit like slowed
down and love that your average 31 year
old going on 32 years old Justin Bieber
fans sitting here doing some makeup for
you but I think I gained a little bit
more appreciation for him also when I
watched his carpool karaoke with James
Corden which James Corden i'ma have to
start watching him when I'm up late
because he is hilarious and several of
you kindly directed me to the YouTube
video where he did carpool karaoke with
Carrie Underwood and of course I love
that and so I'm like hmm I think I'm
gonna watch some more of these and
Bieber has like two of them with him and
he's so funny
so yeah good story huh so the product
I'm applying here is my trusty benefit
erase paste and medium and then I'm
using this Real Techniques pointed
foundation brush to just dab that in
sometimes I'll use my fingers sometimes
I'll use a Fuller Brush it's really just
whatever I'm feeling like at the moment
and today I honestly wasn't even
thinking cuz I was too involved in the
conversation we are having yep I'm
shooting this on a Friday and I should
mention this is gonna be like a party
look I mean we're going all out this is
not gonna be like natural quick and easy
makeup I'm really just gonna go the
whole nine yards with this this is the
instant age rewind in neutralizer
I had really only used the skin tone
ones or the one called brightener for
the longest time and then I'm like oh
there's one called neutralizer and it's
got quite a bit of coverage to it you
know oh just put that where I want to
brighten I said I was gonna be trying
some different
loose powders to compare to my by terry
hyaluronic hydra powder and this is one
I've never used like it's my first time
using it right now it's the NYX color
correcting powder in lavender it just
has the most faint maybe it's not
something
lavender color and I'm just going to be
dabbing this over my concealer and he
used a healthy amount of it and kind of
baked my concealer
this feels not quite as lightweight as
the texture of the by Terri powder but
because it is this like light lavender
color it definitely does do more
brightening
you know might not hurt to be a little
careful sometimes goodness this you
might not know since when I held it up
though you can see the label is horn off
this is the Maybelline brow satin that
I'm using right here just for a little
fill-in and I have a question which I
would love to know your answer to in the
comments section what is your favorite
Christmas song like there are certain
songs that can just bring tears to my
eyes around Christmas time and a couple
of my favorites that just when I hear
them I love them
it's the Rascal Flatts version of I'll
be home for Christmas because their
harmonies just are so good and then
Carrie Underwood's the First Noel
that's an awesome version as well to
sing myself like the thing that I find
myself singing around the house all the
time sorry cupcake and nookie but it's
have yourself a merry little Christmas I
love that one
now I'm just gonna like dust away some
of this I feel like from a distance it
looks good up close my under eye area
looks more dry with this powder than it
does with the by Terry but after we work
in some setting mists and that kind of
thing we might be in a different place
so we'll see this is a new two face
powder brush it's called perfect powder
brush mr. right and he's wearing this
little bow tie which could come off but
who would want to take it off I just
gonna use that with a little True Match
pressed powder from my shot my stash
drawer I've got this laura geller
baked illuminating foundation in medium
this was a stuff I was talking about
being a little bit dark for me as all
over foundation but it does work kind of
well as a contour and I really like
using this a little bit smaller brush
from Sigma
this is the love flush blush palette I'm
going to use this shade right here
called how deep is your love little bee
gees for you this morning
you know this headbands cute and all but
I feel like I'm just brushing a bunch of
product into my hair and for my
highlight I'm two-faced has the
candlelight glow they repackage them
they have the regular one that's kind of
got a pinky side and a golden side and
then this one is called warm glow this
is the completely new product so one
sides a little peachy one sides kind of
golden and so I'm gonna take more from
this side here and I'm just gonna apply
that right here kind of on this outer
parts top of the cheek area and like I
was saying I'm wanting to do a fun look
here this is this NYX proof it I primed
my by the way so this is not your
natural wear it to the office kind of
look work appropriate makeup was
recently requested and I'm definitely
gonna do that but this is this is not
that kind of a look but of course it
depends on where you work some people
work at the circus they're on Broadway
here
might be appropriate so here's the cute
little chocolate bon bons palette so
they put out chocolate bar one they put
out chocolate bar semi-sweet and now
here's the bon bons palette with the
cute little heart-shaped colors as I
look at it I could see plenty of ways
for me to stay in my neutral comfort
zone but I'm gonna try to not do that
with this video all right so I'm going
to go into this purple shade here which
is called blackcurrant and I'm using my
Sigma e25 which is kind of my comfort
zone and we're
get this pretty purpley shade going in
the crease don't be afraid to use this
color in the crease because even though
it has a little shimmer it really like
contours the eye nicely I think
this is my little mua makeup academy
professional 315 brush great little
small crease brush and I'm going to go
into this super dark teal called Earl
Grey I do like how this shade is dark
but it still shows up like teal you know
building it up slightly in the outer V
area so we went to Texas for a good part
of last week for Tyler's sister Amy's
wedding and it was a beautiful wedding
and I got to do her makeup and it's just
doing Bridal makeup especially I don't
know it's it's she's got a face and very
familiar with I was just really having
fun doing it and I don't know how like
makeup artist don't keep from being so
excited like as you see the the
transformation happened and it's like
it's her big day and you see the dress
hanging over there and like gosh it just
kind of makes me emotional just thinking
about it like how do you keep from
getting so excited because like she was
just looking so so good and I was so
happy with the way the makeup was
turning out they're just a good vibe in
the room you know it was just fun now
that I've done that with these dark
shades I'm just blending there's no
color on this brush
now on the lids I had done kind of a
trial run of this look the other day and
I was just layering all kinds of things
and I did kind of an unusual layering on
the lids and I actually really liked the
way it looked so first off I had cafe au
lait on there which is a little bit
silvery it's like a really light silvery
taupe okay so there's that and then just
for the heck of it I ended up going over
it with some of this molasses chip which
is absolutely this color is just the
bomb look at that and I put a little bit
of this over the top of that other shade
and it's so shiny but it's a little bit
warmer and my thought process was that
the slightly warmer shade on the lid is
a bit more unexpected with these blues
and purples but I like it going back in
with the low purple and just kind of
reworking the crease a bit just to make
sure I didn't get too much shimmer up in
the crease not using a lot of product
here then I'm taking a little molasses
chip with the good ol e 36 a little
wispy brush and I'm applying that kind
of on the border right up here just a
little warmth for those of you who
really stick to your neutrals it kind of
makes the look a bit more wearable like
what I might have instinctively done is
taken cotton candy and put it on the
border of the purple but this just I
don't know it makes the look a bit more
earthy so I don't know if you can see
too much what I'm doing here on camera
but that's just sort of softening the
edge and just up under the brown I'm
going to use this shade called divinity
it's
to be your Matt highlight and this is my
ELF blending brush nice for a lot of
different purposes on the eye area and
then you can also kind of go right up
under the lower lash line and clean that
up a bit with this shade I have a friend
whose grandma made really good divinity
next we're doing a fun wing I'm using
this color pop cream gel liner pencil
and the shade is called piggy bank and
it's kind of a funky purple and I'm not
going to go all the way across the lash
line with this
okay so that's what we're doing here
we're creating this pink wing and just
bringing it up onto the upper lash line
a bit and just down onto the lower lash
line a bit the people at toddler
gymnastics today are gonna be like is
this woman up too and when I say toddler
gymnastics though that's a pretty loose
terminology there this is like it's an
open gym thing that this gymnastics and
cheerleading gym in our area does it's
just a nice opportunity to give them a
different place to run around a
different environment things to explore
new surfaces and they set up a bunch of
you know very little kid-friendly things
as well it's not like I'm saying hey you
know up on that balance beam there's
just all kinds of fun stuff and me being
one who I used to teach like I remember
three to five-year-olds class at the
YMCA back when I was in like high school
and the summers during college and I
just loved that so much so I loved
getting to go there and do this stuff
with her then I'm taking totally fetch
which is this hot pink and an angled
liner brush I'm just like topping off
that liner the liner is maybe a hair
more purple than this shade but they
actually are pretty similar and then I'm
using this Physicians Formula
booster liner pen in ultra black and I
am going to take this all the way across
the upper lash line but for that wing
you know I'm just keeping it within the
pink liner so a very fine line of black
going within that
lower lashline I'm bringing down a
little bit more of the pink because I
did some liner on the inner rim and I
just kind of I'm ready now to overlap a
bit and then with a smudge brush I'm
again taking this fabulous molasses chip
shade which is become like the
unexpected star of this look and I'm
going to take that color all the way
under here and sort of overlap with the
pink this shade can be very full-on like
I was sitting you know it's a really
pigmented color if you like this look
but you're feeling like it's a bit much
for you you could always leave out that
pink wing I was just trying to do
something a little bit different because
there will always be the crowd who's
like there's something different and
then when you do something different
there's the crowd who's like that's too
different I find just doing what I like
and enjoy tends to be the best thing for
my mental health
um you gonna be able to get past those
lights oh oh you look so cute
today he's got a little shirt under
gonna sweat er yeah Morgan that's so
cute bears died 40 and she's got a
banana in her hand over there you're a
rock star
well at this point in time I am not
totally done with my Christmas shopping
still have a little more to do I'm still
waiting on some online things to come in
so I can wrap them got it pick out a few
more things but I I freaking love this
time of year you can't let yourself get
too crazy stressed about this stuff
you've got to take one day sometimes one
hour at a time and realize that you're a
better parent when you're 8 happy and
calm parent so just take it easy take a
deep breath everything will get done and
if it doesn't it's not the end of the
world
I've come this far I might as well put
on some false lashes right and since I
am now in a bit of a hurry I'm going to
as this dries I'm going to do my lip
product this is one of the new two-faced
la creme lipsticks the shade is called
topless this I was comparing it the
other day to nude beach hair out of my
mouth first nude beach is more pinky
than this this is a little more as you
can see like a peach nude this formula
is very shiny very creamy and then a
combo I really liked with this because I
can kind of feel like my lip line is
disappearing a bit you know not standing
out as much as I would like with the
shape like this yet I still like the
overall nude look so I'm going to take
this Neutrogena color stick this is one
of the new shades and very Brown by the
way I have a video outlining all of
these new Neutrogena things and as you
can see the lips will begin to look a
bit more full a bit more defined just
kind of going over that border
one other thing I want to do I want to
intensify my lower lashline pinkness
just a bit I just got a little bit crazy
with the overlapping there night didn't
want to overlap that much yep that was
necessary
still need to work on my hair a bit
which is decided it randomly wants to be
really staticky but that is my finished
makeup look I hope you guys liked it you
know it's just something different and
fun and I just feel like I really went
more towards the non comfort zone shades
in this palette and it was a lot of fun
and maybe next time I'll do something a
little more natural with this and I do
plan to do a review on this so stay
tuned and thank you for watching bye
