for a little get ready with me fun in
this video the hair is kind of in
progress as you can see I have curled
the bottom part with my Bed Head bubble
wand so it's a little more wavy a little
bit more of a tight wave and then I
wanted to see what it would be like if I
just did loose waves on top of that with
some large just jumbo volumizing rollers
there those are from Connie I'll leave
those in while I do my makeup and we'll
all find out together at the end how
that works out but I'm gonna start off
I've got my moisturizer on whoo I think
I will do some right I'm gonna use my
Rimmel fix imperfect Pro under this law
so how has everybody been since we last
talked these are not a typical tutorial
by the way if you're new to my get ready
with me videos some parts are sped up
sometimes I stopped and just you know
chitchat as if we were actually getting
ready together so got that primer on now
so I am going for more of a glam party
type of look I want really long wearing
face makeup and kind of more dramatic
eye makeup so by the way I am gonna be
using this quad from L'Oreal the love to
hate me 1 I got a lot of requests after
my favorites video to see this in action
I'm gonna use my Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation for a really long
wearing base
I had asked on my Facebook page for my
Friday fill-in-the-blank last week I was
like what is your favorite occasion or
situation to do makeup for and a lot of
people said like a night out or a date
and that's probably mine too you know I
like the really special occasions like
weddings and stuff like that but I also
feel like I really like those situations
that are kind of low pressure you know
or you can just really have fun with it
and not really be concerned about being
photographed a zillion times you know so
that's why I like you know party bait
makeup as well because it gives you a
chance to maybe do something a little
more dramatic without being too
concerned about if you mess up or don't
do it exactly the way you want to by the
way this pixie correction concentrate
and brightening peach got from Target
but this is a little bit thick so I do
like to use my fingers whenever I blend
this stuff in then I'm gonna really
brighten with my age rewind eraser and
there I'm gonna use this is like my all
over face highlight thing
I'm drinking some of this is water with
the mio stuff in it it's like one of
those liquid flavor things you can just
squirt it in its the mango peach kind
and it's so friggin good busted out the
crockpot for the first time in a while
this past week and I did kind of Mexican
it makes me think Mexico and Mexican
lasagna because it's so like layered up
but it was really more like a casserole
with rice chicken salsa cheese a lot of
cheese it turned out really good and it
ended up being the kind of thing that
you could just you know eat in a bowl
with a spoon is kind of one of those you
know like Mexican Bowl type thing where
Tyler had some like in a tortilla and
really liked that I've got the recipe on
my Pinterest board I have a whole board
for crock potting by the way tis the
season I always think about crock
potting in the fall
so we've had a really unusual thing
happening at our house recently like in
the evenings I don't know probably
around like 7:00 7:30 you know it's
starting to get a little more dark
outside and a flock of Canadian geese
flies almost directly over our house
like we've got in our living room some
doors that go out onto our deck so we
can really see you know what's happening
out there and I you hear them you can
hear them coming so that's what alerts
me to look through the window and then I
see them in perfect V formation flying
over our house same time every night
it's happened for like a week and a half
probably is that some kind of sign you
know like good luck maybe or something
or some kind of positive omen or maybe a
bad omen I don't know
so guys I'm redoing the banners for my
YouTube channels and one of them for the
vlog Channel I thought would be cute if
they had me and Tyler and cupcake on the
back I wanted to take a new picture of
Tyler and cupcake so the person I'm
putting together the banner can use that
and it has a nice white background and
everything and I was like bub I'm gonna
put some makeup on yeah I was having too
much fun with this I just did a little
bit of concealer cuz you'd been out the
Sun golf a lot but I covered up a little
bit of redness and a little bit of
powder that was it but I was enjoying
myself so much guys that's so fun and
the pictures turned out really well too
if it's a party look you know we got to
throw some false lashes in here these
are my demi wispies from ardell and so
on perfect makes the exact same style if
you can't find ardell lashes and for a
more in-depth lash tutorial i do have a
video called false lashes 101 that'll
take you every step of the way
in great detail more detailed and you
might even want so I think I might have
been hungry when I went to bed last
night because I had a dream that I was
in a spaghetti eating contest and I was
training and it seems like years past
this would be like like like it was an
Olympian or something for training for
something really big and then I went
through the competition and I won and it
was really exciting and my family was
really proud of me and
I left to go on tour and like I toured
the world I don't remember exactly where
I was but we were in sort of like a
flying saucer type thing so we would
just like touch down random places these
are the kinds of dreams I have on a
regular basis it's like analyze that for
me okay I just thought of this cuz it
was on TV
not all my thoughts are completely
random in this video but you guys know
that Carrie Underwood is now gonna be
the one singing the Sunday Night
Football song for NBC I was really
excited about that because I freaking
love Carrie Underwood but it used to be
Faith Hill and I really like Faith Hill
too but do you guys know like why the
change was made did did faith decide to
step down on her own or did like the
executives decide they wanted a change
or something like that I don't know but
I mean I'm a huge Carrie Underwood fan
so I'm down with it but I just didn't
know like what prompted it but I am
excited for football just in general to
begin I know pre seasons been going on
but now college is starting and soon
we'll be into regular season NFL which
go Rams then I'm gonna do kind of a lot
on my lower lashes so I'm using
something that definitely doesn't smudge
on me whatsoever and this is the
covergirl LashBlast water-resistant
mandatory mascara face
almost forgot something super cool I was
planning to do
it's my lorac 3d liquid lustre shake it
up I love this stuff this is so fun for
like a party look or a really glam look
you got going on it's got a little
dropper I just put a little bit like a
drop source there on my hand okay then
you could use a brush I just kind of use
my finger then it out just a little bit
get a little on there and this looks so
gorgeous just padded right on the center
of your lid oh the sparkle come on I
would have done this before the false
lashes by the way I would have done it
just like right after I did my eye
shadow had I remembered I'm getting too
caught up and you know stories about my
dreams and Canadian Geese and all that
Hey
oh I think you have the wrong number
oh that's okay bye-bye for some reason I
just assumed that with styler it's like
is this mic
no not mic if I'm gonna go to a party I
want like a long wearing lip color that
I don't have to tend to too much and I
really like the Jordana twists and
shines
I like the Revlon bomb stains that were
kind of like this as well but I feel
like these um have the staying power but
they feel a little bit more smooth shade
it's called um honey love so it's gonna
be a pink that's not too loud go over my
lash line just a bit here okay so this
is what my hair is looking like real
smooth on the top and then it's got
these waves or at the bottom I think I
really liked that it was very easy and
actually a little quicker to do than
what I normally do I've got this
necklace from forever 21 really cute
it's got a little gym there these
earrings also from forever 21 kind of
playing off this golden shine we've got
going on on the lids so I'm out of space
on the memory card right now so thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this look and I'll see you in
the next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
