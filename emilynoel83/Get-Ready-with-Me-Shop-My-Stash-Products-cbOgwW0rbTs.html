combining a couple of video ideas today
it's going to be a get ready with me but
I'm going to be using shut my stash
products so I just redid my top makeup
drawer that's what I've been doing over
the past few months I had missed a month
in there with just so many new products
coming in I was just really overwhelmed
with a lot of the new drugstore stuff
but generally speaking what I'm trying
to do is go through and shout my stash
it might be old products it might be
some newer things that I just really
want to make a point to use and I put
them down here in my top makeup drawer
underneath this desk and that way
throughout the month whenever I open
that drawer I will be you know prompted
to get some use out of some of these
products so I thought it would be fun to
do this video get ready with me style
and just pull out these products and
tell you about them as I go and then at
the end we'll take a closer look and
I'll show you what all exactly is in
there so the first thing I'm going to
put on my skin is actually a new product
that I want to make a point to use it's
the Smashbox photo finish primer oil it
looks a lot like that Sonia Kashuk oil
that I've been using but I'm kind of
wondering what's gonna make this a
primer oil but I'm just gonna work this
around any really dry areas especially I
hope this helps out my like under eye
area inner corners around my brows I've
been seeing kind of dry there lately
okay I've given that a little time to
sink in I mean my skin does feel soft it
feels very hydrated but I'm still kind
of wondering what makes that primer oil
you know other than just any other kind
of one what else this is my ELF acne
fighting foundation whether or not you
have acne I still think this is a really
great coverage just unexpectedly good I
wear it in the shade buff and it's just
a really nice product nice texture very
like velvety soft on the skin but I kind
of set it aside and haven't gotten much
use out of it lately so just kind of
roughly dab that all over and then I got
this new sponge this is the up-and-up
Beauty Blender from Target and it's I've
moistened it you know I'm dampen it
water and it still feels so hard I swear
this is like the hardest blender type
sponge I've ever used like I I don't
feel like I am enjoying this at all
this could not be further from the feel
of my Real Techniques sponge or my
Beauty Blender and I had a hunch it was
going to be that way so I went ahead and
dampened about my Real Techniques sponge
so I could pull this in mm-hm
this feels so nice and soft
can do a little under-eye correcting and
I have been just a slave to my a benefit
erase face so I pulled out my Bobbi
Brown corrector in bisque which I also
love you know it's great I just you get
in the habit and sometimes when you're
in a hurry just reach for the same thing
over and over again so I have pulled
this into my shop my stash drawer so I
can use it more
I do use these a lot faster than erase
paste though I gotta say there is just
not as much product in these little guys
and then I got the micro mini from
target's up and up line I showed this on
snapchat but there's it's a two pack
I've dampened this one it doesn't seem
to have hardly grown at all like the
micro mini actual Beauty Blender the
little green sponge that really grows
this gosh it's just so hard you know
just feels like this little rock-hard
sponge that I'm trying to make blend
something that doesn't want to do you're
cute you're just not doing a good job
bringing in the micro mini uh-huh what a
difference
dang I wish those would have been better
I also shop my stash for this guy
anybody remember me talking about this
this BH Cosmetics color correcting
palette I can see on sephora's website
like color correcting is going nuts
there are so many products that do that
kind of thing so I thought I might just
pull this in for old times sake I'm not
so big on the greenish color correctors
but I am going to use these kind of
peachy colors up here we're going to use
this more like concealer I'm just gonna
dab this on those areas that I really
want to brighten up
these concealers they do feel nice and
creamy but they're just a little on the
dry side so I'm interested to see how
they respond to baking
and I'm gonna take the micro-mini I
think this texture of concealer will
really benefit from this so how have you
guys been doing lately I feel like we
haven't done that like they get ready
with me type thing in a while
least that's the way it feels for me I
am just yearning to do some periscoping
more often ever since I did that when
David was here it was so much fun
so I really want to get back into that
kind of things more live stuff I don't
know if morning's will work better or
you know maybe some morning just while
I'm doing my makeup my honestly be the
best way to go another shot my stash
thing this is my laura mercier secret
brightening powder I hadn't been trying
this very much lately to bake the under
eyes so I thought why not pull that out
and give it a go I just popped the flat
side of my Real Techniques sponge into
that and I'll just dab it over this
concealer
so while that's kind of baking this is
normally when I do my brows and I shot
my stache for this wet and wild color
icon brow pencil it's in the shade
brunettes do it better
sorry so a nice dark brown I use this a
little bit but not enough I kind of
forgot what I thought about it so I
thought it'd be a good product to pull
back in to the rotation it's a lot
softer than I thought it would be but it
is very dark so I feel like I'm gonna
have to really you know go easy
we're gonna continue on with this brow
drama I don't recall really loving this
product because I didn't understand why
there was like a little brush that you
couldn't ever reach like he can't really
reach that side of the brush because
this is so bulbous I hate that word
sorry
so now I'm just dusting away some of the
powder eNOS from that secret brightening
powder
I think that concealer really should
have been a bit more emollient for that
kind of process because the area is
looking just a little more textured than
I would like but that's okay we'll move
on I shot my stash for this powder from
Physicians Formula
it's the mineral where oh so radiant
powder and creamy natural I really like
this powder it's just a nice texture
there is some coverage to it and let's
see I'll pull in my ELF complexion brush
and I'm just gonna lightly dust this
over the rest of my face that didn't get
set with anything and then some bronzer
Bahama Mama why not this is a really
deep bronzer from the balm you don't
need a lot of it that's why I'm gonna
have this product forever I will never
hit man I don't think but I'm just going
to tap into that a little bit and
lightly pull it around my hairline
you
I had the best dinner last night on
Fridays we like to get food from this
really good Thai restaurant where we
live and I was on a chicken pad thai
kick for quite a while but more recently
it's been all about the pineapple fried
rice not only do they put pineapple in
it but there's cashews Oh the cashews
the cashews like make it for me and
there's chicken and shrimp it's so good
and they give such a massive portion I
feel like I can eat on that for like
three meals seriously and the egg rolls
the egg rolls are fantastic when you're
eating at a place that does egg rolls
like I think that's very important to
the experience of the meal it's got to
be a good egg roll and these are like
fabulous plus the sauce that you dip the
egg rolls in that might be just as
important I know that's what you guys
tuned in to hear about you were just
hoping for some food talk right and I
don't care if it's breakfast time you
know what I'm gonna go down and do after
I finish this video I'm gonna eat some
leftovers I'm gonna use a color pop
blush I hadn't really been digging into
these too much this is in the shade
birthday suit I think it's a that's a
satin finish and you know it doesn't
seem too bold but I recall really liking
this in the past when I used it
actually with this shade you know it's
not so intense so I kind of prefer the
application with the finger the small
stipple brush can be nice for some of
the more bold shades in the colour-pop
line
oh yeah going for that chrissy teigen
cheek effect you know what I'm talking
about she's got the best cheeks in the
business does she not every time I watch
that fab life show I'm always like her
cheeks you know great observation
all right let's call it a day there I'm
torn I got a couple things I don't
really know what to do here I've got
this you way luminizing liquid
highlighter I actually have a lot of
products from this line that I want to
start trying more of and working in this
is in the shade nude light so I'm gonna
there it all came out I'm gonna dab a
little bit of that onto the back of my
hand first and since the small stipple
isn't really clean I'm gonna use this
high cheek bone highlighter from Sigma
and kind of just paint a little bit of
this onto the tops of the cheekbones
it's a subtle blow very subtle but
pretty I find that highlight is one of
the hardest things sometimes to get to
really translate onto camera like
sitting here in real life I'll feel like
wow I've applied plenty of highlight and
then even in my little screen here I'll
think it looks like okay that's enough
you know you're good and then I look
back on my video when I'm editing and I
think I can't hardly even see it anymore
so I think sometimes it takes a lot then
I'm determined to get use out of this
thing I don't know how many times I've
shot my stash for this item I have you
know tried to use it I just I struggled
with this but here's what I want to do I
think I want to take this one in the
center with it which is incandescent
light it looks like the brightest and I
know these aren't like technically
highlights like you can use these all
over the face but I do just kind of want
to focus that one right in this zone
because it seems like the brightest and
yeah that's a pretty that's a pretty
effect I think it's kind of clinging to
the doing Asst of that liquid highlight
and then it has been recommended to me
to take this dim light shade and just
dust that all over the face like
apparently that gives a really pretty
look just lightly
so we're kind of just judging the look
as I go because this is obviously a
combination of products that I don't use
every day I've shot my stash for old
things new things and we're just kind of
seeing how it goes the BH concealer
palette did let me down a little bit
because I feel like I don't know I can
just see a little bit more than I
usually see once I'm done concealing and
baking and all that and I think it was
maybe just a little bit on the dry side
for that method am i pulling my fix+
this is the coconut scent I've used a
lot of my rose scent that this came in
getting in my coffee I don't know what
that's gonna do so I have been having a
strong urge to do a wearable blue eye
and so I made sure to kind of shut my
stash for a few things that would allow
that these NYX prismatic eyeshadows have
not been getting nearly enough love or
use in my collection for as long as I've
had them I've got blue jeans well blue
jeans and this is called girl talk so
both are highly shimmery all the shades
in that line are like very very metallic
and then check out this old fave the
Physicians Formula matte quad in quartz
quartet how perfect is that going to be
because you've got this cool like crease
color the mob this is even like a light
blue this is gonna be fun I didn't
really pull a special primer so I'm just
gonna use my Milani eyeshadow primer
this is just the best eyeshadow primer
so I know what I'm going for here I'm
going for blue pop on the lids so I'm
just going to do a soft crease first I
think I'll use this color right here I
have a feeling I'm gonna fall in love
with this matte quad all over again
these shadows are just so nice the thing
is they can be kind of hard to find like
you won't just see these quads
everywhere where physician's formula is
sold I have seen them in person in Ulta
and I think I ordered one of my quads
because there's one called Canyon
classics I think it is and that's more
of a warm very neutral quad but I love
this quartz quartet
I think I'll use some of this shade this
is a great blended out type you know
highlight that doesn't look too
highlighter ish these can kick up some
dust and just be warned but it's a small
price to pay because they're easy to
blend
they're pigmented they're all mad if
that's what you're after
now this bluejeans color I don't think
this is gonna need any kind of a base
like I am
look at that it's gonna Pat it on with
my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
it's not a really bold royal-blue
and it's also not the frosty baby blue
that I would use all the time in high
school so this is kind of a cool color
so Belle is big into Disney songs like
if you can just pull up some Disney
songs on YouTube she is all about the
music and the song was currently going
through my head I always have a Disney
song in my head now these days why do
you parents are probably like yeah
welcome to my world but right now it's
that song the Ursula sings on the Little
Mermaid poor unfortunate soul yeah yeah
that it may you send us Girl Talk shade
and my little inner corner e46 brush
just pop it around here this look really
makes me want to dive headfirst into
some more of those NYX singles that I've
got I'm kind of torn now I want to keep
a lot of blue on the lid but I do want
something just a little darker out there
so I think I will go with this color
just a bit this is a nice way to if you
feel like you know the shadow you've
popped all over your lid is kind of
colorful or you know if you just feel
like that's a bit much for you always
have that deeper shade that you can just
work into the outer part and something
about that I don't know it just makes
the lid shade look a little less stark
sometimes
now this is a liner from the balm it's
the mr. right now line and they have a
nude shade it's called Brian I think
this would work nicely you can't even
see it it's so nude it just matches my
skin and I'm gonna put that in here on
the lower inner rim
next move I'm going to smudge a little
bit of this color right down here
I forgot to put lip balm on earlier I do
have this Kate Moss it's a lip balm have
you guys seen this it's got the little
pink riding on here and it's just a
clear balm what does it smell like can't
can't decide a little bit like apricot
where is it apricot I've got an eye
liner that you may have heard me talk
about before it's the L'Oreal voluminous
superstar I didn't love this shape of
this liner I just don't like pear shaped
tips to my eyeliner I like it more
pointed but this isn't as bad as some
that I've recently tried and I'm just
kind of looking to use it up get some
use out of it so I'm going to take this
across my upper lash line
mÃ¡scaras I've pulled two one brand-new
that I want to use one older the older
one for the lower lash line is lash
discovery and then this is lash obsessed
from Palladio amped up length and volume
I'm kind of liking what I see with the
brush so far tapered tip not too
oversized the bristles aren't too too
long
I kind of do want to pull in a lash for
this look these are the Cara
or Cara brand the number 205 I think I
got them from that shop miss a website
which means they were only a dollar they
are a nice lash for length
for lips we're gonna have a major
throwback here I'm going to use Jordana
easy liner in tawny
first off which I mean the easy liners
those are like some of the first lip
liners I ever really got into and tawny
is always one of those that's just
really nice if you know you're going to
do a neutral lip
that's a pretty color just adds this but
I'm gonna bring in something else when
did everybody decide they were too cool
for the Revlon lip butters I mean these
at one point in time were the best thing
since sliced bread and then I never hear
anything about him again so I'm going
back to my lip butters and I pulled out
two I've got pink truffle which is a
really nice kind of neutral dusty rose
and then I also pulled out brown sugar
which appears to have been barely
touched by me I'm gonna try a little of
the brown sugar first that's kind of
pretty
and then maybe I'll just cuz it's here
and it's open you see a little of this
on the outside I don't know if that's
making any difference not really pink
truffle is really like the same shade as
that tawny lip liner so just
re-evaluating the look I think I want
just a light bit again of the Bahama
Mama bronzer
and then I think I'll add just to hear
more of this lightest like hourglass
shade right up in here that was just
really pretty I don't want to lose that
glow my hair I'm not really sure what I
want to do with it just yet so I think
I'll just pull it off to the sides like
so but that is my finished look um thank
you guys so much for watching it was
kind of fun to reveal what's into my
shop my stash drawer as I do a tutorial
or a get ready with me it's kind of fun
to do it that way but I will leave you
with a quick look at what else is inside
now maybe it was the fact that I knew I
was going to be doing a get ready with
me and I needed to do a full face that I
shot my stash for a lot of things but
that's okay it'll give me a lot of
material for you know the coming month
to really try to use stuff I want to use
this up this is a Mallee perfect prep
poreless primer I love it but I've just
had it for a while it needs to get used
up that elf foundation that I used today
I've got a pure minerals tended
moisturizer I pulled my it cosmetics CCS
in the illumination and the bronzer cuz
I plan to mix those into different and
other foundations I might use elf stick
foundations I had one of these it very
quickly developed an odd scent and so I
tossed it and repurchased two more so I
got one that I can contour with and one
that can be more like foundation slash
concealer there's a highlighter pen I
use this is a Palladio contour stick the
secret brightening powder a few
concealers that I grabbed down on the
one I used today some buy buy under eyes
and Mac the BH palette this is the it
cosmetics my sculpted face I thought
that would be a major throwback contour
palette because it was really the first
palette I ever knew of to be a
contouring palette keeping these out
because I never got around to using
those lower fake lashes last month my
friend Norma sent me some gosh and
Annabelle products so shout out to the
Canadians I'm gonna use those got the
color pop blushes my Laura Geller gilded
honey that I really have not used enough
of some NYX singles I pulled out both of
my physicians formula matte quads in
terms of larger palettes
I wanted to pull out a naked palette
because I just haven't used my naked
very very much and also the audacity in
Paris palette from Lancome I kind of
wrote that one off very quickly I didn't
think it was great quality for the cost
but I kind of want to take it on more as
a challenge and Alan try to get some
good looks out of it a bunch of lip
products including this Mac patent
polish lip pencil I think that's what
it's called a couple of lip liners I've
got some lip butters in there and some
Rimmel Kate Moss products a very loved
and rediscovered color riche gloss from
l'oreal i think that was in the saucy
mauve shade i believe that was the name
couple of brow products a Stila mascara
that was hiding within one of my
palettes I've got some liners in here
from the balm and color pop and then
those two mascaras that I used today and
then these are a couple of cream shadows
from Shu a oops
goodbye from my top makeup drawer thank
you for watching I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
