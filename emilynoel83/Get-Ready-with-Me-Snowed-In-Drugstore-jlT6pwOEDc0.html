this is gonna be a get ready with me
video I haven't done one of these in
what seems like a really long time so I
thought it would be fun to do one and I
kind of like to give these a theme so
it's going to be all drugstores some of
these products are gonna be some new
things that I'm just trying out and I
thought it would be fun to just play
around with them today and I figured I'd
turn the camera on and capture the whole
process so it is a really snowy day here
I'm in southern Illinois and this whole
winter we haven't gotten more than just
like a dusting of snow here or there and
now I think we've got about 6 inches out
there it's been a nice day cuz Tyler was
able to be home from work like a lot of
stuff was shut down today so we've just
been having fun around the house we had
some nachos I did this salsa crock pot
chicken thing and that's so great I love
doing things in the crock pot that can
be different kinds of like taco type
fillings I did something with beef
around Superbowl time and it was great
in tacos or in a quesadilla or on nachos
and now I'm yesterday I did the same
kind of thing with chicken and so we've
been having the leftovers there but this
is not a food video this is a makeup
video I'm using this rule BB cream here
you'll notice it looks different because
this is the radiance version and the
regular version was featured in the
Emily awards for the second year
straight for best drugstore BB cream and
now they've got a match and a radiance
so I've gotten both of those different
kinds and I am trying them out I really
want to see how they compare to the
original and this is just my second time
using the radiance
you know might have a little blow to it
but I'm not picking up on a whole lot of
anything real drastic here and I'm not
really loving the way that's blending in
with my brush either the first time I
applied I used fingers and actually that
might be my preferred method with this
because it was looking a little bit
streaky with the brush and normally this
Real Techniques buffing brush everything
works really well with that but not so
much this product I guess however John
that's pretty decent I don't know if
it's quite as much as the regular one
I'll have to do like some side-by-side
pictures at some point and really
compare next I'm using this NYX compact
here is the conceal correct
contour
these concealers seem to have pretty
good coverage to them but there's kind
of a thicker drier feel to them than
what I was expecting so sometimes with
products like that I'll get them blend
it out and I'll feel like they're
covering well but sometimes they'll
start to kind of look a little dry in
you know these kinds of greasy areas
later in the day so I want to keep an
eye on that one I'm still looking a
little dark in here so I'm actually
using this kind of salmony color there
around the inner corner that's doing
pretty well actually
I think someone's car is like stuck in a
ditch down the street or something I'm
hearing sounds like tires are spinning
I'm just gonna kind of press over this
concealer so it melts into my skin a
little more the thickness of it makes me
kind of want to make sure it's looking
natural and got a little bit of my elf
mineral booster and shear here that I'm
gonna set that with and the way I do
these get ready with me videos I'm gonna
just talk throughout that's always just
seemed like the most natural way to do
these for me so sometimes I'm talking
about the makeup sometimes I'm just
talking about other stuff
now I know people up in Boston are
probably not too excited about the snow
that I think continues to be hitting
your area but I have been really excited
for the snowfall that we're getting here
it's just it takes me back to feeling
like a kid whenever we get significant
amounts of snow I think about what it
felt like to have those snow days you
know and my dad was actually the
principal during that time and I think
he was equally excited what a snow day
would roll around so it just makes me
remember those good old days as they say
but actually today it's Presidents Day
so lot of schools were already closed um
I've got a new bronzer here that I'm
trying out it's from Revlon and check
out the shading it's bronze illah to me
that seems like kind of a negative terms
like you know someone who is way too
bronzed it might be a bronze illa I
don't know the overall tone is kind of
warm I feel like I can get away with it
as a contour but it's also the kind of
color that just sort of warms up my
whole skin tone I think with bronzer you
control a lot of the intensity and a lot
of the overall look just with your
application like you can judge the
product all you want the way it looks in
the pan but I think it really comes down
to like how do you plan to use that do
you want to apply it in a really
concentrated way with like a small stiff
brush or do you just want to use a
fluffy brush kind of like I'm doing and
dust everywhere
that was a new Fergie blush that I'm
wearing I picked this up at Walgreens
it's in the shade brush with danger so a
really bright matte hot pink and then
I'm giving this product a second chance
because I've heard a lot of good things
about it but I I don't know I wasn't
nuts about it when I first used it it's
the chic luminosity glow powder from
Sonia Kashuk and it's one of those
things where I like ice watch it I can't
see much going on there but I'm just
gonna I don't know apply a little bit
here kind of on the tops of my cheeks
see if I get a little glow that blush
was definitely matte so if I see any
glow it's got to be coming from this
product I think I don't know I can't
tell if it's really doing anything and
then this is my L'Oreal infallible
setting spray that I've been messing
with hmm I know it says to spritz like a
zillion times and a certain pattern on
your face like do a tea do an X but I
just I feel like that's way too much on
my face so I just do like a couple
spritzes
just a quick like explanation on the eye
look I'm using this Ulta gilded gold
palette they have a gilded gold and a
rose gold let's see last weekend I was
playing around with the rose gold one
and had pretty surprisingly good results
so now I'm testing out loops testing out
this one it had definitely has some
elements here that remind me of The
Naked palette and on the bottom it's
matte top row is shimmer so I thought
I'd play around with that today and I'm
going to be using this essence stays no
matter what I pencil and shadow as a
base and the shade on this it's kind of
metallic it's called gorgeous grey
I don't know about you guys but Ulta
brand products have been pretty hit and
miss for me over the years and I feel
like more miss than hit probably overall
but this palette is actually doing okay
for me I kinda had underestimated that
dark shade that I'm sticking in the
crease here and I got I think a little
more than I was expecting over on the
right side blending over that
so I don't know if you guys did anything
fun on Valentine's Day but we went out
for pizza with some friends and we took
Bill out with us and she's actually been
doing really good in restaurant settings
which I'm so impressed because I would
just think you know for a baby that
might be just different enough from your
home life to really freak you out a
little bit but she's been doing really
well I think she likes the people
watching and there's just a lot that I
think grabs a baby's attention in a
place like that before they really even
have time to fear it you know at least
at this stage of the game a couple of
different things I'm trying here on the
lower lash line I've got a teal blue and
then like more of a royal blue this
royal blues from Jane and then this one
is from the Fergie line it is in the
shade hyper sky
I'm kind of loving the way this looks
how fun what better way to spend a day
cooped up inside just playing with
makeup take a little bit of this light
shade from the palette and kind of
brighten up here to tie the upper lash
line and the lower lash line together a
little bit I'm going to take some more
of this shade and just kind of blend it
a little bit down here
so I had tweeted the other night that I
was enjoying some hot chocolate with
peppermint marshmallows they're so good
I I'm a big big fan of the chocolate
mint combo I love like mint chocolate
chip ice cream and it tastes so good
with hot chocolate too and I found those
marshmallows in at Walmart and they were
just right in there with the regular
marshmallow lineup I guess you'd say and
they are so stinking good they're just
mini marshmallows they're like pink and
white swirled looking and they're so
good I would highly highly recommend
them for the lips I've got a bunch of
these NYX high voltage lipsticks and
this is in the shade flutter kiss and it
seems to be just kind of a rosy
bordering on neutral maybe a little bit
of a like a mauve type color but I don't
know I kind of like it with this look
it's kind of cool toned and I think
that's kind of working with the eyes and
then my hair I just washed it last night
and I tell you guys I have been dealing
with some unusually oily hair and it
didn't really kick in I would say the
first month after having Belle I didn't
notice any of it but the second month
was when it really ramped up it's like I
would freshly wash it and then by the
next day I would notice just this way
way increased oil production and I'm not
noticing it so much anymore but I've
tried so many things you guys like
really clarifying shampoos normally that
Neutrogena anti residue shampoo would
work wonders for that kind of an issue
but even that wasn't working I looked up
online to rinse your hair with Listerine
I'd done that and that worked like
initially to get the hair really clean
but still I think it was just the oil
production was really kicking up just
recently I've been using this suave
two-in-one shampoo and conditioner and
I'm sure leave it to the most random
thing you might pick up to use but
that's been actually working a little
better either that's working better or
my body chemistry is just changing
somewhat
I'm sure my hormones are just in a
really weird place after giving birth a
few months ago that is it everyone thank
you guys for joining me for this get
ready with me video these are a lot of
fun to do I hope you guys are safe
wherever you are dealing with the snow
and everything I think I hear someone
downstairs just now waking up from their
nap time so I will see you guys later
