probably do because somebody actually
tweeted me and said they liked that I
wave at the start of my videos so hi
good to see you um this is gonna be a
little get ready with me video I'm
really it's one of those where I'm not
quite sure what direction I want to go
in I know I've had some requests to do
kind of a golden e I look so I thought
this might be a good time to throw that
in but beyond that I'm just kind of
flying by the seat of my pants and we'll
see how it all turns out aren't those
the funnest days makeup-wise when you
can just kind of sit down and it's like
you know no particularly have to come
out with it's just whatever you feel
like so I've got my face moisturized and
I creamed up and primed
I used the Garnier five-second blur I've
got a review on that actually really
enjoy that as a primer and as kind of a
pore refining type thing now that it's
making my pores smaller but it's making
it look that way so I'll take it I'm
using my Estee Lauder Double Wear light
today so you could maybe get a little
idea of how that goes on compared to the
regular double where I have intensity
2.0 so I'm just gonna start off there
so there's what we're working with on
the coverage of the double where light
definitely lighter than the regular
double where oh you think
double where light might be lighter I
really need to do a more in-depth review
I would like to compare the different
levels because I actually have the
double wear BB which would be even
lighter than this and then the light the
regular and the maximum coverage face
and body so I think would be fun to
maybe compile a video where I've got
each of those on at different points and
show the difference so you still think
this has really good coverage and it is
buildable you know you can add a little
more here and there to places where you
want a little more coverage but overall
like from a skin evening point of view
like it really has a nice finish and
just a nice natural blues videos by the
way when I do them they're not like a
full-out tutorial because I'm kind of
just talking and not necessarily talking
about makeup throughout some places are
sped up some places I'm just blabbering
on so in case you're not familiar with
my get ready with me that's what they
turn out to be like but I also wanted to
give a little special mention to
something different I'm using today I
picked this up recently it's the hard
candy glamoflauge light now the
glamoflage and the tube and the squeezy
tube is like a really really full
coverage concealer and so I was really
interested to try this one out and it's
got like two tones see how one's more
peachy ones a little more skin tone or
like maybe a little yellowish undertone
and I got it in what's a shade light
it's a pretty good coverage with that
we'll see how you know it wears
throughout the damn let's set it with a
teeny bit of my fare mineral summer
bisque
but is it the least bit spring-like or
any of you guys are because we had just
a beautiful weekend you know little
breeze mid 70s just gorgeous weather for
being outside and then it went and got
real cold and we didn't have the snow
down here in southern Illinois but I
know some people north of us had to deal
with that and it just seems so strange
here's the funny thing I have a wreath
on my door and I wanted to change it out
but there is a nest birds have built
these little I think it's probably like
little sparrows or something just teeny
tiny birds from what I can see that have
been in the area have been going around
there and they built a nest and I opened
the door one day because I'm like ok I
don't think I've noticed them around
here lately I'm just gonna you know go
ahead and change the wreath and I look
in there and there is an egg in the nest
so therefore I cannot change the wreath
right there's two people expecting they
don't have my hat sir one person one
verse so I will be very interested to
see what happens with that bird
situation but we had my mom and dad and
my sister and brother-in-law came down
over the weekend excuse me not to burp
there held it in for you guys but I was
like shut the door gently there's a nest
with an egg Hinnant on my door um so
anyways I using some powder here this
alum a smart shade loose
there's something so like rejuvenating
about having your family over to visit
for a weekend you know it's just like I
mean you get very caught up in your
day-to-day activities and routines and
feeling of being busy and then you kind
of just get that moment to really relax
and hang around with the people who know
you best and it's just there's something
very very comforting very relaxing about
that and I just really appreciate those
times and just you know laughing my head
off with my sister like old time it's
like you're always glad to have those
moments but I think as you grow up more
you appreciate them even more so really
really enjoyed that weekend
this is a new blush that I'm trying out
Tarte sent the see how the packaging's
like a little different than usual and I
think it's a newly-released shade it's
called captivating and it's like a matte
peach but like a really pigmented peach
so I'm using that today
this is a kit by the way that I just
recently reviewed on my Express channel
this Too Faced brow envy I've really
been liking this and I just do the
little setting wax part first and then I
go through and do some of the blonde
like right here on the inner part and
then some of the brunette on the outer
part and then there's a neat little like
matte creamy highlight you can put there
under your brows so the whole banana
here the whole banana everything you
need brow wise is in there
so the pregnancy has been going along
well I'm shooting this on a Wednesday
and every Wednesday I turn over to a new
week so it's 18 weeks today I can't
believe it everything's been going
really well I've been feeling really
good especially into this second
trimester you know things have been
going great I've really been doing my
best to eat well and it kind of you know
well-rounded meals you know trying to
take in a few more veggies and stuff
salads sweet potatoes and stuff but I
will tell you the guilty pleasure I have
been just craving all the time
and it's the Panera broccoli cheddar
soup
it's so good it's so good like it's
somehow during this pregnancy I mean I
always thought that soup was good but
now it seems like 10 times better even I
love taking the bread and like breaking
it up and mixing it into soon like I
turn into a psycho every time I talk
about it's like I talked about it in my
16 week pregnancy vlog and I was looking
back to the video and I like was
astonished with how my face like took
over this look as if I've been possessed
but I don't know of the Lord of cheddar
broccoli soon it's so freakin good
anyway I'm doing a golden e look by
request so I'm going into half-baked
here
the combo I've never used together with
my naked palette the gold and then the
kind of plummy color called hustle but
they're gorgeous together
deepening this up just a little more a
little more purple in here
you ever get into like an eye shadow
zone I feel like that's what I was in
there well I was just doing this it's
like almost forget the cameras on just
keep going shadow to shadow brush to
brush
you know how you find out when certain
makeup brushes are important to you when
you feel like you've lost one and your
reaction to thinking you've lost that
brush will tell you how much important
place that brush holds in your
collection because I thought I lost my
Real Techniques fine liner brush the
other day oh I just could not find it
anywhere I searched I have three little
cups here I've got a little spinny thing
and then like another cup over here for
teeny tiny brushes and I couldn't find
it in any of them and then I checked
this guy again that holds a lot of my
Real Techniques stuff and it was down in
there you know getting lost in the
shuffle but I was really concerned and I
was contemplating you know getting
online and ordering it again but I
thought you know I haven't done a lot
traveling lately I'll give it a little
bit of a chance to turn up but this is
my essence dice already say that as its
gel liner midnight in Paris
fabulous liner
you guys sending stuff to my p.o box by
the way I just recently got one cuz I II
I've just been asked like crazy to go
ahead and do that
and I mean you're sweet
letters have just absolutely made me
laugh made me cry I mean I love hearing
the stories behind the people who are
watching these videos you know and you
guys have just shared so much with me
and I just want you to know as I've said
I mean if you've had if you've sent me
something that's had your return address
on it I've written back to you and told
you this but like I really really
appreciate you guys just just taking the
time to watch a video you know you don't
owe me one more thing I don't want you
to feel like you do but it really has
been amazing to just kind of open up
these notes and sit down and just gain a
whole new appreciation for you many of
you have mentioned you know that's kind
of amazing the connection you feel like
you build with somebody through a
computer screen but it's it's true and
it's real and you know I am so so glad
that you find the videos worth your time
and that you would take time to like
pour your heart out to me in a note just
really I don't know I don't know that I
have a word to say it but I feel very
very grateful and I'm so thankful for
each and every one of you and I'm not
just saying that I'm not just throwing
that out there is some little like thank
you so much but okay I I truly truly um
from the bottom of my heart like you
guys really make my day in so many
different ways all the time so thank you
and this would be a bad time to start
crying always something's got to mess up
the Matt's Gary got sneeze you got a cry
no stain strong it's like they're just
in the closet but that would be just too
much work to get up I feel like I need
to do something a little extra here you
know I'm just looking at my shadow like
I wanna I want to buff something up a
little higher you know what will it be
what will it be
I think maybe I'll take buck where's
buck on here right there
I'm gonna take that with my little wispy
e36 just barely any on there and just
take it up a little bit more give this
look a little bit more of a fade if you
will
if you won't it's still happen that's
pretty that shade shears out very nicely
then but and on the waterline I think
I'm gonna add a little brightness here
sorry it's really hard for me to look
into my camera and make sure I'm doing
this in just the right spot so I managed
to duck down a little here but this is
the Rimmel scandaleyes and nude just for
a little bit of something extra there
right enough widen the eyes a bit and
then on lips I'm kind of kicking myself
because I use this a lot but it's just
so dang pretty and it's my Sonia Kashuk
shine Lux sheer and the shade is sheer
pink lust and it's just a beautiful like
kind of soft peachy color with the
prettiest like glossy finish whenever
I'm thinking nude this is seriously like
my favorite thing to grab cuz look at
that look at that gorgeous shine that's
coming off of a lipstick and I have a
blog where I tried on and showed like
every shade of these that I have it was
totally one of those like you find a
shirt you love you buy it in every color
if it was that kind of situation with me
for these I had them in almost every
color and I just love the formula
alrighty everyone so there's my finished
look kind of soft and springy um I guess
that's the way it turned out
like I said I didn't really have any
kind of roadmap for this look I just
knew I was gonna do something a little
bit golden on the eyes and it looks like
everything else kind of followed suit
with a peachy like soft neutral vibe as
far as the rest of my look I wanted to
find some cute coral earrings but
apparently I don't own any so I just put
on these they've got some gold hardware
on there and then kind of like a
greenish type turquoise it very much you
match you with the shirt but you know I
don't care look at this Burk it swinging
out like crazy someone used to just like
press that back and we can give you a
look at the bump here there
there it is there's my little bump oh
thank you guys so much for watching this
get ready with me in requesting these
kinds of videos they're really fun to do
and if you haven't seen my lipstick
dupes I recently put out a lipstick
dupes video ten lipsticks that I found
dupes for high-end lipsticks as I found
the drugstore dupes for so if you want
