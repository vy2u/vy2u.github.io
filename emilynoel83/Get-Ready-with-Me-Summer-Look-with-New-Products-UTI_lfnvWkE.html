ready with me video today in case you're
not familiar with this kind of video
it's not really a tutorial you are
seeing makeup application and I'm
talking throughout sometimes about
random things because I really treat
this literally as if you were getting
ready with me what it would be like so
it's just a more casual basically makeup
videos when I have a lot of new products
mostly new products here that I want to
use so I thought we could kind of see
how that goes together so make this kind
of a lightweight summertime look that
would be really appropriate for the
season so fourth of July weekend just
happened I hope you guys had great
holiday weekends we had some family down
and it was just so much fun we got to
well Tyler did a bunch of golfing with
my dad we went out to one of the area
wineries it was just tons of fun all
around mom and I went shopping she did
like this huge clothing haul unexpected
like just kept running into great deals
so I gotta say I'm kind of starting the
week just a little bit tired and kind of
wishing they were all still here but
you're here with me so that's the good
thing right well I'm gonna get my little
mirror set up here and I'm using the
Almay smart shade CC cream I have the
shade light/medium and so this is a
complexion corrector SPF 35 texture on
this seems to be a little thinner than
say the Rimmel BB cream that I kind of
liked I thought that had nice texture
and just really was almost foundation
like in the way it went on this
definitely has more of a tinted
moisturizer type feel from as I won't
talk through this entire video but my
next new thing I'm really kind of pumped
about this this is from flower Beauty
did you get more line and it's like
these little concealers if you remember
having pencils back in the day that
would push up like this and once you
would use up the lid like you would push
it up from the bottom and get a new a
new piece and so this is three different
concealer shades so they're all stick
concealers you're not getting a ton of
product this is plastic here it's just
this little domed part
that is the concealer so I'm gonna use
this one and just dot over the areas
where I need it
just so you know that's a decent
coverage concealer but it's really
really creamy that could be good you
know for people who don't want to over
dry the under eye area and stuff like
that maybe a little too creamy if you're
gonna use it like a lot around your nose
and you get super oily around your nose
so just something to think about there
this is another product that's not
really new but I love using it it's the
maybelline shine free pressed powder the
shade I have here is golden and I'm just
using this little Sigma the tapered
highlighter brush and it's just nice
because I don't want this powder to go
everywhere I just want it to go where I
want it
so getting back into golfing a little
bit I started hitting balls this past
week in the backyard I'm just working on
my chip shots and stuff like that and
I've never been like really into golfing
and I feel like the last time I kind of
went out to the driving range it didn't
go so well so it kind of ended on a sour
note and I wasn't too excited about
golfing anymore but Tyler's been golfing
a bunch and so I just thought hey let's
see how I'm doing now and actually I
really like improved somehow I think
Golf is a weird sport but I haven't
picked up a club in months and I'm
hitting really consistent straight shots
you know pretty much where I'm aiming
for the most part so I don't know
I love the color of this Stila mango
crush lip and cheek stain I think it's
gorgeous you can put it on there and
then blend it out but for some reason I
always end up getting my finger involved
and I regret it later because it really
does stain and it's hard to get off you
could probably just dot it straight from
you know the applicator and then blend
it out with a like this elf small
stipple brush I love using that and then
kind of keep your finger out of the mix
but I don't know I've got to touch it by
the way this kind of reminds me and the
way it goes on in the way it lasts it
kind of reminds me of benefits cha-cha
tint only I feel like this has more of a
reddish tone to it not quite so like
peachy orange but has a little more red
and as you can see here on my lips it
does have shimmer to it as well but I
kind of want my lips in the end to feel
a little more hydrated then this will
make them feel so I'm using this Korres
pomegranate lip butter I recently got
this after seeing miss flaemm rotc
ingrid talked about it and i thought
that sounds right up my alley so it's
got this reddish tint it just feels so
nice and soft so that's a great thing
for summer
I made some amazing dip over the weekend
a second time I've made it but I found
it on Pinterest and we had it first at
my friend Kayla's bachelorette party
it's called skinny poolside dinner it's
fat-free cream cheese and then you dice
up red pepper - jalapeno peppers I take
out most of the seats and then corn and
it's all mixed together oh and a packet
of ranch dressing mix and I add a little
cayenne pepper as well mmm
so freakin tasty I will have to link to
that recipe so you can try it if you
want to but it's good with like Ritz
crackers it's good with if you've got
like a nice sturdy like wavy Lay's
potato chip or vegetables you know if
you slice up some carrots or you've got
celery or something I've made it a
couple times now and it's gotten rave
reviews from those who have eaten it so
yay I finally found the Enabling color
tattoo pigments I just got a couple and
there was like zero selection they had
all been picked over I was like where
was I how did I miss this but I have
buff and tuff that's this more gold any
color you're gonna see and then this
light kind of highlight type shade is
barely raisin
this look could not be simpler I just
went all over the lid and then just kind
of buffing it back and forth in the
crease
super easy one of this to be kind of
maybe a summer go-to thing with pigments
I get them everywhere then I'm taking
the lighter shade now
I was gonna use my heated lash curler
but I guess that battery's wonderful
I don't know if you've heard any of the
banging noises during this video but our
sump pump recently kind of stopped
working like we had a power outage like
a big storm and then from there on out I
never heard the sump pump clicking on
and even that's basically keeping like
excess moisture of water if you have a
heavy brain keeps the water out of your
crawlspace that's our situation here
anyway
don't ask me too many questions about it
I don't know some pumps but um it's
being we're getting a new one if that's
being installed as we speak
who else is talking about sump pumps and
their get ready with me videos my
goodness okay so here's the finished
look by the way my mom just gave me a
haircut put a bunch more layers up in my
hair see it a little bit more now in my
banks because they were so short and now
you can see those layers coming back I
just went and grabbed this little um
kind of turquoise colored beaded
necklace because I'm loving the way that
looks alongside reds or this this makes
me think of a real watermelon II kind of
color you know on my shirt some stud
earrings my little bracelet here that I
love so much with these big kind of
silvery stones the whole intent
makeup-wise was to just do something
that's really lightweight and natural
for summer and also work in some new
products you may not have seen before if
any of those kind of sparked your
interest and you want to see reviews or
tutorials or just expanded information
on those kind of things let me know so
just want to tell you if you you know
are having company over and you want to
have a little something in your candy
dish cookies and cream kisses so amazing
rave reviews these I don't think these
are anything new but they're cute and
they were just a hit in the candidate
also guys this cotton room spray this
makes everything just smell so fresh and
clean you know if you're trying to kind
of spruce up a guest room and have just
a little finishing touch in there I
think scent is so important and this is
the white bar and concentrated room
spray if the scent is cotton I also love
the island margarita one
but it's just a really like you know it
doesn't take much a couple of sprays of
that in a room really does make a
difference and kind of a lasting
difference I think smells just like
fresh laundry so thanks guys for
watching and I'll talk to you again soon
