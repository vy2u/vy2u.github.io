ready with me video and this one I
thought would be fun to kind of create a
theme for this that was all favorite
products so some of them are like really
old favorites that you've heard me talk
about a lot may may or may not have seen
me actually demonstrate them and then
also going to have maybe some newer
favorites jumping in here and the
priorities for me makeup wise I love
long wearing makeup so this is gonna be
a really long wearing look no it's not
like a 5 minute long get ready with me
because I do like to hop in here and
there and just talk as if you know you
were getting ready with me so I'm just
gonna clip my hair out of my face and
we've got a little culprit here can you
spot him he's right there yep pull
personnel on him this has been my
standby for zits for a long long time so
guys I went and saw the Great Gatsby
yesterday it was so freakin good
like I first off I love Leonardo
DiCaprio I think he's just done
tremendous work apparently still hasn't
won an Oscar but you know whatever I
think he's still amazing I read the book
back senior year of high school we had
to read The Great Gatsby and I really
enjoyed it then and then I actually
enjoyed the original movie with Robert
Redford
so I actually have like a t-shirt that
says the Great Gatsby ins got like that
sort of movie print of on the front of
it so when I heard this was coming out I
was super pumped now there are certain
movies that um like that are in a
certain era and you're kind of like gosh
this makes me want to go back and live
in that time this kind of makes you
watch you watch it and you want to go
back to the 20s you know
jump into my eat pearl cream kick a
bunch of cream products foundations
concealers a mattifier illuminizer and a
blush and I'm just using the concealers
for this look but I'm planning to do
like the actual like her whole reverse
contouring technique with this I need to
do that still on the to-do list still
happen concealers good lo of these
concealers are awesome
here's the problem with hitting pan when
you do sometimes the product cracks a
little bit like I just lost a couple
little bits off of this because see how
it's like just kind of getting so low
that it's cracking some so oh well at
least I'm enjoying the product right
this is the Revlon Photoready bronzer
it's got four shades in it you can use
sort of more toward the deeper bottom
part when you're wanting to contour I
think it's just a really good shade to
do that with yeah I'm really getting
into these days beverage wise green tea
it's supposed to be good about having
like fat burning properties in it or
whatever I don't know I don't really
know what it's got in it but it's
supposed to be really good for you
supposed to like keep you from bloating
Liston I believe it's Lipton is the kind
I've got and I've got a caffeinated
version and a decaf and one is like
dragon fruit - melon or something and
they actually taste pretty good you know
I don't add any sugar or sweetener to it
and I really like it
I was talking about this on beauty
broadcast live last week by the way that
happens Thursday mornings 9:00 a.m.
central on my vlog channel and all the
episodes so to speak are recorded so you
can always go back and watch at that
time doesn't work for you but this past
week I was telling everybody about this
bird's nest that we have it's like
really close to our porch on a little
kind of smallish tree right in front of
our porch and there are little baby
Robins in there and I mean I remembered
seeing at first like I knew there was a
nest there and then one day I saw a bird
just sitting in it and I'm like I bet
she's sitting on eggs you know and then
before I knew it in the next few days
there are little baby birds and like
I've been checking on it so much so I
can go out and look and I can see like
the little robin heads in there like
they got the little beaks open and I
like give me some food and and then you
can see you know the Robin out screwing
around and then bringing stuff back and
feeding them it's just adorable and I
can tell they're getting a little bit
bigger now love that I can actually look
out the window and I have a direct view
to that nest and I can see whatever
those little birds are doing so I'm like
their second mama
although I'm not really doing anything
for them beyond just spying out my
window and creeping on them but whatever
I'm loving this quad so much this is
physician's formula
mat shadow quad I already had Canyon
classics which was something I demoed in
a tutorial recently the three in one
video it's kind of plastic brown beige
sort of colors this one um
this shade actually I don't know if it's
coming off as just gray but this
actually is kind of like a dusty rose
color there's a little bit of pink tone
in that this is like a super light blue
kind of a dark grey and then this is a
great blending color here this sort of
peachy shade so I'm loving me so much
with some primer I love the staying
power so it's a great matte
I look that I just I don't know it can
work for anything this was actually the
I look I was sporting on an Instagram
picture over the weekend and a lot of
people said tutorial please don't fear
the sponge tip you can use these things
they actually pack on the product really
nicely
did a little winged liner but I kind of
like to you know go back to my deeper
shadow or if it was you know another
kind of liner that I used down here on
the lower lash line and it just actually
blend below the wing a little bit I'm
kind of doing a smoky smudgy thing on
the lower lash line so it's nice to draw
that in you know and kind of incorporate
the smudgy feel to the bottom part of
the way well I'm waiting for my lash
curler to heat up I have a wedding
coming up this weekend that I'm going to
be in and I'm gonna be doing my friend
Kaylee's makeup she's bride and so I'm
really excited for that I think it's
gonna be tons of fun and it'll be fun to
take the camera along while I'm there
and then maybe I'm not sure how I'll put
it all together but maybe have a little
recap you know after the wedding and
talk about you know some of the
strategies I used or you know the things
that worked well the past doing a few
weddings I feel like I've really honed
in on a very great long-wearing I look
so I thought that could be something I
could talk about a little bit but time
to curl the lashes
again this was the night outlook that I
tweeted about a couple nights ago and
you could definitely make this less
dramatic if you want to by skipping the
false lashes maybe not lining the inner
waterline area you could just stay with
the smudgy shadow on the outside and you
know make it a little less intense
this is a little product duo that a
viewer told me I needed to experiment
with and I think was kind of a long time
ago but I recently have been doing this
and I really like it it's Max Kreme Kup
lipstick so this is a cream machine it's
really smooth and feels nice on the lips
and you can see it's it's kind of a
muted pink you know it's not like
in-your-face pink but it's just really
soft so I put that on and then it does
look really pretty with this lip gloss
which has a little bit it's got some
shimmer in there but it's got more of a
peachy pink tone so I think it looks
really nice on top of this lipstick as
far as the hair Goats these are kind of
second day curls that I did with my
Remington T Studio pearl styling wand I
have two sizes and this was the smaller
of the two so you can see they're just
kind of like waves now and so take off
take out the clip from when I pin my
hair back and I love when I'm in a
situation where I have these these sort
of curls for the second day because it
totally they're totally workable you
know to use in something I love using to
refresh curls on the next day or just
even at the end of the day if things are
looking like they're falling a little
bit if you're doing just kind of like a
beachy wave look and you want to sort of
reinvigorate those waves and keep them
from looking dry or whatever the when
replenishing mist I dump this in a
Beauty test tube not too long ago I had
a smaller size in a different scent
before but this is the lavender all the
scents kind of have the same function
though and I just spritz this sort of on
the ends of my hair and just scrunch it
in a little like everything looks a
little bit smoother
after I use a strain and got some
accessories but I put on this fun little
necklace with some turquoise and silver
I got this from a store called Cato I
got my rings on that I always wear and
then some silver stud earrings I hope
you guys enjoyed this video using all
products that I would totally recommend
some are newer to me some I've enjoyed
for a really long time again I would
classify this look as very long wearing
I think it's something that could be
sort of a special occasion look if you
want it - I mean coverage wise and just
staying power wise the face makeups very
long wearing I find that those
Physicians Formula matte shadows just
can give you a really classic look I
like pairing you know the look we did on
the eyes here was pretty neutral where
the colors are concerned but then we
popped it up with some lashes and some
kind of intense sort of smudgy liner and
stuff with any you know tutorial or look
that I do definitely customize it to the
way you want to wear it that's what it's
all about so thank you for watching and
let me know what kinds of get ready with
me videos you want to see in the future
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
