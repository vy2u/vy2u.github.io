for Valentine's Day this is actually
gonna be kind of a trial run of the look
that I plan to do on Valentine's Day you
guys might want to get in on the process
a little bit and see what we're doing
here and check out my awesome robe you
might just have to stay in that on
Valentine's Day who knows but I'm gonna
get started with some Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation I like a lot of
good coverage and this shade is just a
really great match for me right now so
I'm going to dot that on all over and
blend it out
I am trying a new brush for my
foundation by the way I got this from
cargo when cargo is being featured on
HauteLook and it is the magic brush it
says blends really nicely the bristles
are just SuperDuper soft but it's just
gonna take me a while to figure out you
know if I like this as well as my f80
now I am taking advantage of some
natural light today in here because
there's snow on the ground and I'm in
front of my window and it seems to just
make the outdoor the light that's coming
in from outside just like extra bright
so I'm seeing how that works birthday
this is my little Capricorn compact my
friend David got this to me got this too
he gave this to me for my birthday and
it's got like a translucent type powder
in there from Estee Lauder and I've been
using it kind of as an under eye setting
type thing
lately but I was gonna say um are you
guys watching the Olympics I love
watching the figure skating and I used
to pretend that I was an Olympic figure
skater when I was a kid except I just
had rollerskates and we had our garage
so I would like skate circles inside the
garage and you know that Billy Joel song
river of dreams that was always like my
anthem and that would be like what I
would imagine I was you know skating
around too just like they are on the ice
so any time I watch a limbic figure
skating it takes me back to that done
here's another question for you what is
your favorite Valentine's Day candy are
you into the conversation hearts cuz I
like those however I only like them if
they're a little bit soft you know like
I don't like to bite into the rock-hard
dry ones it's like the ones that are
just a little bit it's like they're
they're like super chewy like a gummy
bear anything but they're just a little
bit soft and I find them so much more
delicious and the white ones white ones
are the best I mean you can't go wrong
with chocolate
I like chocolate-covered cherries those
would be nice
newsflash new Milani baked blush is that
our met this is the delicioso pink one
and it's gorgeous
it only takes a teeny tiny bit but I
will actually have a review either going
up soon after this video or maybe it's
already up but you'll just have to keep
an eye on the Express channel because
there's this blush and another one and
they're both really gorgeous and they're
matte
all right folks back with you with one
eye done with one headlight oops sorry
about the phone and the random
wallflowers outburst but um the eye look
that I'm thinking about is with this
color riche quad and Rose for romance
what does this remind you of will make
it three perhaps yeah I figured you know
naked three is everywhere there are lots
of looks on it I thought it might do
something with something comparable in
case you didn't want to spring for naked
three but kind of like the look that it
creates I am gonna draw one shade from
my eye on neutral palette though because
this is all did you know starting
out with the base by the way this is
awake from Sigma it came out with the
light collection but it's a little bit
pinkish so that's going all over the
wood what I was gonna say was I shot a
totally different
Valentine's tutorial the other day and I
just did not like the way it turned out
I didn't shoot it like it get ready with
me like this I shot it just as a
tutorial it was a really dark look I
mean it could be cool but there are
definitely things like seeing it
completed and seeing it on camera there
are definitely some things I would
change about it and I just was not
feeling it like I got it onto my
computer and I was looking at like
something's just not right about this I
am NOT digging it and I cannot advise
people to use this look for Valentine's
Day if I'm not digging it so I'm coming
up with a look that I dig here moral of
that story so let's get started
so pinky tone shadow all over the lid
the lighter pink around the inner corner
then I need some Matt I need some Matt
in this look so I'm going to this Sonia
Kashuk I on neutral I'm going to using
this shade right down here and just
adding that to the crease there's
another Valentine II question for you
that I should definitely have the answer
to considering how long I've been
married but it's something that always
seems to stump me every year and it's
what do you do for a guy on Valentine's
because Tyler you know he'll tell me for
a birthday for Christmas he'll give me
some ideas of something to get him but
then on Valentine's Day he insists he's
like it's more for the woman than the
guy which I don't quite agree with you
know I don't think it needs to be that
way but I just like I really have a hard
time coming up with a Valentine's Day
appropriate gift because I feel like I'm
more prone to getting him something
practical and the practical gifts don't
always make a lot of sense with like hi
happy Valentine's Day romantic holiday
here's your you know leaf blower
okay these are my salon perfect demi
whispies favorite lash from way back
kind of flared out on the ends this is
the repackaged Revlon precision lash
glue no a lot of people have trouble
finding that lash glue but really is my
favorite kind to use just because I feel
like it's so easy to get just the right
amount on the lash band and I typically
find it at Walmart
you ever ask your significant other how
they like your makeup to be done
I'll ask Tyler and he likes the smoky
eye either that or that is like the
makeup terminology that you that just
pops into his head oh yeah smoky eye
totally smokey eye I like to ask him
about stuff like that war like if we're
in a store ask him like what's your
opinion on this eye shadow that I'm
about to get or should I get this one
used to see what else it pay for lips I
don't love the Revlon Colorstay ultimate
suede lipsticks this is in the shade
silhouette but I do have a lip balm on
that my lips have been kind of primed
with I just burped you didn't need to
hear that but anyway I think these are
kind of dry but if you've got the balm
on underneath it helps and I just really
like this color and I think it will work
beautifully with the cheek that's going
on for this look
alright back with you now the hair I
just kind of loosely curled so I've just
got that parted in the middle sort of in
this top that I'm wearing I'm is
short-sleeve it's kind of like a tunic
type top it's short to the point where
you would probably want like leggings
underneath it so I'm wearing it with
some black leggings and it's just got
this sort of like belted thing going on
here at the top I think this came from
Macy's but I don't remember exactly when
I got it I've had it for awhile but I
just wanted something kind of neutral it
sort of let the pink pops in this look
you know the really light soft Pink's on
the cheeks and on the lips let them
shine kind of so yeah that's my
Valentine's Day look I am a fan of the
Naked 3 but if you're looking for like a
downsized and less expensive way to get
a really similar look to something I've
done with the naked 3 quite a few times
this kind of an eye look check out the
color reach quad from L'Oreal and Rose
romance it gives you a really really
similar look so thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed this get
ready with me if you've got any themes
in mind for future get ready with me so
let me know and I'll see you next time
