video has a special theme it is five
minute makeup and this is actually a
challenge I did once before several
years ago and Tyler was actually off to
the side with a stopwatch like timing me
it was super stressed I have not a 5
minute makeup kind of girl I like to
take normally like a half hour to do it
and that's because you know I like to
experiment with different products and
try different things and it's just you
know more fun for me that way but I know
there are times when we're all in that
pinch and we need to just get it done
quickly so I've gathered up the things
that I'm going to use here in a little
basket so I already have it right out
here and the make up process is not
gonna be edited out or anything and I
mean not gonna be sped up I want you
guys to see the whole thing because you
know you want to see how it all goes
right so I'm gonna get on my phone here
and get my 5 minutes I also don't just
want it to be like 5-minute barely-there
makeup but I wanted to actually be you
know like a full face of makeup so
that's that's my challenge I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able to execute it or
not but we're gonna try so all I have on
my face right now is moisturizer just so
you know there it is set for 5 minutes
it'll go off with an alarm and I'm gonna
start off now with foundation I'm using
this one from covergirl and I'll have
little reasons probably posted up on the
screen why I chose certain products for
this tutorial things that I think are
quicker to use than others so I'm just
gonna get that all over what the hands
off Real Techniques expert face brush
here to blend that all in so blending
blending blending this is where I would
normally edit out but we're gonna see
the whole thing I need my mirror gosh
that little screen on the camera is just
too far away and too small so still
gonna take enough time to make sure I
get this blended all in and right into
the hairline and around the jaw and all
that this is pretty good coverage so I
wanted to make sure I had that then I'm
going to take my covergirl and Olay
concealer stick get that where I need it
god I feel like I'm being real sloppy
but I mean you just gotta be fast right
and then I take my real thick bird this
is not real techniques is Sigma P 80
brush to just blend all that concealer
in make sure I can get the maximum
amount of coverage out of what I put on
blend all that out boom boom boom and
then I'm gonna take a little bit powder
cuz I think I just want a little bit on
my t-zone this is maybelline shine free
it go a little under my eyes as well
just to mattify that and then blush
bronzer duo from flower I mean it's just
quicker sometimes when you got them both
together you don't dig around for one of
the others so I'm going to contour just
a bit with some of the bronzer and then
get a little bit around this hairline my
forehead I meant to say what strange
things come out when it's you're on the
clock for five minutes and nothing's
edited and then the blush part do a
little bit right up in here melodia duh
la dee dee alright um then for my eyes
I'm using this tart smolder IDEs like a
big chubby pencil because you don't have
to be precise with this as you would
like a bitty skinny guy right that's my
theory anyway and I just want my eyes to
find don't want to mess with a ton of
shadow or anything and this is a pretty
long wearing stick here so I've got it
there I'm just gonna kind of smudge with
my finger right along the lash line I'm
gonna go well about a little relaxed
line of course I can't talk real well
while I'm putting on eyeliner but who
can right okay must curl lashes got a
new eyelash curler from Revlon thank
Asprey cute boom-boom-boom why this
normally would normally hold this for 15
seconds and
I would wait I would normally hold it on
each I do I eat I one at a time and then
put mascara on and go to the next I
don't even know what I'm saying
this is my Malley volumizing mascara it
just builds up the volume the quickest
of anything I have so that's why I used
it for this and then brow brow brow oh
my god ah my heart is racing
it should not be beating this fast I
swear this is from Milani it's like a
little pen and I swear it's probably the
fastest thing to do my brows and I don't
really feel it everywhere but just some
key places gosh
and then um this is from wet and wild
isn't my lipstick red coz red always
makes you look a little more done up
right okay so the alarm is not yet going
off and my phone is gone to black so I
can't read just glance down and see how
much time I have but I'm gonna do more
mascara yay
I tell you what well know that stress
will start to your day you know you find
out you've only got five minutes in oh
that's not easy I have a little smudge
keep the q-tip handy okay and then I
smudge the liner a little bit better
yeah eyeliner is probably like the
hardest thing that it was what really
got me stressed out and I didn't quite
blend enough between my eyebrows either
but there's that take care down on my at
timewise five four three two one yeah
okay awesome
well I wouldn't say this is my favorite
makeup look ever but it's not the worst
ever either I don't think I mean I feel
like my skin has coverage on it my eyes
are pretty natural went a little bit
bolder with the lip because I think
whenever you're in a time crunch I think
if you can do a bride
you instantly look more done up and also
I mean my tip for anybody who's you know
doing this kind of thing would be and
I'm just gonna well I'm talking here I'm
just gonna add just a little more
concealer but try to play up the parts
of your face that you like the most like
if you like your lips like I kind of
like my lips so you know played that up
a little bit more or if it's the eyes
you know focus on that and then it'll
kind of detract attention from other
parts of the face so that you may not
like so much when you do something
brighter a little bit bolder but just
used a chubby eyeshadow or chubby like
eyeshadow slash eyeliner stick on the
eyes just for definition I mean when it
comes right down to it I don't think I
need all the shadow but just the
definition around the eye is what helps
a lot so let me know what your to your
tricks are if you've ever been in a bind
like what are your must do steps that
you would not leave out even if you only
have five minutes to get ready you know
what other get ready with me videos you
want to see I would love to do them for
you and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
