a new brand in this too in this tutorial
here or at least a brand that's new to
me I'm sure some of you maybe have
already checked it out but it's glam
couture cosmetics and I am trying
several different shadows from that
brand and they're called HD pigments and
these are the ones I'm going to be using
for this look this look actually
incorporates on the inner part of this
yellow shade called
sunshine and they are well they're very
colorful they're also pretty sparkly too
so be aware of that a red shade called
strawberries that's gonna kind of go on
the outer half of the lid and then we're
gonna fade up with a pink shade called
crazy and love and it's kind of a bright
magenta pink and what's probably my star
product and all of this that I have used
in other ways before doing this tutorial
and I just love it so much it's the puts
a press shadow in night in Vegas and
it's that pretty pretty black with some
sparkle to it we also use that as a
liner in this look and we're going to
use some individual false lashes so I'll
walk you through everything from start
to finish on the eyes so sticker ok the
first thing I did was I applied my be
lush is shadow magnet primer there on my
lids so the shadow will stick and that's
really important because we're dealing
with loose pigments here and then the
first color I'm going to use is this HD
pigment in sunshine I know it's really
bright but it's also pretty sparkly too
as with most of these that I'm using so
I'm going to take my small lo Cornell
quarter inch brush and I'm just going to
get this might help to actually put some
product on the brush first I don't know
why I thought I did that already okay
pack it on and we're just gonna apply
that all over the inner half of the lid
and it this it is yellow and so yellow
is a little more difficult shade to
build up and just for the nature that
it's a light color and so you may want
to go back to it a couple times and
definitely do kind of a packing oops it
got a lot extra on there do kind of a
packing
motion with it like you're patting it
down as opposed to back and forth back
and forth this will keep it more
contained to your lid rather than all
over the place okay
so there you go there's that part of it
and then if you want to go ahead and get
this going a little bit under your eye
not only is there a lot of color to
these shadows but there's a lot of
sparkle too so think like special
occasion party
proms you know it would really be
appropriate for that and done we're
gonna get take care of some of the
fallout there that kind of compressed on
your cheek in a little bit here but
first I'm gonna take a size up I'm going
to take the 3/8 brush here from lo
Cornell and I'm gonna dip into this red
shade strawberries and I'm gonna just
tap a little bit into my lid there and
once I get that okay and then kind of
pack it into that brush you can see it's
kind of packed on to the tip the tip
there and then I'm gonna use that to
just go outer half and crease and out so
crease and then just work it up like so
okay and you can see if you really try
to blend out the border between yellow
and red when you mix yellow and red you
get orange so you get kind of a nice
fade effect going there and then just
because I don't want the yellow to kind
of disappear because it is a more subtle
color and we're also using a little less
of it I'm gonna go back again over that
and then I'm gonna take the pink shade
which is called crazy and love and it's
like a bright kind of magenta pink and
using that same brush and I don't really
mind if the red and pink get a little
mixed here because that is sort of the
intention get a little bit of the pink
kind of on the opposite side of the
brush that I was using and then work
that up right here is this an everyday
look
no is it a fun look yes okay
blend that up there and then lightly
lightly I'm gonna take actually my
chisel crease brush wishes from glam
couture cosmetics and lightly get a
little bit of that yellow on there and
that's gonna actually become a highlight
it's so sparkly but I mean this is this
is a characteristic of the look we're
going for so it's fine and then I'm
gonna take my glam Couture eyeshadow in
night in Vegas so it's black sparkly but
the sparkle really doesn't come off so
much on this as it does in those loose
pigments and we're gonna see see how
we've taken this this is bright and this
we've added quite a bit of depth to and
that's kind of what makes it even a
little bit more wearable you know you
take it and instead of dishing a bright
color you see some contouring and
shading going on so I'm going to take my
fine crease brush that's available at
CVS the essence of beauty line and just
kind of start getting it down there in
the crease just like so oops falling out
of frame there
and just keep blending you can't have
you forgot that I was even on camera
they just keep blending blend on to the
lid a little bit kind of like it's
sweeping down motion blend up to into
that color some more that you used and
you're just gonna notice I mean it's it
just has a real calming down effect on
some of those colors which can be kind
of what you're going for and now I'm
going to take I have a fan brush here
and this can be good for kind of
sweeping off some of this glitter that
might be might have rested elsewhere on
your face another thing you can do is
take kind of a translucent powder and go
over it and it can kind of sweep away
with the powder too so just a couple
tips there if you encounter you know any
sort of fallout with any shadow
especially glitter glitter is one of the
easier things I think to wipe off than a
straight colored pigment because
sometimes that can press into your skin
and actually stay there longer so just
keep blending blending buffing out the
edge till we kind of get the matched
effect on the other eye and now we're
going to move on to liner you can use my
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black and it's just going to be
a matter of tracing the line inner
corner to outer corner
for our lower liner we're going to use
the glam Couture eyeshadow the the dark
stuff that we used to darken up the
crease I'm going to take my angle liner
brush just dip it in there to the shadow
and then basically just kind of connect
to that line this is a really rich
shadow so it'll it's gonna come off
basically like a liner would only just a
little bit softer because it is that
shadow consistency and not a you know
creamy pencil so just keep taking that
liner just from inner corner and to the
outer or whichever way it suits you best
and you may be going over some of that
yellow sparkle so it'll kind of make an
interesting effect there next I'm going
to go ahead and curl my eyelashes hold
that for about 15 seconds then I'm going
to apply some Rimmel mascara it's the
sexy curves full volume and curved
mascara and I'm not necessarily nuts
about this particular mascara but we are
going to be adding some individual false
lashes and that will kind of perk up the
look you can see it's got sort of a
flared out look there in the corner
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do in a minute okay guys now we're going
to put on a few clusters I think we're
gonna do four clusters of these false
individual lashes as you can see they're
not actually like one lash but they're
little chunks of you know little bundles
of eyelashes and it can be nice for a
natural look it does for me it takes a
little more time because you you know
you're just going back and forth back
and forth to put them on instead of just
one strip however you know you your are
achieving a different look with just
that flirts flared out look at the end
there so you can kind of see what we're
going for it's it's a little more
natural and so yeah that's what we're
gonna do I'm just gonna take one off
here I pulled it off of the thing and
you can see it's got that little bitty
point to it and then I just squeezed out
some glue on a tissue here and I'm just
gonna dip the end in there so that end
becomes coated just about like that okay
and so we're gonna let that get a
little bit tacky just like we would if
we were gonna put the full strip on you
know you got to wait and and let it get
a little more solidified so it'll
actually stay where you place it and so
we're just gonna wait here a little bit
while it gets tacky
okay now you could use tweezers but I'm
just going to use my fingers actually
and just get a decent grip on your
little false lash and just place that
right there on your lash line and so you
can see that little bead of white there
but that's actually going to dry clear
so don't freak out it kind of helps
because you can see where you just
placed your last one and you can kind of
just create a little lineup of them
there so we've got one on I'm gonna
repeat that same little procedure with
three more of these and then I'll return
with the finish guys welcome back this
is our finished look here you can
probably see that the glue is still
drying just a little bit but I assure
you it dries clear you can see over on
this side you can't see it anymore
but basically this turned out to be a
little more wearable look than I thought
it was going to be and what you what I
mainly credit that to is the fact that
we incorporated a darker shade into this
and this looks and well kind of a wild
darker shade but that glitter really is
not that intense and it's really can be
a rule of thumb with any really bright
shadows you use if you take something a
little bit darker and work it into your
crease and create sort of some depth
there you can I think you can make a lot
of shades a little more wearable so I
hope you enjoyed this look and I really
hope you check out this brand because
they I mean look at how much you're
getting here you're getting a lot of
product for the small small amount we
used I mean this will last for a really
long time so I really encourage you to
look through those colors lots of
different colors neutral colors too so
oh and on my lips I put on my NYX round
lip gloss and amethyst so that's another
cheap cheap product and just kind of
plays off of the pinks and warm Reds
coming off of you know kind of the top
of this look here on our
so I hope you enjoyed this video guys
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
