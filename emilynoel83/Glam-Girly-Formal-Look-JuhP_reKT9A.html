formal events coming up proms weddings
you name it but I have a formal event of
my own coming up I'm going to be at the
celebrity waiter gala down here in
southern Illinois um it's an event that
where the proceeds go to the local child
advocacy center for abused and neglected
children so it's a great cause and I
have kind of a fun little dress with a
floral print on it so I wanted really
fun and feminine makeup that would be
long-lasting and sort of a step up from
what people normally see me wearing on
TV so i will show you the look so
sticker guys have already primed my lid
with my Too Faced shadow insurance and
Max rubenesque paint pot because I
really want this to be an extra long
wearing look and those two products work
great together and then I'm going to
grab my own custom palette from Coastal
Scents this is the one that I you can
create and pick your own shadows that
you want to go in it there are 12 pans
in here and I have more pictures and
information on my blog but I'm going to
take this one up in the corner it's sort
of a creamy light gold shade it's really
pretty and I'm going to use that as my
all over lid shade next step I'm going
to go down here to this shade right here
on the bottom of my palette and it's
kind of like a really deep shimmery a
topi grey kind of shade that's it and
I'm going to use my Sonia Kashuk medium
eyeshadow brush and just basically use
that to pack the shadow in my crease and
just create that wash of darker color
just kind of this nice halo of topi grey
shimmer it looks gorgeous i think with
the gold shade and for a more natural
look stopping there i think you would
have an awesome look I'm just going to
go a little bit more with that and I
Stephanie here I'm going to bring in a
darker shade to define our outer V as
promised you know very girly glamorous
that's sort of the look we're going for
tonight I'm just going to use my fluffy
Sephora rounded crease brush just to
blend out the edge of that color even
though we will be going over it
second and I'm going to take my smallest
crease brush my fine crease brush from
essence of beauty going to go down to
this matte black shade that I have here
in the corner and that's going to be the
color that we're going to try to work
kind of carefully with but we are going
to try to create a more defined outer V
with this shade so that involves the
ports going about mid crease going over
and coming up from our corner and really
deepening right in there and now it's
kind of the fun part which is warming
this look up a little bit i'm going to
take a couple of kind of rosy shades
here one is this color right here it's
kind of a shimmery red because i do have
those rows tones in my dress and I'm
going to go over the border here really
really lightly keeping a really light
touch and very little product on the
brush and then I'm going to take this
gorgeous shimmery purpley pink shade and
also layer that and we're getting just
kind of all tones of warmth and red and
pretty you know just tones that you
don't typically see with a smoky eye to
keep it nice and feminine and then I'm
going to go back to the shade that we
first used on our lid that kind of
creamy with gold shimmer and I'm going
to use that right up to my eyebrow as a
highlight moving on to our liner I'm
going to be using my Revlon Colorstay in
blackest black going from the inner
corner to outer corner and we will be
winging it out just a little bit
starting at that very inner corner
them in deep focus right now getting the
line a bit thicker as we get to the
outside that would be a general stopping
point for a more natural look but we are
going to extend it just a little bit
just creating that wind out effect
just like that then I'm going to take my
revlon colorstay pencil also in black
and for that I'm just going to work on
getting it connected to you know that
that little wing we've got going on
there and then I'll just be taking that
all oops oh I just hit myself in the
nose I thought I'd drew on myself I'm
going to be taking it all the way
smudging it right into that lower
lashline and carrying it all the way
over to the sorry guys in our corner
here going back to the shadow palette
now I'm going to use this kind of medium
to dark matte brown shade and my liner
brush and I'm going to use that color to
go over my lower lash line to kind of
give it not necessarily a smudged out
effect but a little bit softer effect
with that over the black I could
obviously go over this with that you
know matte black shade but this will
just soften it just a touch here next
I'm going to get my Too Faced lash
injection mascara and I really want you
know this looked to be a lot of lashes
so I'm gonna just be applying that a
little bit really lightly on my lower
lash line and also my upper lash line so
after I get that done I'm going to put
on some false eyelashes they are the
ardell number 106 fashion lashes they're
kind of like have that little bit of a
you know there's the lashes are a little
bundles on it and I really really like
the look that I get from that so I'm
gonna put those on and then come back
and show you the finish will come back
guys here is my finished look I hope you
like it definitely it's a glamorous
girly feminine formal look so those are
about all the words I can use to
describe it but haven't done my hair
just yet that's next on the agenda but
this is definitely a prom appropriate
look or for any you know big event where
you want to just step it up a notch um
on my face i am using actually another
kind of Milani bronzer because
I was starting to run low on the sunset
duos so I found this and you can see
it's got like this sort of floral print
on it almost it's the powder bronzer in
light so I'm testing that out right now
for the first time and I've also got on
my Jane blush and blushing plum so
that's just kind of a plummy pink shade
and then my covergirl cheekers and
golden pink as a contour and then if
you're wondering what's on my lips I
wanted a long wearing products so i'm
using my maybelline superstay gloss so
it's gloss on one end and then this long
wearing product on the other and this
shade is number looks like 55 see I
think I might have to look that up
online just to make to confirm that but
um anyway I hope you guys enjoy this
look and I have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
