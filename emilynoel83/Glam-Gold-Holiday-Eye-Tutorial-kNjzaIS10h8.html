lately that's beauty broadcast dotnet
you may have noticed the question of the
week the little poll question on the
sidebar was what tutorial basically
would you like to see involving
holiday-themed I colors and the options
were red green silver and gold and I
honestly I had a plan for red green and
silver but you guys all picked gold so I
had to think a little bit on this but I
am going to be using my Coastal Scents
double-stack shimmer palette to create
this look that is just really a warm
shimmery gold and I think it looks it's
it's kind of a holiday twist on this
look by using the red lips and kind of
the mat flawless skin if you went with
more of a dewy skin finish and nude lips
this could be a great summer look as
well so if you want to see how it all
comes together keep on one first thing I
did was applied my Too Faced shadow
insurance all over my lid that is one of
the best primers just in terms of
staying power and helping your shadows
last longer so after that oops I'm going
to take my ELF cream shadow duo this is
in butter pecan and I'm going to be
using the kind of deeper golden e brown
shade and just get a little bit of that
on my finger and dab that all over my
lid and you don't want to apply this too
thick so really just go like you know of
a super thin layer here this is just
gonna add some intensity to our shadow
and help everything kind of cling to the
lid next I'm going to take my double
stack palette from coastal scents and
we're looking at this gold color right
at the top of the palette next to the
silver and I'm going to take my ELF I
shadow brush just pack some of that
shade on there and then just start
packing that all over the lid and this
is going to turn out to be I know it's
called a shimmer palette but this really
gives the most metallic gold finish of
anything I own and you're going to see
it kept sort of a slightly Brown and
appearances you go over the top of that
cream but oh it's over all still it's
very gold very warm and what we're going
to do is just get that all over the lid
and then take a smaller brush or a q-tip
or whatever you have I'm going to use my
Coastal Scents a detail brush and just
take that right around the tear duct and
right into the lower lash line very easy
just carry it right in just like that so
now you've got super duper gold lids and
we're going to go down a couple shades
to a slightly deeper gold in this
palette here's the one we use and we're
going to go right down to their to that
gold and we're going to apply it with a
different brush and you're going to see
how the finish can completely change
even though these are probably equally
shimmery shades just using a different
kind of rush and a different method of
application will make it look different
i'm using my sephora rounded crease
brush getting some of that on there and
i'm going to take this into the crease i
just want to wash up a little bit deeper
color there and as you can see we're not
getting as much shimmer here because
it's just we're not packing that color
on quite so much we're going for a much
more sheer application so just continue
building that color until you've sort of
got what appears to be a very soft
almost coppery look there okay so just
take that up and just blend it I mean
you can go to your to your brow but just
make sure it's extremely sheer up to
that point okay next we need to pull in
a matte shade to this look just to kind
of create some contrast here and that
color is going to be our Brown smolder
but actually first I want to do my liner
just to help us understand exactly where
that Brown smolder shade from covergirl
is going to go so I'm going to take my
la girl fine line it's a liner pin here
with a very very fine tip and I'm going
to start at my inner corner of my eye
here extreme inner corner
and just follow your lashline stay
really close to it and then we are going
to wing it out at the end once you get
to the outer end here what you're going
to do right from the absolute corner of
your eye you're going to kind of point
up up toward your eyebrow the outer
corner of your brow and then just
connect and fill that in and you're
going you should have equal wings on
each side if you approach it in this
manner you can see what what we've got
there and just make sure it's fully you
know right down to the very corner there
because we are going to connect with a
little bit of that brown shade now bring
in your brown any matt brown will do I
just find that this is very good it's
from covergirl it's called Brown smolder
i'm using my CBS essence of beauty fine
crease brush and you can see how this
tip here of the liner is going to help
us understand exactly where we want to
put that brown shade see how I'm kind of
like going right in the middle of our
crease and then I'm just carrying it
right out to the tip of that liner and
it's it's just super warm it's this look
aunt really needs a like a deep shade to
kind of add some contrast and brown just
works great with gold that's why I
picked brown instead of black so it
wouldn't get too muddy looking so there
we go just kind of blend circular
motions right out to the end there of
that and then what I want to use this
this shadow for also is in a liner since
on the lower lash line so I'm going to
take my Coastal Scents tackle on liner
brush just any good angle liner brush
and the shade is deep enough to kind of
mesh with the black liquid and go in you
know most of the way and just sort of
overlap the gold there now for one more
step
it's going to add a little more
highlight to this look I'm going to go
back to the initial gold that we put on
our lid i'm using this small brush or
you could use just a small shadow brush
i mean whatever you have I'm I just want
something where I'm going to have a lot
of control and I've got that shade on my
brush here and I'm just going to go on
the upper border of that brown that we
did and it's just going to lighten it up
a little bit and just really keep gold
the theme of this you know so you're not
just seeing this all blend up to brown
it's also bringing back the same goal
that was on our lid and then to kind of
buff it out just take your Sephora
rounded crease brush or any fluffy
crease brush that you have and just kind
of basically almost just dot over it or
or buff over that to really incorporate
that in with the look next I'm going to
curl my lashes and I'm going to apply a
coat of the covergirl exact I lights in
black pearl on the top and bottom lashes
and then I'll join you at the finish
look and we'll also talk about
accessorizing for this look
all right guys here is the finished look
just a nice kind of metallic gold look
for the holidays and something that
really takes this to be a holiday look
instead of like a summary gold look is
the lips I think you know you could go
with a nude lip and some really bronzed
skin and this would be a perfect look
for summertime but to kind of glam it up
before a holiday look I went with a
matte red lip here and what I used for
that is my Rimmel exaggerated lip liner
in ravish that's my favorite red lip
liner and then I used a mac lipstick
that I actually got in as part of my
prize package for that el video star
thing and the shade is Ruby woo it's be
69 and it's just a great shade of red
and it is it does come off very matte
and so I kind of like it because I don't
I feel like while it's bold it's not
really competing with the metallic
finish on the eyes the skin is very mad
as well I used my maybelline dream matte
foundation which I'm kind of
rediscovering that I do really like the
finish it gives I did do a little bit of
bronzer just to kind of tie in some of
the golden eat owns but what you really
want to think about with pulling off
this gold I for the holidays it's very
simple because I think it works really
nice with leopard print so I have this
like leopard headband here it plays off
of those tones really well so just if
you're wearing like a little black shirt
or a black dress or something accent it
with maybe some gold earrings or
something like that these have like a
little butterfly on them they came from
Claire's but and just anything that's
that is like a gold accessory a pretty
like long necklace with with gold
accents in it and you know leopard looks
cute with this as well so those are just
some things to think about and I think
the red lips really make it look like
kind of a glam look this reminds me of
my pinup girl look only it's got kind of
a little more of a twist on it with us
with the metallic tones on the eyes
instead of the mat so thanks so much
guys for tuning in for this video and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
