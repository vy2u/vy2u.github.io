today's look it's kind of a springy look
because I feel like I'm using some sort
of spring-like shades but we're
incorporating color and kind of a sneaky
whatever doing this on the news
sometimes it was like I didn't want to
wear super bright colors that would
distract from what I was saying but yet
for my own entertainment I wanted to
work in color in small ways and so one
way we're doing that is with you know a
little bit of really blended out deep
plum in the crease and then on the lower
lash line we've got a really fun color
there as well and this is using the
romantic eye palette I've had requests
for a tutorial ever since I started
raving about this in my haul video and
this was also named as one of my top to
face palettes in that other video I did
recently and I just so enjoy the color
variety in this palette how easy
everything is to blend this has been on
the market for at least a couple years
now but I just recently picked it up not
too long ago and I am just enjoying it
so much so I want to show you one of my
favorite looks using this palette so
I've just applied an eye primer all over
my lid and I'm gonna start off with this
shade called soulmates it's a really
gorgeous shimmery color I'm just using a
small like detail type brush a little
angled brush can get you right in here
where you want to be and I'm just gonna
take that right around the tear duct for
some brightness then I'm taking that
same shade with a larger brush and just
applying this on the inner third of my
eyelid and I'm moving on to cut the cake
it's a really pretty lavender shade with
a little bit of shimmer that's gonna go
all over my lid think about kind of
overlapping some of that white and then
we will overlap this shade a little bit
more in a second with a deeper plum and
the two shades layered just look really
great I think next I want to create some
really subtle contrast in the crease so
I'm using this shade here it's like a
matte very soft grey called
I do I'm using this brush from NYX it
says small eyeshadow brush for smoky
eyes and it's just really nice for you
know getting wedging right into your
crease and as you can see I'm starting
all the way in here
and it's not a deep shade at all but you
find that it does really you know give
you a very soft shadow here and kind of
a nice base to get on there before we
work in the deeper plum I've done some
really light looks with this palette
where this was just kind of blended out
really softly in the crease and that's a
good stopping point for a natural look
next we're using first dance and this is
an awesome matte plum color and I'm
using a smallish flat brush that gives
me a lot of control with where I'm
putting this shade so what I want to
start with is getting some of this right
here on the outer part of my lid and
with that overlapping you see more of
the purple come through this shade when
you're going over the lilac so I love
that you know this can go from something
that's very deep on the eyes almost
looks black to something like this right
here what you're seeing more purple come
through then I'm using that same shade
with a really small crease brush you
could use something like that NYX one
that I had used with the grey if you
want to this is maybe even a little
smaller than that this little crease
brush from essence of beauty is really
handy you can get a duo of these from
CVS but it's really great for getting
like the deepest part of your shadow
exactly where you want it right there in
your crease larger brushes are great for
a more diffused look but when you're
really thinking about placement with a
look which is what this is all about you
want that darkness right where your eye
recedes the most so this can get you to
that point as you can see I can very
easily shape the shadow outward just a
little bit shadow is definitely
extending out past the eye then I'm
gonna go in with just a bare Sigma e-40
brush anything fluffy that you got and
just kind of go back and forth right
over the edge there to soften it out
right up in this area I really want to
soften that edge even further so I'm
gonna go to this light matte pink and
drop my palette it's all good everything
survived that shades called kiss the
bride
lightly above where your purple and I
don't like to do too much overlapping
because I think it lightens the purple
more than I want so just really try to
keep it right on the border and then
you'll get still a nice soft edge soft
edge kind of contradictory there but you
know what I mean
a blended edge and for the highlight I'm
using this matte color right here called
bouquet toss to show you when I'm going
into these shades I am just going like
that with my brushes you know just to
get a little bit on there because it
doesn't take much these shades will show
up with very little product actually
placed on your eyes so love that next
we're gonna go to the upper liner and
then that will kind of help us blend
down into our lower lash line part of
the look so I'm using my Milani
eye tech extreme liquid liner starting
right here in your innermost corner
sometimes I like to go just above you
know my lash line and then really get in
there and fill in as close to those
lashes as humanly possible we never want
a liner gap okay
thickening it here as I get to the outer
corner and extending it out so drawing
it out like straight in that direction
and then we're just forming a little
triangle there then we're gonna fill in
that triangle and in a moment wait for
it we've got a winter lower lash line
we're gonna kind of go dark to light I'm
starting off with a black liner this is
my M cosmetics
black night water liner actually lasts a
super long time in the waterline
appropriately-named so I'm just gonna
take that all the way in here I'm also
kind of drawing this on the skin here
just on the outside and making a little
connection to that wing to the shadow
palette angled liner brush going to
first dance that's the plum with this
shade I just want to overlap that black
liner that I just drew there on the
outside and something else kind of cool
that you can do to get an even more
finished edge to your wing
is very lightly use your angled liner
brush that has a little bit of powder
shadow on it and you can just really
lightly like flick it there on the
outermost part of your wind then I want
my green here to really pop as much as
possible but also have really good
staying power so I'm using this NYX
liner in green papaya it's a great
spring green and just really brings out
the green of the shadow also so this
liner I'm just going to go from my
innermost corner kind of hitting that
pearly white shade and then take it
under the lower lash line and then just
kind of underneath the black now using a
smudge brush we're going into honeymoon
probably the most shimmery shade in this
palette and this looks gorgeous all over
the lid too but I got to tell you I'm
kind of attached to putting it here now
especially paired with that NYX liner
goodlow this looks pretty love it so
just taking it all the way to the edge
but one thing that I think really pulls
it all together is going back to a
little bit more of the plum just use
your smudge brush and just overlap that
grain make sure the green just looks
like it's fading right in you know it's
like it's making a grand entrance right
here so keep it a little dark on the
outside next up I'm just gonna curl my
lashes real quick and apply mascara on
my upper and lower lashes using my red
cherry number 43 lashes here on the
upper lash line just a really full
fluffy lash I love it so much so I just
kind of grabbed those in the center line
them up apply them right on top of my
eyeliner and I just let that glue dry
and then sort of blot a little mascara
there right down by the base of the
lashes to make sure everything's
connected I also want to point out how
everything kind of got pulled together
as far as the blush and the lip color
also I'm wearing my sleek blush by three
and pink lemonade and I'm just wearing
this shade here so I've got that on my
cheeks and it's giving a great amount of
glow there so I think that really
complements the look nice
as well as a pink lip that's not so
bright that it's detracting from the eye
makeup but kind of like a natural pink
you know and this is that new sculpting
lipstick from Estee Lauder it's the pure
color envy lipstick and impulsive so got
that on and I just think it really goes
nicely with the color scheme that's
happening on the eyes so thank you again
guys so much for watching for taking an
interest in this palette and this look
from you have a great day and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
