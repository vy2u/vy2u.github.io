in for this video this is not only a
makeup tutorial but actually a video
with a little bit greater purpose beyond
makeup it's for the going gold childhood
cancer awareness campaign I was
contacted by Elizabeth's truck she has a
blog called the wishful artist she is a
wife mother and an artist and she not
too long ago found out that her little
boy had cancer she shared her story
online she's actually working on a book
that can help parents sort of deal with
that difficult diagnosis and how to talk
about it with their kids and things like
that go on gold is really the awareness
campaign for childhood cancer so the
idea is that getting the word out
getting it a lot of exposure may get
more funding for this cause more funding
for research and then hopefully a cure
so I wanted to support not only
Elizabeth's story but I know I mean just
through being working in the news I've
met so many parents who have a child
battling cancer and you know there's a
benefit here there there's a fundraiser
or something to try to help them pay for
all the expense you know that they have
just in dealing with the treatments
associated with whatever cancer their
child might be dealing with Elizabeth's
son is actually dealing with leukemia
she reached out to me and I thought this
was really something that I wanted to be
a part of and you know how in my world
can I do this well it was through maybe
a makeup video a gold makeup tutorial
sort of in honor of her cause if you
want to do this a similar thing
definitely post a video response to come
for these families and for anyone who
might encounter this in the future so
for this tutorial it is all about gold
so let's jump right in and show you how
to do it i'm using my Too Faced return
of sexy palette and there was just a
great little section of this palette
that has some great gold warm colors
that I thought would be perfect for this
video so to start off I just prime my
lids with some eyeshadow primer and then
I used the light gold color here it's
kind of like it's not at all a brass
eagle
was kind of like a soft champagne gold
and I just used a small eyeshadow brush
to Pat that all over the lid and also
kind of around the inner tear duct area
is when I took the shade in this
grouping that's kind of like an old gold
sort of a little bit darker gold with a
little bit of brown and I just patted
that on the outer part of the lid to add
a little bit of contrast using a
small-ish crease brush I use the brown
that's in the center of this grouping of
colors it's a really warm light brown so
it's kind of a different take on the
crease instead of going super deep and
dark we're keeping it a little bit light
but still a shade that can provide that
natural crease contrast color we're
after then i buffed it out with a fuller
crease brush after that I used that same
brush to apply the lightest shade kind
of a shimmery highlight just under the
brow using it really lightly it i used
my wet and wild mega liner for a really
thin line all across the upper lash line
and then I gave it a little bit of a
thicker wing at the end just for a
little bit of an upturn look there i'm
not using falsies for this look surprise
surprise so I wanted to do you know just
a little bit of a wing I took the liner
that actually comes with this palette it
is the eyes waterproof liner in perfect
blush using it in a small area there to
connect to that way then grab a smudger
brush going to the darkest brown in this
kit and that we're just going to overlap
that liner and carry it on in until we
meet up with the goal that we put around
the tear duct so a nice soft lower lash
line next just give your lashes a curl
i'm using my prestige my blankets lashes
mascara um i've heard some good things
about this one so i'm just going to
build up a couple of coats on my upper
lashes and then for a softer lower lash
look I'll use the Maybelline lash
discovery with the really teeny tiny
brush a really simple kind of natural
look actually I think as you just look
at me and my eyes are open you know it
seems to be sort of a soft neutral look
but it's kind of that peekaboo effect
when you look down and then you see that
pretty wash of gold on the list bars
what else is on my face I used the
Revlon Photoready bronzer
I love this bronzer for just kind of
warming up the skin and doing a little
contouring and then for the blush for a
little bit of a peachy glow with some
gold undertones I use NYX blush and
pinched love that color my lips for an
overall kind of base shade I use this
essence lipstick in in the nude just a
creamy kind of nude lipstick they're not
like my face needed just a little more
color with all the soft tones elsewhere
and I used my buxom big and healthy
lipstick in Tokyo this kind of reddish
shade actually to deepen things up thank
you for watching this video again my
small way of contributing to the goin
gold childhood cancer awareness campaign
when I get involved in this as well we
can provide a little strength or a
little boost to those who are facing
this horrible problem so thank you so
much for watching guys I hope you have a
wonderful day and I will see you next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
