tutorial I'm really excited about it
it's going to be kind of in-depth since
it does involve false eyelashes but it's
sort of going to be a like black and
gold tutorial as you can see you know
using kind of a smoky eye effect but any
lighter shade that I'm using in this
tutorial is going to have that nice gold
tone to it my whole makeup kind of has
that glow to it and if you're wondering
kind of what that's all about I'll just
tell you i'm using my Rimmel lasting
finish foundation and then as far as my
other face products for my blush I put
on um rimmel peach blush and then I used
as my contour shade I'd use covergirl
cheekers in golden pink and then I did
like just a sweep of this color because
it's just so warm and pretty it son what
is it Milani minerals in my tie that
blush so after doing that though what's
kind of giving this a different look is
I used my Smashbox a flash powder and
what this is is just like a loose powder
but it's got like a little bit of like
golden um sparkle to it you can maybe
see that a little bit there so you use
it sparingly but I just kind of used it
like the tops of my cheekbones and um
you know that's basic across my forehead
so that's what's kind of giving it that
whole you know tone that's kind of
golden e but I really want to focus on
the eyes for this tutorial so let's go
ahead and did first was applied my Too
Faced shadow insurance and then um the
first shadow I'm going to put on there
all over my lid this is from that
Smashbox rapture set where I got all
those duo's for Christmas this duo is
called the zyre and i'm going to be
using um this shade right here it's kind
of a i'm not sure if it's coming through
but it's just like a light golden a
yellow so i'm going to use my ELF shadow
brush just to pack that color right on
my lid just all over the lid and this is
just a great i look for going out it's
just you know a way to kind
switch up the typical smoky eye I love
golden a tones and then putting the
black in and dark gray and with it
really is a pretty touch so after doing
that I want kind of a neutrally shade to
go in my entire crease just to kind of
get get us ready get us just a tone
closer to the black shade we're going to
be applying it just will make blending
easier and easier blend to go from the
light shade to a medium shade to a dark
shade if that makes sense so I'm going
to use my Smashbox number 15 brush kind
of like a bullet there and I'm going to
be using this NYX trio the trio is
golden rust and walnut bronze and this
is walnut bronze here on the end so it's
just kind of a nice sort of shimmery
taupe and I'm just going to apply that
all in the crease just from from inner
to outer this this would be a great um
once you get this shade in here this
would be a great stopping point for just
an everyday I think because just the
right amount of like subtle contour but
we're gonna kick it up a notch and this
the basics of this as far as what I'm
doing with the light shade on the lid
then going in with this shade and then
deepening it up with like a smoky black
that's the basic concept behind a lot of
my smoky looks that I've done you know
you can take these very same methods and
apply them to different colors of
shadows so that's why this is so great
to learn but so I've got that all over
there and then I want to work in a
deeper shade so I'm going to use my
makeup forever diamond shadow and this
is the sparkly black shade actually it's
rubbed off the back so I'm not sure
exactly what it's called but as you can
see it's just like kind of like a black
disco ball there so I'm going to take my
fine crease brush and just use that to
start working this end of the crease and
also on the outer part of my my lid so
I'll come in a little closer so you can
see that
so we're just really putting the focus
here on the outer half and we're going
right on top of that walnut bronze and
again these colors you know these are my
suggested colors but if you've got
something close to this and you know it
works for you don't stress yourself out
by getting exactly what I'm using
because I'm just letting you know in
case you know you want to know exactly
what shade i am using i'm telling you so
just putting that out there so i'm
focusing on getting that outer V here
with the makeup forever shadow and you
can see it blends pretty easily but
we're going to keep keep blending it
more after we do the liner that's sort
of a method I use to really make sure my
eye shadow shape is consistent with the
shape of the liner but over top of this
i'm just going to grab this my Sephora
rounded crease brush and just barely get
any shadow on it and just kind of end of
the bat black shadow and just kind of
lightly go over that just to blend it
out a little bit and you'll notice this
i right here is a little more defined
than this one is at this point but we're
going to come back to that so next I'm
going to get into my golden sunrise from
covergirl and this really comes in handy
for this golden look so I'm going to use
that as my highlight here on my brow
bone use that to also soften the borders
of the black shade just like so and then
if you want just a hint more highlight
like maybe right in here under the brow
I'd go back to that lightest shade that
we put on our lid at the very start and
just get a little bit right under there
and we really like how this look turned
out it's really interesting how warm it
is but yet how smoky it kind of turned
out so we're going to go ahead and move
on to the liner i'm going to use revlon
colorstay liquid liner in black on the
top lash line so let's just go ahead and
do that
I pretty much go from the inner quarter
to the outer corner you just get that
seamless line which will come in handy
when we apply those false lashes on top
of it and once I get towards the outer
corner i'm looking to thicken the line
and extend it out just a little bit here
past the natural lash line and then
we're going to use that point to blend
in our lower lash line so I'm just going
to define that a little bit more here
it's going to look kind of bold right
there but trust me once those lashes get
on there it's going to all make sense um
on the lower lash line i'm going to use
revlon colorstay pencil in black brown
might as well be black it's really dark
but I'm just going to do a light stroke
of that from inner to outer corner and
if it looks you know kind of bold oh
that's what I mean to do with this this
is kind of a smoky nighttime nightlife
kind of look so that's where I'm going
with it so you can see I just blend it
right in with that and then to help us
blend further we're just going to take a
little smudge tip and sort of smudge it
out just slightly here just like that
and then we're going to go over the top
of that with our diamond shadow like the
makeup forever I just think I like
holding this up to the camera because it
looks so pretty and then I need the
liner brush I'm going to use my angled
liner brush for that and just top it off
eyes have this habit of wanting to top
off any sort of cream based liner that I
put down there I like to go over it with
something just in case
and so now looking looking at this shape
we've got here we got sort of that
winged effect and so we want to make the
most of that with our shadow you can see
how this is coming right in line for
were to draw a line here from the lower
liner out you would have this outer V
and so this is going to really help you
guide you through that here I'm going to
go right off that corner and create a
slightly more defined shape here now
with the the sparkly black shadow which
isn't really all that sparkly on but
just a little bit so I'm kind of
blending from Midway my midway point of
the crease right out like that so see
how that's kind of mimicking mimicking
that shape a little more now we're just
using the tip of that liner which
extended just a little bit out and it's
making our eyes look a lot bigger when
we do this step okay so once you've done
that you know continue to mess with it
it's okay shadows like this are
generally pretty buildable so you can
you know start out with it however you
want and and build more color as you
feel you're comfortable with so I'm
going to go ahead and curl my lashes and
we're going to get on with the false
lashes here and I did do a tutorial
where it's probably a little more in
depth on that process um not too long
ago it's back there if you just kind of
look through my videos I think I find it
but I'm gonna apply a coat of covergirl
volume exact mascara just too because I
like to have something on my lashes
before I stick false eyelashes on there
I just feel like they blend better and
this helps them kind of get that you
know that upward motion going and it
just works really well with the false
eyelashes so any mascara will do for
this I just kind of I honestly just
grabbed one doesn't really make a
difference because those false eyelashes
will
doing the work for us we don't have to
worry about layering on tons and tons of
mascara so I am going to take one step
while that's kind of drying a little bit
I'm going to take my maybelline mineral
power finishing veil stuff and I'm going
to just use a regular old concealer
brush that I use for dry products and
since we are using such dark makeup Here
I am just going to put that here it's
very oily orbing and this is just kind
of my safety net because I don't want
that to you know come down and and
smudge down on my cheek or right under
my eye there so that's just kind of our
insurance policy there for the the lower
liner and so I'm going to go ahead and
get my lashes prepped here i'm using the
salon perfect lashes available at
Walmart a couple of them came off of
this other I I pulled them I you can't
really tell that they're not there
because these are pretty natural lashes
anyway but I was like that stinks i mean
i thought i was pulling him off
carefully but apparently not not
carefully enough so see if i can get
this whole strip off they're pretty
delicate you know some some brands more
so than others these may not be the
highest quality by any means but anyway
I don't know if I told you I can't
remember what it said these are sweeties
and I'm gonna hold those here with one
hand and dip into my glue with the other
I'm do it using the duo dark tone glue
you can use whatever glue you prefer but
I do like the duo brand they have clear
as well I just kind of got into use in
the dark blue because I figured our
kleiner dark blue that drives black you
know but if you are if you have a habit
of kind of hitting yourself elsewhere in
the I don't get the dark tone glue if
you're just starting out because it will
dry black so you got to keep that in
mind it looks great as I put it on right
now but it dries black and and those
little mistakes will show up if you hit
yourself you know just accidentally put
it elsewhere on the eye if you get any
on your fingers I've learned make sure
you gets off your fingers before you
start touching
I because that's another way you can
kind of get a little bit of problem area
so just let that dry on there you can
see these are pretty natural lashes it's
funny how even just natural really
natural lashes can do great things for
your eye and I already did my brows too
so those are done sorry if this is
shaping up to be kind of a long video
I'm trying to look back at what I
started and I feel like it's getting
long but you know you want to see the
whole process so I want to show it to
you so now that this is getting tachy
that's the reason why I'm waiting um I'm
gonna place these right here on my I
hopefully you can sort of see what I'm
doing just going to line it up and make
sure the band it's on there touching the
lash line okay so little touch you there
for a sec and I couldn't really talk but
now that it is on I'm just going to lift
up and make sure they're drying in that
upward fashion it's like so and once
they get even more dry i'm going to
apply a coat of mascara on there just to
kind of bond the lashes together but
other than that the look is done i hope
you guys like it it's just you know a
new way to do the smoky eye we using a
little bit of gold tones and the gold
tones all throughout your makeup too i
don't know if i mentioned i am using
revlon matte lipstick in nude attitude
but on top of that i put the revlon
colorstay mineral lip glaze and lasting
shimmer so that's what's giving it that
nice shine so thanks a lot for watching
guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
