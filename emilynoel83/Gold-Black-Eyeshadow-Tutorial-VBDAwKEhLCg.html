tutorial I'm really excited about it
it's gonna be kind of in-depth since it
does involve false eyelashes but it's
sort of gonna be a like black and gold
tutorial as you can see you know using
kind of a smoky eye effect but any
lighter shade that I'm using in this
tutorial is going to have that nice gold
tone to it my whole makeup kind of has
that glow to it and if you're wondering
kind of what that's all about I'll just
tell you I'm using my Rimmel lasting
finish foundation and then as far as my
other face products for my blush I put
on Rimmel peach blush and then I used as
my contour shade I used covergirl
cheekers and golden pink and then I did
like just a sweep of this color because
it's just so warm and pretty it's um
what is it Milani minerals and my Thai
that blush so after doing that though
what's kind of giving this a different
look is I used my Smashbox flash powder
and what this is is just like a loose
powder but it's got like a little bit of
like golden
sparkle to it you can maybe see that a
little bit there so you use it sparingly
but I just kind of used it like the tops
of my cheekbones and you know that's
basic kind of across my forehead so
that's what's kind of giving it that
whole you know tone that's kind of
golden II but I really want to focus on
the eyes for this tutorial so let's go
ahead and did first was applied my Too
Faced shadow insurance and then the
first shadow I'm gonna put on there all
over my lid this is from that Smashbox
rapture set where I got all those duo's
for Christmas this duo is called desire
and I'm going to be using this shade
right here it's kind of a I'm not sure
if it's coming through but it's just
like a light golden yellow so I'm going
to use my ELF shadow brush just to pack
that color right on my lid just all over
the lid and this is just a great I look
for going out it's just you know a way
to
to switch up the typical smokey eye I
love golden a tones and then putting the
black in and dark gray and with it
really is a pretty touch so after doing
that I want kind of a neutrally shade to
go in my entire crease just to kind of
get get us ready get us just a tone
closer to the black shade we're gonna be
applying it just will make blending
easier and easier blend to go from the
light shade to a medium shade to a dark
shade if that makes sense so I'm gonna
use my Smashbox number 15 brush kind of
like a bullet there and I'm gonna be
using this NYX trio the trio is golden
rust and walnut bronze and this is
walnut bronze here on the end so it's
just kind of a nice sort of shimmery
taupe and I'm just gonna apply that all
in the crease just from from inner to
outer this this would be a great umm
once you get this shade in here this
would be a great stopping point for just
an everyday eye I think because just the
right amount of like subtle contour but
we're gonna kick it up a notch and this
the basics of this as far as what I'm
doing with the light shade on the lid
then going in with this shade and then
deepening it up with like a smoky black
that's the basic concept behind a lot of
my smokey looks that I've done you know
you can take these very same methods and
apply them to different colors of
shadows so that's why this is so great
to learn but so I've got that all over
there and then I want to work in a
deeper shade so I'm gonna use my makeup
forever diamond shadow and this is the
sparkly black shade actually it's rubbed
off the back so I'm not sure exactly
what it's called but as you can see it's
just like kind of like a black disco
ball there so I'm gonna take my fine
crease brush and just use that to start
working this end of the crease and also
on the outer part of my my lid so I'll
come in a little closer so you can see
that
so we're just really putting the focus
here on the outer half and we're going
right on top of that walnut bronze and
again these colors you know these are my
suggested colors but if you've got
something close to this and you know it
works for you don't stress yourself out
by getting exactly what I'm using
because I'm just letting you know in
case you know you want to know exactly
what shade I am using I'm telling you so
just putting that out there so I'm
focusing on getting that outer V here
with the make up forevers shadow and you
can see it blends pretty easily but
we're gonna keep keep blending it more
after we do the liner that's sort of a
method I use to really make sure my
eyeshadow shape is consistent with the
shape of the liner but over top of this
I'm just gonna grab this my Sephora
rounded crease brush and just barely get
any shadow on it and just kind of and of
the that black shadow and just kind of
lightly go over that just to blend it
out a little bit and you'll notice this
eye right here is a little more defined
than this one is at this point but we're
gonna come back to that so next I'm
gonna get into my golden sunrise from
covergirl and this really comes in handy
for this golden look so I'm gonna use
that as my highlight here on my brow
bone use that to also soften the borders
of the black shade just like so and then
if you want just a hint more highlight
like maybe right in here under the brow
I'd go back to that lightest shade that
we put on our lid at the very start and
just get a little bit right under there
I'm ooh I really like how this look
turned out it's really interesting how
warm it is but yet how smoky it kind of
turned out so we're gonna go ahead and
move on to the liner I'm gonna use
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in black
on the top lash line so let's just go
ahead and do that
I pretty much go from the inner corner
to the outer corner you just get that
seamless line which will come in handy
when we apply those false lashes on top
of it and once I get towards the outer
corner I'm looking to thicken the line
and extend it out just a little bit here
past the natural lash line and then
we're going to use that point to blend
in our lower lash line so I'm just gonna
define that a little bit more here it's
gonna look kind of bold right there but
trust me once those lashes get on there
it's gonna all make sense on the lower
lash line I'm gonna use Revlon Colorstay
pencil in black Brown might as well be
black it's really dark but I'm just
gonna do a light stroke of that from
inner to outer corner and if it looks
you know kind of bold oh that's what I
mean to do with this this is kind of a
smoky nighttime night life kind of look
so that's where I'm going with it so you
can see I just blend it right in with
that
and then to help us blend further we're
just gonna take a little smudge tip and
sort of smudge it out just slightly here
just like that and then we're gonna go
over the top of that with our diamond
shadow like the makeup forever I just
think I like holding this up to the
camera because it looks so pretty and
then I need the liner brush I'm gonna
use my angled liner brush for that and
just top it off I just have this habit
of wanting to top off any sort of cream
based liner that I put down there I like
to go over it with something just in
case and so now looking looking at
shape we've got here we got sort of that
wind effect and so we want to make the
most of that with our shadow you can see
how this is coming right and line for to
draw a line here from the lower liner
out you would have this outer V and so
this is going to really help you guide
you through that here I'm going to go
right off that corner and create a
slightly more defined shape here now
with thee these sparkly black shadow
which isn't really all that sparkly on
but just a little bit so I'm kind of
blending from Midway my midway point of
the crease right out like that so see
how that's kind of mimicking mimicking
that shape a little more now we're just
using the tip of that liner which
extended just a little bit out and it's
making our eyes look a lot bigger when
we do this step okay so once you've done
that you know continue to mess with it
it's okay shadows like this are
generally pretty buildable so you can
you know start out with it however you
want and and build more color as you
feel you're comfortable with so I'm
gonna go ahead and curl my lashes and
we're gonna get on with the false lashes
here and I did do a tutorial where it's
probably a little more in-depth on that
process not too long ago it's back there
if you just kind of look through my
videos I think you'll find it but I'm
gonna apply a coat of covergirl volume
exact mascara just to because I like to
have something on my lashes before I
stick false eyelashes on there I just
feel like they blend better and this
helps them kind of get that you know
that upward motion going and it just
works really well if the false eyelashes
so any mascara will do for this I just
kind of I honestly just grabbed one
doesn't really make a difference because
those false eyelashes will be doing the
work for us we don't have to worry about
layering on tons and tons of mascara
some okay I'm gonna take one step while
that's kind of drying a little bit I'm
gonna take my Maybelline mineral power
finishing veil stuff and I'm gonna just
use a regular old concealer brush that I
use for dry products and since we are
using such dark makeup here I am just
going to put that here
it's very oil absorbing and this is just
kind of my safety net because I don't
want that to you know come down and and
smudge down on my cheek or right under
my eye there so that's just kind of our
insurance policy there for the the lower
liner and so I'm gonna go ahead and get
my lashes prepped here I'm using the
salon perfect lashes available at
Walmart a couple of them came off of
this other eye I pulled them out you
can't really tell that they're not there
because these are pretty natural lashes
anyway but I was like that stinks I mean
I thought I was pulling them off
carefully but apparently not
not carefully enough so see if I can get
this whole strip off there pretty
delicate you know some some brands more
so than others these may not be the
highest quality by any means but anyway
I don't know if I told you I can't
remember what it said these are sweeties
and I'm gonna hold those here with one
hand and dip into my glue with the other
I'm do it using the duo dark tone glue
you can use whatever glue you prefer but
I do like the duo brand they have clear
as well I just kind of got into using
the dark blue because I figure dark
liner dark blue that drives black you
know but if you are if you have a habit
of kind of hitting yourself elsewhere in
the eye don't get the dark tone glue if
you're just starting out because it will
dry black so you got to keep that in
mind it looks a grey as I put it on
right now but it dries black and and
those little mistakes will show up if
you hit yourself you know just
accidentally put it elsewhere on the eye
and if you get any on your fingers I've
learned make sure you it's off your
fingers before you start touching your
eye because that's another
way you can kind of get a little bit of
problem area so just let that dry on
there you can see these are pretty
natural lashes it's funny how even just
natural really natural lashes can do
great things for your eye and I already
did my brows too so those are done sorry
if this is shaping up to be kind of a
long video I'm trying to look back at
when I started it and I feel like it's
getting along but you know you want to
see the whole process so I want to show
it to you so now that this is getting
tacky that's the reason why I'm waiting
I'm gonna place these right here on my
eye hopefully you can sort of see what
I'm doing
just kinda line it up and make sure the
band on there touching the lash line
okay
it's a little touchy there for a second
I couldn't really talk but now that it
is on I'm just going to lift up and make
sure they're drying in that upward
fashion it's like so and once they get
even more dry I'm gonna apply a coat of
mascara on there just to kind of bond
the lashes together but other than that
the look is done I hope you guys like it
it's just you know a new way to do the
smokey eye we're using a little bit of
gold tones and the gold tones all
throughout your makeup - I don't know if
I mentioned I am using Revlon matte
lipstick in nude attitude but on top of
that I put the Revlon Colorstay mineral
lip glaze and lasting shimmer so that's
what's giving it that nice shine so
thanks a lot for watching guys and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
