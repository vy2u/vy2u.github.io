tutorial for you today it's an eye look
that is very holiday appropriate I think
in kind of a different twist on my
holiday look that I showed you the other
day this one is rather than just sort of
the basic you know cream colored shadow
this is a kind of a golden a look so
this is what I'm going to be showing you
today it's actually a gold look with a
hint of red and brown to kind of warm it
up a little even more because gold is a
very you know it's a very warm toned on
your eye and it's just I think you're
going to enjoy it's a little bit
different technique then I may use in a
lot of my other videos and by the way
you wondering my lip color is revlon
colorstay sheer in sheer Ruby so it's
kind of like comes off as a little bit
more than that um red but it's not too
in-your-face for red so anyway I've gone
ahead and I've also done my eyebrows and
put on some I primer so we're going to
start out with the shadow and we're
going to put shade just all over our lid
and it's from the starry boutique color
set I think this one is called in the
club but it doesn't have that on the
package it just says number six and so
it's pretty identifiable on cherry
cultures website under the starry
section but we're going to use this
really metallic gold shade and we're
going to just apply that all over our
lid
and I mean it's just the only basic but
yet when you put it on your just kind of
like wow you know it really does catch
your eye and we're kind of going to go
go ahead and just for blending sake sort
of blend it up into the crease area just
a little bit so other shades will
overlap with it that's kind of a good
strategy with a lot of Shadows I find to
sort of put it beyond where you want it
to be so it blends more seamlessly with
the other shades so I'm just going to
pack on a little more color here and
there we go there's a basis for the
looks of gold and then I'm actually
going to take red which I know it sounds
a little bit odd to put on your eye but
this is from NYX this is in cherry make
sure it doesn't wash it out here it
really is a true true red it's more red
than my than my lips are actually and
I'm just going to dip my blending brush
in here this is actually my Sephora
professional brush the rounded crease
brush number 13 I really like that for
putting on some soft color in the crease
and I'm just barely getting any on my
brush and I'm just going to go over the
crease area a little bit and you can see
that gold almost looking a little more
orangi perhaps as I do this very nice
and warm and we may go back and sort of
reapply on this a little bit but now
they put their I'm also going to just
take a small brush my little low Cornell
brush and also get a little more right
down in here on the creek on the outer
half of the lid okay now next what we
want to do is sort of give it a little
bit deeper look in the crease so we have
a little more definition I'm going to
use my Too Faced shadow in dirt bag
which is actually brown with gold flecks
in it and I'm going to take my small
crease brush which looks like this use
it a lot and just get a little bit on
your brush
and I'm just going to kind of focus it
on the outer part of the crease here
okay so this is basically for the main
part of the I besides my highlight just
kind of it's a three-color look that
really isn't all that tricky it just
does require a white touch at times
which can be hard for some people to
sort of wrap their head around that but
it's it's really not that bad and then
finally just to kind of blend over at
all we're going to get back into the red
shade again just to give it a little
more pop and we're just going to blend
right over everything crease end up okay
so that's what we're dealing with her
right now and then we're going to go
ahead and deal with what's up here and
for that I'm going to switch and use a
different brush than what I used to put
it on my lid that was my ELF I shadow
brush which really packs on the color I
want it to be a little more diffused so
we're going to go back to that gold
shade with more of a fluffy eyeshadow
brush and we're going to lightly just
dust this just to continue the theme of
the look all over that area in there
okay and then just for an added
highlight i'm going to use I know I'm
just jumping around on the brand here
I'm going to use my Sally girl single
and champagne it's just like a really
pretty pearl shade and I'm just going to
do a little extra highlight right under
the arch okay so there's the shadow for
this look and then we're going to do
some lining but the liner is really kind
of taking a back seat in this look I'm
not putting a lot of emphasis on it I'm
going to use my revlon line fantasy in
chocolate which I love the gold
undertones in it on almost everything
i'm using because this it won't pick it
up on the camera i'm sure but there are
some tiny tiny little bits of gold in
this and i just think it pulls pulls
everything together really well so i'm
just going to look down into a little
mare
here so you can better see how I'm doing
this because I'm just going to start at
the halfway point I guess you'd say and
staying very close to the lash line and
I'm actually this is just a little brush
that came with it it's very fine and I
actually like you like this brush for a
cream liner so it's working and just
very slightly blend forward but we're
not going to go all the way in okay
we're just going to keep it and again
this is not one of the darker brown
liner shades that you could use here
either so keep that in mind if you want
to duplicate this we want to keep the
liner soft so that is why I chose to use
a brown that I have that is that is not
very eat okay and then we're going to go
on the underneath side and for that
we're just going to really mainly
concentrate on connecting right there at
the outer corner oops I'm sorry I think
I went out of frame there on you and
we're going to go basically most most of
the way in and as you can see I'm just
kind of like getting it like right in
between my lashes really taking it easy
on the liner okay you can kind of see
what we've done there it's basically on
the upper and lower lashline we're
really just trying to be so what I'm
actually going to win a little more of
this cream into the corner to make sure
I've got that connection okay so next
check in my time here I'm going to grab
my gold liner from use this is another
thing that's available on cherry culture
comics the ultra fine eyeliner in
metallic gold and I'm just going to kind
of run around
the corner and right into the inner part
here
just a little bit and that's kind of
ties that kind of old gold finish and
I'm going to go back to my gold shade
here in this little palette and grab my
liner brush and just sort of go over for
a little added effect we're going to go
over this with a little more gold here
I'm sort of just whatever you have left
just kind of gently get it out toward e
toward the edge there so finally we're
going to do some mascara and I hold for
about 15 seconds or so it for the sake
of time we're just gonna breeze through
this i'm using my mary kay ultimate
mascara and this really builds up in one
coat lengthens thickens everything if
you haven't tried this mascara i think
you would really like it just for the
simplicity of it all in terms of
applying and then I'm going to do one
quick swipe one or two on the outer and
there's the look it's so easy so fun for
the holidays and I hope you guys like it
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
