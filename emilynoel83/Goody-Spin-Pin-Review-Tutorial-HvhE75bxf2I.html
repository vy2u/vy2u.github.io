tutorial this is a hair look that is so
easy to do because of two really special
products that I personally have never
seen before
and it's from a goodie simple style so
goodie is a widely known hair product
brand and it's called the spin pin and
for about I think I paid maybe five or
six bucks for this at Walmart and you
can get them in blonde or brunette I
have the brunette here and so they're
kind of a brownish a little tool here
there's just like a spiral pin and you
get two of them and the concept is that
you can make a really easy bun with this
with this tool just by twisting your
hair into a bun no other tools are
needed I'm not using elastic bands and
I'm not using bobby pins to get this
look here it's almost too easy and my
hair has layers and so a big concern you
know part of why I was skeptical about
this was that I thought you know there's
no way that these two pins are going to
keep all the little sprucing out layers
of my hair actually contained into one
button but it was able to do that I did
a little side bun here today just by
twisting one of them downward one of
them upward and you've got it it's
really incredible I was using a lot less
time and a lot less tools than with any
other you know method of doing a bun
like this and there are some variations
and you know there are some really
simple directions on the back of the box
as to how to use the spin pins and then
if you open up there's a little guide on
the inside showing you a couple of other
ways to do it you could do like a double
or you know side bun middle of the back
of your head you can do one up high I
mean there are a lot of options here
with this product so again it's a very
inexpensive way to do it they say one of
those spin pins can do the work of 20
bobby pins and I honestly believe that
after doing this look so if you want to
see how to use them keep on watching the
first step to using these spin pins for
a bun is to gather your hair in
- you know one chunk as if you were
going to pull it back into a ponytail to
demonstrate this look I'm going to do it
on the side here kind of you know back
behind one here for a little low side
bun but you could do it right in the
middle of your head or you can do it up
high it works any way you want to do it
so anyway I'm just going to kind of pull
my hair over there I do not need to use
a ponytail holder to secure my hair
whatsoever you could if you wanted to
but honestly you don't need it for this
so that's awesome
so I'm going to collect my hair over
here behind my ear and then I'm going to
twist my hair into a bun and so I think
it helps to twist it up and then
continue to twist the hair as you go
around and I have layers in my hair so
that's always you know something I feel
like I have to think about when I'm
doing these styles but just try to kind
of tuck any any loose ends in there as
best you can and you know that's
basically your starting point then
you're going to take a pin with the open
end you can see one end is closed and
the other end had these open tips here
you're going to take that and screw that
basically counter-clock clockwise down
into your bun from the top so I'm just
twisting twisting twisting as far as you
as it can go until you can't you know
hold on to that part anymore take the
other part with the open end going up
and then just spin that up into your bun
and now your bun is secure and it's not
going anywhere it's really surprisingly
secure there and if you wanted to top
this off with just a little bit of
hairspray to make sure you know
everything is as secure as you want it
to be I've got some bangs kind of like
coming back here that I might style a
little bit and you know really get those
looking the way I want them but I was so
surprised at how this really holds your
bun into place and despite me having
quite a few layers in my hair it
actually works really nicely so it's
something I'm going to be using a lot
whether I want to do this low bow
or a high bun or anything you know it
really does the work of I think I was
watching a little web ad for this and it
does one of those spin pins does the
work of twenty bobby pins and I believe
that because recently I did a bun and I
was using a bunch of bobby pins and it
was just kind of getting ridiculous you
know I was like oh that's not staying
and that's not staying it and it was
just a ton of stuff in my hair this was
so quick and it actually holds it in
there very nicely he wanted more volume
in your hair like kind of up in the
crown if you wanted more of a pouf going
on you could definitely either you know
do a pouf by pulling back the top part
and make that little front pouf and then
sort of connect it in the back with some
bobby pins like a half-up half-down
style and then use the rest of your hair
to twist it into the bun with the spin
pins or you could leave kind of a side
bang here kind of section off some tease
Oh a little bit so you've got that kind
of poof secure it with a couple of bobby
pins in the back so you're in a half up
half down style and then twist the rest
into the into the bun you know you have
a lot of options in terms of how this
part is styled but I do want to show you
really quickly how to take them out in
case you're concerned that maybe now
that I've put these cork screws in my
hair am I going to be able to get them
out again and it's super easy again all
I have in here is the spin pins nothing
else is helping them and I'm going to
find the one that I first put in and so
I'm going to just twist that
counterclockwise here to get it out so
there's one and then find the bottom of
the other one and just kind of twist
that counterclockwise as well and to
that my hair is out now so very easy to
put in take out there secure just a
little top your look off with a little
hairspray just to kind of finish it and
get you know any flyaway hairs in there
but even if you have layers these spin
pins can do a really good job of keeping
your look in place so thank you so much
for tuning in for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
