joining me for this video how many of
you have shadows sitting around that say
use wet or dry or maybe they say baked
eyeshadow on them and I oftentimes
really just have it used them wet you
know I just use them dry but if you do
experiment with using them wet which I'm
sure many of you have you can really get
a different effect I'm going to be
taking a couple of the bait shells from
Milani which are gorgeous they're kind
of marble than swirled lightly them on
your eye they look one way dry and like
a totally different shadow when you use
them wet and just because you decide to
use them what doesn't mean that's the
only way you can use them so like for
example for this look I've used each of
these shades wet and dry and I feel like
they come together to give you a really
nice soft smoky look so i'll show you
how to get best i'm just going to apply
a little bit of primer here on my lid
and crease area that with your finger
and really just blend it into your
entire eye area then i'm going to take
my Milani baked shadow infusion you can
see this is a really pretty shade of
some lilac and gold colors and it's
going to come off looking a little bit
like a light lavender mathtype shade and
then i have this little spray bottle of
water and basically to get this to make
this via wet shadow I just spritz a
little water on the palm of my hand you
can see my hand is not soaking wet but
there's just a little water on there I
take the sponge tip applicator and just
dampen it on my hand and then I go
straight to the product this is not
going to mess up your product or make it
so you can't apply it later the moisture
on there will will not cause any
problems or again I am basically just
going to apply this all over my lid here
and you can see that the reflective
quality that this Shadow has when you
apply it wet is you know it's just a
more vibrant color than you'd get if you
wear it dry so my applicator is still a
little a little damp
so I'm just going to also bring it up to
the crease as well you're going to find
this is going to be a really long
wearing looked and one of the things
that i love about doing a kind of a wet
/ dry technique is that i can take a
brush to this now and pick up a little
product and then totally soften this
whole area with that shadow and it just
blends nicely it's almost like i'm using
two different shades like using it wet
was one shade and using it dry gives me
another softer look as you can see as I
just blend this up here i'm not even
using a different highlight i'm just
really kind of concentrating it right in
here and then you know diffusing that
shade up to the brow so it's really
light to almost non-existent right up
next to the current take a really pretty
shade called a melange and this is a
black and you can see some little bits
of white but overall as the light
catches it there is a subtle gold
shimmer in this product so I'm just
going to do the same thing I just spray
my hand and you could do this any number
of different ways I just find this
really easy to get the applicator wet
without getting it soaking wet and you
can do this with a brush as well if
you'd rather apply a brush to your hand
and then to your product but then again
just I kind of just swirl it on the
product and then I'm just going to apply
this on the outer part of my eyelid and
you can see the intensity of the black
is really nice ever so slightly kind of
getting that applicator right in the
outer part of my crease and just pulling
it outward a little bit it's going to
take this bear brush as the SS 217 from
sigma which is really nice for getting
in your crease but still having some
control and like i said i don't have
anything on it I'm just buffing over and
go back to this dark shade just dry
using my pencil brush here and I'm just
going to use that color as soft as I can
under the lower lash line next I'm going
to use some pencil liner this is my ever
color automatic waterproof liner in onyx
from mally beauty I love it because it's
really dark and it lasts a super long
time on
water line so I'm just going to apply
some of that to the water line here also
going to actually give a little bit of
depth really cementing this right right
between the lashes on the outer part
here and then I like to kind of blend
over that again with the dark shadow and
I'm going to line the upper lash line
with this
you
alright guys here's the finished look
once the lashes are on and everything is
all finished up so I hope you like this
what I really just wanted to show you
was if you have some shadows in your
collection that are baked or say you
know wet/dry instead of just having one
shadow that really doubles as two
totally different looks depending on how
you want to use them so that's the eye
part of things on my face you know I
went through my regular foundation
concealer and all that but then two
bronze it up and kind of give my face
sub contour I feel like when I wear my
hair parted in the middle I sort of pay
more attention to doing a little bit of
maybe contouring on the forehead like
concentrating a little bit more on
either side also the cheekbones and for
that i love the elf contouring blush and
bronzer so i used that side there and
then just to give a little pop of
brightness on the cheeks i know i talked
about this in a recent video but i used
my pink passion blush from elf not
really to get this thank you note color
but you just use a little bit really
lightly right up in here and i feel like
it just kind of brightens up the face
for lips i played off of the gold
undertones that are also in the eyes and
I used my maybelline colorsensational
lipstick in nearly there and this kind
of comes off it's like a metallic sort
of neutral shade and then to pump up the
shine a bit i use my Rimmel vinyl bronze
lip gloss in golden goddess I've heard
some people say that these have been
discontinued but I know I I just saw
them at my local Walmart store so it
might just kind of very store to store
whether they've kept these in stock but
if you look closely at this this gives a
nice golden Sheen on top of just about
any lip color if you want to give it
that sort of a look so I hope you liked
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
