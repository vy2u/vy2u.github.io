joining me for this video how many of
you have shadows sitting around that say
use wet or dry or maybe they say baked
eyeshadow on them and I oftentimes
really just haven't used them wet you
know I just use them dry but if you do
experiment with using them wet which I'm
sure many of you have you can really get
a different effect I'm going to be
taking a couple of the baked shells from
Milani which are gorgeous they're kind
of marble then swirled lightly but it's
on your eye they look one way dry and
like a totally different shadow when you
use them wet and just because you decide
to use them wet doesn't mean that's the
only way you can use them so like for
example for this look I've used each of
these shades wet and dry and I feel like
they come together to give you a really
nice soft smokey look so I'll show you
how to get that I'm just gonna apply a
little bit of primer here on my lid and
crease area that with your finger and
really just blend it into your entire
eye area then I'm gonna take my Milani
baked shadow infusion you can see this
is a really pretty shade of some lilac
and gold colors and it's gonna come off
looking a little bit like a light
lavender mathtype shade and then I have
this little spray bottle of water and
basically to get this to make this be a
wet shadow I just spritz a little water
on the palm of my hand you can see my
hand is not soaking wet but there's just
a little water on there I take the
sponge tip applicator and just dampen it
on my hand and then I go straight to the
product this is not gonna mess up your
product or make it so you can't apply it
later the moisture on there will will
not cause any problems or again I am
basically just going to apply this all
over my lid here and you can see that
the reflective quality that this shadow
has when you apply it wet is you know
it's just a more vibrant color than
you'd get if you weren't dry so my
applicator is still a little a little
damn
so I'm just going to also bring it up to
the crease as well you're gonna find
this is going to be a really long
wearing look and one of the things that
I love about doing a kind of a wet slash
dry technique is that I can take a brush
to this now and pick up a little product
and then totally soften this whole area
with that shadow and it just blends
nicely it's almost like I'm using two
different shades like using it wet was
one shade and using it dry gives me
another softer look as you can see as I
just blend this up here I'm not even
using a different highlight I'm just
really kind of concentrating it right in
here and then you know diffusing that
shade up to the brow so it's really
light to almost non-existent right up
next to the bridge take a really pretty
shade called melange and this is a black
and you can see some little bits of
white but overall as the light catches
it there is a subtle gold shimmer in
this product so I'm just going to do the
same thing I just spray my hand and you
can do this any number of different ways
I just find this really easy to get the
applicator wet without getting it
soaking wet and you can do this with a
brush as well if you'd rather apply a
brush to your hand and then to your
product but then again just I kind of
just swirl it on the product and then
I'm just going to apply this on the
outer part of my eyelid and you can see
the intensity of the black is really
nice ever so slightly kind of getting
that applicator right in the outer part
of my crease and just pulling it outward
a little bit it's gonna take this bear
brush it's the SS 217 from Sigma which
is really nice for getting in your
crease that's still having some control
and like I said you don't have anything
on it I'm just buffing over go back to
this dark shade just dry using my pencil
brush here and I'm just gonna use that
color as soft as I can under the lower
lash line next I'm going to use some
pencil liner this is my ever color
automatic waterproof liner in onyx from
Malley Beauty I love it because it's
really dark and it lasts a super long
time on
waterlines so I'm just going to apply
some of that to the water line here also
going to actually give a little bit of
depth really cementing this right right
between the lashes on the outer part
here and then I like to kind of blend
over that again with the dark shadow I'm
going to line the upper lash line with
this
alright guys here's the finished look
once the lashes are on and everything's
all finished up so I hope you like this
what I really just wanted to show you
was if you have some shadows in your
collection that are baked or say you
know wet dry instead of just having one
shadow that really doubles as two
totally different looks depending on how
you want to use them so that's the eye
part of things on my face you know I
went through my regular foundation
concealer and all that but then to
bronze it up and kind of give my face
some contour I feel like when I wear my
hair parted in the middle I sort of pay
more attention to doing a little bit of
maybe contouring on the forehead like
concentrating a little bit more on
either side also the cheekbones and for
that I love the elf contouring blush and
bronzer so I used that side there and
then just to give a little pop of
brightness on the cheeks I know I talked
about this in a recent video but I used
my pink passion blush from ELF not
really to get this thing out color but
you just use a little bit really lightly
right up in here and I feel like it just
kind of brightens up the face for lips I
played off of the gold undertones that
are also in the eyes and I used my
Maybelline Color sensational lipstick in
nearly there and this kind of comes off
as like a metallic sort of neutral shade
and then to pump up the shine a bit I
used my Rimmel vinyl bronze lip gloss in
golden goddess I've heard some people
say that these have been discontinued
but I know I I just saw them at my local
Walmart store so it might just kind of
vary sort a store whether they've kept
these in stock but if you look closely
at this this gives a nice golden sheen
on top of just about any lip color if
you want to give it that sort of a look
so I hope you like this video thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
