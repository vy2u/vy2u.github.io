today on today's video is going to be
some tips that did not come straight
from my brain these are things that I
have actually taken from my mom and my
mom is a former cosmetologist so she
definitely does have some knowledge in
the arena of beauty to share I think if
you look to anybody who spent a little
more time on this earth than you have
and you might realize hey they they've
got some tips they've probably learned a
thing or two that I could benefit from
and you know it would have been great if
while I was back home for Thanksgiving I
would have had this idea and I could
have just you know busted out the camera
and done something right then and there
with my mom beside me but I didn't have
this idea until about two hours into my
five and a half hour drive home so I was
like bum I've got to call you early in
the morning and you know get your input
in this video so she is one of the few
people that between the hours of 6 &amp;amp; 7 I
feel like I can get away with calling in
the morning so we're just going to dial
her up here we're calling mom
Oh mom good morning you're on my video
right now yep all right all right so
I've given people the backstory of what
the idea you know of this video was and
the fact that I feel like there are
people in our lives who may have you
know some little tidbits to offer beauty
wise and sometimes you don't always
think of things early on like in your
teenage years like oh I'm going to take
that tip for Mom but time goes on and
you start to realize it yes the first
thing that I wanted to talk about and
the thing that really got this idea
churning in my mind was Dove soap
because when I went back home I did not
take my beloved face washcloth that I
used to take my makeup off every night I
had forgotten them and so mom said well
why don't you just use the Dove soap and
a washcloth and so I used it and
continued using it for several days and
you know there's something to that my
skin feels great the classic and I think
it's surprising how effectively it
actually can remove makeup like a full
face of makeup and get it around I feel
like I can get it around my eye area
without any problems yeah and it really
can can remove it fully but yet you feel
like your skin is not stripped so I
thought that was a pretty good solution
there and something I think I'm gonna
keep on doing very good okay we're gonna
move on to number 2 here and this
is copy through the straw
this is been a newer thing that I've
noticed mom doing and I thought you know
I could really benefit from that because
I don't have the best of enamel on my
teeth and I've had recently some work
done on my front teeth and now I do have
this heightened like awareness of that
area of my mouth and like I want to keep
it good as long as I can oh yeah like if
that's not a good thing if you like
person your lips around the straw that's
a good that's a good point is stretch it
stretches your lips out just a little
bit as opposed to scrunching them in so
what about your cocktails all righty
number three this is my third tip that I
feel like I have kind of taken from mom
this has also been revived a bit in my
mind after the Besame video that I did
with all the red lipsticks and that kind
of thing and it's the use of from mom
primarily the use of lip brush
but then also the advantages of blotting
a creamy lip product off and just to
give you guys a little background my mom
loves to use these like covergirl
outlast like really long wearing lip
products because they just don't move
outside the lip line but if you're going
to be using you know a creamy lipstick
which maybe you got a color you love and
you just really want to make you segment
a lip brush can really kind of ration
out the amount that you're putting on
your lips at one time as opposed to
swiping it all on straight from the
stick so tell us a little bit more about
the logic behind using the interesting
it's good to know that there's a way you
can work with some of the creamier
lipsticks in this video and what I
applied I used Revlon cherries in the
snow which is a very bold yet
creamy yeah a bold but creamy lipstick
and I love the color but I worry about
wearing it a little bit too full-on
because it will just drift even with my
lips an eye you know you mentioned like
I don't have the problems you have with
the lip line issue but with certain lip
colors anybody can have an issue I think
so applying it with the lip brush helps
you build up the color more slowly and
then the blotting of course like you
said you know keeps it from drifting as
much throughout the day and just having
as much creaminess on there all right
I'm gonna move on to tip number four
from mom and this was probably one of
the first makeup related tips I ever got
for a mom and I don't feel like she ever
at any point in my life like hit me over
the head with you know you've got to do
this makeup whiten you got to do that
she's never that kind of a person but
one thing that she did do it I think it
was before taking some one of those
church photos maybe you know the the
lovely church family photos and mom was
talking about how you know peach blush
you need some blush on there and she
seems to think that peach is a pretty
good color I am holding here covergirl
instant cheekbones in the peach
perfection but the specific blush that I
am referring to is called pretty peach
and that's also from covergirl you
really see the value in peachy blush on
just about anybody right but just using
a blush in general it is one of those
things where even if your makeup was
pretty minimal on the rest of your face
you put on a blush in the morning and it
does something don't you think that's
your problem okay
and last tip this is tip number five I
just kept it to five I do have a few
others we could do a part two on this if
you guys want it but the last thing I'm
going to leave you with here that came
comes from mom is the use of waterproof
eyeliners only and I think people get
really hung up on using waterproof
mascaras let's say for staying power and
the concern of things running but the
eyeliner is really the closest thing the
ultimate closest thing right in there
next to your eye and mom will tell you
that as your eyes age you know you've
got more of a transfer issue there with
non waterproof liners but even on my
eyes I mean around my inner corners even
if I'm not particularly like crying
during the day you know you can have
some transfer there in some weirdness
gunking up like in the inner corner of
your eyes take it away when you get
through with your telescopic I would
love you to try the Jordana color and
the waterproof liquid liner in the shade
black Envy because that's the one that I
use non-stop it's probably just a couple
bucks cheaper than the L'Oreal and that
that's the next one that you need to try
and I will make sure you have it yeah
yeah I'll get I'll give you a tip I'm
going to just go ahead and take a sip of
my coffee here and say thank you so much
for joining me on this early morning

co-host right now

supplying me with the idea without even
realizing it and we may do this again

not do this alone for a change and I
hope you enjoyed the tips let me know in

game-changing makeup tip that you've
gotten from a mom or a loved one out
