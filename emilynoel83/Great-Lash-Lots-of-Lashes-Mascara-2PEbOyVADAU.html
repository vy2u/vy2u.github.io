mascara review video I know everybody is
always looking for just the best mascara
you know even if you found one that you
kind of like I think we're all sort of
like have wandering eyes when something
new comes out and so I posted something
recently on my blog I called it mascara
Palooza and I just showed a bunch of
different new mascaras that I'm trying
now and in this video I'm going to be
talking about the new great lash lots of
lashes one good thing about great lash I
think it's got really cute packaging I
like these colors on here it's also very
affordable you can find this in most
places for you know right around $5 I
gotta admit I was not a big fan of
original great lash which looks very
much like this but the brush is
different original great lash has a
brush that is not very big but it is a
traditional brush that is kind of
spiraled around and it's a very wet
formula combination of those two things
both the brush and the formula made me
look like I had about five lashes when I
was done putting in a brush didn't have
like enough different spikes coming out
of it to really separate and make me
look like I had a lot of lashes so I
know there are some people who just
absolutely adore regular great lash and
I mean I guess my point here is that we
all have different kinds of eyelashes I
don't have great lashes so I do need
something no pun intended
great lash but I don't have the best
eyelashes so I need more help and so I
was hoping this mascara would give that
to me again it's called great lash lots
of lashes I'm just looking at the
packaging to tell you what they say it
will do it says lots of volume no clumps
no mess
it says the exclusive great little
grabber ooh that's what they're calling
their new brush gets to each and every
lash with precision for lots of volume
corner to corner volume builds with each
coat no clumps no mess contact lens say
to not let dry between coats I want to
just give you an idea of just how small
this is I'm pulling out the brush for
luck
girl LashBlast this is another rubber
brush mascara okay check it out
small brush gotta say I like this a
whole lot better than original great
well it's still kind of that wet formula
but if we're going to work with a wet
formula on my sparse lashes I need
something like this that's going to
divide them and really highlight each
one and not get too much product on
there all at once this is designed to be
used is really so this wider end is
coming up on the outer part of the eye
so this works fine for my right eye and
I felt like I got some great results as
you kind of look at how this applies you
know I really kind of liked how it built
up and as you look at the before and
after with the left eye that has nothing
on it and the right eye that has this on
it you can see the lashes are separated
I could pick one thing that is a problem
with the cone-shaped brush is that
sometimes when you pull it out the
longer bristles get cleaned off very
well through that stopper that you're
pulling the brush out through but
sometimes there's too much product left
on the small end and when you're going
back and you're putting on more mascara
I got just a little bit clumpy really
happy with the way this performed on my
right eye but again I am NOT one who
really likes to flip my wrist around I
mean this is not a brush that just works
exactly the same this way as it does
this way if you want that same effect
you've got to be turning your wrist and
that's just something I've never really
been comfortable with I'm sure there are
people out there that are like oh I do
that that's cool and if you do great
because I think then you will get a
totally symmetrical look just didn't
feel like it fans them out the same way
I kind of felt like again I was dealing
with a little bit of the clumpiness like
I said when you're going back coat after
coat and you've got a little more
product than you need on the tip roll an
affordable mascara a big improvement
over the other kind and you're probably
wondering well how does it wear
throughout the day does it flake off
that was one thing that I never had a
problem with with this one or original
great lash I didn't have issues with
this flaking on if we compare this to
covergirl LashBlast this built up a
little more thickness on the lashes just
by the nature of when you pull it out
it's not cleaning off the whole
the tip of the brush quite as well and
you're putting a little more product on
there so I think it built them up a
little bit more my lashes were a little
more clump free however with the
covergirl LashBlast had the original
great lash just down on the bottom of my
list of drugstore mascaras I mean I just
it did not work well for me
this worked a lot better so thank you so
much for watching have an awesome day
and I'll talk to you in food</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
