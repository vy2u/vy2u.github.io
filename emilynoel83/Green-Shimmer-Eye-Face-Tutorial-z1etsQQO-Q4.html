colorful look to use your 88 shimmer
palette from Coastal Scents with take a
look at this tutorial it's going to be a
really easy look using some nice greens
and blues and I'm also going to walk you
through everything I did for my face
makeup as well so if you want to see
this look keep on watching the first
thing we're going to do after applying
our moisturizer and primer I used
Smashbox photo finish is to put on a
foundation so i'm going to use Rimmel
stay matte foundation and I'm just going
to apply it all over my face with my
fingers and the color is by the way soft
beige in the number is 200
okay so once you've put on some
foundation we're going to go ahead and
use some concealer i'm going to use
Maybelline age rewind concealer in
medium around my eyes and just dotted a
couple of other places where I want a
little more brightness on my skin and
just blend that ins nice and smooth
right up to that all basically right up
to your lower lashline and next I'm
going to set the look with or my
foundation in my concealer anyway with
some loose powder I'm using one of my
favorite loose powders it's from Mary
Kay and the shade I use is beige one and
it's just a nice loose powder here I'm
just going to apply with a it with a
powder brush just all over my face
now for a bronzer for this look I'm
going to use my Milani sunset duo's in
sunset breeze I'm pretty much just going
to use the bronzer side of this it's a
nice matte bronzer I'm using a fluffy
kabuki brush that I got from big lots
actually so I'm not quite sure though
the brand is upstage you can see that
but I'm just going to use that brush and
apply it basically all over my face just
to give a nice wash of bronze color this
is matt so it's not gonna you know it's
not going to have like shimmering
particles that that sort of you know
make your skin look too shiny or
whatever so i'm just going to kind of
give myself an even and really light
application of that and then next I just
want to touch of shimmery bronzer so I'm
going to use my wet and wild bronzer and
the shade here is Tahitian tan as you
can see I'm kind of running out of this
but I'm going to just put a little bit
on my brush and just go over the parts
of my face that would naturally see the
Sun this like I said it's a bit darker
and has a bit more shimmer so I'm just
going to put that on kind of the tops of
my cheekbones and my chin down the top
of my nose and my phone hang on to the
blush for this look I want to keep it
kind of muted since we are doing kind of
blues and greens on the eyes so i'm
going to be using Rimmel blush in peach
and I'm just going to grab my blush
brush and apply that all over the apples
of my cheeks then for a contour shade
I'm going to use my covergirl cheekers
blush in golden pink and just kind of
suck your cheeks in and use that as your
contour
so when you begin the eye look you want
to have your 88 shimmer palette handy
and what we're going to do is
concentrate on some of the green shades
in this palette so I'm going to take my
elf shadow brush here I'm going to dip
into this shade right here it's kind of
a light very light lime green and we're
just going to apply that all over the
lid and I've already applied some Too
Faced shadow insurance next step I'm
going to take my lo Cornell um it's the
one quarter sized brush here and I'm
going to dip into this pretty pretty
emerald shade right here right here at
the towards the bottom of the palette
and you know if you don't have this
exact palette you know any green shade
will do this one definitely obviously
had some shimmer to it so I'm just going
to get a little bit on my brush and I'm
going to apply this right on the outer
half of the lid
now once you've got that shade on the
outer part of your lid you want to take
I'm going to use my Smashbox number 15
brush and or any like you know fairly
medium-sized crease brush will do and
use that same colors you just go all
over your crease
so at this point you should be seeing a
lot more color in the crease and we're
going to sort of blend that with a
little bit of a blue look here so for
that i would say grab any like fluffy
sized crease brush that you have for
mine I mean use my Sephora professional
rounded crease brush it's a little bit
bigger and I'm going to dip into this
blue shade that is right beside the
green that we used it's from right here
and just use that and lightly sort of
apply that right on top of this area so
just get a little bit on the brush tap
off any excess that you have and lightly
apply that over the green you'll find
that these shimmery colors work really
well together and so now you've sort of
tone slightly tone down the green shade
just a little bit but it's still blended
and still colorful just to get a little
bit deeper you can see that this this I
things are a little bit deeper right in
the outer corner um I'm going to take
that same blue shade that we use just a
little bit more of that and work that
into the crease as well just the outer
part of the crease just like so just to
give it a little little more depth and
then following that just to kind of just
top off the blues that we've been adding
to this pick any of the light blue
shades in this in this palette and I'm
just going to dust that on really
lightly on the far border of everything
we've done okay and then as a highlight
I'm going to grab one of these pretty
kind of lemony yellow shades this one or
this one really you know I'm just kind
of being general because anything that
you have will do just keep it kind of
pastel colored and I'm going to use that
as my highlight up here it's not really
going to show through as yellow we're
not we're applying a very sheer wash of
that color right up there okay next for
our liner I'm going to be using my ELF
waterproof liquid liner and the
is midnight so that's a nice navy blue
shade I'm only going to apply that to my
top lash line so I'm just going to go
from the inner corner out with that
and we're just going to wing the outer
corner out just a little bit it's not
going to be a real pronounced thing but
we're just going to continue the line
just a little bit past the natural lash
line the lower lash line grab your angle
angle eyeliner brush and I'm going to
use this midnight blue shade it's the
darkest blue in the whole palette and
we're going to just use this on the
outer half of the lower lash line and
just kind of blend it right in with the
tip of that navy blue liquid liner just
like so it's going to be a really soft
look it's not going to detract from all
the pretty color that you've got
elsewhere on your I just going to deepen
it a bit and then I'm going to use a
blue that's right beside that's just
kind of a blue that we already used once
here this shade right there I'm just
kind of a true true blue and youth that
I'm sorry on the inner part you use my
elf eyelash curler then apply your
mascara I'm going to use some it's
Maybelline sky high curves mascara and
just go ahead and apply you know one or
two coats of this all right guys well
that is the look it's incorporating some
subtle greens and blues it's a shimmery
look but I think it's still really
wearable and as for my lips I'm using
NYX or nicks round lipstick and Indian
pink it's a nice soft coral shade on my
lips and then over the top of that i'm
using Revlon's super lustrous lip gloss
in life's a peach so it's kind of a nice
light peachy lip tone that doesn't
detract too much from the I look so I
hope you guys like this look and they
a lot for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
