this video this is going to be a guest
review there's a new face in this video
it's Sarah and she is Tyler's sister and
she and her sister Amy were down for a
visit this weekend we did some fun stuff
and we're sorry Rachel couldn't be here
as well she had to work so shout out to
Rachel but um Sarah is going to talk
about what she says
they life-changing product life altering
Prada
it's definitely altered and um we have
here a Redken heat setting spray and
what it is is you just spray it on your
hair before you curl it with a curling
iron and it holds the curl for literally
days and this hairstyle I have now I
curl my hair pour one out last night and
I just touched a bowl this morning but
it helped the curl extremely well and no
matter what you do walking outside doing
stuff I actually started using it about
two and a half years ago in Thailand we
got married uh because it was humid and
every one of us have our hair down my
hair doesn't curl well and what was she
thinking I know it
prison when it wasn't it's not very
cooperative normally so I went to my
hair stylist and she introduced
community setting spray and said that it
would hold the curl and I wouldn't get
frizzy and it was amazing my hair
actually curled and stayed and I've been
using it ever since I started using buy
a lot of sheets and spray but now I use
the Redken hot sets number twenty-two
and I just like it a little bit better
and kind of just walk people through how
you would put this on your hair and how
you go about either curling it or
straightening or whatever um well I do
my hair in layers like I'll take it up
and put in the clip and do one like
probably one inch section at a time but
what I do is I just take the whole layer
in a spray maybe two to three sprays and
wait a couple seconds then it dries and
then I just go ahead and curl it like a
normal place so you would have like say
if you into the bottom layer of your
hair then you would pull up the top half
and you would only spray this about
three times maybe three and you're able
to get this kind of curl that lasts you
you see it left on this yes and I don't
need any hairspray either wow I am so
good because and the thing is like you
can run your hands through Sarah's hair
it's not crunchy like you know hairspray
might make it sometimes you can see it's
completely you can touch it run your
hands through it and it doesn't it feels
totally soft so that's what yeah I hope
to use when I straighten my hair because
it also protects your hair from the heat
so it's a multi-purpose product and it
looks like this laying you about
thirteen dollars for this day five ounce
container of it but I actually went to
the Walmart salon yesterday and I got a
big bottle probably fifteen ounces or
more for $20 and then I just recall this
little bottle and this little bottle is
lasting over six months I think that is
so awesome and you can find this um most
salons will carry goods you might be
able to search for it online and find it
there but I just this is definitely the
type of thing I'm going to get because
Sarah was telling me that just because
you know I have fine hair and I really
don't want to get like greasy or get
like a buildup of products in my hair
but this really just keeps it I mean it
looks shiny it looks touchable it's
pretty and I the most outstanding thing
about it I think as you guys that that
lasted so long and the weather cut it
down here even though it's wintertime
there is a lot of moisture in here right
now there's kind of some humidity out
there already and it really hasn't
affected it at all so that's awesome
hmm Tyler Damian here and there like a
thoroughly impressed by it so Tyler
gives it two thumbs up he's gonna start
using it to when
girls and ratings and everything you owe
me just when he goes out and maybe for
when he takes the bar so he has that
extra energy and incopy on him in itself
just cause it's the confidence builder
you know your hair looks good you feel
better about yourself I mean at least I
do agree awesome well thank you guys
very much for tuning in for this video
and thank you to Sarah for taking time
out of her day to talk about this
program
yay five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
