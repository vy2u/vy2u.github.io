this video this is going to be a guest
review there's a new face in this video
it's sarah and she is Tyler's sister and
she and her sister Amy were down for a
visit this weekend we did some fun stuff
and we're sorry Rachel couldn't be here
as well she had to work so shout out to
Rachel but um Sarah is going to talk
about what she says they life-changing
product life altering Prada it's
definitely altered um we have here a red
can heat setting spray and what it is is
you just spray it on your hair before
you curl it with a curling iron and it
holds the curl for literally days and
this hairstyle i have now I curl my hair
poor went out last night and i just
touched a bowl this morning but it
helped the curl extremely well and no
matter what you do walking outside doing
stuff i actually started using it about
two and a half years ago and Tyler we
got married because it was humid and
every one of us have her hair down my
hair doesn't curl well and what was she
thinking I know in a prison it wasn't
it's not very cooperative normally so I
went to my hair stylist and she
introduced community setting spray and
said that it would hold the curl and I
wouldn't get frizzy and it was amazing
my hair actually curled and stayed and
I've been using it ever since I started
using by a lot of shoots and spray but
now i use the redken hot sets number 22
and I just like it a little bit better
and kind of just walk people through how
you would put this on your hair and how
you go about either curling it or
straightening of whatever um well I do
my hair in layers like I'll take it up
and put in the clip and do one like
probably one inch section at a time but
what I do is I just take the whole layer
in a spray maybe two to three sprays and
wait a couple seconds then it dries and
then I just go ahead and call it like a
normal voice so you would have liked
safe you into the bottom layer of your
hair then you would pull up the top half
and you would only spray this about
three times maybe three and you're able
to get this kind of curl that lasts you
you see it left on this yes and I don't
know any hairspray either wow I am so
but because anything is like you can run
your hands through stairs here it's not
crunchy like you know hairspray might
make it sometimes you can see it's
completely you can touch it run your
hands through it and it doesn't it feels
totally soft so that's what yeah and I
also use when I straighten my hair
because it also protects your hair from
the heat so it's a multi-purpose side
and it looks like this land you about
thirteen dollars for this day 5 ounce
container of it but I actually went to
the walmart so on yesterday and I got a
big bottle probably 15 ounces or more
for twenty dollars and then I just
recall this little bottle and this
little bottle is lasting over six months
I think that is so awesome and you can
find this most salons will carry goods
you might be able to search for it
online and find it there but I just this
is definitely the type of thing I'm
going to get because Sarah was telling
me that just because you know I have
fine hair and I really don't want it to
get like greasy or get like a buildup of
products in my hair but this really just
keeps it I mean it looks shiny it looks
touchable it's pretty and I the most
outstanding thing about it I think as
you guys that that lasted so long and
the weather kinda down here even though
it's wintertime there is a lot of
moisture in the air right now there's
kind of some humidity out there already
and it really hasn't affected it at all
so that's awesome hmm Tyler name
here and there like a thoroughly
impressed by it so Tyler gives it two
thumbs up he's gonna start using it too
when he had curls and ratings and
everything well me just when he goes out
and maybe for when he takes the bar so
he has that extra energy and kali i'm in
itself just confidence builder need only
your hair looks good you feel better
about yourself i mean at least i do
agree awesome well thank you guys very
much for tuning in for this video and
thank you too Sarah for taking time out
of today to talk about this pelvic yay
