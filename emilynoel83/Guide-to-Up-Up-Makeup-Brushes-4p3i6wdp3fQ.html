for this video this is going to be a
full-on guide to the up and up brushes
that are available at Target up and up
is the store brand you've probably seen
everything from skin care items to
cleaning items in that store with that
brand on them and they actually have
makeup brushes that are store brand as
well I first discovered these brushes
when they were packaged this way all
black on the handles and I have a couple
of eye brushes like this I also have
this kind of foundation brush in that
style and more recently like within the
past year so they've kind of given their
brushes a makeover they've come up with
lots of different styles of brushes and
here and there in my videos I've talked
about really liking certain ones but I
thought it might be most useful and a
lot of you have requested that I just do
a whole video on all the ones that I
have actually for today's makeup
application I used all of these brushes
so I could cut to some demos and you
could really see them working and while
I do love some of these and some of
these are like my favorite brushes in my
whole collection there are others that I
don't really think are necessary so I'll
be pointing that out as well so I'm just
gonna start off with the first logical
one that you might use on your face and
this is called the complexion brush this
was the brush that I did a full video on
on this channel I think I called it
affordable brush rave and this is a
really really great buffing foundation
brush you like those really dense soft
sigmax brushes from Sigma I think those
are great but this is definitely an
affordable option that gives you that
similar look it's super soft it's really
dense all of these brushes in this line
seem to have this kind of two-tone
synthetic bristle going on and I just
think this brush is really ideal for
liquid consistency foundations today I
used it with the cosmetics CC cream and
it's just really nice for buffing that
in I have some brushes in this style
that are just really really tight in the
brush hairs don't have much of a chance
to really spread this really blends
nicely all across the skin but if you
want to make this double up as an under
eye concealer brush it can dab over that
area nicely and just really work to
maintain a lot of the coverage of the
concealer you're using as well this has
been and continues to be one of my top
up and up brushes that I've tried I have
heard
so many people tagging me on Instagram
and on snapchat saying they got this
brush and they love it so it's
definitely gotten rave reviews from a
lot of you all as well now another thing
they have available is a concealer brush
duo and these are kind of more
comparable to the sigmax precision
brushes up and up has this duo available
one of them it's cut at a very slight
angle and the other one has kind of a
dome tip to it the cut on these is not
so crazy harsh or different that I feel
like oh I can only use this one for
certain things and then I have to pick
up this one you know if they're really I
think kind of interchangeable so they're
nice from that standpoint because you
could be using one you get it dirty and
you set that aside to be clean and then
it's like you have an automatic backup
to use but today I just put on some mac
prolongwear concealer and I dabbed it
out with the one that's a little more
flat and I think it just works really
great for that these would be nice for
like spot concealing over a blemish and
just tapping over your concealers are
small enough to get right around you
know the inner corner of your eye area
so I think these are really handy now
the next little task would be setting
the under-eye and that's where this
comes in this is actually the complexion
brush set if this sounds a little bit
familiar I did review this whole set on
the Express channel already if I refer
at any point in this video to a brush
coming from the set this is the set that
I'm talking about in this set there's a
foundation brush that's flat a very
typical concealer brush that's also flat
and these are the two where you know I
know some people like these kinds of
brushes this can even be nice to Pat out
your concealer but the two rock stars of
this collection are this nice full
angled brush which is great for
contouring and this little guy who has
really emerged as a stud of my brush
collection this is great for setting the
under eye area it fits in there it's not
too big not too small but also it's
great for a very spotlighted highlight
application as you will see since I'm
just one person sitting here and I can't
demonstrate every foundation brush Under
the Sun these you will not see demoed
but I thought those are a very classic
style that a lot of you are familiar
with so they're they're nice quality
they're really nice and soft I gotta
admit I'm not reaching for these all the
time
still I do think this group of brushes
is completely worthwhile for these two
for the smaller one as I said you know I
just tap into whatever powder I want to
use I can easily and quickly set the
under-eye area if you just like to have
you know a little bit lighter or
brighter powder on your face to
spotlight different areas this is just
great for that it's like just a
miniature size at the up-and-up blush
brush if you have that if you're
familiar with that this is just the mini
now if you guys hear some noises I've
got somebody plenty nearby so just a
heads up for powder what are we gonna do
with powder there is a powder brush in
this line I picked it up I really didn't
think I needed it and sometimes you know
your opinion changes like you finally
get something home and you start using
it you realize oh my gosh why did I wait
well I don't really feel that way about
this I still don't really think I need
this brush this is a very nice quality
very soft full powder brush but to me it
just feels so big I'm not saying it
can't apply the powder well or maybe
apply some bronzer really nicely or
might even be nice you know as a body
type brush honestly that might be where
how I end up using this for all over the
face I just don't find myself wanting
something quite this large I really
think for face powders I've gotten so
used to using my ELF complexion brush
which if you see those two side-by-side
it's really like about half as full so I
don't know personal preference if you
really like a full super fluffy powder
brush there is one in this line but what
I actually used for my powder today is
this retractable brush this in
comparison size-wise to this one this is
much more my speed
it's really soft it's not crazy dense so
there's just tons of movement with this
brush and I think you'll find you can
make this be a lot of different things
for you if you want this to be your
contour type product just slide up the
little slider hold on right there where
it connects this could easily go in as a
contour this could be blush seriously if
you're on the go a lot you need
something to throw in your purse or
you're just trying to downsize the
amount of things you're taking with you
brush wise as you travel this would be a
great one and it's great for powder I
just used a light dusting of my it
cosmetics powder all over my face I also
use this for my bronzer I used my Too
Faced beach bunny bronzer and this is
just the perfect size you get nice
diffused light
application but you still have some
control and if you watch my happy little
makeup things video the satisfaction of
the retractable brush contouring we're
going back to one of the blushes from
the set and this is this really great
full angled brush I'm primarily using
this for contouring I think it's great
but just a little secret if you wanted
to use this as like a foundation type
buffing brush and you prefer more of an
angle as opposed to this kind of style
in the complexion brush you might like
it for that too it's worth a try I mean
these are nice against synthetic
bristles work great for liquids and
creams but I use this as a contour for
this video with my ELF contouring kit
it's just the perfect size to fit right
in there you know right in the hollow of
the cheek I kind of like to apply the
product and then buff in circular
motions it's so dense it's so soft
it just feels heavenly on the face I am
proud to say that my absolute favorite
blush brush in my entire collection is
from the up and up line it looks like
this it's like I said the mama and the
baby version here of that little under
eyes / highlight brighter the exact same
cut and style one's just bigger than the
other and this is just ideal for powder
blushes it's really nice taper not too
big not too small I used it with my
frat-boy blush today and just it's a
perfect application of powder blush
every time it's really nicely tapered a
long way down the side so when you're
tapping into your blush you know you're
usually using somewhat of the side of a
brush you're not always just going boom
like straight down in you're kind of
going in like this and so it just sweeps
on really nicely from the set this is
the brush we also used his under eye
setting powder I find this is really
nice if you want that nice concentrated
highlighted look on the cheeks
some people might go for a very soft and
diffused highlight in which case you
might use the blush brush for that but
if you really want the highlight to
stand out this brush is really good for
that and today I used my Becca champagne
pop by Jaclyn hill highlight and with
this I kind of been back and forth on
this product because I thought I didn't
love the application I got when I used
like my Sigma F 35 but I'm really liking
it when
a smaller brush like this so just dab it
right over the tops of the cheekbones
this can easily go down the nose with
highlight as well it's just a really
nice controlled size it's just funny how
different brushes work well with
different products and overtime you
uncover different little combinations
and that highlight is so interesting
because i thought when i swatched it i
thought oh that's really intense and
then I thought I was using brushes that
were a little bit larger with it
and it was lacking a little something on
my cheeks I think a smaller brush with
that product like this is definitely the
answer so that's pretty much gonna do it
for face brushes and I do have an eye
brush duo from up and up this contains
two really similar brushes one just has
a little bit longer bristles that have a
little more give and a little more
movement to them and one is more of a
flat type brush the kind you might use
for packing on product or smudging up
and up does have an eye brush set and
they don't have like the same type of
brush hairs as these they're more like
traditional brownish looking brushes and
it really didn't appeal to me at all I
knew I really wasn't gonna like it
because they seem pretty oversized to me
I just don't like using massive brushes
for my eyes and if that means using
these smaller ones have been pulling in
one of my own blending brushes that's
fine by me but what I did for today's
look I actually worked in one of my
caviar sticks from Laura Mercier the
lovely Kristen game gave me this one in
amethyst and it's just beautiful on the
lids it instantly makes my eyes look
greener then I use the larger of these
two brushes to sort of blend that out
these are great with cream shadow type
products and I can kind of push it up
into the crease a little bit more I also
use the slightly larger brush with the
warm Brown from my Becca ombre Rouge
palette and kind of blended that up into
the crease and just above and it's
really nice for controlled application
like that and then like I said I do
bring in my own blending brush to get
more of a buffed out edge apply my
highlight and I brought in this smaller
brush with one of my color pop shades
this is from Danny's collection it's a
shade called hope kind of an iridescent
pink and I use that for a little bit of
a pop on the lids just to show you I
mean this brush works really well with
color pop eyeshadows
an interesting different texture and
fingers could work fine but some people
prefer to use brushes so these would
work well with those and then I smudged
a little bit of that deep plum II brown
shade from the Becca palette on the
under eye with the smaller of the two
brushes finished off the look with my
brows my mascara my lip product which is
the Too Faced melt melted metal in
melted metallic jelly there are a couple
of other things I just want to note here
one thing I've talked about a lot is
this round foundation brush it's called
around because instead of being pinched
up here at the top the ferrule is
totally round and I have talked about
using this a lot as a nice little
concealer tap in product well now I
can't find this any more on targets
website I'm glad I checked before doing
this video it may be one of those things
where you can still find it in stores
but it's just not on the website any
longer maybe they're phasing it out
which I don't think is a good idea but
who knows again I have this in the old
style of packaging is now packaged like
this so if you do happen to find it in
the store it will have this kind of a
handle on it also I had gotten this cute
little up-and-up travel brush set look
at the handles on these is this not
totally adorable I mean I think those
are so cute there's this small like mini
blush brush size which can work for
blush there's a little angled brush that
you could maybe used for eyeliner or
even brow product perhaps and then
there's this little kind of fluffy kind
of reminds me of my Sigma e25 type brush
but maybe not quite as full that you
could use for shadow all over the lid or
maybe into the crease it's really a nice
little set i've tried plenty of like
mini brush sets and they're just way too
small to use you know i like the even
the face brush is definitely something
where okay I could see myself applying
blush with that or highlight I know cuz
I have if you need some teeny tiny
on-the-go brushes these are out there
these are the same nice quality and feel
as the other ones just a little bit
smaller here's the hard part where I get
to the end and I have to say okay what
are the total must-haves if I had to
pick like two must-haves from this whole
up-and-up brush line like most valuable
brushes it would probably have to be the
complexion brush
and the blush brush I just think these
are really great at what they do
this can kind of double as a little bit
of a concealer brush which is nice
this could double as your highlight
brush if you wanted it to it could
easily contour as well it's just a great
size it's such a solid blush brush so
those two are really really awesome and
you've got my impressions on these other
brushes really all throughout the video
as I've been talking but a close second
or third I guess to these two would be
this complexion brush set I really think
even though I don't find myself using
these flat ones all that much but I know
some people might love that kind of
style I really adore the angled brush
and now this smaller like highlight type
brush I wish they just sold them
individually or maybe these two would be
a nice little duo on their own not that
anybody from targets listening but I
just I really like these two and I do
think they're worth the cost of the
whole set so guys that's my review on
what I believe is almost the entire
up-and-up brush collection just all of
the brushes in this kind of two-tone
style of brush hair that's offered at
Target just a classic hidden gem type
product you know I have nothing to do
with Target or up and uh there's no
collaboration happening here this is
just one of those great situations where
you stumble across something awesome in
the drugstore you keep trying it and
buying it and Here I am just telling you
my thoughts on it so thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch thanks for
requesting this video and I'll see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
