joining me I am feeling a little under
the weather today I've got a toddler who
has come down with a little something
and I very quickly snatched that up and
got it myself woke up with the sore
throat the congestion and I'm just
thinking okay here it comes let's just
deal with it but nonetheless still very
excited to bring you this video talking
about some new stuff from hard candy and
hard candy is one of those makeup lines
it's like they've had their share of
both hits and misses over the years that
I've been using their products but I've
had like just enough really good
successes with this line that anytime
new things come out I really want to
make sure I keep trying them it's kind
of like elf for me but hard candy is
sold exclusively at Walmart you can get
it in store or online and they've come
out with some really intriguing new
things this time around so I've got a
couple face items and some lip products
as well first face thing that I got is a
little bit more skin care oriented it's
the sheer envy instant eye fix under eye
treatment and this is one of those
products that has like the little metal
tip at the bottom that's supposed to be
really cooling and it gives you this
product that sort of Prime's the eyes
moisturizes hydrates I'm not so sure
this is doing anything for me well
enough to constitute repurchasing or
using this over the long haul it says
five times treatment power D puffs
brightens smoothes Prime's moisturizes
luxury metal applicator and the color
that comes out of it is actually kind of
peachy tone which really excited me at
first but it's not a coverage product
really it's just kind of like a tinted
moisturizer for the under eye area and
it does feel good you know it does have
that soothing kind of cooling feel but I
wouldn't say it maybe goes as far as the
like Garnier eye roller that feels I
think even more cooling and actually has
some more coverage to it or more
recently I've tried the flower Beauty a
roller thing
and that is extreme coverage like that's
a legit concealer packed into a cooling
rollerball not everybody may be looking
to really have heavy-duty concealer out
of this kind of a product but I'm just
letting you know what to expect because
I didn't feel like this really covered
anything it felt kind of nice but it
didn't even really cool as much as those
other couple products I mentioned so in
my opinion definitely not like a star
product from hard candies line another
thing that I know many of you have asked
me about already and I was so jealous
when I was seeing many of you like
tweeting me pictures look what I found
at Walmart and it took me I think a good
several weeks after I first started
seeing your pictures of this to see it
in my store but eventually they got it
it's the glamoflage mix in pigment
makeup drops and why is this so exciting
well I have the cover FX custom cover
drops and I absolutely love these things
this is so much liquefied coverage
concentrated coverage in this little
dropper and I have this in the shade and
35 and I've talked about this before how
you can just add well as many drops as
you want really to any kind of product
it could be a moisturizer you could
create your own like tinted moisturizer
with coverage you can amp up the
coverage that certain foundations might
have you can also alter the color
because these come in a wide range of
colors and so when hard candy has
something similar to that I am all over
it really wanting to try it really
hoping that it can measure up coverage
wise and so mixin pigment drops I got
the shade light 3 I went for something
that I thought would pretty much match
my skin tone or matching pretty easily
with most of my foundations I wasn't
really looking for a lightning or a
darkening color something I noticed
right off the bat well I feel like the
cover FX custom cover drops are thin
these are pretty much just as thin as
water so even more thinness to the
consistency I'm going to do a little
something for you here on my hand I'm
going to apply one drop of my cover FX
custom cover drops here and I'm going to
just kind of blend that out over the
skin and give you just a little feel if
you're not familiar with this product
what
does coverage wise like I've got a mole
right here on my hand you can't see it
at all it is just like a matte formula
type of product and it just completely
covers hard candy again I've shaken both
of these up before I've done this I'm
going to do heck I'm going to give that
two drops I feel like a little more came
out of that one drop of the cover FX and
as you can see I've got slightly
different tones of product here overall
the hard candy if you can kind of ignore
the difference in tone and not let that
bother you too much it's much much
thinner and consistency and it's lighter
coverage not saying it doesn't add
coverage to foundations I've mixed it
with but it's not that kind of
miracle-working product that the cover
FX is I mean the cover FX I feel can
take anything and turn it absolutely
full coverage like up to the standard of
the Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
cover it'll take you all the way there
you know and this stuff it's not going
to go that far it's going to look I
think probably even more natural as you
blend it in with things but it doesn't
add as much coverage and what I wanted
to show you in this video is I took a
very middle-of-the-road coverage wise
foundation in my L'Oreal True Match just
the regular kind this is in the shade
true beige and v and I thought okay
here's a light light to medium coverage
foundation I will mix two drops of each
in with it and show you each side of my
face I used equal amounts of foundation
on both sides so just kind of the amount
that I could get tipping the jar over
once and then the two drops of the mixer
I did the cover FX side first and I feel
like it's adding a lot of extra coverage
to this product a lot more than what I'm
accustomed to seeing out of just regular
L'Oreal True Match on its own and then I
did the hard candy stuff on the other
side and again there's a slight shade
difference here because I didn't get
exactly the same colors I feel like two
drops of that added some coverage to the
Loreal foundation but it didn't quite do
as much and sometimes it's even hard to
show that like on camera but I feel like
even just the texture of the product
moving across the skin the heart
candy is so so thin and the coverfx
while it's thin and concentrated like
you know in the scope of liquid makeup I
feel like the cover FX is thin but it's
like it's just got enough creaminess to
pack in a little more pigmented coverage
now this is not my first rodeo trying
the hard candy mixin drops because I
would say I've used them three times
already this would be my fourth time
I've used them already with this L'Oreal
True Match and just various foundations
that I thought could use a little extra
coverage and that's exactly what it does
it adds a little extra coverage this can
take you to a very very full coverage
place not everybody may need that
another consideration for these might be
a shade adjustment maybe you just want
something really really thin and
lightweight that you can add to a
foundation formula that you already
really like that can just alter the
shade a little bit you could get a
lighter shade a deeper shade my store
selection already seemed a little bit
picked over when I was buying mine but I
know they had one or two richer colors
it's not as good of a selection as the
lighter shade so that's something to
keep in mind also cover FX has a really
broad shade range I think the bottom
line is we don't have a dupe here we've
got a decent product a product that
could be workable for some people but
just don't set your coverage
expectations as high as you do with the
cover FX drops next thing is a lip
treatment type product it's the instant
lip fix lip treatment duo and it has a
scrub on one end and the treatment on
the other the scrub is like a scrubby
stick kind of makes me think of the elf
lips exfoliating lip scrub sticks you
know this one though not not up to par
in my opinion now the first couple of
times you use it don't expect to feel
hardly any scrubby's at all it's like
you've got to work down some of the balm
to really get into anything that you're
going to feel exfoliating your lips so
now that we've gotten past that point
using it in this video you can see me
rubbing it on the lips a lot of this
oddly opaque white creamy pink ball my
kind of goes all over the lips and I
feel like I'm getting more balminess and
not quite enough exfoliation even though
now I feel like I
have really worked in to a rougher
surface on this product it's like the
elf bombs are just a little more sturdy
when you run them across your lips you
really feel the resistance and you don't
have a lot of excess mess when you're
done here it's like it just it's gooping
out a lot but once you're done with that
you wipe off whatever excess has
developed on your lips and you've got
this treatment side which is actually
kind of like a gloss format it reminds
me a little bit of those Milani lip oil
products but this is a little bit
stickier the scent is nice it's a little
bit like fruity with a hint of Rose it
says it has rose hip oil mango butter it
is pretty thick my best advice would be
go for the elf lip scrubs the
exfoliating sticks and apply on top you
know any kind of treatment product that
you like to use any kind of balm or you
know even those Milani oils I feel like
I like those because they are that kind
of gel oil hybrid but they didn't feel
too sticky this feels pretty heavy and
sticky on the lips let's keep rolling
with the lip product shall we we've got
some blooming lip oils and I got them in
both shades that were available and what
we've got here are kind of gloss again
it's that hybrid gloss and oil merged
into one although I find the formula of
these to not be quite as heavy and
sticky as the treatment side of that
stick I just mentioned but they have two
shades one is called Zen strawberry
that's the pinky color and then they've
also got calming peach I have the same
kind of scent same claims on the
packaging it says infused with over 10
essential oils instantly hydrates and
restores dry and chapped lips wet shine
gloss finish and the pink one it says
transforms from clear to a unique pink
tint lip color and then this one goes to
a coral lip color these might be my
biggest win of the hard candy haul I
feel like the consistency of these
products is so so much like those Milani
lip oil set you are getting that
staining tint even though this one is
named like strawberry and this one's the
peach don't expect strawberry or peachy
flavors or cents to come out of these to
me they both kind of
I'll faintly like herbal tea it's not
objectionable
I really don't notice it outside of just
the application and then boom I don't
smell it so much anymore but just so you
know and I'll show you the pink one
going on first and it does truly start
clear and then you can see the color
developing on your lips it goes kind of
through phases you feel like oh it's
like kind of softly rosy and then you've
got a pretty good pink going there now I
have seen stains that kind of default to
this absolutely super super bright crazy
pink and I don't feel like this goes
there it's just kind of a pleasant
looking pink a fresh pink on your lips I
think as for the calming peach again
this starts out clear you put it on your
lips and you can slowly see the color
developing overall colors are pretty
close on these don't expect to get like
that much color difference between the
two because it just doesn't go that far
the coral that this color turns is a
very pinky coral it might be the
slightest bit warmer than the other
shade and you might say well you're
applying one right after the other maybe
you've got remnants on of the other but
I have used these totally separate days
and the shades are not that far off from
one another I find that these feel quite
hydrating on the lips the staying power
is really pretty good
I wouldn't put one of these on the
morning the other day I noticed that I
still had a full color stain even after
lunchtime and if I wanted to you know
add the gloss back on I could but I
definitely had some color hanging around
that slowly started to fade after that
lunchtime point in the day so I really
do enjoy these if you've tried the
Milani lip treatment oil things and you
like that consistency and you like what
they did for your lips these are doing
and feeling in a similar way you just
got that staining aspect to them last
things that I saw that were new products
from hard candy are these metallic
mousse matte metallic lip colors matte
metallic that combo just doesn't sound
really appealing to me I'm going to tell
you right off the bat when hard candy
first released liquid lip colors I tried
those and I had some decent luck with
those they seemed rather
and really really pigmented on the lips
so here they've released it in the same
kind of format these little tins that do
have a mirror and then your product
inside it's one of those things where
it's not absolutely necessary but the
first time I purchased anything like
this from hard candies line
I remember the tin was the reason why it
caught my eye and made me linger there
and think about the product a little bit
more you know so maybe they are onto
something I got two colours of this as
this soft kind of dusty rose called
truffle and then I also got Queen of
Hearts which I've been wearing
throughout the video these feel
extremely dry at the onset like when I
first start applying them I'm like okay
yeah it's just moving across the lips
they don't have a really liquefied feel
when they start and an odd thing about
this truffle color and I feel like the
applicator is like bold on two sides
it's got like a little bit of furriness
you know on the outer edges and then the
other side seem to be just free from any
kind of fuzzies and it's even sort of
sparse on the sides and it did kind of
feel like a lot of work to spread this
around on the lips and you pear you know
this odd applicator with a pretty dry
formula lip product right out of the
gate it's a little tricky to get all on
there but the end result with that color
is like this sort of semi greyish dusty
rose mom some people might really enjoy
that tone but it's just a very drying
feel immediately then with Queen of
Hearts the applicator there seem to be
more normal like it was kind of
surrounded all the way around with some
sort of like fuzzy doe foot applicator
not that you know you got to have them
real fuzzy but it just seemed like
something was defective on the other but
again very dry feeling on contact and
then you have that added sort of dry
down as you wear it now it's not
completely transfer resistant as you can
see I can pull some off
so thank you guys so much for requesting
this video and asking me to check out
some of these new products probably the
most asked about thing you know those
pigment drops not like a total fail but
I just I would very much hesitate to
call them a dupe for the cover FX
because they just don't do exactly what
that stuff does my personal favorite
thing that I came out with I think are
these blooming lip oils just because
they feel good on the lips they do have
that treatment kind of feel they don't
feel like they're going to slide and
slip right outside my lip line so
there's enough thickness but it's not
too heavy and I kind of do like that
stain also gotten a lot of questions
about the holiday sets and all that
stuff that's coming out now I have been
trying a lot of that type of things so
expect to see a lot of reviews on this
channel in the coming days and weeks so
I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
