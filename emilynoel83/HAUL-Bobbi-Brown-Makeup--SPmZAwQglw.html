is going to be a Bobby Brown makeup haul
um do you ever get like this unusual
urge to just find out more about a
particular makeup brand because that's
kind of what went down here for me when
it comes to Bobby Brown makeup I have
used actually going back quite a while
like towards the beginning of my channel
I remember trying Bobby Brown's
corrector way back then and her creamy
concealer and the foundation stick and
then I really like stopped there and
even though I like those products for
whatever reason I just didn't explore
much more into the line and I think
sometimes with brands that you're not
super familiar with it can feel kind of
overwhelming like you're not really sure
where to begin or you know I'd want to
try all the eyeshadows where would I
even start and for quite a while now
I've really been wanting to try a Bobby
Brown shimmer brick so I just decided
hey now's the time it's going to happen
so I have some face products some eye
products and some lip products to talk
to you about today it's not purely just
a whole like here's what I got type
video because I have been playing around
with these things for a few days so
first thing I'll mention I feel like
I've been a little bit out of the powder
foundation game for a while like I've
tried a lot of interesting drugstore
powder foundations a couple maybe here
and there that I've liked from high-end
brands like it cosmetics but overall I
haven't done a lot of experimentation
and I know that when I think about the
Emily Awards and that's when I always
kind of review okay what if I tried
what's been the best and I just haven't
really put myself out there to try
enough I don't think so
I got a bobbi brown powder foundation
this is called the skin weightless
powder foundation please excuse all of
the finger brands that have developed
over all these products already but this
weightless powder foundation I got it in
the shade beige 3 and you got your
mirror in there there's your powder and
a sponge the powder definitely is a good
color tone for my skin it feels soft but
not maybe quite as like buttery creamy
as I was expecting but that's okay it
doesn't mean it's not going to do a good
job and today you know I have on a
liquid foundation and I use
some of this over the top so I feel like
I'm getting a nicely sort of modified
look I've got a little glow in certain
areas where I wanted it and I used other
products to do that I used this the
other day also kind of like a setting
powder and I did feel like my makeup
looked really fresh and had good staying
power even like late into the day so
from that perspective I liked it I
haven't used it yet solely as powder
foundation that's the thing that I'm
always like a little hesitant to do for
whatever reason but I'm gonna try it
that way and definitely see if it's got
decent enough coverage when it's worn
just by itself or just on top of
concealer in a few places where you want
to wear it I'm definitely going to use
it that way too now I got a couple of
the pot Rouge for lip and cheeks you
guys know I love a good multitasker so
the fact that these products can be worn
on your lips and your cheeks that
appeals to me but also a little
backstory here you ever start browsing
the internet and you wind up looking at
something after a period of time and
you're like how did I get here it was
kind of that way for me when I wound up
watching Marie Osmond live makeup
application on Facebook I'm like oh wow
you know this is interesting I'm really
fascinated when performers people who
are you know really heavily in the
public eye celebrities do their own
makeup that is super fascinating to me
like maybe that's part of my infatuation
well I know it is part of my infatuation
with Carrie Underwood is the fact that
she said when she's on tour she does her
own makeup and I really respect and love
that anyway Marie Osmond was sitting
there doing her makeup before a show I
guess and I was really impressed with
how she was just like kind of slapping
stuff on using her fingers most of the
time and stuff was looking fabulous and
a couple of the things she used were
these particulars shades of the pot
Rouge and she was using them as blushes
and so it's milk chocolate and fresh
melon where the shades that I got so
happy with this probably never would
have thought to try this had I not seen
it in action on someone first so this is
a creamy product there's no shimmer in
it and yeah it can work just like a
cream blush you can dab it on your lips
for a little color there but this Shea
it has a lot of brown in it and a little
bit of some dusty rose what it really
reminds me of I think a very accurate
description is this is like benefits
Dallas boxed powder but in a cream form
because it has that little you know
dusty plum dusty rose thing happening
it's not like a pure strong brown but
it's got a lot of neutral happening so I
actually um the other day I did use it
with my fingers and it was okay that way
but this isn't necessarily like the
silkiest products um really dry down
quickly on the skin this is a really a
cream with some moisture in it so I
prefer pulling out my elf small stipple
brush because I can really control the
application and I just went kind of
right in this zone right down in here is
where I applied it just sort of above
where I might do a contour and I really
liked it I think you could definitely
lay this product on heavy enough to
where you would feel a little bit of
stickiness on the skin but if you're
using a brush like this it keeps the
application like super light so I really
enjoyed that shade I think I'm going to
get tons of use out of it because it's
very versatile very buildable and I love
the color of the true benefit Dallas I
do a little comparison to the regular
Dallas and the cheekathon palette in my
last video that I put up and this
definitely reminds me of original Dallas
but in a cream then the other shade that
I got is fresh melon and this is more of
like the little fresh pop on the apple
of the cheek this shade is rather light
I'll swatch it here next to the milk
chocolate shade you can see how light
I'm talking about there I haven't tried
these on the lips yet they actually
might be really pretty like blended on
the lips but the fresh melon while I
think it's really pretty it's a little
less remarkable to me than the milk
chocolate shade I still think I'll use
it but I do believe I have quite a few
things already in my collection that are
this peachy tone in a cream format you
know I've kind of got that covered happy
I tried it but extra happy with the
other shade now let's talk about the
shimmer brick that I got well I felt
like I wanted a shimmer brick for a long
time I really have not honed in on a
particular one it's like I just want to
feel the formula try it
I don't really care what shade they all
look really pretty to me and I do have
several of the Physicians Formula
shimmer strips but those all come in
kind of a golden bronzy they're meant to
be like bronzers basically so I feel
like I've got that bronzy color family
covered in this type of product so I
wanted to go with something that was
more like the shade of a blush so I got
nectar
isn't it beautiful it's so so pretty
these gorgeous tones that you can mix
together you could definitely focus in
on maybe just one part of it I think if
you get your brush more towards the top
of the compact you end up with a lighter
shade simply because there's this kind
of whitish iridescent peach strip
happening up in there and then you get
more of like that solid blush tone down
in the bottom but I really really like
this I think it's beautiful and if you
mix them all together it's like the
lightest peach but very glowy look
definitely blush and highlight rolled
into one is what this product makes me
think of and I am wearing this kind of
right on top of where I did the fresh
melon shade on my cheeks I took it up in
here a bit and the glow is just
beautiful I feel like whenever I've worn
this I felt so just fresh as a daisy you
know like it's so beautiful and glowy
but with just the right amount of color
mixed in I know they had a pink and the
bronze and I'm not sure what all other
colors let me know let's start the
discussion what ones of these you have
what do you love but I am really really
impressed with the peachy glow of nectar
looking at my box here I also got this
full-size hydrating eye cream but this
was just a bonus this was just thrown in
I ordered off of Bobbi Brown cosmetics
calm I don't know if there was a
promotion going on and I missed it but I
was really surprised to open my box and
find a full-size hydrating eye cream so
I am wearing that today says enriched
mineral water and aloe vera so I put it
on today under my makeup it's really
nice was not expecting that but thank
you so with I products I was really a
little bit overwhelmed but as I was
looking at all the different eyeshadows
because at least when you're shopping on
the Bobbi Brown cosmetics website
they've got them kind of divided up like
the mattes are in one section
and then all of the shimmer finishes are
in another the metallic finishes and I
actually kind of appreciate that because
there's no question as to what the
shadow finish is going to be you know
you know what you're getting and first
and foremost I landed on a shade and
this was kind of by chance I didn't
really know that it would be perfect for
this but I believe I have the perfect
shadow for a one shadow look and I hold
it up fair enough like like it what is
that kind of medium brown color this is
the metallic eye shadow in burnt sugar
first off I think metallic that word
could be used a little bit loosely with
some of these shadows because it does
have Sheen and shimmer but it's
definitely not like the nearly wet look
that some really metallic eyeshadows
have you know so I I wouldn't
necessarily see this as a pure metallic
shadow but what it is is kind of like a
mix of taupe and brown and a little bit
of some golden sheen in there and I
think it's absolutely dynamite as a one
shadow look so I had to try the one
shadow look today I worked in a few of
the other shadows yesterday really like
that look pop up a picture later on as
we go and show you how those look but I
just had to see you know exactly what
this was capable of when used purely on
its own so I've got this shade padded
all over the lid I blended it up into
the crease and I love the intensity I
really love the intensity of all of the
shades that I have they really are super
pigmented and I feel like I'm getting a
lot of product but I patted it all over
the lid with like a Sonia Kashuk medium
shadow brush into the crease with a
sigma e25 and i love what's happening as
the shade sheers out you see that kind
of golden e bronze and then I did a
pencil brush just all down in here on
the lower lash line absolutely love it
like this is such an easy shadow to work
with it could be your everyday just
quick and easy look it could be kind of
a special nighttime type look too so I
love burnt sugar that's definitely like
the star standout I think of what I have
at least so far in my first few days of
using them now also in the metallic
formula I got Kanye and I was wearing
this one a little bit yesterday
kind of smudged into the crease it goes
a little bit darker than burnt sugar
it's kind of interesting how these are
called metallic and I don't think
they're that shiny and that's fine by me
I think they're more versatile not being
quite so shimmery but it's just funny
that they're called metallic and I feel
like this shade is just so gorgeous
because it's got a little bit of red in
it a little bit of Burgundy but also a
lot of just dark brown okay there's the
burnt sugar there's the con yak next to
it you can see a little bit of shine but
not too much I thought that looked
really pretty as a crease color and this
could maybe be an interesting one shadow
look as well I'll have to try that
because it's just not too terribly dark
but just enough darkness to really give
I think a potentially dramatic look I
feel like I'm talking about these in
order of my preference of the eyeshadows
that I got I got one of the mattes and
this is in the shade called black plum I
did a little bit of like eyeliner
smudging with this but haven't worn it
so much as an all-out eyeshadow yet yeah
who doesn't love a nice dark plum and as
I put my finger in this it feels to me a
lot like my Weiser matte shades you know
there's a little dryness to it but yet
you swatch it out and it's extremely
pigmented so I've got that one right
down here it's very dark I will say it's
kind of hard to pick up on a lot of the
plumbing us in that color I feel like
once I put this into an eye look it
could pass for dark brown it could pass
for almost black or charcoal you know
it's just one of those really deep dark
shades now the last shade that I got
this was the one that I actually thought
was going to be a pretty one shadow look
and it still might but I think it's
maybe going to be a little light for
that it was in the shimmer wash category
and it's the shade called rose gold and
it's a very light pinky rose gold you
know how some tend to go a little bit
more toward peach or kind of a more of a
brassy look this to me comes off more
just like light shimmery pink and it's
pretty and I do think I'll get use out
of it and isn't that a pretty light for
some lineup of shades right there I
don't think that's my favorite thing
that I own that's classified as rose
gold like I'm thinking of all the pretty
shadows in the lorac unzipped
palate you know that have that pretty
like little bit of bronze a little bit
of gold a little bit of pink in it this
one it feels nice it feels like a really
good formula but that particular shade
just isn't Wow me the two shades that
are really impressing me are the burnt
sugar and the con yak and I am going to
try that one it's a one shadow look too
but part of what I like about these
shadows is you start like kind of
smudging away the swatches look how
nicely they stay especially the dark
color like that really adheres to the
skin somehow so I'm really impressed
with that last couple things I wanted to
try and some lip products and I wound up
with two shades that I think are pretty
close to one another like it's kind of a
fine line between them I didn't plan it
that way that's just the way it worked
out and I got one of her regular lip
color so classic Bobby Brown lipsticks
and this is in the shade pink mauve and
that's what I've been wearing throughout
the video deep dusty berry type color I
definitely like it I don't know that I
find the formula of this lipstick to be
that like wow it's so different from
anything else I've used it just feels
like a very classic lipstick it's creamy
with no shimmer I'll definitely use it
but I'm not like doing cartwheels over
it the other shade that I got is one of
the creamy lip colors so you can see the
packaging is different here it doesn't
have that gold band around it and when
you open it up instead of being like a
formed pointed tip bullet it's more of a
rounded like kind of like a Revlon lip
butter type style this shade Italian
rose is kind of close to what I have on
except it's a little lighter and a
little bit warmer but the formula I
think is outstanding I love the way this
feels
little bit of thickness very rich on the
lips so it's so so comfortable it just
makes you want to smush your lips
together press them together and just go
oh it feels so good and you can do that
and it doesn't smush the color off of
your lips you know it actually still
stays looking good well I'm going to
take off what I've got on there
currently and put this other shade on
for you it's just so creamy good amount
of shine it just feels mmm tremendous as
you rub your lips together like it's a
really luxurious feeling lipstick
this is of course the kind of shade that
you could rock anytime anywhere if I
really would have realized how close the
tulip color shades were that I got I
probably would have gotten a different
color in the regular lipstick but I'm
really happy with this Italian rose
shade in the creamy lipstick so yeah
overall I think a really successful
Bobby Brown haul and I'm kind of looking
around to see what are the things that I
like best I would say the biggest hits
for me would be the shimmer brick I was
not let down by the beauty of the
shimmer brick really I'm excited about
the milk chocolate lip and cheek pop
Rouge very impressed with the eye shadow
formulas as a whole but most happy with
burnt sugar and cognac is a close second
and the creamy lip color is a definite
winner as well everything else you know
I certainly like it but I just don't
know that it's really maybe had a chance
to stand out to me a whole lot just yet
the powder foundation I think remains to
be seen how that's going to work as an
actual powder foundation so we'll keep
trying but thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this was fun for you
please let me know what kinds of things
you've tried and enjoyed from this line
or if there's any other makeup brands
that you feel like I haven't really dug
into enough that you'd like to see me um
use more products from I'd be happy to
hear so thank you for watching and I'll
see you soon
