for my first video on this channel in my
new makeup room I'm so excited to be
here I have done a couple of videos
already in here on my beauty broadcast
Express channel my review channel so you
can check those out as well it's
definitely still a bit of a work in
progress I got a couple of things that I
want to add in here before I do my room
tour and my makeup collection video but
this is just super exciting for me I'm
loving the new storage I've got in here
and just the paint color and studs
mentioned this in another video that I
did but I've got the room set up so I
can shoot videos in several different
locations so it's not gonna always
necessarily look the same every video
you see here i'll be messing with my
lighting too of course but for now this
is a haul a drugstore haul from Walmart
and Ulta and so I just wanted to show
you some of these new things that I'm
testing out a lot of great candidates
for reviews including a couple of things
that I have reviewed recently but I want
to start off with something that I saw
in Revlon's line this was just right in
at Walmart with the regular display and
they're these quads and I thought wow
those are bright colors for the
drugstore you know like I don't run into
a lot of drugstore quads that have that
kind of color intensity so I really
wanted to try them out I am wearing one
of these today I'm wearing exotic that's
the one with the purple and the gold it
reminds me actually my like junior high
days because those were our school
colors purple and gold purple and gold
that was the cheer got like a matte
purple a matte yellow like a really true
bright yellow and then this kind of
golden shimmer and a black shade that's
maybe like I'm almost a matte or maybe a
satin finish and I'm wearing this quad
today and I must say I'm unpleasantly
surprised with the amount of intensity
particularly of the yellow I was like
wow that really is packing on it's
looking bright with the purple I feel
like I was really having to build up the
color a lot not quite as vivid as I
would have expected
and then I've got some of this black as
well as the purple smudged down on my
lower lash line but the shade that I
thought really would have been a total
home run or an easy shade to get right I
thought might have been this golden a
shimmery shade right there and this I
mean it swatches and you can kind of see
some of the flakiness but when I was
applying it on my lids with a brush I
thought it was super flaky and just
wasn't hanging together a little hit and
miss but still kind of exciting to see a
quad with some really bright shades this
may have been around for a long time and
I just missed another one that I got
here is called Wilder I wore this one
over the weekend this has a matte like
deep teal a matte coral also got a
shimmery white and a shimmery like
really light gold knee shade same deal
these top two shades were the
disappointing ones I mean I could get
quite a bit of intensity out of the
matte brighter ones and I would have
thought you know how hard is it to get
you know a pigmented shimmery why so
same with the other one they're a little
hard to control but really excited about
these kinds of shit I'll have to maybe
do individual reviews on these or that's
what I'm thinking I'll do with some of
my different drugstore quads because
they vary so much it's really hard to
just review one line of drugstore
eyeshadow quads because I feel
differently about so many of them so I
may just go individually do a little
tutorial along the way and so keep an
eye out for that on my Beauty broadcast
Xpress channel a review that I do have
over there right now is on these L'Oreal
polishes these are the gold dust
collection and I have pop the bubbles
which is this really pretty blue makes
me think of like sparkling glistening
water and then I have the statement
piece which is what's on my nails now a
really like soft gold not not super
brassy type color kind of like a golden
e champagne shade and these are textured
so that was kind of one of my complaints
in the video was that I don't love to
feel the texture but it can be corrected
so check out my video there for more
details but loved the effect that I got
out of these with one coat that really
impressed me so at Walmart I picked up
three of these new covergirl
colorlicious lip glosses
kind of a sheer lipgloss sort of thin
texture not the thinnest I've ever tried
but I mean they can slip around a little
bit on your lips like after eating I
noticed that quite a bit don't come off
exactly like how they look in the tube
they don't come off the exact same on
your lips so just something to be aware
if I do have a full review on these as
well but the shades I got were the
shimmering one called honey kiss and I
thought of that as something similar to
Revlon spoiled lip gloss Super Lustrous
gloss that's no longer around and it is
kind of similar to that not quite as
opaque but similar color tone and then I
got give me guava this is this peachy
shade with golden shimmer and I also got
plum alicia's for the radiant orchid and
this does not come off quite as bright
on my lips but it's still it's a pretty
shit but like I said I feel like I do
need to be kind of careful with these
excuse me
careful with keeping an eye on them and
making sure they're not like running
outside my lip line now Ulta I found
some new brushes that I wanted to try
and review one of them is from Ecotools
love the little eco tools packaging that
comes with the pouches like in case you
don't have brush storage and you just
want to travel with one or two they slip
down into these pouches really nicely
when I picked up was the airbrush
concealer brush and so this is one of
those full concealer brushes it is not
pinched in at the top of the ferrule at
all so a little more full you know it's
more of a buffing concealer brush as
opposed to those classic flat concealer
brushes and I did use this for my
concealer today and it did a decent job
if it's something you want to really
work in circular motions this still
seems a little small to me the thing
that I'll probably end up comparing it
to in my review is the elf flawless
concealer brush which is a little more
full not quite as like pointa either one
of these would be workable with
different formats of concealer like a
powdery concealer such as bare minerals
bisque or like I used today with a
liquidy concealer use this with my Estee
Lauder I said did a good job of going to
get in enough but maybe not the best
blending can
or tight brush but you know I'll keep
messing with it because sometimes you
just takes multiple uses and you try it
with different products and you realize
oh that worked really good in this way
but not maybe so much this other way so
you got to try it a few times before you
really get a feel for some of these new
brushes but another brush line that I
ran across that I hadn't seen in Ulta
before and by the way I was really proud
of myself I hadn't been to Ulta in like
3 to 4 weeks with all this moving and
house stuff happening I just hadn't been
there so I was running into lots of new
things it seemed like but I found this
urban Beauty United brand have you seen
this ooh boo Ubu I don't know had some
individual brushes and they had a little
like maybe five piece brush set and then
I went for the smoky eye brush kit which
included these three pretty purple
brushes right so my thought is can these
be used alone to create an eyelid I love
to put brush sets to the test in that
way you know and see can this do the
whole job without pulling anything else
in so I'll totally do that in a review
but for now number 35 which is this one
this really reminds me of an eyeshadow
brush that Real Techniques has out
because it's kind of fluff is the number
36 which is a teeny tiny smudger brush
really could be good for smudgy eyeliner
may also be workable you know as a
really small crease brush but it's so
sure it really makes me think of a
smudger and then the other one is number
31 and this is an angled brush it's got
a really steep angle on it pretty stiff
so this could be you know an eyebrow
thing this could be a more precise
eyeliner so definitely looking forward
to trying those out in creating a look
with them and speaking of eyes I got
some Jain eyeshadows I know Kristin game
loves these Jain eyeshadows and when I
stumbled across them the other day they
were buy one get one 50% off and they're
not exactly the cheapest singles out
there they're around $8 on their own so
maybe keep an eye out for one of those
deals if you can at Ulta but I
a couple of these already but wanted to
just explore more of them and I was
really impressed by the variation of
matte and shimmer so the ones I picked
up are clay which is a matte shade and
this just seemed like a classic kind of
blended out type color Anne's ition
color seemed like it would be really
nice I love the feel of these matte ones
really like luxurious nice feel to those
another matte one that I picked up is
called iris check this out this is like
deep dark eggplant
you know plum type color I think this is
going to be fun to see how that sheers
out you know you can tell it has the
potential to be really dark but what
does it do when you're like buffing it
out and and blending it you know
slightly above your crease so can't wait
to work with the how gorgeous look at
that teal this is called juniper kind of
a metallic finish there but could make a
really pretty smoky eye potentially even
like a one shadow look type smokey eye I
think so
oh I've got so many plans ready and the
other one is Rosie Posie and this is a
shimmer as well and I thought you know
for the pinky looks that I like really
pretty you guys know how it is when
there's a buy one get one 50% off god
forbid you only bought one or only
bought three you've got to go and even
number picked up some new false
eyelashes too I found from eyelure they
had a bunch out it seemed like a bunch
of new stuffs is a 3-pack of the natural
lights super full I have had these
before I've enjoyed them they're a
really nice cut they're kind of
lengthened out more toward the outside
but not in quite as dramatic of a
fashion as say the demi wispies are I
also love the way I lower packages
they're lashes because they're not like
on a band the band is not laying on
anything there's just a slight adhesive
right underneath the lashes and they're
just very easy to pull off you don't
mess with the shape when you take them
off of there it's just a small detail
but I mean it meant
and then they had another sort of
grouping of lashes
this one says texture I can't remember
if one of the others said volume or
length on them but this is just the one
said it says number 117 a long angled
lash with a twisty messed-up finish and
this is a style of lash that I like a
lot I like it when the lash is not cut
super blunt and you can see different
lengths working in and I think it's so
easy to make those blend with your own
natural lashes last but not least at
Ulta guys I knew this day was gonna come
and I'm maybe not the first person who's
seen something like this but I found a
DD cream they got the BB the CC and now
the DD and this is from tree hut this is
the line that makes all those really
yummy smelling scrubs they're not only
sold at Ulta but I've seen them at
Walmart Walgreens they've got at my
oldest store quite an expanded line of
that kind of thing and then I saw this
and it says daily defense cream SPF 20
res berry macadamia this was the only
scent that they had in this it says
certified organic shea butter raspberry
seed macadamia oils and it has UVA ub
UVB and free radical protection and I
have been really really conscious of
wearing sunscreen a lot lately because
we have a pool at this house and it's
amazing and I love spending time out
there but I really don't even want to
set foot outside without making sure I'm
totally coated in some kind of
sunscreens so this is definitely
something I'm gonna put to the test out
there in full Sun and see how well it
protects SPF 20 not maybe the most heavy
duty SPF out there but I still think
it's impressive that it's in this
product and this smells nothing like
sunscreen this raspberry macadamia I
mean a light bulb went off in my head
when I realized what this smells like
we have a winery near our area here and
they do a sangria it's called Russell
Hill by the way shoutout to wrestle
haven't spent much time there lately
with pregnancy at home but they make a
sangria a red wine sangria that smells
exactly like this just exactly like it
when I first popped this open I thought
I've smelled that before what is it what
is it what is it what is and then it
came to me and it's just like I mean
it's delicious I've got this on right
now and I smell freaking awesome I must
say there is a lot of berry lore Asbury
coming through this I don't know that it
would be everyone's cup of tea but this
is definitely something you could stroll
by at Ulta give it a whiff see what you
think of it it was not super expensive
either let me see
it was around $7 and there was the buy
one get one half off so guess what I
went for this daily defense dry oil mist
this has an SPF 8 so that's pretty cool
right so this is the kind of body spray
type product you can use but also it has
like moisturization 2 small bit of SPF
in here but some nonetheless so I think
that's cool and I've layered these I
really like the sense that's my home for
today y'all thank you so much for
watching like I said I'm so excited to
share with you more of what's happening
in this makeup room I've got totally
news story I've got a hook in here
that's just something I have never had
before it's I just have to show it to
you so you can see it but they'll be
coming in a future video thanks again
for taking time to watch and I'll see
you later
