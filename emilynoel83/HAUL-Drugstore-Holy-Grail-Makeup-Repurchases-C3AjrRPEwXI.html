me this is one of those videos where I
was thinking about doing it and then I
thought no nobody's really going to be
interested in just a haul that's not a
brand new stuff but of things that I
maybe have already talked about in the
past but ultimately I thought I think
it's really saying something if me the
person who is like chronically trying
new products all the time is willing to
go out and repurchase the same thing
repeatedly a lot of these things that
I'm talking about are kind of like
recent empties but I haven't been doing
the greatest job of keeping all of my
empties in my empties bin as opposed to
in the trashcan but something that I
often will say in that video is oh this
is a product I just ran out of but I am
going to repurchase it and I guess this
video would be the proof that I have
indeed gone ahead and repurchase some of
these things first thing and it's a
definite Holy Grail status item is the
Sarah V hydrating cleanser I had a large
size of this already and it took me a
long long time but I finally gone
through it all and I've been in sort of
an unusual place with my morning
cleansing routine because I've been
trying out several different micellar
waters and one conclusion that I've come
to is that the very heavy Sarah V night
cream that I've been using it's like the
skin renewing night cream it's got like
a purpley label on it that's really
heavy and for me to not do a full-on
face wash in the morning at least where
I'm using a night cream that's that
heavy you know it's not enough for me
I've used several different micellar
waters and I'm not necessarily saying
that these aren't like getting my face
fully clean in the morning but the whole
concept behind those is that they're not
stripping your skin it's almost like
they're offering a little extra
hydration back to your skin and I feel
like lately my skin has not been looking
as clear as it should be and I kind of
blame that process of not giving it a
full face wash in the morning and
instead just using the micellar water
and I think maybe that's a bit much for
my skin right now so I do need to wash
it so that long story it leads me back
to this this has been the thing that I
have been using as my face wash for I
guess seems like going on a couple
now it's seriously the best thing I
think to give your skin that clean slate
at the start of the day but it does not
strip or over dry I dealt with eczema on
my face and I've used this as a face
wash and it was not you know overly
harsh to those sensitive areas says for
normal to dry skin with ser amides and
hyaluronic acid they say with like
relationships if you love something let
it go and then if it comes back like I
don't know maybe that's way too deep for
face wash that is kind of what happened
here now something else face wash wise
when we're talking about makeup removal
at night time something I go through
much much more quickly are the little
Olay daily facial space face face wash
cloths and if I'm at Walmart I will no
problem by the equate I think they're
called hydrating face wash cloths and
they come in at two packs so you get a
couple plastic pouches full in one box
but at the time I was shopping for some
of these things I was in Walgreens so
and they just had the Olay kind and they
only had in stock the sensitive version
or the oily to combo skin version so I
went for the sensitive and these work
great in case you're not familiar with
the way they work they are just like a
little folded up cloth and once you get
them wet they suds up and they're great
for just removing all your makeup even
eye makeup even if I don't use the
sensitive kind none of the other kinds
including equate and none of them
irritate my eyes whatsoever and I really
get all up in there to remove everything
so I'm always repurchasing these so this
isn't really a unique repurchase it
didn't take as much work I had to go
through a box of these as it does some
of this but I love them and it's for
sure Holy Grail status on that now i
repurchased a foundation that i used up
and i actually went through this
foundation it was several months ago i
believe but it was still kind of in my
memory just looking through my
foundation stash thinking I wish I still
had that one in there because it's a
great one from the drugstore and it is
my Neutrogena healthy skin and this is a
really awesome lightweight foundation I
use it in natural beige and you know a
lot of times I like Mike
frig and if I'm doing certain looks
maybe I really want to go the
full-coverage route but this is one of
those special like lightweight
foundations that really looks good on
the skin it does not look too heavy it
doesn't cling to dry areas I won't say
it has like a luminous finish because
there's not shimmer or sparkle in this
but your skin just looks fresh after
application it has SPF 20 in it this is
the foundation I'm wearing today I
didn't go topping it with a whole heck
of a lot of concealer with the exception
of the under-eye area and I'm pretty
happy with just the overall look so I
was really glad to get that one again
I have conveniently gone through a
couple of my favorite drugstore mascaras
at the same time and so I went and
repurchased those and the sign for me
that I am getting to the end of a
mascara is when I apply it to my lashes
and it's no longer separating because
then the formula has just gotten so
thick that it can't easily be combed
through the lashes so I was noticing
that with both of these mascaras so it's
definitely time to repurchase now the
super sizer I believe this is my third
tube and clump crusher water-resistant
god only knows how many of these I mean
this might be honestly six or seven on
this because I use this so religiously
on the lower lashes so again it's clump
crusher water-resistant version I buy it
in very black it really does not go
anywhere when I put this on the lower
lashes there is a very gentle curve to
the wand but overall it's a very small
brush on there and the bristles are
rather short but there's a lot of them
the lashes end up lengthened but not
overloaded with mascara the crowning
achievement of this product is by far
the staying power if you're going to put
on lower mascara you don't want it
moving and smudging down below a lot of
mascara formulas do that to me under the
eyes is definitely my eye makeup staying
power problem area so this is great for
that and in case anyone was wondering I
don't have a hard time removing the
clump crusher water-resistant certain
waterproof formulas are a real hassle to
get off and if I feel like the removal
is so difficult that I'm losing lashes
I'm not going to want to use it that one
is pretty easy to get off and then the
super sizer I haven't been using quite
as long but
got this in very black in just the
regular variety but I do love this one
they say unique lash styler twirl as you
apply I have a full review on this
mascara if you would like some really
detailed info and to actually see it
going on but it does great things for my
lashes which are sparse they like to
point down with this brush it's like you
can apply one side that really loads on
some product and then kind of turn it
and the bristles help extend it out and
I know later in the summer months I was
wearing this a lot just for a natural
look I would do my eye shadow but not do
liner curl my lashes and apply like two
coats of this stuff and it really like
put my lashes out there it lengthened
them out it held the curl whenever I do
that with this I get comments like on
pictures Oh your lashes look so long
what mascara is that and this has really
been my favorite one to use so I would
highly recommend it I needed some new
Revlon precision lash adhesive that is
my favorite lash glue but Walgreens
didn't have that in stock they did have
the duo brush on strip lash adhesive so
I went for that it is I've used this
before it's very similar to Revlon's
except I feel like the consistency is a
bit more thin and therefore it takes a
little more time to dry but it's decent
I was thinking of not mentioning this
because it wasn't my true like Revlon
one that I use up over and over and over
again that I repurchase but then I
thought some people might be interested
in the difference so if given the
opportunity I would still continue to
buy the Revlon oh and this says do not
freeze could you guys quit freezing the
lash glue I mean come on what oh I meant
to mention this after the foundation I
got a new L'Oreal True Match pressed
powder I have it in the shade buff beige
and I'm wearing a little bit of that
just to set my look today and for the
longest time I was wearing the shade Sun
beige in that and not only was i running
low on it but it was definitely not the
right color for me right now so I went
ahead and got buff beige and it's a
great color match I know a lot of people
rave about the true match foundation but
the powder too and this line is just
great first off you've got a huge shade
range I feel like I've been talking
about how great this powder is for years
and it
actually has some coverage to it if you
wanted to just do a quick look you know
tap on some concealer and then just wear
some of this kind of like powder
foundation style you could do it I do
use my Milani multitasker powder quite a
bit but this is not quite as heavy as
that and it also has I think just a
lighter look on the skin the Milani
multitasker I think you have to make
sure to use a light hand with it because
just sticking a brush in that product
will pick up a lot of powder this powder
is interesting because it's kind of that
nice luxurious soft texture but it
doesn't go on so heavy to where you
couldn't just use it as an easy quick
touch-up powdery so I love this stuff if
you're looking for just a great
drugstore pressed powder plus a lot of
color variety so you can really hone in
on your exact shade this is nice plus
it's got the mirror in the back and it
gives you a little sponge as well now
the last makeup item that I thought I
repurchased I actually didn't get out of
the store with apparently I checked my
car to see if it fell out of my shopping
bag it was nowhere in there and then I
looked at my receipt and sure enough I
actually did not get it set on the
counter to check out and I'm talking
about my Milani eyeshadow primer I love
that stuff that is probably my favorite
drugstore eye primer it measures up
completely for me with Urban Decay
primer potion and I completely went
through one tube of the Milani and it
took me forever
like I remember referencing in different
videos still using the Milani you know
is just hanging around forever and it
only takes a little bit so right now I
feel like I've just got a bunch of like
shadow primer samples that I'm using up
and I know a lot of you were really
concerned like oh my gosh she didn't
make it out of the store with that eye
primer are you gonna make it and I'm
here to tell you I will be okay but you
know maybe now that I think of it maybe
this is really a blessing in disguise
for some other person who randomly gets
my cart and that primer was in there and
maybe they're not even thinking about it
and they throw it up on the counter with
the rest of their stuff and then they
get it home they're like oh I didn't
remember buying this but they find out
that it is their holy grail I shadow
primer I may have just changed someone's
world with that little incident you
never know the last thing that I will
mention here is my deodorant my holy
grail do
rent that I love so much and I am a
sweater it's just the nature of Who I am
I've used plenty of deodorants that I
like that work well enough but I found
one that really is awesome but there is
something that you need to definitely
watch for and double-check on with this
I'm talking about the secret clinical
strength it comes in a box like this
invisible solid proud sponsor of Oprah's
life class yes you know you're getting
some serious deodorant when it is a
stress response
Oprah's life class deodorant it really
does smell good I love it it says proven
stress sweat protection and this
clinical strength like it's good stuff
but you want to make sure you're getting
the invisible solid okay like it's just
the regular like solid deodorant like
that I have used up one of these
absolutely loved it the next time I had
to go repurchase I mistakenly got the
kind that's like a cream that clips
flicks up through and number one I don't
think it works nearly as well for
keeping the sweat at bay number two that
just feels like weird it's like kind of
a wet creamy like you got to rub it in I
don't dig that experience at all so look
closely take the extra second make sure
you're getting invisible solid because
that's the best so that is my drugstore
haul full of repurchase products
products I am extremely familiar with
that I have used up in some cases
multiple times over and I just wanted to
share that with you it's kind of like
life after empties you know I did indeed
go out and repurchase these things and
I'm really glad I have them back in my
life I am sure this is not the last time
I'll be repurchasing these particular
things so thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you again later
