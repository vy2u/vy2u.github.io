have been accumulating some products
here from various places for a little
while now and I gotta say lip products
tons of them I have just been I don't
know what's going on here but I need an
intervention of some sort I mean I feel
like I'm going to come home one day and
Tyler and cupcake will be standing there
saying we need to talk you've got a lot
of lip products here but um there's been
something that has come out in stores
that I've just been kind of waiting for
and waiting for ever since um Bentley
blonde I don't know if you found her
here on YouTube but she's awesome and
she tweeted me like I don't know it was
probably a month or so ago about these
Revlon lip butters and she was like you
would love these keep your eye out for
them and it was weeks and weeks and then
just recently I found the lip butters in
the stores and I just love them I mean
she told me you know i watched her video
on them and she talked about how they
were really moisturizing yet they give
off color and they're just beautiful and
so I went out and when I first found
them you know based on her review I got
four I mean I did not want to miss out
and because i'm not sure if these are
limited edition or what but when I found
the display they had all of them there
so I got I got four of them as you can
see they're kind of just the gosh there
is some major lawn work going on next
door sorry um this one is called peach
parfait and as you can see they look
like you know a basic lipstick but
they're so moisturizing and they go on
with shine like you don't even need a
gloss over the top so peach parfait is
really really pretty and you can see
just with one swatch there there's some
shine and that has a little shimmer to
it some of these other ones are just
kind of straight up creamy then the one
I have on is very smoothie I tried to
get kind of a range so i could see you
know how the lighter shades versus the
darker shades work but this is a really
wearable pink they have some brighter
pink switch i'll show you one of them in
a second but that one's like super super
wearable and the brighter one that i
have is called lollipop and this one is
straight up just a creamy color
and it's just Powell you know it's like
a great magenta pink but what sets us
apart from a lot of lipsticks is your
lips are going to look so you know
hydrated and practically like you've put
a gloss on them I just love that aspect
to these and I love the texture great
color selection the other 1i have is red
velvet I'm trying to think about how
many other colors that were there I
don't know maybe like a dozen or so red
velvet is going to be a great great
holiday shade it's a very wearable read
this kind of red that is not you know
your fire engine red but it's something
just to hair deeper don't be don't stray
away from this because it is a little
deeper because that's actually going to
be a little bit easier to where it's
going to look a little more natural
strangely even though it is darker than
some of the brighter Reds that are out
there but um I love these so I'm so glad
I found them I was so excited when I
know in the checkout was even like oh
wow you must really like these I'm like
I hear they're really good other lip
product i got it's one of the revlon
colorburst lipsticks which i like these
as well and the shade is petal I think
it's a fairly new shade that's come out
but it's definitely you definitely
neutral kind of a golden e peach so I'll
swatch that right over here so you can
see as you can see just like that swatch
versus these others these are real shiny
and this one's still a little shiny and
shimmery but it doesn't have quite the
hydration level got another lipstick
here god I tell you revlon what's going
on I got this pink I just randomly found
this in the store one day this shade is
called gentlemen prefer pink and it is a
neat kind of pearly pink I'll that
right here just it comes off extremely
creamy I mean even though if you look
closely at the product there's a little
bit of a shimmer sort of to it when it
comes off you know finish why's it just
looks really creamy very very saturated
color really thickness is Revlon super
lustrous in that lipstick and smoked
peach so on this just kind of seemed
interesting to me I didn't have much in
terms of this kind of a color now you
can really see the finishes see shiny
shiny shiny shiny coupe
that one's mad something new at
walgreens I know a lot of you are
familiar with the sinful colors nail
polish is a really affordable brand of
nail polishes well now I've found that
they have put out some lip glosses so I
haven't even tried these yet actually so
I can't tell you much about them but the
one that I have this kind of a neutral
shade called this lips for you I'll just
get them both swatched here and then the
other one is more of a bubblegum pink
like straight up looks like bubblegum
but I'll have to review these ooh they
smell good just got some of my nose
whoopsie okay this is the more neutral
one that I first put on and then the
other one is more pinky yeah they seem
like pretty typical lip glosses but I
will definitely try those out and let
you know how those work for know if you
remember a couple weeks ago Malley was
on TV like a non-stop with shows and
there are a couple things that I just
had to pick up one of them was the
poreless perfection glowing foundation
it comes with this great brush super
soft nice full powder brush but my shade
is medium and what this is is pretty
much a a powder foundation it's got some
nice coverage to it this shade I feel
like it's just the slightest bit dark
for me but when I put it on it really
brightens up my skin I like using a more
full coverage powder sometimes over a
lighter foundation or tinted moisturizer
and this is just really a nice coverage
on it is somewhat brightening it has a
little on velour sponge underneath there
but i'll continue using that i haven't
used it for that long so far but i do
like the finish that it get in the other
thing I got from malli oh my goodness
guys this is so exciting for me because
these are some of my favorite favorite
eyeliners but this is a ten-piece
eyeliner kit of the ever color automatic
waterproof eyeliner who saw my recent
eyeliner favorites video you saw me
really kind of go nuts for this
particular kind of liner I think it's
great for the waterline I already had
like four of them
and they're sold in duo's or I've just
kind of gotten them through some of
molly's larger kits on QVC but when she
came out with this I thought I cannot
turn this down because the price was
like the equivalent of buying like just
I don't know two or three of these but
you get this whole set and what and
they're all full size and what's cool is
that you're getting just the full range
of anything you might possibly want some
of these liners and I need to point this
out you know they're not all for
defining your eyes you've got your
darkest darkest ones that are going to
give you like Richie dark saturated
definition but then you've got colors
that are not necessarily going to you
know go on like the black is going to go
on but they're going to be more of like
an accent type color if you know what I
mean so I've gotten them all swatched
here on my hand and I don't know if I'm
going to be able to remember all the
particular names but they have a shade
called satin taupe which is this one
right here they've got a silver a forest
green a gold a copper plum Navy nope
wait black cherry Navy plum dark brown
and black those aren't the exact names
but that's basically what they are and
what's so cool as hell you know they are
so while I'm wearing and you know
they're not going to go anywhere and I
am super excited to you know start using
you know maybe one on the top and a
different color on the bottom and mixing
image so at the start of this video I
said I was influenced by dentling blonde
who tipped me off to those lip butters
well makeup by Tiffany D was talking
about something else that I just felt
compelled to check out after she talked
about it and it was the instant age
rewind eraser foundation and concealer
and this is more this is called a
treatment makeup so it's different and
it's a very different texture so I need
to get you know try these more and
really review them for you but basically
this is a light coverage foundation that
goes on almost more like with the
moisturizer feel it has some light
coverage but it's more about being that
treatment for you because it has
some some concentrated age-defying stuff
going on there and then the instant age
rewind concealer is really interesting
because it's very thin but it has some
really concentrated pigmentation to it
in other words like it doesn't take a
lot that it is still managing to cover
stuff up even though it is going on in
such a thin way so it's really
interesting and I was just I've been
intrigued by these for a while just
blocking by them and seeing how they're
called erasers and they kind of look
like they have this little eraser tip
the foundation is just the same only
bigger butt is so cool and so it's kind
of fun to use and I'll keep using it and
try to come to a determination on how
good I think it truly is but I'm
enjoying them so far and I just just
like everyone I've kind of inspired by
other people's purchases on here as well
so thank you so much for watching this
hull I hope you enjoyed it and learned a
few new things about some lip products
and there are definitely some things
that I'm going to have to try here i'm
going to go wash my hand now have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
