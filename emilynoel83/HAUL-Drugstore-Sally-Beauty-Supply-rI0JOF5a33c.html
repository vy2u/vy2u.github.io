off my shirt it says save the earth it's
the only planet with cupcakes has a
cupcake I love this shirt I found it for
probably $10 at Walmart not too long ago
I think I wore it on a blog TV so I
really enjoyed it I felt like wearing it
for this video
anyway this haul is gonna be from
Walgreens and Sally Beauty Supply it's
not a lot of things but it's several
things that make me pretty excited the
first of which it's not makeup related
and it is the peeps marshmallow flavored
freezer pops I believe I've talked about
these on Twitter before these are
amazing you can have three of these for
less than 100 calories and they're not
like all different flavors like the
thingies are different colored that they
all just kind of have this slight
marshmallow flavor they are ice pops but
they just had that flavoring to them so
I think they're awesome I find these at
Walgreens they are just $1 per box so
it's definitely worthwhile you get 10 in
every box
they're purchased from Walgreens Etsy
came out with some new shades I believe
they are fall shades and this shade is
called ladylike and I saw it in the
store and it looked much more pink on
the shelves I have it on my nails now
too but kind of strikes me as a grayish
lavender it's very I mean I think it's
very classy looking but I just I thought
it was getting something more like kind
of a dusty pink but either way I still
like it it's just it is different from a
lot of colors I have because any other
lavender shades I have are more like
Easter Egg lavender so this one's a
little more toned down but that's called
ladylike and this is two coats of that
there's also a new display from
Maybelline and there was also a little
coupon pad like right there by the
products and it said like P by 3 you get
two or three dollars off and so I bought
several things from that display and I
believe these are all yeah they're all
limited edition I have some new blushes
and they had these two and there was
also a highlight one's called
press-worthy pink I actually saw a
little something about
in the latest Allure magazine I believe
but it's kind of like a baked blush
almost I'm trying to see on the
packaging that says baked but this is
just a really pretty fresh pink it has
some luminosity to it it does have a
little bit of sparkle in there as well
so just be aware and I have that on
today kind of on the apples of my cheeks
and then this shade it looks so dark it
is by far the darkest blush I own and
this is called ravishing Rouge but when
I saw it I kind of thought you know
maybe if you wear that sheer that could
be a really pretty color so step one
open the container and obviously a
swatch like I would never wear that
concentrated now this could be a really
pretty burgundy eyeshadow that was what
in my mind was my backup plan if this
did not work as a blush at all I used a
very light touch like barely tap the
brush and tap off the excess and then
really blend it in and so I have that
here in the pink there I just was trying
it out so it's so overall if you've got
light to medium toned skin like I do use
a very light touch if you have deep skin
I could see this being really gorgeous
on you but it is like a total burgundy
blush so I thought what the heck I'm
going to try it out and then the other
Maybelline thing the third item I got is
a limited edition eye studio palette in
Sapphire stylist and this I believe is
what the model in the picture was
wearing and it looked gorgeous and I
think these are kind of similar to those
the textures of the color explosion quad
yeah thumb swatch okay so you got a
couple metallics a gold and a silver and
then two really vivid blues so this
looked really pretty they had like the
dark blue in kind of like an outer v up
top and then they went underneath with
the gold it was so pretty now from
Sally's a couple things that I picked up
were total recommendations from a lot of
you who watch my videos there was a
video in the past a haul where I talked
about the hemp's lotion from I got it
from Ulta
it smells kind of like bananas it's
amazing it smells so good and I just got
a little size of it and ally you said
you know if you want that go to Sally's
because it's a lot cheaper and so I
found the hemp brand at at Sally's and I
smelled the original kind and it was
pretty much exactly like the brand name
that I got so I was looking at that and
they have all these other like really
fruity variations of it and so I was
thinking what am I gonna do and then I
saw that they have a bronzing
moisturizer and got this home turns out
that smells pretty similar to the
original with that kind of money smell
it again a little bit of the banana
scent very fresh and I'm like if I can
find a sunless tanner that smells like
bananas you know that is I have arrived
you know that that's what I want and so
I'm gonna try this out and let you know
you know how well it works haven't used
it yet just opened it to smell it but
thank you to those of you camera
adjustment here thank you to those of
you who recommended it to me there we go
another lotion that had been reduced
from like seven some dollars to 329 and
it's sweets yummy body lotion orange
cream frosting oh my gosh this smells
like an orange Dreamsicle I'm not
kidding it is so sweet it is so yummy it
smells good as you just you know smell
it out of the container here but it also
continues to have that great smell on
your skin smells mmm just so good but
sad thing is since its reduced I'm
thinking you may not see this on the
shelves much longer so maybe see if it's
reduced in your store win win hair
products back when and I got my QVC
Beauty test tube I got the cucumber aloe
when in there used it for a while felt
like it was actually drying out my scalp
a little bit not sure why I think that's
the one for oily scalps and I don't have
a particularly oily scalp so I think it
might have dried me out a bit not sure
but whatever the case may be
when is expensive and you have to use a
lot of it like use a lot of pumps of it
when you get it and so
a lot of people said try hair one from
Sally's so finally I got around to get
in there and this one I got is one with
olive oil it's one of those cleansing
conditioners and they had big bottles
but I thought I'm just gonna try the
packet so this was a couple dollars I'm
gonna try it out and see how I like it
but this is for dry hair my hair ever
since going on vacation I feel like my
hair has dried out considerably at the
ends so we got to go through some sort
of little repair process here so this
will be part of it that is all I have to
share with you everyone thank you so
much for watching this haul video and
have a wonderful day bye
