you in this video I think I need to
label this the I only intended to buy a
deodorant haul because that's where a
lot of this started and don't act like
that's never happened to you because I
know this happens to everybody I'm kind
of making up for some lost time with
this haul just some really spotty
purchases from different places and
while I have been rediscovering a lot of
the things that have been in my
collection for some time you know I'm
always trying new things as well this is
my life this is what I do might as well
mention this deodorant by the way I got
this at Walgreens I had tried a secret
clinical strength from a Walmart beauty
box last summer and it just recently
tried it a few months ago and really
really liked it and you guys I can sweat
I mean I can sweat with the best of them
and I really thought this stuff worked
well and so I was looking in at
Walgreens trying to find the same kind
of thing and I noticed that there was
one that on the Box said Oprah's life
class deodorant like what I'm so getting
that one I wish I kept the box because
just the thought of it kind of made me
laugh out loud but it says
stress-response invisible solid
deodorants oh I got this it's you know
just a different scent of that same
clinical whatever this kind actually
smells even better than the first one I
got so I needed that I picked that up
things I did not need would be the wet
and wild color icon limited edition
Sunset Junction
trio of face products here oh I love
this I love love love this and I
remember last year at this time remember
wet and wild came out with like these
limited edition bronzer blush thingies
there were this size and it was bronzer
and then there was a palm tree or
something but then that was the shape of
the blush and it was like how am I gonna
fit a brush in there and now this year
they've come to their senses and given
us a regular trio of products but this
is so pretty
I'm wearing this is my bronzer slash
contour a little light contour today
didn't do much with that but this is my
blush and then this highlight is unreal
with shimmer here's what those three
look like very very pigmented really
loving this rosy toned blush especially
but I was just so
so happy with that and then in at
Walgreens I think they had like a buy
one get one deal if you had that balance
rewards card which I have that rewards
garden I use it every time so it was for
Rimmel so I got four different Rimmel
things I wanted three and then I just
tacked on the other to get the deal
again I don't know how new it is but
they had what was new to me a little
string of the Rimmel Kate Moss lipsticks
these are not the mattes but just the
lasting finish lipsticks in the black
packaging I can't remember what the name
of the collection was it's made it's
like bohemian something I'm not sure but
two of these shades really appealed to
me one is 0-8 and that's the one I'm
wearing today with a gloss I'm gonna
mention in a minute but um like I said
these are just creamy lipsticks not
mattes but I just thought this shade was
so pretty and kind of rosy wearable just
a nice kind of muted pink shade I really
really like that these are very
comfortable on the lips really nice
quality lipsticks and then the other one
I have here is 30 and I haven't yet worn
this but how yummy does that puppy look
I feel like I refer to makeup products
as puppies way too often but there's
that look at that beautiful like
raspberry shade love from the loves to
the non loves I got this provocative 16
hour kiss proof lip color a lot of you
have asked me about these and I decided
to go with a really light shade for
whatever reason 120 pucker up is what
this is called and this is not the color
of the actual product by the way this is
like a colored plastic they're trying to
imitate what's on the inside I thought
it was just gonna be a creamy like pinky
nude color but it's actually like this
oddly sheer just wash of shimmer on the
lips it's very very sheer there it is I
mean it looks pretty if this were a
gloss I think it would be pretty never
set entirely to where it was dry like a
covergirl outlast would it remain pretty
tacky like I let it sit on there for a
good 10 minutes I was like okay this is
probably as good as it's gonna get I'll
put on the top coat which is interesting
it actually makes me think of like a
liquefied bomb or something and it was
pretty comfortable on the lips I don't
know why i swatched that it's just you
know it's there I didn't like how sheer
this was I
think the color was especially
flattering on my lips right after I
applied it and let me tell you that
stuff got ugly as the day went on it was
looking so like cracked and my lips just
looked like dry and lighter than their
normal lip color but super dry and some
of that frosty shimmer was like getting
in all the cracks it was not cute I'm
kind of in a place with this where I
don't feel like I can review the entire
line just based on this one so do I go
ahead and try another one is it worth it
you guys have any shades of these that
you really think are good and then I
totally meant to use this today but I
forgot to it's the scandalised thick and
thin eyeliner waterproof and I wasn't
really planning to get this but it just
seemed appealing in the moment and it's
like a felt tip liner that has the
slightest little angle here we focus yes
can you see that now it's like a teeny
tiny like angled marker and they say you
know you could use it from the tip and
get one kind of look let's see if we can
do that or you can use it like on the
wide side and get another kind of look
there's a couple of swatches kind of
messy but I could see how that could
work I didn't realize I had so much
Rimmel to talk about but a couple of
things that I found at Target are these
showoff lip Velvets found these last
weekend really really love these the two
shades I got I think are actually
awesome I have atomic rose and I have
orange ology I know I've worn orange
ology in a video I think I wore this one
when I was periscoping last weekend by
the way get the periscope back it's
gonna be the new beauty broadcast live
it's so fun it's like live broadcasting
from your phone and I think it might
only be an iPhone thing right now but
it's so super fun it makes me think of
when I was doing Beauty broadcast live
only I can do this more on a whim I
guess cuz I'm just doing it from the
phone I've gone live a couple of times
already and if you've been watching
thank you it was really fun but I was
wearing this in one of those and I'll
swatch them out for you by the way the
applicators on these are like little
scoops they hold a lot of product these
are the kind of matte lip products where
I kind of like that they're in this
liquefied State first they don't totally
set too
you know SuperDuper dried they will kind
of transfer off a little bit not full-on
like you know a wet finish gloss would
onto your coffee cup let's say that I
noticed it's like several hours past I
would press my lips together and I could
still feel moisture in the product so
that was kind of nice
there's orange ology oh how yummy is
that and there's atomic rose and you're
probably thinking right now Emily do you
even know what Matt is because those are
shiny right now but I swear I swear when
you put them on the lips you know you're
putting on a thinner coat than that
first off and they do have like a
totally matte finish I will prove it I
will review those for you
also I am obsessed with the up and up
brushes from Target and just fascinated
by how many great brushes I've gotten
from this line one thing that I picked
up is this I brush set let me pop these
out and show you because I think it's
pretty much all face brushes that I have
from this collection so I wanted to get
a couple of eye brushes to try and see
how they were but you can see one's a
little fuller one's a little bit shorter
I think they called this the eye shadow
brush and this the smudger brush but
this could be good just for more
controlled application on the lid and
then this one I can actually see for as
fluffy as it is I could see that almost
working in a little bit similar way to
my Sigma e25 so I'm going to try that
and report back and then this cute
little set is the mini brush set let me
pop these out the the style of the
handle is so cute I mean seriously how
adorable is that so you've got this
brush and size-wise you know I can see
this working for a little finishing
powder maybe or you know a little
on-the-go setting powder and then this
other one gosh I mentioned that this
last brush could be a sigma e25 how
about this one look at that shape that
would be really nice for the crease well
this one looks like kind of a downsized
you know brush head if you want to call
it that for the face these seem to be
like full-sized brushes at the ends just
shorter handles couple estee lauder
things I was talking to David about I
think it was the pressed powder
foundation that I have said just wait
try the loose powder on top of double
and he will be fascinated by the
coverage so I ordered this loose powder
I really don't have a ton of loose
powders that I'm a huge fan of right now
so this is the Double Wear mineral-rich
loose powder makeup I have it in
intensity 2.0 and David was so so right
on this I love the coverage that this
adds to not only double wear I mean if
you put this on top of Double Wear it's
like
Vavoom coverage but it's really nice
just lightly over some of my lighter
foundations as well but I was so
impressed with the packaging I mean
they've really thought of everything
with this they put a mirror in this top
part of the lid I haven't used this yet
but there's a little puff in there as
well then it twists off and they've got
that locking mechanism I love that
except here's what you don't want to do
leave this open and leave it right on
the edge of your table because someone I
know may have elbowed that off and
gotten powder all over her floor so be
safe lock it immediately but I really
like this stuff I've been applying it
with my elf complexion brush don't you
love combining a totally cheap brand and
a high-end brand but love love loving
that that's a huge product success and
the other thing I ordered was one of
these pure color envy sculpting
lipsticks but I wanted to try the shine
formula Cristen game was wearing one of
these in a video I don't think it was
this exact shade but it had a really
pretty finish to it
magnetic closure can you handle it
ah love it but this is kind of like a
poppy
I don't know bright pinkish red color
really for as bright as this is I don't
know that sheer is a good way to
describe this product but it seems maybe
just a little more lightweight than the
regular pure color Envy sculpting
lipsticks but that's that shade right
there is kind of like a watermelon color
very very summer appropriate so I'm
excited to play with that some more I
had a couple orders some skincare ish
related things from beauty calm and Ulta
so this is kind of a combo of those from
beauty calm I've heard enough people
talk about this to intrigue me enough to
finally get it but it's the radiant
creamy concealer from NARS I have it in
medium one
custard it's like an exact skintone
match for me right now you'll have
sometimes people like their concealers
to be a little more brightening this is
an actual match match so it is good to
effectively cover something up and like
camouflage it into my skin tone you know
I know they say be careful what you wish
for but I wish I could have my full-on
melasma back for a day so I could just
test this on top of it and see how well
it would do I think at first I went a
little too heavy with this I don't think
you need a lot of this concealer to do
the job is what I'm learning but for
minor dark circles stuff this is easily
handled it also on beauty comm that was
where I got this iced mint lemonade lip
scrub from philosophy I've already
actually reviewed this on the Express
channel fabulous scent it is so
invigorating but there's just not quite
enough little scrubbies in it to be as
good of a lip exfoliator as my elf lip
exfoliator but if you want some more
details check out the Express channel
I'm really getting into all things rose
the scent of rose in like setting sprays
and mists and stuff like that scent of
rose and lip balms there are some legit
skincare benefits with rose actually
being involved in certain products as
David has told me it's not just about
the scent but I got this Peter Thomas
Roth clinical skin care rose stem cell
bio repair gel mask ok this had rose
going for it this had the concept of a
gel mask which I'm really enjoying masks
lately I find it's a quick way that I
can kind of pamper myself and as new
moms know there's not a lot of ways to
really pamper yourself but this says for
all skin types and you put it on like
kind of a thick layer of this says put
on a generous coat on clean skin leave
it on for 10 minutes and rinse with cool
water and my skin feels so nice and soft
after I do that it also says for an
intensive treatment refrigerate and
apply as a mask so it would be really
cool and then or apply a thin layer as
your last layer of skin care and leave
on overnight and I have done that as
well and I thought you know it's a
little hesitant at first as I thought it
was going to remain like kind of tacky
like the mask did but if you just put a
thin amount
on it actually kind of I don't know
absorbs somewhat it's not like you're
going to bed with a sticky face there's
what it looks like it's like pink gel
goop not like true real rose but enough
rosiness I guess for me to get some
satisfaction out of it but this is a
five ounce jar of this stuff so I'm
really really liking that so far some
Ulta stuff here I got this bareMinerals
perfectly paired Pink's this is a duo of
their marvelous Moxie buttercream
formula today I am wearing this
forbidden nude shade over that Kate Moss
lipstick the zero eight it didn't
drastically change the color of my
lipstick but it gave a little bit of
shine but these are super creamy I think
they're a little less sticky than the
regular marvelous Moxie this other one
that I have is called must-have pink I
mean extremely wearable shades very you
know spring and summer friendly so
there's those back to the masks got a
couple of other ones these are the
really inexpensive ones from Freeman the
sweet tea and lemon peel away clay mask
and the sparkling pear pore cleansing
mask
this says oily combo skin and this says
normal combo skin I could fall into
either of those categories depending on
the day this one I liked better although
I need to remind myself that when you're
doing a peel-off mask apply a pretty
thick layer because it's gonna peel off
more easily that way but my skin felt
great after this very very smooth this
one intrigued me because it said whipped
clay and it has the appearance actually
of like a mint julep mask you know that
light green look all over your skin but
it doesn't quite like harden as much or
tighten up as much and I didn't really
notice a lot of effect from this again
I've only used it the one time so far
maybe Tyler will try these as well and
can report some findings to he kind of
likes to do the mess but I like the
scent on these and this one in
particular the sweet tea and lemon
smells awesome
but really the mask thing that's had the
greatest effect on my skin just in
smoothness and I think overall radiance
of the skin has been the rose stem cells
got some Neutrogena pure and free baby
sunscreen SPF 60 plus haven't needed to
use that yet but I'm sure I will soon
again
with the road stuff the Mario Badescu
skincare facial spray with aloe herbs
and rose water rosy mist comparison
video is going to be happening with this
and a couple other things I like the
aroma I don't feel like it's pure roses
kind of like they say it says with aloe
herbs and rose water I can tell there's
some other things kind of mixing into
this but this doesn't always give the
most wonderful fine mist as a couple
other things I've used and I know I feel
like this is going on forever I'm not
going to keep you any longer except to
mention that I got this Sara VI Repair
Cream I had mentioned in my skincare
routine which is still holding strong
for the most part I mean I'm throwing in
some masks and different things but I'm
still keeping with the skincare routine
that was in that video I'll link to that
below but I was talking about how it's
kind of inconsistent with using eye
cream I mentioned the one from Tarte the
C Brighton maracuja stuff but to be
honest I haven't noticed that being like
the best thing ever so I got this Sarah
VI Repair Cream and this is a really
really nice consistency
Sarah V does a great job with the
hydrating products and I like this
because it feels almost bomb like I
don't know it feel like it retains
moisture in the eye area pretty well and
so they say use that AM and PM and then
I saw this new thing the skin renewing
cream serum and I thought it was just
going to be a serum that you would use
under a moisturizer right well it
actually says use alone or under makeup
once or twice a day in the AM or PM
almost like this and itself would act as
a moisturizer and serum in one but it
says helps reduce the appearance of fine
lines and wrinkles we can always use
that it's a little pump style I've used
this a few times so if you use this do
you like to top this with your regular
moisturizer or do you like to use it
alone so that's it everyone tons of new
material for reviews and like I said it
all started with a little deodorant at
least the Walgreens stuff did thank you
so much for watching I really appreciate
you taking time to watch my videos and I
will see you again later bye hey real
quick I wanted to tell you about my eye
look today because I didn't actually
have any eye shadow products that I had
hauled to work into this look so I used
my sugar pop palette from Too Faced and
it was one of those looks where I just
started off I didn't really know where I
was going with it
I put this peach fuzz shade on the lid
and then in my crease it's just this
malted milk ball color here kind of a
bronzey shade so that's what that looks
like when you really pack it in the
crease and then just sheer it out on up
and I use the peach fuzz again as the
highlight and then I used kind of a
coordinating eyeliner here on the lower
lash line and I put blue-raspberry over
that it's like I felt like having a pop
of color today but I didn't really want
it all over my lids I just felt like
doing it this way so yeah that's it
thanks guys see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
