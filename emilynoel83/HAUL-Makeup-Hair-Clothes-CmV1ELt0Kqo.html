broadcast and this one is gonna be
really fun because it's it's very well
rounded hall if I do say so myself it is
makeup hair and some clothes as well so
I will just start off by talking about
what's in my lap here these are my new
hot rollers from Remington these are the
Remington ionic protective hot rollers
and I'll tip this hopefully without them
all falling out but I got these from
Ulta and these were one of the most
reasonably priced roller sets that were
there and so I've been using these for
now a couple of weeks and as you can see
there are some really fun bright colors
these are some smallish rollers by the
way they're not like the big jumbo
rollers these I wanted something that
would give me a little more curl so this
is the largest size it's cool about
these is that these are the lightest
weight rollers I've ever had on my head
they come with some great clips that
don't leave dents in your hair which I'm
very sensitive to that I don't actually
um clip these apart they just stay like
this and they fit just right over the
roller if that were there's these three
different colors that cool and they're
different sizes that coordinate back to
the roller successful things about the
size of a football maybe a little bigger
so it doesn't take up much room on my
bathroom sink which I love really quick
you don't have to leave them in for all
that long I'll sometimes leave them in
for as little as 10 minutes if that and
I still get a nice you know bouncy curl
out of them so anyway enjoying them so
far but I'll continue to use them and
give you another update on how those are
going got some cute things from forever
21 this thing right here is actually a
cute little vest and it's a little bit
shorter in the back and then it has some
longer sides here in the front and it's
kind of looks has the appearance in the
front there of having two layers one is
sort of just like this kind of nude
cotton feel and then the other
practically feels like a suede and it's
got this little flower print on it and
it just drapes beautifully I like how
those front sides come down a little
more it's really slimming and I
thought this could be so cute with a
variety of different you know tank tops
underneath and things like that it was
right around $20 and I just thought I
want to as soon as I put it on I thought
it's comfortable it's easy to wear it's
a fun layering piece that I think I'll
get a lot of good at them next I have a
dress that I wore recently to the
rehearsal dinner at the wedding I went
to this is another forever 21 I like
magenta roses with teal leaves on a
black background it's it's just a little
ways up here in the back and it's got
kind of a nice scoop neck and sort of a
you know it's sleeveless but it's got a
very wide strap area it's got you know
some elastic right here across the waist
and so it can be a little bit blousy
here on the top part and it's got
pockets too which I love forever21 item
is a little black kind of tank top style
dress it's nothing it's got nothing
really fancy about it it's somewhat show
a little bit of an overlay with that
ruffle a pattern so it's like you know
you've got your base dress here and then
that comes down over it I put this on
and I love the way fit and I just
thought you can't go wrong with a simple
black dress like this that has these
interesting little ruffles all over and
you know I picture that being great with
just a little cardigan sweater thrown up
over maybe a jeans jacket or something
like that some really chunky fun bright
tool then go to Dillard's recently and I
know I tweeted about this several times
because I get very excited about a good
deal say one-shoulder deal here it's
kind of got that little bit of a wing
ideas so it's got a big kind of blousy
shoulder over one side and it actually
does have a strap on the other side
little gold and magenta paisley print
going right down the middle this is
another knee length of press I'm Lia
when I get to some makeup um the first
thing something I showed in my natural
at night tutorial saying that I will
have a tutorial coming on this but this
is the Too Faced summer eye palette OMG
traveled with this over the weekend to
the wedding it's so much with the pink
look and I gotta say I'm loving that but
the coral is great so is there turquoise
all these shades however are like except
for toasted coconut down
they're in the corner they all have a
lot of like shimmer and shine and
sparkle even these if it's not showing
up right now these have some sparkle in
them as well so you may want to have
some matte shadows to kind of bring some
contrast to this kit but it is so so fun
to you also something I just posted a
little kind of initial reaction blog
review on it's the bare minerals duo
it's the ready shadow so the bare
minerals press shadow in the top shelf
and I blogged about this with some
swatches and just an example of me
wearing it but these are super soft
wonderful colors here I love the way
they go on these are nice what I would
call kind of like low-maintenance summer
neutral look that's very light and easy
to wear that would probably be this so I
am gonna keep trying these and get a
little more you know experience with
them under my belt before I totally
review it but this little duo is super
fun the only thing I don't like is the
$20 price tag for this little guy this
NYX blush in pinched
I'm gonna be doing working on a blush
dupes videos so I thought hey that may
be like something else I have so I like
these NYX blushes I haven't been
disappointed yet so again that one's
called pinch picked up a bronzer from
essence it's the Sun Club matte bronzing
powder it says brunettes darker skin
right here but the shade is called sunny
and it's just a great big big size about
as big as the palm of my hand or bigger
matte bronzer and you can see it's got
those little ladies on there too but
this is a really nice tone for doing
some contouring and bronzing it's a
little bit softer um it's a little more
powdery say than NYC sunny so the color
comes off of this a little bit more so I
think but works great and plus you've
got a ton of surface area on here to
take like a big kabuki brush and go all
over yourself with that if you want so
from essence a couple of fun bright nail
polishes here I
really like their nail polishes because
the colors are bright and they last a
really long time without chipping but
this great tangerine color is called
wake up and this lime green is called
Lima and so a lipstick from Rimmel put a
little announcement about this on my
blog this is called nude delight right
here and many of you are fans like I am
shade called spotlight beige from Rimmel
but you've said you've had trouble
finding it watch them here side by side
they're very very very similar so just
want to let you know it's called nude
delight I bought this it had a little
new sign by this particular shade so it
makes me think maybe they've put
something out rereleased something
that's very much like spotlight beige so
if that's what you're looking for it's
creamy it has no shimmer it's a very
pretty nude so in terms of lipstick
finds I saw these city duet two-in-one
lip colors from NYC I swear I had
something like this when I was in like
junior high or high school but I can't
remember what brand it was but I have
two of them this shade is called the
Rockefellers and it's kind of like a
coral this is more peachy and this is
more like brighter Korres those two
pretty colors haven't worn these quite
enough to even tell you much about how
they perform but I was just struck by
these shades this one's called the red
hot though there's the red hots pinky
shade red shade the other one is more
corally pink so there's that I thought
those look like a lot of fun and you can
kind of customize it to the exact you
know lip shade you want so that's very
flat wraps up my haul everybody hoped
this was enough variety for you but this
was a lot of fun so thank you so much
for watching and I will see you again in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
