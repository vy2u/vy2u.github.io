for you today because I've got some new
things I want to update you on and they
come from a variety of different
shopping trips here and there you know
like I go somewhere I pick up one thing
and you know it adds up so I'm gonna go
through those products we've got some
high-end some drug store some QVC new
bag to talk about that I'm really loving
so we will get to all that also I'm in
my play clothes sometimes you just want
to have your play clothes on I get home
from work and I just want to put on
something comfy shout out Monmouth
College dear lady now to the stuff and
first off I'm gonna talk hair a little
but I did get my hair trimmed recently
so not so much on length length is
pretty much the same but I did just get
the layers kind of back in it so I'm
happy with that and I've been using a
new shampoo and conditioner recently my
sister-in-law actually recommended the
organics argan oil shampoo and
conditioner you know they come in little
containers like this and I think the
argan oil ones are turquoise or teal or
something and I couldn't find those they
were all out but I did find the cherry
blossom ginseng shampoo and conditioner
and I do like these as helps rejuvenate
the scalp and hair follicle to add
volume at the root while nourishing your
hair so um I guess this would be sort of
a volumizing couple of things to have
it's pretty good I mean I don't notice
anything outstanding coming from it the
scent is pretty good but not amazing so
I'm still going to try to get the argan
oil kind because she really raved about
that but one thing that I think has
really helped the health and the shine
of my hair has been this product from
suave and I picked this up not too long
ago I found it at Walgreens it's the
keratin infusion smooth and shine serum
so this is not many this is actually
just what it is and it comes out just a
little like serum type thing right out
of this pump it just takes a little bit
and like I have that on my hair today
and I just feel like this is enhanced
the shine of my hair a lot it just makes
it look really healthy so I have been
loving this so many of you have been
telling me to try the Real Techniques
brushes
and I really don't have an Ulta very
close to me I have to drive like between
1 1/2 and 2 hours to get to an Ulta so I
really wanted to see them and feel them
and so during the last time I went to
Ulta I did find some and so I got the
stippling brush for one and this is a
really awesome stippling brush first off
I like the construction of these brushes
I like how they have kind of a wide
handle you can actually just sit it up
like it will stand on a surface but this
is a cool stippling brush because I
think a lot of them are made too long
the bristles are too long and they just
kind of touch your face and they feel
really flimsy and Bend and this one is
really easy to use so i I've enjoyed
this so far it's not too terribly big
but it's still Vince enough to get the
job done so liking that so far and then
I'm just kind of getting into my eye
brushes I got an eye brush set it came
in a neat little kind of like brush roll
but I think you can bend down and
actually sit this up on your table and
just use them you know very cool ideas
here and it came with I've I brush this
one is like a really chunky looking
brush so you could go in your crease and
they're all this super dense really
really soft bristles so I think that
they're gonna be really easy to use and
blend with the one that I've been
finding a lot of use for is this base
shadow brush and it's kind of like it
has a pointed tip you can kind of lay
down some product with that or you can
use that little tip to get in your
crease and blend it out so that's cool
they've got this which is a brow brush I
haven't used this one yet but it's like
kind of a stiff angled brush for your
brows and a liner brush pixel pointed
eyeliner brush which actually seems a
little bit thick to me for like an
eyeliner I haven't used that one yet so
we'll see but I do love this accent
brush this is just a great small size it
reminds me a lot of the Sonia Kashuk
smudger brush just very same size good
for smudging in the outer corner you
could use it as an inner corner thing
but those are all purple and really
pretty Jay
recently and my t.j.maxx I don't feel
like they have the greatest selection of
beauty products there but so when I did
finally like find something I shadow
related I jumped on it and it's from the
brand I think he'd say of course I
believe so I don't have hardly any other
products but it was this neat little
eyeshadow thing it's like all on a strip
and these all open individually so I
paid like seven dollars for it and this
is what the colors look like it looks
like it would be really really pretty
and so I swatch them and I'm like okay
there's a silver not great pigmentation
but whatever the white not too bad now
get a load of this what I mean really
it's it this this should be like
beautiful wonderful purple and I can't
believe how much I can rub my hand on my
finger on that and not get hardly any
payoff so disappointment and same with
this one barely any shimmer but no real
purple color so I would say don't waste
your time don't waste your money on that
how it I am really enjoying that I got
from Sephora gosh it seems like it was
at least a month ago but it is the
shades of fame I palette and the
packaging is really cute it's kind of
like photographers and models all over
this little palette and then you open it
up you've got a mirror and you've also
got a bunch of fun summery shadows so
you've got to cream like liners or they
could be a shadow base for you you've
got a brush that's sort of a typical
flat brush or like a more liner type
side right here and then the shades you
know a selection of neutrals and then in
terms of colors you've got a teal a
wonderful coral that I've been having so
much fun with and then all of the rest
are just kind of like in your brown and
cream family this orange e coral it has
like gold sparkle it's so pretty I've
worn that quite a bit so loving that so
far I'll probably like maybe swatch it
do a little a bit of an extended review
on my blog or let me know
you want to see a tutorial a few random
other drugstore things one of the Revlon
just bitten kissable balm stains that
many of you told me I should try but
I've never been able to find in the
stores lately is the shade a door and it
looks like it would be a really dark red
and it kind of is a deeper red but it's
definitely more wearable than you might
even realize
so I've worn this one since getting it
and I really think it's very pretty the
other red in the collection romantic is
more of like a true sort of tomato we
read and then this one seems to be
something that's a little more berry a
little bit more like NYC's sheer Reds so
love that if you want more opinions on
these just check my review that I
recently posted my coral eyeshadow
obsession is growing I got the
Maybelline eye studio quad and I think
this is limited edition in coral alesis
this was in a special display shades are
so like buttery and yummy and just
really really nicely pigmented I like
how they put in this cool almost like
yellowish green color in here to kind of
switch it up and make it a little
different this dark brown is also really
fantastic but I think the star is
probably that beautiful coral it's it's
more on the metallic side all these
shades are a little more metallic than
anything in that Smashbox kit except a
new lash blast and I figured might as
well get the fun new white packaging for
the Olympics so yeah I think lash blast
is a great mascara for not smudging not
flaking off it's not too much of a wet
formula it does have kind of a large
rubbery brush but I'm wearing this
mascara today and I'm not doing any
falsies today and it did pretty good for
me guess what I got some of this
Maybelline BB cream 8 and 1 beauty balm
skin Perfector used it a few times
initial reaction is not super impressed
a couple of these BB creams that I've
tried so far struck me as a glorified
tinted moisturizer I mean a skin
Perfector they all market themselves as
a skin Perfector which boggles my mind
because there are no more perfecting my
skin than just the average tinted
moisturizer might
I mean it's just something you're
putting on with super light coverage
it's not covering any sort of mark or
circle or anything like that so for the
lightest coverage possible maybe
something to look into but I'm planning
to try a couple more of these because
I've only tried this one and the Garnier
one and CoverGirl's smoothers tinted
moisturizer has now been sort of
repackaged just to prove my point about
the fact these are remind me of attended
moisturizers covergirl smoothers which
looks like let me find one for you it
looks just like this okay
they now just have this very same
packaging and they put like BB cream on
it and it says something about being
repackaged on the label and I'm thinking
well this is just their way of jumping
on the BB bandwagon maybe a ban why it's
just basically their same product and
they're just calling it BB cream so um
I'll let you know if I see one that I
think really Wow's me and maybe review
them all as a whole that I've tried but
so far this one I was just kind of like
hey what's so special did a blog post on
the hyper shine lip glosses from ELF and
how these are kind of a new rediscovered
yet I'm purchasing more of them type
thing like I found a few in my
collection realized how much I like them
and I found another one at Target in the
shade Moff and you can see this on my
lips as well as a couple of other
favorite shades on beauty broadcast net
that's my blog but these are the kinds
of lip products that click through the
tip and I just feel like they're very
wearable very easy for summer really
really like that shade in particular in
terms of my lips but better came up with
some new lashes at Sally's these are the
ardell demi whispies which are one of my
favorite kinds I like the way they're a
little bit longer on the edges the strip
itself is not too long into end and it
just gives a lot of nice thickness and
drama when you want a little more
dramatic or smoky look so I love those
lip products that is low in my
mind these are from the brand it
cosmetics and these are called the
vitality lip flush and this is kind of
like their take on the balm stain
concept a moisturizing stain I would say
these are more moisturizing than the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stains
they really make your lips feel
saturated and that feeling hangs around
for a while for example I was wearing
one today I went and had a salad with
kind of like you know that Italian oily
sort of dressing and I always expect
that to break down whatever is on my
lips but it was still on there and I was
super excited but the brand actually
sent me one of these in the shade Jenna
sukwon which is this is what kills me
wouldn't you think this is just gonna be
some crazy sheer just like gloss on your
lips I mean you would think that but
when I swatch it for you and this is so
funny
it like morphs into the most beautiful
perfect pink and you don't have to go
over it as much as I have there but once
it gets on your lips it turns into such
a pretty berry pink and it just takes a
little while for the color to develop
but once it does your lips are stained
that color and you've got pretty shine
I've got on a different shade now but
that brings me to my point
they sent me one I was so intrigued by
this and I enjoyed it so much that I
thought what other shades do they have I
want to try more I want to see if
everything's just like this one like how
do these work and so last time they were
on air they were selling a set of three
with that color I just showed you and
two more so I thought okay I'm trying
this out the other shades were
love-story
and this appears to be kind of like a
mid-tone rosy color this is what I have
on right now like it changes a little
bit when it gets on your lips and
becomes just a little more intense I
guess a little more pigmented so I'll
swatch that by the side of this one here
too but you can see beautiful pink this
gets even Pinker on your lips just a
warning and then the other
shade is pretty woman looks a little
scary it looks like a very deep dark red
but this is actually a lovely berry
color and like I said super moisturizing
stains so there you go there's your
three colors colors once they get on
your lips they will last and I feel like
they stay glossy for a while too so I'm
just I'm just nuts about these I'm
fascinated by that Jenna sukwon shade
and how it is such a beautiful pink and
like I said even Pinker than it is on my
hand on my lips because your lips have a
little bit of natural you know pinky
tones in them but it's just so crazy how
it's like transforming and it's feeling
so good ingredient-wise it says with
plum oil cherry oil shea butter argan
and jojoba plus vitamins A C and E green
and white tea and aloe it cosmetics
comes up with some like crazy innovative
stuff so loving these this did not I've
worn this all day this has not and I did
put it on again before this video just
cuz I wanted the color to be really true
to what it is but it did not feather
outside my lip line at all nothing else
needed no lip liner no gloss just
totally thrilled with those we almost
forgot I got to show you my new purse
here it is this is from Isaac Mizrahi
and I got it from TJ Maxx and I love
this bag looking kind of like silvery
taupe as you look at it now but it
actually looks rose gold in in some
lights which I thought was really
interesting I don't buy bags for names I
buy bags because of Ag and so when I saw
this what caught my eye was the color
and also the shape I mean it's it's not
super wide front to back so you don't
feel like you're lugging some enormous
thing but yet it's a good bag for me to
take to one like how it almost kind of
automatically there's a little magnet
there at the top and this is kind of
hard to show but once it gets close it
just kind of shuts itself and it's very
nice and neat like that pocket in the
front there's a pocket in the back got
sort of like several compartments it's a
pretty satiny sort of lining a zippered
compartment big part there big part here
and then got my Altoids
some other little areas there on the
inside so it's so soft it feels super
luxurious this was originally somewhere
in the sixty something price range and I
got 430 so I was really happy with that
and just glad I got a cool new bag I've
been carrying that pink one that has
it's getting a lot of little frayed
threads on it that I got from Target a
long time ago loved the bright pink bag
but was looking for something just a
little more neutral but still really fun
thanks a lot for watching this whole
guys I hope this gives you some ideas of
some new things I have some new things I
might talk about in future reviews and
whatnot so have a great day and I'll see
you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
