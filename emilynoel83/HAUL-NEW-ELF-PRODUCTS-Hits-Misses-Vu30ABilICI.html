joining me this is going to be an elf
haul of course in typical elf fashion
there are a ton of new products and
probably by the time I post this there
will be even more new things that I
haven't tried yet but I do have quite a
few new things that I've been playing
around with so in a lot of cases in this
video I'll be able to sort of give you
my review on most of these things the
first out I have to say thank you so
much to everybody who came out to the
meet and greet at the oldest store in
Chicago and just a couple days ago it
was so much fun it was really I said
this on Instagram but this will go down
as one of my best days after doing what
I do and like 95% of the time just
getting to interact with you guys like
through a screen and through typed
comments for me to get to hug you and
tell you thank you and look you in the
eye and just tell you how much I
appreciate you that was so so good that
was such a good feeling for me and the
those of you who traveled from
neighboring states and took so much time
out of your day or you know you got off
work at you ran over like I so so
appreciate that because you feel like
long-lost friends so thank you positions
formula thank you Alta jumping into this
hull the thing that really drove me to
do the hall was the sponge trio yes
elf has had like a little blender sponge
before I didn't love it so much and it
wasn't the all-time worst blender sponge
that I tried and I think I talked about
in my top 5 bottom 5 video but you know
it left something to be desired and so
here they're doing a trio and I have
just cleaned mine so they are fully
dampened and they are at their maximum
size like this is a big sponge it's a
big freaking sponge look at it next to
just the traditional Beauty Blender it's
so big like the butt end of it is larger
it doesn't quite taper to as much of a
point it's just wider in every way and
then they've got a medium size and this
I actually find in the way it performs I
find this to be a bit more comparable to
the classic Beauty Blender even though
it's a little shorter it doesn't come to
quite as much of a point like this was
the one I was reaching for more because
this just felt so darn big
and then I would say my favorite of the
group is the little micro mini and I
will hold that up to the beauty blenders
micro mini it's still a little larger
but you know it does do a very similar
job this is the one of the three that
I'm actually satisfied with the amount
of point that it comes to because these
other ones see how they just blow up and
it's like they're practically rounded
off there with just the tiniest point it
doesn't really help you that much
so with this if you do actually want to
take that around the under eye it does a
good job these are very soft sponges you
can feel them as soon as you get them
under the sink you can tell okay they're
absorbing the water I can wring the
water out and they will grow in size and
they're very very soft I can't speak too
much to the durability yet because I've
only cleaned these like twice and being
clean you can see they were kind of
resistant to getting totally 100% clean
and I use my Beauty Blender solid
cleanser with them comparing these two
in terms of sponginess I feel like the
elf feels just a little more dense than
the micro mini this is even more like
kind of light and spongy and that's
really the thing I love so much about
the micro mini is I like how it feels
light as air you can dab in your
concealer and feel like you're barely
applying any pressure yet it still gets
blended this you know feels a little bit
heavier on that area so I don't think
these have really taken over and become
like my new favorite sponges by any
means but they are definitely leaps and
bounds ahead of some of the different
generic sponges that have come out
certain ones if you go back to my top 5
bottom 5 video on Blender sponges any of
those in the bottom 5 that I complained
about being hard as rocks you know they
can't absorb water they don't soften up
at all these really do soften up and I
feel like they do a pretty good job just
bouncing across the skin and having that
nice texture that you want shape seems
to be a concern with me a little bit
more with these larger ones and I think
about you know what are the reasons why
I love my Real Techniques sponge so much
for example and I love the shape I like
that flat edge it offers a little more
versatility you do end up with a nice
kind of pointed tip with that sponge as
well
with these you know you really do lose
something when they blow up and get big
because that point just you know it's
not nearly as pointed as the point of a
Beautyblender and if you're wondering
what is the closest thing you found to
being like the Beautyblender micro mini
it's definitely the one in this set I
haven't even seen a lot of micro mini
dupes created out there but I know the
one from up and up targets brand
absolutely sucked I'm sorry it was just
it did nothing like a little bitty rock
and this one is definitely the closest
thing I've tried to being like the micro
mini so hopefully that helps you out a
little bit a little description of those
three sponges they come in a tray
obviously when they get big they don't
fit back in their tray but you can use
that to kind of stand them up and then
this is the box they come in as well the
directions just like with a Beauty
Blender wet the sponge with water
squeeze out the excess bounce the sponge
across the face to blend in makeup and
something I just want to give a brief
mention to because I need to use these
more it's the elf hydrating water
cleansing cloths so different brands
have come out with like a micellar water
cleansing cloth type thing and I think
this maybe elfs take on that you get
twenty pre-moistened cloths in here and
it's great start take off my makeup last
night and just as I began to take it off
with my normal equate wipe thingy I
remember it oh my gosh I've got those
elf wipes I have to use and they're
decent wipe and that they don't I don't
feel like fumes are coming off of them
like into my eyes so many of these wipes
that are pre-moistened are so heavily
scented and it bothers me a little bit
and it definitely bothers my eyes these
do have a light scent to it but it's
nothing too overbearing and I could
definitely get it right around the eye
area and it didn't cause irritation and
I felt like as I applied more pressure
to my skin with the wipes they almost
felt a little bit exfoliating you know
like there was a little texture they're
not super heavy-duty but just slightly I
was only taking off like a partial face
of makeup at that time so I'm gonna have
to use these more and tell you how
effectively they actually remove a full
face of makeup but yeah those are in the
works and something I'll be messing with
the
tone correcting powder I know some of
you had tried that it's been around for
years in elfs line it's like a little
rectangular face powder with four you
know quadrants of color and they all
look kind of like different pastel tones
well now they've come out with one
that's labeled warm and this is what it
looks like and you've got the yellow and
kind of a light peach shade here a light
blue and then kind of a beige in here as
well so the idea is you can swirl these
colors together and it's going to be
sort of a corrective powder on your skin
and so I was eager to try this and when
I first used it I just went all over my
face with it after I put on foundation
and I thought woah woah woah dial it
back because it looked maybe part of it
was that it had a very light look in
comparison to my skin tone that's all
the shades actually blended together
it's a very light and matte powder so
that can have the potential to look a
little dry and cakey so today I just
chose to use it as an under eye setting
powder and I actually think it did a
pretty little speck there it actually
did a decent job in that area I
definitely liked it better on the under
eye then all over the face for me and I
really liked kind of honing in on these
two shades the yellow and the peach and
I found that to be really brightening
but I think my take away is still that a
little goes a long way with this product
because it just is so Matt um you know
you don't want to make your skin look
overly dry with powders like this so
just be aware you know there is another
color option out there now for my skin
tone you might say you know are you warm
or are you cool and I tend to feel like
I am very neutral I can generally get
away with a lot of different tones on my
skin whether they are more of a warm
family or cool color family don't look
to this as a powder that's going to have
a lot of coverage and it's completely
going to like color correct your skin
look at it as something that's going to
be more brightening and definitely
mattifying and the brush by the way that
I used it with if you've got like the
elf small tapered brush that's a good
thing to use if you do use it on the
under eye another new shade that elf has
come out with in an existing product is
their bronzer in golden so they've got a
cool
bronzor a warm bronzer and now the
golden bronzer which looks a heck of a
lot like the warm bronzer in fact I will
bust mine out to show you
okay here's cool bronzer it's like its
own animal I think I did a video one
time where I really multitask like crazy
with this particular bronzer palette
like all over the face so there's that
one but then you've got the warm and
this is what that looks like and yes I
have hit pan on that puppy and now
here's the new golden so you can see a
lot of similarities I feel like the
warmth just has a little more intensity
each shade in the warm palette and just
kind of is a little more different from
one another if you know what I mean
there's a little more contrast between
the colors this one everything is a
little bit closer and on my skin tone I
don't get a real bronzed effect I have
put this on all over and it's just the
most subtle effect ever so if you've got
really fair skin and you like the idea
of a light just softly shimmery um glow
this whole thing just has the most
subtle glow to it ever might be exactly
what some people are looking for but I
could see a large number of people who
are used to bronzers that just have a
lot more depth to them trying this and
being like and you know that's not
enough it's too watered down so I just
want to let you know that's out there
but in general I feel like I get more
impact and more versatility out of the
warm bronzer and the cool like I said
that's just that that's a different
thing all together I'll try to find that
video where I use that a lot now the
story of this video another new shade
the elf has put out in an existing
product is their bronzer palette they've
put out a deep bronzer palette so um as
with their little four in one palettes
the shades do pop out you know you have
that ability to sort of rearrange things
if you had multiple shades at home I'll
show you how it compares to the light
bronzer palette which has been out for a
while they both have a variety of
finishes so there are two completely
matte shades in this palette and then
one has a little more sparkle and one
has like a satiny finish and with this
one definitely too matte shade
right here this one has quite a bit of
like almost glittery Sparkle which I
don't love and then this shade is a
little bit more like a satiny or softer
shimmery finish for me I'm really
enjoying this deep bronzer palette over
the light one because this just you know
in a lot of situations didn't show up as
much on my skin as I would like all of
these shades are very pigmented I feel
like there's just more versatility with
them I love that you are getting two
that are totally mad now I've been using
my lorac take me to tan Tigo palette
quite a bit lately and I'm sure some of
you are wondering how those compare and
I would say there are way more
similarities with the deep bronzer
palette to this one then the lighter one
has the lighter one just didn't come
close to touching the lorac palette this
one you know the tones are not identical
but the overall theory is the same and
that in both of these palettes are
getting two mattes
two shimmers you know the colors if you
were to swatch them all out side by side
they're not the same but there are
similarities there now in the past elf
has had some really good like cheap
eyeshadow primers you know the kinds
that come out twist out with a little
wand and I thought you know they can
definitely do the job they've been
pretty good for me and now they've got a
new thing called Pro eyeshadow primer in
this little tube and it says a pro
strength eyelid primer that can be used
as a base to help prevent creasing and
smudging of eyeshadow for long wearing
color and something I found kind of odd
about the tube there is a really big
hole in the tube so just FYI you will
only need to squeeze out a little bit
and it has kind of a different feel from
let's say the Milani eyeshadow primer or
Urban Decay primer potion it's not quite
so quick to feel dry like kind of dry
down on the skin it's a little more balm
like like maybe there's a little more
moisture in this product I've used this
a couple times and I did not have any
creasing or any problem with this
product under you know whatever
eyeshadow I was using probably my
understand see a modern renaissance
palette you know everything worked fine
a couple days that I've used it I think
I'm going to have to use it more and use
it in
some different conditions that challenge
the product a little bit more but it's
been so far so good one thing I noticed
right off the bat was when I squeezed
some of the primer out there had been
some separation like a little bit of
liquid squeezed out ahead of the actual
creamy primer so I don't love to see
that when as soon as I get a product but
that does happen at time and real
quickly another eye thing that I got
that I am wearing today is from their
beautifully bare line and it's the
smooth matte eyeshadow and the shades in
this when I was choosing from the
website a lot of the shades were very
picked over but I ended up with soft
beige and this ends up being a color
that's just like a little more peachy I
would say and maybe slightly deeper than
my skin tone but you've got a wand
applicator here and this is all I've got
on my eyes in terms of shadow today so I
just kind of dabbed a little bit on each
eyelid blended it all over the lid and I
also took it you know just up into the
crease as well and slightly above and I
really just blended it out with my
fingers so it was very easy to work with
definitely a different texture from a
lot of cream shadows that I've tried
because it's very slippery and it
doesn't feel like when as soon as you
put it on you're like is this stuff ever
going to actually set because it has
just a lighter softer a little bit more
sheer look and feel compared to a lot of
like the eye paint type products that
you might put on and they're very full
color and you feel like you got a blend
of really really quickly or else they're
going to set that way forever
like I mean this you do have a lot of
wiggle room I think in terms of blending
and they do eventually set but that
being said if you layer this on really
thick I think you're going to wait even
longer for it to set or you might not
notice a completely dry feeling I was so
tempted to like top this off with some
other shadows and really play with the
look and do some layering and whatnot
but something in the back of my mind
said no just show them what this shade
and this shade alone looks like so this
is what it looks like it says it's
infused with vitamin E to help nourish
and hydrate I've blended some out here
my hand and it really isn't going
anywhere but yet it still does not feel
100% dry I don't know that I'm so
intrigued with this product that I would
really care to purchase more shades in
it but what I have I think works a
decent you know and it might make a nice
base for some other eye looks because it
is such a matte neutral shade a new face
product that I got are these
highlighting dewy drops and the shade is
just called illuminating and it says a
liquid highlighter with illuminating
pigments that bring light to the face
for glowing dewy complexion and in the
directions they basically say you can
get some of this on your finger and just
start tapping it all over your skin well
I did try that the first time I used it
and I think it's important to be aware
that there is potentially a lot of
separation with this product like what I
just squeezed out on my skin is very
runny and there was a lot of clear
liquid that came out you actually can
shake this product up a little bit so I
would recommend doing that even so it's
a texture that's going to feel very oily
kind of greasy if you are a very oily
skin type this is probably the last
thing I would say should be going on top
of your skin is like a finishing touch
step I've totally rubbed it in on my
hand and you can see this pretty subtle
glow that's coming through a little bit
it's not like a glittery glow it's
almost kind of hard to put your finger
on exactly what you're seeing there but
it's a nice look all blended in but just
tapped like in certain key areas on top
of makeup I don't think it looks so good
it looked kind of patchy on me and then
when I tried to sort of improve the
situation by topping it off with a
different kind of highlight it really
really wanted to just cling to the areas
where I had this and it was just too
much so the way I plan to get use out of
this is actually blending it in with a
moisturizer or working it into a
foundation and then blending that all
over the skin because I think pinpointed
areas and on top of makeup
the oily consistency that this takes on
I'm just not comfortable with that
now next up just a couple different
kinds of lip products that I discovered
on elfs website one of them is their lip
lacquers and I have them in purple and
natural and this
looks like straight up concealer and I
will try that on for you and let you see
what it looks like but the purple is
what I've been wearing throughout the
video this is just one light layer of
the product so all things considered I
think that's a pretty opaque pretty full
color look it is very shiny and I was
wearing this all throughout the day a
couple days ago and I didn't notice any
bleeding outside my lips like up into
fine lines around the lips and I thought
it actually wore pretty well for it
being such a non sticky product there's
enough cling happening to the lips you
know what I mean it's got just enough
thickness to really hang on there but
not so much thickness that it feels
annoying and I really like the flat
edges to the doe foot applicator this
seems to be the direction more doe foot
applicator czar going see how it's more
flat and less like just a little scoop
for product so that really helps you get
right out to the very edge of your lip I
think the shade is beautiful and I am
really pleasantly surprised with this
formula so I love the purple I'm not so
thrilled with the color of the natural
shape just because it is so like kind of
erase your mouth nude but it is shiny so
it has that kind of in its favor but I
would definitely be up for trying some
more shades of this formula I think it's
a good formula I do like how opaque the
colors appear to be so I think that's a
really good sign
now the other product I got are called
lip tints and these are again a new
product to elfs line and these are said
to be infused with vitamins A and E shea
butter jojoba oil grape oil olive oil
and says the formula helps moisturize
lips and give a soft shine and you know
they do come in all different colors as
well so I have pretty pink please and I
got marvelously mauve and also cheers to
champagne which has a little bit of a
golden a metallic shimmer to it these
other two shades are just like creamy
colors and while there is an element of
Sheerness to all of these I do find the
two that are just creamy to be a little
more colorful than this one this one
ends up being very sheer on my lips and
the way the applicator goes it's this
kind of thing where
just like a flat edge and the product
squeezes up through which I don't love I
find that to be a little sloppy and with
so many products that have nice little
light kind of even if you're going to
squeeze it up through you know they
might have a spongy applicator there
those are much more easy to actually get
the shape and the line you want around
your lips whereas these everything kind
of pushes out everywhere so I don't love
that also I really had a bad first
impression with these when I first used
them the separation was horrible like
there was so much just clear unmixed
liquid that I had to squeeze out of
these and I felt like I was squeezing
out like half the dang product I mean I
I did not like that feeling but what
else could I do these aren't the kind of
thing where you can really shake them up
and you know you can kind of try to mush
around the tube a little bit massage the
tube but I don't think that really gets
you very far either so with what remains
I think they've got a decent formula
it's a little bit thicker feeling than
the lip lacquers almost to the point of
being kind of sticky if you already
don't consider yourself a gloss person I
don't think you'll like these because
they really you know they are kind of
thick and also a little bit sticky the
colors of the pink and mauve I think are
really beautiful there's there is a nice
shine that comes off of them but I don't
know that I love them enough to want to
pick these up all the time they're not
really unique shades and while I do have
a pretty good tolerance for you know a
goopy product if I love the shade
especially these just felt a little bit
annoying to me on my lips and like I
said another strike against the product
for the delivery method being you know
that just flat applicator where stuff
squeezes up through I don't love that so
that is my haul everyone tried to review
things in situations where I knew enough
about the product to review it but you
got to give credit to elf they are
always creating new things some things
you know in my eyes or hits some things
or misses but for the affordability of
this brand I think you definitely feel
like you can get away with a little
experimentation so thank you again for
watching and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
