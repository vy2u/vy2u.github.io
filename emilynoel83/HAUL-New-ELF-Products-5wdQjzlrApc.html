elf product I tried the other day asked
if you guys wanted to see an elf haul
and many of you said yes so that's what
I'm doing today I've also gotten just
inundated with tweets asking about some
of the new elf baked products and just
different new things here and there on
the site so there are a lot of new
studio products instead of being like
one dollar a lot of the studio line
items are like three dollars also my
shirt this was my little Walmart number
here this lipstick tank top so I've been
getting some good out of that lately as
well I'm fun it's just falling apart
today got kind of a messy bun going on
it's super hot outside my makeups kind
of melting on me but we want to do this
video so I first got to talk about just
a quick mention of the thing that I did
blog about some more and have some
pictures of this is the elf Studio pout
perfect it's a super duper shiny lip
gloss as you can see there it's just got
a ton of spark it reminds me in terms of
just the color a lot of NYX mega shine
lip gloss and Cosmo if you're familiar
with that but but this is designed to do
is just highlight the center of your
lower lip so you're not supposed to put
it all over because you just want to
have that little bit of dimension and
shine on your lower lip so I showed this
on my blog with like a really bright
pink lip color and something a little
more nude today I'm wearing this over my
revlon colorburst lipstick and petal so
it's if that's kind of a really soft
peachy pink but I've got it right here
in the center of my lower lip and I
think it's so pretty I really really
love this I kind of mentioned in my blog
I mean it's nice that it's not like
SuperDuper heavy feeling because you are
using this as a layering product you
could put it over a liner or a lipstick
or a gloss or whatever but it does just
give amazing shine and there's no
plumper in this there's no like tingle
or feeling like that it's just making
your lips seem fuller just by the way it
looks not any chemical reaction
happening there so I really was pleased
with this this was three dollars and I
like it a lot something I didn't like so
much are the new elf lotion wipes it
says to hide
and moisturize the skin and I have them
in vanilla and coconut so they come in
one of these little containers sort of
like you would get face wipes in and it
says infused with aloe cocoa butter
vitamin E soy ginkgo biloba coconut milk
and sweet almond oil to revitalize and
nourish the skin um I don't really like
the scent of these first off and that's
kind of a sticking point for me in terms
of lotions I want it to smell good and
it smells kind of like has sort of a
chemical type scent I can't quite put my
finger on it it's a little bit coconut
but not much pull it out of there they
just come out like that and it really
just feels like I'm taking like a wet
ones white and just putting that on
it feels slick it feels a little bit
greasy there it's not like if you were
to squeeze this creamy lotion it would
come out you know it's just like a wet
wipe that might feel kind of refreshing
if like you kept these in your fridge
and then you were hot and you came home
and you put one on but I mean it really
just doesn't feel that hydrating it
feels just kind of slick and it doesn't
immediately absorb into the skin
um I can't quite put my finger on it but
I'm not a fan of these I wouldn't really
recommend them if you want to get lotion
get lotion that would be my tip another
studio thing I got was the small stipple
brush and as you can see it's small it's
not very big it's kind of short and I
could see you using this in a lot of
different ways and for like a light
application maybe a highlight or you
could maybe use it to blend out
concealer or blend out smaller portions
of your face as opposed to using like a
full-sized stippling brush so this is
compared to like my Sigma one so far I
have just used this to highlight and get
just that really light amount of product
on your skin but I imagine there are
other ways you could use it if you have
it and want to recommend something to me
feel free but again that's called the
small stipple brush and it's from the
studio line also got kind of a handy
thing I think I used to have one of
these from Revlon but it's the makeup
remover pen and so I think this is a
Studio line product it has a nice tight
cap which is good to see because you
don't want this stuff drying out but
basically you
take this little marker looking thing
and you can easily correct and eyeliner
mistake a smudge of any kind if you were
gonna use this and like take it in your
purse to fix maybe he say your eyeliner
gets a little smeared throughout the day
you know go over it with this but then
maybe blot over that with q-tips so that
way you don't have any residue baked
products I have the baked blush in
passion pink I just have one of the
blushes and that's what that looks like
it's really kind of like a soft peach
but I don't know if you can tell but
there are some swirls of brighter pink
in there I'm wearing it today it's a
pretty soft blush it does have a little
bit of a pearlescent Sheen to it so if
you don't like frosty blushes maybe
steer clear of this one but if you do
want to use it as kind of like that
blush slash highlight I think it can be
really pretty but I enjoy this blush the
packaging is a little bit flimsy feeling
I mean I'm wondering if this is maybe
gonna break it just seems extremely
lightweight and I felt that way about
the eyeshadows as well obviously it's
still intact right now so I can't say
for sure I have three of the baked
eyeshadows so I will swatch those for
you here I have pixie which is kind of a
light pink with a little bit of an
iridescent shimmer I have kind of a plum
color called burnt plum and this is sort
of like a deep plum deep burgundy color
and then I have a brown that's called
BARC and that's what that one looks like
so as you can see these are all kind of
like that domed baked concept you could
wear these wet or wear them dry or kind
of a metallic look and I actually like
these three together and this is pixie
this is Burt plum and this is bark bark
comes off as sort of a metallic medium
brown that pretty burgundy plum which I
love I love that kind of color and it
looks beautiful blended up through the
crease and then pick see this light kind
of shimmery pink I'm pretty pleased with
these as far as elf eyeshadows go I mean
I like all three of you know that
sometimes elf eyeshadows can be kind of
hitting
this evenin those little like $1 quads
you know maybe you like these two shades
and not another one or they're they're
32 pallets it's hard for me to really
like every single shade but I just
randomly got three of these and I happen
to like them not only just the way they
happen to look together but I like the
texture it's not a really um like flaky
powdery texture
it really feels kind of like buttery
creamy almost and as you can see that
was more than enough product to get a
really pigmented swatch there on my
finger so from the studio line I'm
something I haven't tried yet but it was
recommended to me I got the eyebrow
lifter and filler so one side is going
to be this it says ivory here it's just
like a really light kind of skin toned
I'm using my left hand to draw a swatch
on talented it's right here and it's
just like I said skin tone peachy sort
of color and then the other side is
obviously what you're gonna fill your
brow with it has the sharpener kind of
built into the cap and I have it in the
shade dark so that's gonna be a deep
brown let's see if I can swatch it again
there we go alright it's right there so
yeah it feels pretty soft and creamy I'm
gonna see how it works on my brows you
know sometime this week I'll test it out
see if it lasts and goes on smooth and
looks natural and stuff but I just
wanted to tell you about that I've got a
really pretty hyper shine gloss in the
shade bear I love this color Li do like
the hyper shine glosses and this shade
is very pretty it's kind of a golden
peach it's how I describe it so really
reflective it looks nice alone on the
lips I've worn it over sort of a nude
lipstick and it's very pretty that way
too but just a dollar look that can't
beat that it also is the kind in case
you're not familiar it clicks up through
the brush there I got to cover
everything concealer in light I haven't
used this yet I have swatched it it
seems to be a pretty good texture I
gotta say I'm interested to try this on
my face and see how that works but
there's a swatch of the light
they're obviously you'd wear it much
more sheer doubt and stuff but we'll see
how that one goes you know they took
those little blushes remember the ones
that are real small and they kind of
slide open those for a dollar they've
raised the price by two dollars and
change the packaging they've given you a
little brush that I know I won't use I
tell you I'm not a snob to sponge tips
but teeny-tiny blush brushes like this I
don't see the point they give you a
little mirror in here now too
this shade is called blushing giving an
up-close look at it it's a pink with
kind of like gold sparkle when you
swatch it with your finger it seems
super light it seems even lighter and
the swatch than it does on here so I
haven't used that yet but I will finally
I got one of their flawless eyeshadow
quads in tantalising taupe and this
one's new to me and it did arrive with
that top one broken there what you get
in here are two matte shades the
lightest and the darkest are matte the
shades in the middle are a little bit
shimmery and I haven't tried any kinds
of any other quads like this before but
that's what they look like
so seems to be pretty good in terms of
the shimmery shades and this matte color
light ones just kind of light it remind
me a lot of the texture of a lot of the
shadows in those 36 palettes you know
the ones with the warm shades or
whatever it might be so we'll see how
that goes so that wraps it up for my ELF
whole like I said a lot of studio
products about half the stuff I've tried
in half I'm still working on right now
far pretty impressed with the baked
products and loved the pelt Perfector
this little brush I think is actually
really good quality and that will make
up remover pen what a great thing to
have with you when you're traveling or
on the go so thank you so much for
taking time to watch guys and I will see
you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
