today I join you with a little elf haul
I guess it's kind of a big elf oh I feel
like I came out with quite a few things
off of elfs website here recently just
noticed a lot of new products and things
I was interested in reviewing and just
some things that I thought would be
useful to my viewers we all have a lot
of swatches in this video and I do plan
to try these things more and more in
review a lot of them for you first off
things I wanted to try were these new
mineral pearls and these are those
things that are supposedly being
compared to the girl on meteorites
I know Physicians Formula has come out
with stuff like this as well they come
in two shades I got the skin balancing
which is this kind of multicolored
pastel looking set and then also natural
pearls come inside a tiny little plastic
baggie and you just empty them in there
the top screws off and I definitely want
to leave the puff in there it kind of
packs them down like not too tightly but
keeps them from moving around a whole
lot and then you can take it out and
there's the pearls I've already learned
once the smoke thing that if I dip it
too far forward I will lose all the
pearls so I've used the skin balancing
as kind of like an all-over foundation
setting powder also like an under eye
setting powder and it kind of surprised
me how much product like if I just grab
a little brush here here's the elf small
tapered brush if you like dab your brush
over this stuff how much product it
really picks up like I thought they
would be I don't know a little less
powdery it's like how are you gonna
scrub across them and pick anything up
but I mean your brush really easily does
pick up product I don't really think I'm
going to like to use the puff with these
I noticed a major like skin balancing
corrective type thing but it did mattify
kind of nice then the other one is the
natural so this is a mix of like bronzy
colored golden and pinky cream beads
like the other one I was surprised at
how much a brush just being lightly
tapped into this will actually pick up
notice a lot of color translating onto
my face with this though I mean it's
kind of like too light for me to be a
bronzer so it ends up being made
just more of a skintone type powder on
me but interesting to see elf come out
with a product like this and since it is
part of the mineral line it says the
vitamin A B C and E infused formula
conditions and hydrates the skin for a
soft silky feel so I will keep trying
those for you another thing from the
mineral line that I wanted to check out
is the pressed mineral foundation I got
it in the shade beige it is a pretty
good skin tone match for me it comes
with a little puff there and I have had
such good luck with some of these
different pressed mineral products I've
liked the press mineral eye shadows the
blushes the bronzers I think they've
really just got a great creamy very
high-end feeling formula and I must say
this powder foundation is no exception
it feels so nice and smooth it was such
a rich kind of creamy type texture to it
and so I thought it was going to be
really really good coverage and I used
it the other day just on top of like my
primer I didn't have any foundation
underneath and I wasn't that thrilled
with the coverage it gave I thought it
was a definite like medium coverage that
I was getting all over my skin today I
used this as more of just a setting
powder over a foundation and I was
really really pleased with the way it
came on well it mattifies it doesn't
look too dry it kind of reminds me of
the NYX stay matte but not flat powder
foundations so I think I'm gonna enjoy
this one elf has now come out with a
blending brush what their studio line
was really excited to see this because
of the shape is sort of pinched aspect
here toward the top of the ferrule I
thought it was gonna be a lot like my
Sigma e25 actually it's quite a bit
flatter than that it's really nice and
soft and has a nice tapered like cut to
it I think this is gonna serve a purpose
for me I'm just gonna have to mess with
it some more to figure out exactly what
so I'll keep you posted on that a couple
of things that I've never tried before
from the studio line it's the lip liner
and blending brush so I got these in a
couple colors one is nude pink and so
you've got a retractable lip liner on
one end and then kind of like a lot of
high-end brands like I know Lancome and
Estee Lauder I've seen will give you a
lip liner that has a little brush it
thing I think that's kind of a nice
to have particularly if you really love
that particular shade of liner and you
want to kind of blend it out and and
fade it in all over your lip it's nude
pink shade is really pretty I think the
name nude pink is just a perfect
description of it if you like kind of a
matte pinky nude lip you could just wear
this on its own these are creamy liners
I think it's pretty easy to fill in my
entire lips with that I also got natural
and this one's a little bit deeper kind
of a spice type colored lip liner I
randomly lost a lip liner that I loved
so much and it's my Too Faced perfect
lips liner in perfect spice and so it's
kind of looking for a replacement for
that and this does appear to be very
close I love lip liners of this tone I'm
paired with a nude lips been getting a
lot of questions about lip liners lately
so I thought it'd be fun to try a couple
from else also if you saw my favorite
matte lipsticks video that I posted
recently I said I intend to buy some
more of these elf matte lip colors so I
did just that the one that I mentioned
in that video is called coral I already
have one in the red shade and I think
also T rose that's what I hadn't ordered
the couple that I did not already have
and they are nearly nude and pralines so
I am wearing a combination of both of
these today if you're not familiar with
these I love the format I mean it's
skinnier than a lot of the jumbo pencils
but yet it's like two to three times as
thick as a typical lip liner and I don't
know if I pointed this out in the other
video I don't think I did but the end
pops off and you've got a little
sharpener so you can kind of make sure
you keep that perfected pointed tip to
this product as you continue to use it
but if you're into matte lip colors
these are so affordable and so
comfortable on the lips so I use this
nearly nude shade mainly unlike the
center part of my lips and I think it's
just a great classic nude color very
very happy with that and a lot of nudes
you know especially matte nudes like
it's really got to be a color I enjoy
for me to want to wear that without
adding in you know a gloss on top to
freshen it up so I'm very pleased with
the way that comes on I think a fun way
to give the lips a little extra
dimension is taking a deeper shade like
this one and praline
and I just added that kind of on the
there I go drawing on my lips again but
I added it kind of on the outer corner
he's really blended it in so you can't
see where like one shade stops and the
next begins but those two work really
really nicely together something else
under the new section of eyes lips face
calm that's what I always check by the
way to see if there's any new things
that have come out recently and it seems
like they're almost always is something
they're like as soon as I do this haul
there will probably be five new products
on elfs website but this is the
hydrating under eye primer kind of cute
packaging here it's got a little pump
you know but it's still very compact
size-wise and when I pump this out it
has kind of this light pinky appearance
I mean this just feels like an
additional eye cream when I put it on
doesn't go to that really silky smooth
state that some face primers do but to
me it feels a lot like my Clinique all
about eyes which is kind of the eye
cream that I usually start my day with I
want to try this some more and
ultimately compare it to my Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating under eye primer
and do a little face-off between those
and I wanted to show you a couple other
things that I stumbled across under the
beauty school section of the website
which seems like a lot of palettes and
little sets kind of maybe a
back-to-school theme with some of this
and one of the things I got is this it
came in a little box and it's eight
dollars it says 18 piece
eyeshadow palette we've seen a lot of
the elf eyeshadow palettes that have
like all the little squares but I
thought oh this is this caught my eye it
looks a little bit different so this is
what the palette looks like kind of
matte black packaging it does come with
a brush in here it's like a little
angled eyeshadow brush big mirror but
check out the eye shadows really
pleasantly surprised with this one a lot
of like satin finish kind of borderline
matte colors across the top really
really highly shimmery shades in the
second row and then kind of a mix of
some metallic and just lightly shimmery
shades on the bottom it's a really nice
neutral palette and as you see it all
swatched out I mean some of these
shimmery shades have just a beautiful
texture this is the other day and did
not experience much fallout with any of
these
actually you know what this kind of
reminds me of and a roundabout way it
reminds me of my two-faced romantic eye
palette which I love because it's got
this totally random spring green color
and also a little bit of lilac going on
in this palette as well as a gorgeous
rose gold in here some great Browns that
are kind of matte up that only use this
once was really happy with the look I
did the other day but I've got to
experiment with this some more and see
what else it can do but eight bucks very
pleased with this another thing that I
got for six dollars I know got a love
elfs website but it's the back pack
total face kit and I was kind of on the
fence about this I'm like you know is
this really gonna be worth trying but
then I thought I'm gonna kick myself if
I don't go ahead and try this out
because you just never know always
seeking out those diamond in the rough
kind of products and I thought this
might just be one of them so it's got a
little palette that's very compact and a
little lip gloss and a mascara so first
off the baby palette it's so like
compact size-wise you see it next to my
phone it's like so little it does have a
totally decent sized usable mirror there
are eight shadows in here and I was kind
of surprised at how smoky they are I
mean you can do some downright dramatic
eye makeup with this color palette so if
you want to take it very literally and
say okay this is what you're gonna keep
in your backpacks is something you might
use for school type looks it might be a
little dramatic for that but as far as
the way they swatch out they swatch
beautifully I haven't used this yet on
my eyes but I'm impressed with how they
look in the swatch it's got that little
trapdoor underneath with kind of a
neutral peachy blush for things that
seem kind of like Preston glosses they
have a very shiny finish Reds pinks
peachy tones there and in addition to
the little palette you get a lengthening
and defining mascara which I have tried
before from elf haven't been a huge fan
it kind of reminds me of like a
Maybelline Great Lash both in the style
of the brush and the formula it has been
a while since I've used this kind of
mascara so I'll have to try it again to
refresh my memory fully and then you've
got the lip color just a mini lip gloss
in a creamy pink
mine's me of the kinds of glosses that
they've been throwing in those little
like Disney themed kits like the Disney
Villains kit and stuff like that
nice pigmentation with it very full
color only swatch this kit so far but I
thought you know that might make a fun
little tutorial get ready with me some
kind of demo you know showing how that
all comes together that is my ELF haul I
hope you enjoyed it if anything really
caught your eye please let me know in
the comments section like what you're
most interested in seeing reviews and
tutorials on I just think hulls are a
great way to kind of gauge people's
interest in certain things that I'm
trying out so I appreciate you guys
taking time to watch and I'll see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
