thought we could have a little chat
today about some new products that I got
from Ulta recently I try to keep up with
these haul videos but I know there are
always some things that kind of slip
through the cracks don't get mentioned
in a haul but I just wanted to share a
little bit about these products today
there are some things I'm really excited
about so let's jump in I'm gonna have a
drink of my oh I just realized like I
look at this coffee mug and my denim
shirt I feel very Pioneer Woman ish
today a couple things that I ordered and
these looks so fun look at these face
masks yes I think they are supposed to
look like those animal faces I got the
otter face mask and the brightening
panda face mask so maybe the entire can
do these or my friend Kelly's coming to
visit maybe she'll want to get in on
this with me but look at how fun those
are the brand is SNP shining nature
purity and I think they had some other
kinds too I think what I need to do is
host a spa themed party everybody gets a
face mask and then we all play palette
bingo that's how that'll go who wants to
come I will most definitely be taking
some pictures or some snaps with these
puppies on so you can see what they look
like another skincare thing that I found
online
were these CeraVe makeup removing
cleanser cloths they say ultra gentle
and gently removes dirt oil even
waterproof mascara and they have a
little label as being accepted by the
National eczema Association so that's
always a good thing oh well I adore
CeraVe and I have had a lot of luck with
different skincare items they have they
are up against like one of my most holy
grail beauty items period which are the
Olay or the equate daily face wash
cloths that you just you know moisten
with water they're dry and then they
sets up and you can remove all your
makeup
I love removing every stitch of makeup
on my face with those so will these
measure up that remains to be seen so I
will try these and let you know another
little skincare thing that I still need
to try is this Shea Moisture coconut and
hibiscus radiance facial mask
I have smelled this scent this coconut
and hibiscus scent in different body
products that they have and I haven't
taken the plunge yet and bought any of
those
I'm loaded on body wash at the moment
but the scent is so good and I saw
online that they came out with a face
mask and it says with sunji mushroom for
dull skin so we'll see how this goes but
it smells it has that delicious floral
but kind of tropical scent it's so good
I'm gonna need to do a big old like
skincare update or maybe like a favorite
face masks video if anybody's interested
in that another thing that I got is an
eyeshadow palette from NYX they've got
these palettes that say NYX ultimate on
them and this is the one labeled warm
neutrals I was thinking about getting
multiples and then I thought you know
maybe just get one and see how the
quality is because sometimes it's hit
and miss you know with these NYX
palettes I've had some like the Almonte
pop palettes and the little like
everyday palettes that have the blush
and the bronzer and highlight in there
as well and the quality of the shadows
and those palettes is just amazing and
then you'll find some other things and
it's just kind of like AI kind of hit
and miss and I feel like some of these
are hitting misses well certain ones are
absolutely gorgeous NYX is doing a great
job with like reddish shades deep math's
seem to be really good some of the
lighter mattes seem a little bit more on
the sheer side but you really you can't
judge a palette just by the swatches so
I'm gonna need to apply these first
really see them in action before I can
give some definitive opinions now while
I was in my local alte store just last
weekend I did not expect to find this
item it's been sold out on like
Sephora's website oldest website
two-faced website but then they actually
had it in stock in my oldest store and
it's the Too Faced peach palette I
really convinced myself I didn't need it
the reason why I went ahead and got it
was so I could compare it to some other
things and so people who are interested
in this but can't get their hands on it
anymore can have some alternatives
because I've got something from makeup
revolution that I talked about on
snapchat recently it's called the
neutrals versus neutrals palette and
it's got some similarities to this not
every shade is a dead-on dupe but there
are some close things happening there
and there are some gorgeous shades in
here I mean I think it's a really pretty
palette it's kind of strange to me that
there's not
than more peachy tone things happening
just because like there are several and
I mean how many peach shadows do you
need I don't know but there is a little
splash of purple in this palette a
little bit of green I'm excited to play
around with it but I really do think
I'll be able to come up with some things
that you may be interested in that costs
less and can give you similar looks now
I've got a whole lot of makeup
revolution to talk about I got a couple
of their vivid baked blushes so
everything I've tried blush wise from
makeup revolution has been in a palette
form so far but they've got these they
kind of look like maybe a Milani blush
at a glance just that baked style and
this is in the shade baked blusher bang
bang you're dead it's a little extreme
don't you think but it's a nice cool
pink and then the one that I'm wearing
today is called make love instead so
warm pink kind of peachy pink versus
cool pink here I think I'll add a little
bit more really pretty shade though it
has a nice Sheen to it in that nice
mmm yes I'm digging on this one this
one's gonna be a nice I think summertime
blush for me I'll give you a couple
little swatches here so you can just see
the difference in tone
lots of Sheen they're definitely blushes
that take on a very brightened look when
they catch the light but then when
they're not they start to look a little
bit deeper that's why I kind of like
applying them choose just maybe a hair
lower than the actual apple of the cheek
and I think they give a really pretty
effect that way I also got a couple of
these blush sticks I got the one blush
stick and the one highlight contour
stick so this highlight one I was
wearing this on snapchat recently and
when i swatched it I thought you know
I'm not I don't know it doesn't seem
like anything that major but on the skin
it's so beautiful and glowy I'm already
wearing another highlight today but
what's stopping me from layering product
over product huh
a little bit of this a little bit of
extra glow
it's capable of a pretty darn intense
glow and if you can you imagine if you
took this and then you topped it off
with a little bit of like a powder
really shimmery powder highlight you
would just be I also really like the
blush stick too of course they can't put
the shade name on the bottom it's called
matte rush so it's kind of a warm
reddish orange shade and it's actually
really beautiful on the lips or the
cheeks I was wearing this recently as
well really nice and creamy easy to work
with
super pigmented to me this is like
summertime color in a stick you know
what I'm saying it's coral it's bright
but yet it's got a little depth to it so
yeah if I were makeup revolution I would
market this thing as summer in a stick
because that's the color tone that I
think of outside of the bronze is kind
of neutral tones you know this is the
color that I think of when I think
summer and makeup and so then you know I
just kind of blend it out on my hand and
I just look like I've got a little
reddish rash going on that's how I go
about my day like in public is always
like partially rubbed off swatches
because I'm constantly swatching okay
more blush and we're getting into makeup
revolution palettes now I've got easily
over a dozen makeup revolution palettes
like a huge video we are on the cusp of
it I've said it like five times but I am
really it's taken a long time to truly
familiarize myself with all of these
products and give them the trial and
error that I think they're due because
they're definitely so far have been some
soso things not everything is just an
automatic homerun but there have been
some great makeup revolution palettes
too but I saw this blush palette it says
blush palette melts and they are all
creams and so far I gotta say I'm not
really loving them not that I need like
the thickest richest texture for a blush
you know for it to work for me I think a
lighter texture can still be fine but
they feel really really greasy to the
touch so far I think the only one I have
worn has been this kind of deep coral
shade there and that actually seems a
little bit thicker than some of them so
I don't know that they're all an
identical texture and a little concerned
what would happen to these on
skin because they just do feel so
slippery to begin with but truly as I
look at my blush stick that I have my
matte rush here like this texture is
very different from what's in the
palette it's a little bit thicker but
it's still really creamy and easy to
blend out and if I could only keep one I
would definitely just stay with the
blush stick the blush stick I would keep
the blush stick a couple of other blush
palettes I have blush palette Queen and
blush palette goddess blush palette
Queen first off it is all shimmer all
the time
and frankly a lot of these shades look
very similar they're pretty like I love
just looking at the the marbled look
here don't you feel like you're looking
at like a satellite image of Earth if
the earth was pink the bottom line on
this palette is light pinkish or pinky
peach shimmery blushes and they invited
one wild friend along that's a little
bit deeper it's one of those situations
where yeah they're pretty but does it
constitute having a palette full of
eight shades could a duo or trio have
just as easily gotten the job done and
basically given me you know several
different colors to work with the blush
palette goddess yes this this is where
it's all happening here because
everything in here is something unique
doing something different I think
everything in this palette has earned
its spot you know you've got four matte
blushes and four different kinds of
highlights the highlights really vary in
tone and intensity and I love that like
having options where that's concerned
and then the blush is you know you can
bounce around you can mix them you can
you know layer different colors over
others but it's peached and kind of
neutral almost like barely their color
to a light cool pink and then a deeper
pink so there's a lot of variety and
nice quality in this palette so if
you're a blush and highlight junkie I
think you'll enjoy I also picked up an
eye palette this is the redemption
palette iconic elements and what I think
this is is sort of makeup Revolutions
take on the Urban Decay Naked basics 1 &amp;amp;
2 anyone went away in there because it's
almost all matte except for one shade
that's pretty shimmery today I put let's
see this like second-to-last dark matte
brown in the crease along with this
shade right here I used the shimmering
color and one of the other light colors
on the inner part of the lid and was
there anything else like that am i
taking this peach color and use that to
kind of help me blend things out and it
was really nice I enjoyed working with
the shade it's for the most part a very
cool matte palette it's not really going
toward those rusty or reddish Browns and
stuff like that so if that's what you're
into this might be worth checking out I
got the Almay one coat multi benefit
mascara it has nothing to do with the
fact that Carrie Underwood is the
spokesperson and the one doing all the
ads on TV for this thing or maybe it
does the brush it reminds me so much of
L'Oreal voluminous it's just you know a
full brush it's kind of on the big side
and for me it's okay it's good but not
great
it definitely holds the curl better than
voluminous does it lengthens alright I
feel like the blood the blush the brush
can get a little bit overloaded with
product and I have to spend some time
kind of working some of that off good
about holding the curl like I said it
also I was able to wear this on my lower
lashes with no smudging or smearing so
that was nice also I think the AL my
mascaras tend to be pretty good for
sensitive eyes I suspect I'm gonna like
this more as it gets a little bit older
like a few weeks in because I've only
been using it for a solid week now and
the problems I'm having with you know
the brush feeling very overloaded with
product that will probably start to work
itself out with a little more time but
holding the curl for me that is a very
important thing so I'm excited to see
that one other thing that I'll just
throw into this hole I did get that
Mally today's special value that was on
QVC a few days back and it's called The
Good Life hand-picked essentials so it
came in that box she got the makeup bag
and a bunch of different products to try
she has some it looks like a revamped
formula on her shadow sticks so that was
a big reason why I wanted to get this
there's smoky quartz which is kind of
like a Mavi taupe type shade and then
the other one you get is a very bright
in color you could do some sandwich
method with those for sure I was wearing
these I think it was over the weekend
and they've go on really easily seems
like there's a little more moisture in
these than the regular shadow sticks but
I love the fact that they still set they
don't budge there's a new powder
foundation it's the 4k Ultra HD fantasy
foundation and I thought a couple of
things when I first got it first off
it's dark for me and I got medium and I
guess I just shouldn't be getting me
because I think I got a medium with a
laura geller thing and it turned out to
be too dark as well but like three or
four years ago medium was fine for me
maybe this will be a good summer
foundation who knows it's super soft it
feels great to the touch and when I also
looked at this I thought is is the
product downsized
I mean it's just it's not overly
packaged whatsoever but I thought am I
getting less here and then I looked to
compare it to my it cosmetics
celebration illumination foundation and
you're actually getting more in this
compared to the it cosmetics so it comes
with a really nice feeling brush here
it's stiff it's kind of like a dense duo
fiber brush definitely built to create
some coverage with this product and for
me with it being a little bit on the
dark side currently I'm not gonna want
to probably use this brush with this
product because it's just gonna lay it
on too thick for me for me to make this
work at all I'm gonna have to shear it
out some but I do like that brush and I
might even use it for some liquid
foundations it looks like there is a new
lip product to Molly's line called lip
shellac and it's in the shade cherry
blossom I know there was a cherry
blossom shade with her high shine liquid
lipsticks that click through and so this
is going to be a very shiny full colored
like a soft pink I like that it's not
super light baby pink it's definitely a
wearable pink I was wearing this the
other day it's thick but it has some
staying power to it and has a lot of
shine and then the last thing is the
more is more mascara I really like the
Mallee volumizing mascaras so I wasn't
quite prepared for a new Mally mascara
to count out we're dealing with a brush
that reminds me a lot of benefits
they're real with the little spike ease
on the tip and
rubber bristles it was pretty good it
built a lot of length it did it pretty
quickly
I have only used it once so far so it's
gonna take some more use before I can
really chat about that a whole lot but I
just wanted to show you that was the TSV
and i'll be using that and working some
of those products into my routine but
thank you guys so much for watching this
haul I hope it was fun for you and I
will see you again in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
