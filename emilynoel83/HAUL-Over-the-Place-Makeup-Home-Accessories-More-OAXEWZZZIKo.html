a hole that I'm calling all over the
place because it is from a lot of
different places and it's a little bit
random so I'm gonna start off I got to
just mention this right off the bat
these earrings that I got from Target
how cute are those yeah those are cat
ears on their foot not everybody is
necessarily like a pearl girl but I love
the big oversized pearls and you stick
some cat ears on there and I'm all about
it so I think those were around like
five or six bucks maybe at Target and
they were just a you know no question
about it must buy and then also while at
Target I got this little set of studs
and if we can get a focus here focus um
you've got six different pairs and it
ranges from like your little pearls just
a silver stud these are kind of like a
faceted really uh power just went out
and came back on hello okay back to the
hall you can see they're like really
just dazzling because of all the little
I think it's called facets that are in
there all the different cuts on it then
there's a really cool little um well I'd
say they're more like a jumbo-sized
princess cut stud that's got actually
like a yellowish tint to it which is
like nothing I own look at these little
guys I think they're like little
cupcakes aren't those cute with some
gold on there and then these are the
ones I've been wearing recently hollow
really jumbo sized so pretty with you
know other gold jewelry so definitely
ran into some cute accessories at Target
they had a bunch of sales stuff to just
accessory-wise so I picked up this um
infinity scarf tell you exactly what it
is and it's cute I thought this would be
great for fall it's like a t-shirt
material so really comfortable you know
not at all scratchy to wear around your
neck but it's got this cute gold studing
going on there it doesn't go all the way
through hopefully these don't just
off over time I got this for around
seven bucks most of the scarves were I
mean even close to $20 I think so I
thought this was a really good deal and
the type of scarf that I could wear with
so many different things and pop on some
of these earrings with it and you got a
really good look right okay while at
Target um that's one of the only places
where I've seen the L'Oreal color riche
lament and the lilac which I think I
showed the lilac one that I got in
another hall you can expect to see
reviews on these individually on my
beauty broadcast express channel for
just reviews five days a week subscribe
if you haven't this one's the Matt and
so I got it I'm wearing it today I word
a couple days ago as well and was
astonished by the staying power if this
is just like one pass over them but when
I really laid it on thick a couple days
ago my lips just felt a little more
hydrated like that but it is matte so
it's not gonna be one of those real
slick products but I love this color the
shade is matte for me 409 I'm like how
its twists up and you've got a lot of
precision with that tip you can expect a
full review again on my other channel
with this but really pretty color berry
but a little bit bright you know it kind
of plays off of what I've got on my
dress here with these flowers so I'm
diggin it also from target a couple
Sonia Kashuk things you guys know I'm
loving the shine luck sheers right those
are you know the lip products shaped
like this kind of like a lipstick but so
shiny like the opposite of this kind of
matte lipstick you put one of these on
it looks like you've put on both a
lipstick and a gloss so really cool
definitely right up my alley and this
one that I got that's new is or that's
new to me is sheer sheer seashell sear
sheer seashell sheer seashell seriously
sheer seashell I think I actually said
it right one time in there but for some
reason felt the need to keep repeating
it this is a real golden e color shall i
swatch um really shiny definitely the
lightest one Oh
TV came back on mute daddy how shiny and
kind of light it is and I wanted to show
you compared to the one in sheer pink
lust which
in this one's going down fast plus I got
a huge gash in it but see how this one's
so much more golden this has much more
pink tone in it so if you're trying to
decide between the lighter tones um
that's the difference and this one um
this shear seashell has some shimmer in
it I think it's a pretty shade the
deeper shades the plum and there's a
fuchsia that's gorgeous too so give
those a look especially if you like
shiny kind of one-step lip product so I
wanted to try out one of Sonia Kashuk
concealer sticks I've got the hidden
agenda palette which I do enjoy um it
looks like this it's got three cream
concealers plus a setting powder but I
wanted to see how well her sticks would
do and so they had him in several
different shades like different kinds of
light so there was one that was the
lightest and it seemed to be a little
more yellow toned and then this one
called daylight that seemed to have more
of a pink undertone to it so I was
thinking you know maybe that would be
really a really good brightener for
under the eye and I must say ever since
I've started using this I haven't
stopped and I love the coverage on this
definitely really rich and creamy for a
stick concealer I compared it
consistency wise kind of to the UM the
covergirl plus ol a concealer bomb that
I love only this might be just a little
bit thicker a little more coverage
packed into this I'm loving it while
we're on the makeup stuff why don't I
just continue with that this little trio
is from NYC and I know I've done a video
with a couple of the NYC trios that look
like this that I have and I did a little
tutorial and you know all in all they
were workable but not like my favorite
drugstore eyeshadows by any means but
Kristin game had been a video to where
she has a lot of these trios and she was
showing different looks with them and I
really liked the one in bronzed in
Brooklyn and I think this was one of her
top picks as well and you know these
aren't as rich as like a wet and wild
eyes shadow trio but Kristen had made a
good point that that's not always what a
beginner once you know sometimes those
dark really really pigmented shades can
be a little unmanageable if you're not
used to working with that type of thing
and so
you know I found it very easy to use I'm
wearing it today I'm rocking the brown
blended it out with a little bit of
bronze got the highlight shade working
for me up top so enjoying it definitely
I would agree with Kristin this is
probably one of the better trios of the
NYC bunch and there's some swatches for
you you can see that bronze you know a
little bit metallic Brown and the pearl
are kind of a little bit satiny finish
wouldn't they look nice with that gold
any colored lip product - yeah another
Walmart thing that I picked up and I saw
this in a display kind of in the aisle
that doesn't necessarily mean that this
is new I'm not sure but it's one of
these color riche bombs and plush plum
and I had one or two of these in lighter
shades and I really wasn't that cracked
up about him you know I was kind of like
okay there another shear tend to the lip
balm they weren't bad I mean they felt
moisturizing on my lips but it wasn't
anything like to write home about
because I'm always writing home about
tinted lip balms but this one I thought
oh that looks deeper I want to see you
know if I like this better and I gotta
say I'm having great luck with the stuff
that I've been home lately I like this -
let me swatch this this is a very pretty
color check that out if I would have
already had this that might have made it
into my top fall lipsticks video wise
these remind me a little bit of the
Revlon lip butters and shade wise this
particular one plush plum kind of like
Revlon sugarplum i've swatched them here
there's the plush plum and there's sugar
plum you can see sugar plums like maybe
a little more neutral in anyway just
wanted to give you a little frame of
reference there in case you already had
one and we're wondering about the other
but I am enjoying this I think it's a
really nice color
so at Walmart found this new mascara
this is from L'Oreal it says lash out
butterfly butt and it says that on the
tube I'm pretty sure the packaging said
voluminous butterfly but whatever the
case may be there's a butterfly involved
and the brush is kind of interesting I'm
actually kind of loving this style of
brush in other mascaras too but it's
where you've got really short bristles
on one side so that would be the top and
then if I can get in real close HD baby
then you can see the longer bristles
there on the bottom so this is nice the
shorter side is nice for getting some
product on those lashes and then you can
use the longer side to kind of comb them
out and this is probably going to be
hard to show unless the light hits this
just right but there's like two tracks
of longer bristles that make you think
kind of wings that's probably where this
butterfly things coming from like
together at the tip and then separating
and I could try all day to see whether
this is gonna show up for you but I do
plan to do a full review on this I've
only used it a couple times so far and
like I said a cool design with the brush
I like the thought that it's kind of
your application of mascara plus a lash
comb built right my first impressions on
mascaras can change so much over the
course of like a week as I learn little
tricks for how to use it best so keep an
eye out for more on this finally ordered
an urban decay lipstick I got mine from
Ulta so many of you said you got to try
these swatch him for us tell us what you
think and this the shadows is called
manic and so many of them looked
gorgeous on the website like I probably
could have just closed my eyes and
pointed to one and liked what I would
have ended up getting shade wise but
this color I kind of thought fall of
course a little bit deeper rosy color
it's not real pinky it's a little bit
more on the red side definitely a deep
rosy red when long wearing really
intense on the lid you need to put that
through like you know some food tests
and some cup tenses honestly the first
day I used it I put it on with the full
intention of keeping an eye on it and
then by the end of the day forgot how it
worked watch my face and I was like oh
yeah that lipstick you were this is a
whole lot of review so that's the Urban
Decay lipstick this was all over the
place right I went to Big Lots and I got
some soft lips haven't used these in a
really long time but saw the deal and
couldn't pass it up a buck fifty for two
of these and they're the tinted ones one
is pink and one
bronze and I believe they both have an
SPF 15 in there yep one sweet and one is
sultry this seemed kind of cool this was
a bit more pricey for the one at just
two dollars and 20 cents but soft lips
coral gloss sheer lip protectant SPF 10
so this actually a gloss let's bust this
one open and see what this is actually
well I definitely coral see how much
more orange e that is than all the rest
pretty sheer smells decent it smells
kind of vanilla II kind of like a Mac
lip product got a couple things from
Hobby Lobby and then Victoria see I am a
fan of the bombshell scent I have a
little size of that and I really like it
and so when I saw that there was a body
mist I was totally into it because it's
kind of a strong scent you know and so
this body mist sort of it you know
you're still getting that scent but
maybe not quite as extra thing I got was
the pink warm and cozy body mist it says
toasted vanilla and peony and then this
one which I used years and years ago is
very sexy and that's the body mist as
well so just working in a little variety
with my sense there they all smell
amazing and then it had been a long time
since I checked out the beauty stuff
kind of near the checkout at Victoria's
Secret and there was of course a deal
going on that as well so I got one of
these shiny kiss flavored glosses this
is decadent berry
and these used to be called Beauty rush
the last time I was there shows how
often I go to Victoria's Secret but
let's see there's that a really soft
shimmery pink and then this is a glossy
tint lip Sheen jumbo pencil red it seems
really light and very like slick and
shiny so there's that and you can see
quite a bit brighter than some of these
deeper plum and berry colors down here
also and I haven't tried these yet so I
can't review them for you yet but I got
a couple of these I trios this one's in
secret weapon and we've got here classic
fall neutrals
like a champagne a taupe color and then
a mossy green there's some swatches just
real quick on my fingers and then there
they are on my hand they seem a little
powdery but I don't know you guys kind
of got to use them on your eye before
you can really make a determination
funny how those are gonna work and then
the other ones are purples pinky pearly
shade a taupe that's got a little bit of
purple in it and then a real deep purple
or so it's right there love in that
middle shade nice and then when I
checked out the girl says oh you
qualified to get the last one of our
tote bags and so it's a little quilted
bag it says Victoria's Secret down there
I think it's pretty cute it's really
lightweight finally Hobby Lobby fall is
one of my favorite times to decorate and
all the fall stuff this past weekend was
like 40 or 50 percent off so great deals
there I got this cool little like burlap
ribbon that has leaves all around it and
I've got a couple little things set up
in my entryway I wanted to see if I
could cut some of this and maybe like
rope it through some of my display I'm
not really sure yet but it just caught
my eye about half price it was
originally like 15 bucks and then these
cute little guys look at these little
pumpkins little hollow pumpkins they're
a little bit heavy but they're
definitely not like any sort of wrought
iron type thing I don't know what
they're made out of exactly but I just
thought those were so cute and I've got
like one thing on either side of the
entryway a little stand so I thought
those could go in there too
how cute thanks so much for watching
