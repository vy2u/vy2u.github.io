hole a hole that I'm calling all over
the place because it is from a lot of
different places and it's a little bit
random so I'm gonna start off I got to
just mention this right off the bat
these earrings that i got from Target
how cute are those yeah those are cat
ears on their face not everybody is
necessarily like a pearl girl but I love
the big oversized pearls and you stick
some cat ears on there and I'm all about
it so I think those were around like
five or six bucks maybe a target and
they were just a you know no question
about it must buy and then also well it
target I got this little set of studs
and if we can get a focus here focus um
you've got six different pairs and it
ranges from like your little pearls just
a silver stud these are kind of like a
faceted really uh power just went out
and came back on hello okay um back to
the hall you can see they're like really
just dazzling because of all the little
I think it's called facets that are in
there all the different cuts on it um
then there's a really cool little on
well I say they're more like a
jumbo-sized a princess cut stud that's
got actually like a yellowish tint to it
which is like nothing I own look at
these little guys I think they're like
little cupcakes aren't those cute with
some gold on there and then these are
the ones i've been wearing recently
hollow really jumbo sized so pretty with
you know other gold jewelry so
definitely ran into some cute
accessories at tartan they had a bunch
of sales stuff to just accessory wise so
I picked up this infinity scarf tells
you exactly what it is and it's cute I
thought this would be great for full
it's like a t-shirt material so really
comfortable you know not at all scratchy
to wear around your neck and but it's
got this cute gold uh studying going on
there it doesn't go all the way through
hopefully these don't just
pop off over time I got this for around
seven bucks most of the scarves were I
mean even close to twenty dollars I
think so I thought this was a really
good deal and the type of scarf that I
could wear with so many different things
and pop on some of these earrings with
it and you got a really good look right
okay while at target um it's one of the
only places where i've seen the l'oreal
colour riche limit and the lalak which i
think i showed the lack one that i got
in another hall you can expect to see
reviews on these individually on my
beauty broadcast expressed channel 4
just reviews five days a week subscribe
if you haven't this one's the mat and so
I got it I'm wearing it today I word a
couple days ago as well and was
astonished by the staying power if this
is just like one pass over them but when
I really laid it on thick a couple days
ago my lips just felt a little more
hydrated like that but it is Matt so
it's not going to be one of those real
slick products but I love this color the
shade is Matt for me 409 I'm like how
its twists up and you've got a lot of
precision with that tip you can expect a
full review again on my other channel
with this but really pretty color Barry
but a little bit bright you know it kind
of plays off of what I've got on my
dress here with these flowers so I'm
digging it also from target a couple
Sonia Kashuk things you guys know I'm
loving the shine luck shears right those
are you know the lip products shaped
like this kind of like a lipstick but so
shiny like the opposite of this kind of
matte lipstick you put one of these on
it looks like you put on both a lipstick
and a gloss so really cool definitely
right up my alley and this one that I
got that's new is or that's new to me is
sheer sheer seashell sear sheer seashell
sheer seashell serious sheer seashell I
think I actually said it right one time
in there but for some reason felt the
need to keep repeating this is a real
golden e color shall I swatch um really
shiny definitely the lightest 10 TV came
back on mute daddy how shiny and kind of
light it is and I wanted to show you
compared to the one in sheer pink lust
which
and this one's going down fast plus I
got a huge gash in it but see how this
one's so much more golden this has much
more pink tone in it so if you're trying
to decide between the lighter tones on
that's the difference and this one um
sheer seashell has some shimmer in it I
think it's a pretty shade the deeper
shades the plum and there's a fuchsia
that's gorgeous too so give those a look
especially if you like shiny kind of one
step lip product thing so I wanted to
try out one of Sonia Kashuk concealer
sticks I've got the hidden agenda
palette which I do enjoy um it looks
like this it's got three cream
concealers plus a setting powder but I
wanted to see how well her sticks would
do and so they had him in several
different shades like different kinds of
light so there was one that was the
lightest and it seemed to be a little
more yellow toned and then this one
called daylight that seemed to have more
of a pink undertone to it so I was
thinking you know maybe that would be
really a really good brightener for
under the eye and I must say ever since
I've started using this I haven't
stopped and I love the coverage on this
definitely really rich and creamy for a
stick concealer I compare it consistency
wise kind of to the UM the covergirl
plus ol a concealer bomb that I love
only this might be just a little bit
thicker a little more coverage packed
into this I'm loving it while we're on
the makeup stuff why don't I just
continue with that this little trio is
from NYC and I know I've done a video
with a couple of the NYC trios that look
like this that i have and i did a little
tutorial and you know all in all they
were workable but not like my favorite
drugstore eyeshadows by any means but
kristen game had been a video to where
she has a lot of these trios and she was
showing different looks with them and i
really liked the one in bronzed in
brooklyn and i think this was one of her
top picks as well and you know these
aren't as rich as like a wet and wild
eyeshadow trio but Kristin made a good
point that that's not always what a
beginner once you know sometimes those
dark really really pigmented shades can
be a little unmanageable if you're not
used to working with that type of thing
and so then
you know I found it very easy to use I'm
wearing it today I'm rocking the brown
blended it out with a little bit of
bronze got the highlight shade working
for me up top so enjoying it definitely
I would agree with Kristen this is
probably one of the better trios of the
NYC bunch and there's some swatches for
you can see that bronze you know a
little bit metallic Brown and the Pearl
are kind of a little bit satiny finish
wouldn't they look nice with that gold
any colored lip product too yeah another
walmart thing that I picked up and I saw
this in a display kind of in the aisle
that doesn't necessarily mean that this
is new i'm not sure but it's one of
these color riche bombs in plush plum
and i had one or two of these in lighter
shades and i really wasn't that cracked
up about him you know I was kind of like
okay there another sheer tinted lip balm
they weren't bad I mean they felt
moisturizing on my lips but it wasn't
anything like to write home about
because I'm always writing home about
tinted lip balms but this one I thought
oh that looks deeper I want to see you
know if I like this better and I gotta
say I'm having great luck with the stuff
that I've been home lately I like this
to let me swatch this this is a very
pretty color check that out if I would
have already had this that might have
made it into my top fall lipsticks video
wise these remind me a little bit of the
Revlon lip butters and shade wise this
particular one flush plum kind of like
Revlon sugar plum i've swatched them
here there's the plush plum and there's
sugar plum you can see sugar plums like
maybe a little more neutral ish anyway
just wanted to give you a little frame
of reference there in case you already
had one and we're wondering about the
other but I am enjoying this I think
it's a really nice color so at walmart
found this new mascara this is from
l'oreal it says lash out butterfly but
and it says that on the tube i'm pretty
sure the packaging said voluminous
butterfly but whatever the case may be
there's a butterfly involved and the
brush is kind of interesting I'm
actually kind of loving this style of
brush in other mascaras too but it's
where you've got really short bristles
on one side so that would be the top and
then if I can get in real close aged a
baby and then you can see the longer
bristles there on the bottom so this is
nice the shorter side is nice for
getting some product on those lashes and
then you can use the longer side to kind
of comb them out and this is probably
going to be hard to show unless the
light hits this just right but there's
like two tracks of longer bristles that
make you think kind of wings that's
probably where this butterfly things
coming friend like together at the tip
and then separating and I could try all
day to see whether this is going to show
up for you but I do plan to do a full
review on this I've only used it a
couple times so far and like I said a
cool design with the brush I like the
thought that it's kind of your
application of mascara plus a lash comb
built right my first impressions on
mascaras can change so much over the
course of like a week as I learn little
tricks for how to use it best so keep an
eye out for more on this finally ordered
an urban decay lipstick I got mine from
Ulta so many of you said you got to try
these swatch him for us tell us what you
think and this the shade I chose is
called manic and so many of them looked
gorgeous on the website like I probably
could have just closed my eyes and
pointed to one and liked what I would
have ended up getting shade wise but
this color um I kind of thought fall of
course a little bit deeper rosy color
it's not real pinkie it's a little bit
more on the red side definitely a deep
rosy red I'm long wearing really intense
on the lives you need to put that
through like you know some food tests
and some cup texts honestly the first
day I used it I put it on with the full
intention of keeping an eye on it and
then by the end of the day forgot how it
worked wash my face and I was like oh
yeah that lipstick you were trying this
is a whole lot of review so that's the
Urban Decay lipstick this was all over
the place right I went to big lots and I
got some soft lips hadn't used these in
a really long time but saw the deal and
couldn't pass it up a buck 50 for two of
these and they're the tinted ones one
is pink and one is bronze and I believe
they both have an SPF 15 in there yep
one sweet and one is soldier this seemed
kind of cool this was a bit more pricey
for the one at just two dollars and
twenty cents but soft lips coral gloss
sheer lip protectant SPF 10 so this
actually a gloss let's bust this one
open and see what this is actually like
I'm like coral see how much more orangie
that is than all the rest pretty sheer
smells decent it smells kind of vanilla
II kind of like a Mac lip product got a
couple things from Hobby Lobby and then
victorious sikh I am a fan of the
bombshell sent I have a little size of
that and I really like it and so when I
saw that there was a body mist I was
totally into it because it's kind of a
strong scent you know and so this body
mist sort of it you know you're still
getting that scent but maybe not quite
as extranaras the pink warm and cozy
body mist it says toasted vanilla and
peony and then this one which I used
years and years ago is very sexy and
that's the body mist as well so just
working in a little variety with my
sense there they all smell amazing and
then it had been a long time since I
checked out the beauty stuff kind of
near the checkout at Victoria's Secret
and there was of course a deal going on
that as well so I got one of these shiny
kiss flavored glosses this is decadent
berry and these used to be called beauty
rush the last time i was there shows how
often I go to victoria's secret but
let's see there's that a really soft
shimmery pink and then this is a glossy
tint lip sheen jumbo pencil read it
seems really light and very like slick
and shiny so there's that and you can
see quite a bit brighter than some of
these deeper plum and Barry colors down
here also and I haven't tried these yet
so I can't review them for you yet but I
got a couple of these I trios this one's
in secret weapon
and we've got here classic fall neutrals
and like a champagne a taupe color and
then a mossy green there's some swatches
just real quick on my fingers and then
there they are on my hand they seem a
little powdery but I don't know you guys
kind of got to use them on your eye
before you can really make a
determination one how those are going to
work and then the other ones are
Purple's pinky pearly shade a taupe
that's got a little bit of purple in it
and then a real deep purple or so it's
right there love in that middle shade
nice and then when I checked out the
girl says oh you qualify to get the last
one of our tote bags and so it's a
little quilted bag says Victoria's
Secret down there is pretty cute it's
really lightweight finally hobby lobby
fall is one of my favorite times to
decorate and all the fall stuff this
past weekend was like forty or fifty
percent off so great deals there I got
this cool little like burlap ribbon that
has leaves all around it and I've got a
couple little things set up in my
entryway I wanted to see if I could cut
some of this and maybe like rope it
through some of my display I'm not
really sure yet but it just caught my
eye I thought half-price it was
originally like 15 bucks and then these
cute little guys look at these little
pumpkins little hollow pumpkins there a
little bit heavy but they're definitely
not like any sort of wrought iron type
thing I don't know what they're made out
of exactly but I just thought those were
so cute and I've got like one thing on
either side of the entryway little stand
so i thought those could go in there too
how cute thanks so much for watching
