video I have a high-end haul to pass
along and this is stuff from let's see
Ulta a few things from Sephora and also
a couple of new pallets that I ordered
off of the two-faced website and I have
tried everything so far so I will tell
you what I can at this point and I'm
wearing a lot of it as well just because
I know if I'm watching a haul I kind of
like to see as much as I can how some of
these products actually perform and kind
of consistent with my last video there
are some things that I'm going to be
talking about that I am absolutely
full-force just loving and some other
things I think are really questionable
and I have a really big bun today I
don't know if it'll all even fit in the
shot um and I'm also getting all these
new little baby hairs in I used to have
tons of like baby bangs when I was a
little kid like you know all those
little hairs around the hairline and
since having bail I think they're all
starting to come back not sure what
that's about the first thing this is
from Ulta I am so excited that Becca has
a kit out the vast majority of Becca
thinks that I've tried I have loved and
three of the four things in this kit are
new to me so I'll go ahead and show you
those first thing is the shimmering skin
Perfector in opal this is the one thing
that I already had I have this also in
the small version with the sponge tip
applicator just really beautiful this is
my favorite format of highlight that
Becca makes the press ones are pretty as
well but as I've said before I think
this liquefied version something about
it goes on even more undetectable on the
skin but just makes the skin look really
really gorgeous and then what I'm
wearing today is actually a combination
of two of these other products that were
new to me one of these is the beach tint
shimmer souffle in watermelon /
moonstone and this is so pretty I've
looked at these in at Ulta but never
really pulled the trigger on buying it
but seeing it in this kit it really made
me want to get it and it smells good too
it's like kind of a soft fruity scent
and when I first opened this up things
looked a little more swirled in there
but since I've used it I think the
colors have meshed together a bit more
but it's like a really fresh Coralie
looking pink with a little bit of gold
weaved throughout and I just used this
with my ELF small stipple brush dab it
in
here and then dab it on the cheeks or I
think if you wanted to use your fingers
it's a really interesting kind of
whipped mousse like consistency reminds
me so much of the Maybelline
what were those called remember when
Maybelline had like the dream mousse I
think they were called dream mousse
blushes it's that very texture but it
gives a really pretty fresh look to the
cheeks there's a swatch of the kind of
shade you're looking at there and then
you're getting a small size of the
shimmering skin perfecter pressed in
rose gold which I'm the only one I have
of this style of highlight is an opal so
I was excited to try this well it is
highly shimmery I don't feel like it
performs like a typical highlight on my
skin because it is a little bit deeper
like see the depth and color of that and
then think about some of your more
pearly or champagne highlights see this
is quite a bit deeper so actually I've
realized instead of just popping that
shade on top of my cheekbones and
expecting it to be a really like catch
the light type of brightening highlight
I actually just cover the entire area
where I put blush so I have taken this
put it on the cheeks and then totally
topped it off with the rose gold and so
I'm getting this glow enos like all
right in through there and I really like
it the other thing in this kit that I've
not yet tried I have a beach tint but I
don't have this shade this is in guava
and so the beach tints are like a lip
and cheek stain and I really really love
the one that I got in raspberry so this
shade is a nice warm peachy color I just
shared it out right there quite a bit
softer than the raspberry shade I have
I'm excited to use this and see if the
staying power or the staining
effect of this differs much if I know
sometimes in makeup the deeper shades
that stain seem to pack quite a bit more
of a punch than some of these lighter
colors so I'll definitely try it out I
was wanting to get more beach tint so
I'm pumped that that was in this kit so
from Ulta I got this pure minerals
secret crush eye palette and you may
remember several months back I reviewed
the pure minerals soul mattes palette
and it was a beautiful like kind of mush
berry fully matte palette the same size
in format so I think they saw that that
was a pretty successful pallet probably
and now they've put out something else
and I love the outer packaging first off
it's like a soft blush color I love it
and then on the inside you know what
this reminds me of a mini Naked 2
palette in fact let me pull that out so
we can just get a closer look
of course naked 2 is at the bottom of my
drawer I don't know about you guys but I
see quite a few similarities here this
 called chopper in here in The Naked
2 it's kind of a rosy gold and there's a
more I think vivid rose gold here in the
pure minerals palette but are you liking
my pants down there my bit pj pants but
some of those mid-tone shades in just
the whole color scheme
I don't know I'm seeing some
similarities across the board but this
palette also comes with one of those
little chunky brushes the sole mattes
I'm sorry the sole mattes palette also
came with one like this and the shades
in here that are matte are this one this
kind of creamy a little bit pink tone
shade and these two deep ones so really
dark brown and this one actually strikes
me as a deep navy my eyes could be
playing tricks on me maybe that's black
but it looks a little bit Navy
especially in certain lights and then
these four shades in the middle are very
metallic they're nice shades they're
really nicely textured I think this is a
dead-on beautiful one of the best rose
gold I've messed with I've used and I've
got that a lot of that in my look today
I've got the rose gold on the lid
both of these maths kind of in the
crease and outer corner and then I even
took the rose gold just up above
highlighted with the matte shade and I
have a little bit of this kind of I
don't know plummy taupe type color on
the lower lash line so in a nutshell
with this palette and I plan to review a
lot of these things further for you but
you've got a couple highlights these
highly metallic shades and then your two
mats are really really dark so I don't
think that that gives you a lot of
options when you want to create contrast
it's great if you like smoky eyes
because I feel like this look you know
got pretty smoky because these were the
mattes I had to work with and I think if
there was a lighter more mid-tone matte
you would be able to more easily turn
out some very natural daytime look so
here it's like if I want that matte
shade in my crease it's going to go dark
this could be a potential crease shade
as well
but it's still you know pretty shimmery
so it's a pretty palette it's like $32
which i think is a pretty good price for
it
but I don't think it's the most
versatile and if you've already got a
lot of these neutral and nude palettes
particularly the Naked 2 I don't think
this is a rush out and buy it type thing
but gotta say love the rose gold in
there if this is making you want rose
gold and that's like the only shade
you're interested in
check out the l'oreal infallible single
and amber rush that is a beautiful rose
gold and really pigmented and you could
you know blend that in with any number
of other eye palettes you have okay
folks I went ahead and got it this is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
I really wasn't going to get it because
frankly I didn't feel like I needed it
but now that I'm kind of going on this
rampage of trying to compare and test
out different contouring palettes I
decided I needed to try this one so here
it is you've probably seen it a lot here
on YouTube you got your three contouring
shade got your three highlighting shades
ones banana one's got a little shimmer
one is basically matte here the shape I
feel like I've got one cool toned
contouring option and then 2 warm ones
here on the outside this one's a little
lighter this one's a little deeper
richer I've used this a few times I'm
not wearing it today I'm wearing
something else I'm gonna mention in a
second but I liked it it did the job for
me I think I'm going to really have to
get in tune with the I don't know
nuances of this palette to be able to
compare it to my NYX one and in
different things because as it stands
right now just you know initial reaction
wise I'm not seeing what all the fuss is
about because I think I have tons of not
only specific contouring products but
also bronzers and highlights and
different low-cost things that can
pretty much do what that does I'm not
writing it off just yet like I said I
owe this a lot more time and
experimentation but that's just what I'm
thinking right now one thing that I saw
an Ulta sweb site and just immediately
thought I need you in my life it's the
Too Faced natural matte palette oh my
goodness everybody loves natural eyes
well not maybe not everybody but I love
natural eyes and here is a look at the
original natural eyes palette and
is said to be it says we've taken our
best-selling award-winning naturalized
neutral eyeshadow collection and have
transformed all your favorite colors
into a full set of buttery creamy matte
shadows so let's look here here's the
matte here's the original and you might
remember naturalize has been around so
dang long it actually went through a
makeover and it was a slightly different
palette originally and then they gave it
this new packaging and they changed up a
couple shades but this top row is all
matte in the original and it's the same
top row in the new one you're getting
heaven cashmere bunny and six preso in
both of them nudie that shade right
there that my pinky's pointing to at the
bottom is also matte and that is also
the same in both of them
so basically out of the nine colors five
shades were transformed because if the
five shimmers in here are now matte and
so I get the idea I kind of like the
thought that they took you know the
original natural eyes kept that whole
color scheme in mind and turned it all
mad but maybe just slightly disappointed
that some of the things we're already
matte and I already have four of the
shades that are in here so keep that in
mind from a value perspective if you
really are trying to figure out if this
is worth it I've used this just a couple
times already must say love the texture
I think Too Faced does a great job with
their matte shadows and I say this
probably in most of my Too Faced palette
reviews it's like they do maths so well
I wish they would include more mattes in
their palettes and boom here's an all
matte palette and if you do like maths
and you like the way to face does them
they do have a palette called matte eye
and it's a very cool color scheme in
comparison to this one but top row in
this palette I've used that it makes me
think of a really natural taupe stone
kind of eye look this one you got your
pinky mauve ooh they're speaking to me
with that shade I really like that color
is kind of a transition type thing I
have not yet used what's down at the
bottom which seems to be kind of a
warmish Brown scheme so this is not a
full review this is a whole but the
natural matte palette from Too Faced I
really am enjoying it because I think
Too Faced does Matt very well and I
really
that color scheme and while we're on to
face I'll just talk about a couple of
the things that I went to their website
for because they were really new and I
don't think they were put out on
Sephora's or ulties website at the time
so I got the cocoa contour kit and this
contains four shades and a brush and you
got light cocoa which is a gorgeous
satin finish highlight so my ideal kind
of highlight medium cocoa and dark cocoa
so a light cool tone and then a deeper
warm tone very bronzer ish looking
contour and then pop of light dog gonnit
I don't know if you can see it here but
they put sparkle in it why it's not in a
Becca shimmering skin perfector
pearlized kind of way it's like I can
actually see the bits of sparkle and
when I put this on my skin I see the
little flecks of glitter tiny flecks of
glitter but glitter nonetheless and I
don't really like that on top of my
cheeks and that's really a deal-breaker
for me in this palette they're only
giving you four shades and one of them I
don't like and I'm not a huge fan of
dark cocoa either it's very very warm it
strikes me even as a little bit warmer
than my Too Faced chocolate Soleil I
could be wrong on that might need to
compare a little more closely but at a
glance
it just seems you know quite warm so
today I am wearing actually medium cocoa
and light cocoa in my look and I use
this little brush this is the contour
Buki that's what it's been named and it
is cut at an angle and it's actually
kind of blunt cut I didn't know whether
I'd like it or not and I do like it for
laying down the contour I don't really
like it for blending out I don't think
it's a great blending brush again I put
medium cocoa right in here I took that
around my hairline also and then light
cocoa this is really the best part of it
but I already have highlights like this
it's a satin finish very pigmented just
not enough going for this palette for it
to be a total must-have for me and the
other thing I really wanted to get off
to face website is the no filter selfie
powder I just had to do it guys this has
a sunrise powder totally toasted and
Moon River and check out what they did
they put the founders dog who I follow
on Instagram the dog has an Instagram
and they show the little pooch in the
different casts that these shades give
almost as if you were selecting a
different Instagram filter with each one
I've used each of these I do like that
they didn't throw glitter in any of them
so yay for that the effect that I get
from each of them is really so subtle
I'm not sure that I'm picking up on it
and I have liked applying them with my
elf complexion brush this is a really
nice full but slightly flat type of
brush so it's really nice for just
sweeping products kind of lightly over
the skin and I purposely didn't wear one
in this video so I could apply it for
you and we could just watch together and
see if you saw any difference and I
think for the look I've got going on
today I think maybe totally toasted
might be a good one so I'm picking up a
little bit of that on the brush there I
got some and I'm just gonna sweep this
across the face just all over I don't
know I'm not seeing much effect and I
don't know that you're supposed to see a
lot
and I already had some pretty glowy
stuff going on on my cheeks but now I
suppose maybe I'm seeing a bit more glow
elsewhere on the face where I was for
the most part in that this is kind of a
gimmicky idea I mean let's face it but I
was using Sunrise the other day and I
was taking a picture beforehand in this
lighting and then I took the after
picture with it on and I just couldn't
tell it real difference definitely not
casting this aside just yet because part
of the joy of makeup for me is getting a
product and maybe being a little
questionable about it at first but
figuring out the trick to it so this is
not the last you'll hear me talk about
this but at this point in time I'm kind
of like you know what's it doing I can't
really tell just several things from
Sephora real quick the NARS dual intents
to the eyeshadow palette check out that
mirror on the front yeah that's a
totally like usable mirror that's kind
of cool but here are the shadows inside
this is said to be like a wet/dry thing
you can get different looks depending on
the way you want to use these I have
been playing with this I've been trying
to figure out what the trick is to
getting this to work because on some of
these the consistency the way they are
dry they're very dry and I don't love
using them on their own so I've added
water but the times I've done that like
with this shade in my crease I did a
real smokey eye and I loved that kind of
color and I used it with water and I got
creasing this shade I must say is really
pretty and metallic just as is but
certain ones it's like I didn't like the
way they were blending across the eyes
I'm out of breath I'm back with my
assistant now she's up from her nap so
good thing I only have a couple products
left to talk about right you want to
talk about the bite lipstick or the
Beautyblender Beautyblender matches your
outfit I finally got one of these I've
never had a real beauty blender before
isn't that amazing sit down so as you
can see it I haven't tried it yet but I
have been using my Beauty Blender ish
type sponge from Real Techniques I
actually use this today I'm wearing
Estee Lauder Double Wear and I applied
it with this I use it a little bit damp
and I do really like it so I can't wait
to see how the real thing actually
compares
if it's really you know a must-have I
would love to know your thoughts by the
way those of you who have been using
beauty blenders forever and lastly the
lip color I'm wearing today I got a bite
butter cream lipstick this was totally
treating myself here with this one
because this is awesome it said on the
website how these are hand cut and there
was actually a little thing I thought it
was imprinted initially but it's
actually just a little like tab you lift
off and it says hand cut and like it
says here on the box it's the thought
that they're taking off that protective
typical bullet style and getting you to
the core of the most moisturizing part
of the lipstick and I love regular bite
lipsticks but I must say this is even
creamier and it's actually the whole
line is a selection of really wearable
neutrals so this is pecan it was
described as warm dusty rose I think so
that's what I've got on my lips it's a
little hard to get really good
definition with this kind of a shape I
gotta say but I just pulled in some of
my Milani lip liner in say it with me
folks spice and use that to get a little
more defined look but I'm loving it I'm
glad I got a really wearable shade that
I thought I would use a lot because you
know one bite lipstick ain't cheap oh
she smells so good she you're the winner
for Best scent today because she just
had a bath last night and you are
smelling great girlfriend by the way I
did finally get around to doing a five
five and a half month update over on my
vlog channel on her just talking about
all kinds of things baby and new mommy
and etc so thank you guys again for
watching this video if I had to pick the
stars of this haul right now it would
totally be this Becca kit and probably
the bite butter cream lipstick so we
will talk to you guys later bye wow we
look at all the stuff oh my goodness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
