joining me today I am going to be
updating you a little bit on some new
products that I've got some of these
things I actually had on hand back when
I did that get ready with me video a
couple videos ago but I obviously
couldn't use everything like all in one
sitting on my face I guess I could have
it would have been an interesting look
I'm sure but I wanted to kind of just go
ahead and fill in the blanks here and
share some of those other items that I
didn't get to use there and I've also
got some things from Sephora a few
things I picked up while on vacation and
so I thought just be fun to sort of
update the whole situation here so I'm
going to start out with drugstore things
and first up I got a couple of these
city mini pallets from Maybelline and of
course you know this happens a lot in
the drugstore we see things kind of get
recycled in different lines in certain
ways and with these I feel like these
are definitely like the formula that's
in their eye studio quads just recycled
into a little bit larger palette you
know different configuration different
mix of colors but it's a formula that I
believe we've seen before from
Maybelline and I do like it you know
these are smooth shadows they're
lightweight but really quite pigmented
this reminds me a lot also of the
formula that covergirl is using in their
true naked palettes like they've got the
golden one the nude one the Rose one and
this is a lot like that is valid in
particular that I'm holding the rooftop
bronzes reminds me a lot of the
covergirl true Naked Golden's palette
but I've got that one here and this is
what I've used on my eyes today and I'm
just really convinced that this is that
same kind of silky lightweight yet so
pigmented formula very easy to blend
I've got some of this shade and this
shade on my lid this color in the crease
which is about as soft as it gets
I guess shimmer wise but there's still
definitely shimmer in this shade in this
palette a little bit of this in the
outer corner as well and I also used
this shade with a liner brush this deep
it's brown just kind of right in there
in with my lashline and the look is you
know good enough it's fine this is a
pretty common assortment of shades I
think and for the fact that you're not
getting anything really met in here that
might be a problem
and for some people it's you know a
little bit of a drawback for me as well
because when you do have a matter like
at least one darker medium matte shade
that's where you can really start
creating some contrast with the look and
I think sometimes when everything's
shimmering you have to be careful about
like not over blending and mixing too
many of the shades right in with one
another because it can start to look a
little more muddy anybody know where I'm
coming from with that so anyway I think
this is a nice formula from Maybelline
maybe not always an ideal like mix of
shades or mix of finishes but if you're
thinking about running out and
purchasing these because you think
you're getting something brand new and
different from Maybelline it really to
me seems like their eye Studio quad
formula and so did I say this is rooftop
bronzes and this is chilled brunch
neutrals yes I mean when I look at that
palette I think brunch this one actually
has a couple of shades with that and
dusty lilac and the white or light kind
of Beijing cream color here that aren't
quite so shimmery so that's kind of nice
to see but then you've got some really
sort of sparkly takes on taupe they're
very sparkly champagne and then a deep
sort of metallic plum right down here so
that's just a couple of the shades that
were offered and there may have been
like another three or four in that line
another new eyeshadow saying that I saw
and I believe I got these on ulties
website they are the L'Oreal infallible
paints Mattel metallics you may have
seen my L'Oreal infallible paints video
I did a huge video talking about so much
stuff like all of those double ended
cream infallible paint shadows the
liners the lip colors they've got some
really cool things in this infallible
paints line and now we're seeing some
powders I chose to get violent luster
and aluminum foil because I thought the
shade called aluminum foil will really
tell me like what this line is made of
and it is a truly shiny like wet looking
glow there I mean get out of town stand
by for the extreme close-up mamacita oh
yep that's nice I think I'm just going
to do this all day just for the rest of
the video just let the light bounce off
this color
is this therapeutic to anyone else I
don't know though guys I'm slightly
underwhelmed by the purple I have not
used these on my eyes yet the way they
build up on the eyes might be a bit of a
different story I don't know it's not an
unpigmented purple it's a very like soft
lilac II kind of color
I'm not hating it but it certainly had a
tough act to follow with that
aluminum-foil color so this may be a
line worth you know looking into I have
been really impressed like I said with
the other things in this infallible
paints line now they've got some powder
shadows and they came to party now
talking about drugstore mascaras I have
mentioned I feel like several times the
voluminous Lashkar dyes from L'Oreal
I've enjoyed this mascara very much I
think it gives great length thickness
holds my curls not my favorite thing to
wear on the lower lashes because
depending on I don't know my activity
level the amount of humidity in the air
I'm not sure of what it is exactly I
have seen a little bit of smudging on
the lower lash line with this one so
just be aware of that but on the upper
lashes it's freaking awesome the other
new mascara I've been trying a little
more recently is this total piece from
covergirl and I have had like great
experience with covergirl super sizer
mascara so I was pretty eager to test
this puppy out and the brush is really
interesting you've got this flat end of
the wand which really is basically bare
from bristles then there are bristles on
the bottom and this flared out kind of
like ball on the end designed to really
catch the lashes that are hard to reach
and I think it works great for that I
was actually quite happy with the way
that was able to pull out like my inner
lashes I just barely touched it to my
outer lashes too like right over here
and I was like wow I think this could be
a really nice wand for people who are
like me and you're not a wrist flipper
you know what I mean like you you got
this eye this right eye with the right
hand and then you go over to the left
eye and I don't feel comfortable doing
that with my hand some people are
probably really good at it but I for
whatever reason come in like this
and that is a situation where a brush
like this makes it so easy to just get
all over the place it kind of reminds me
of when L'Oreal put out that I think it
was called telescopic explosion or
something and it was sort of their take
on the Givenchy mascara with the little
ball and it was just the ball at the end
and honestly it works really well for
catching those hard-to-reach areas the
formula reminds me of covergirl super
sides are quite a bit actually and I'm
kind of wondering if either I apply too
much product and they got a little
weighed down because the curl holding
nature of this doesn't seem to be quite
as good as it has been with the
voluminous lash paradise I did do two
coats on each eye and that may have not
been totally necessary so I'm going to
experiment with maybe applying a little
bit less of this but I'm shocked it's
pretty rare that I like try to random
new mascaras and they both actually seem
to do pretty great things for my lashes
so I'm impressed with both of these okay
from Sephora I've got a few things that
were online and some things that I
picked up at the cutest little Sephora
that I found in Destin while we were
down there vacationing and the first
things I'll mention are these products
here from bareMinerals they have come
out with what is the exact name
statement matte liquid lip color
now the Gen nude liquid lip colors that
they had I thought were the best most
comfortable liquid lipsticks period I
mean I just love those great texture
they are truly matte but they don't feel
drying they're easy to apply to feel
like absolute velvet going across the
lips so nice and I remember saying in a
video
not that bareMinerals like specifically
longtime to my video or anything and
heard what I had to say but I remember
saying like gosh it would be great to
have this formula in some brighter
shades and now they've come out with
this statement line and so I have to I
got one called flawless which it's nice
it's a pretty shade don't get me wrong
but it does seem maybe a little bit
close to a couple colors I might already
have from their nude line not saying
it's not a statement color but they did
have some colors that were kind of like
that you know ma vie rose already but I
liked
have it you know it's great and then the
color that I've been wearing throughout
this video is called fire and this is
just yummy like I think of this is a
tomato we read does that description
speak to anyone else you know like a
little bit of a warm red happening there
it's so nice you just feel so good they
smell a little bit like the Bonnie Bell
lift lights in cappuccino have I said
that description before I feel like I've
described something as that not too long
ago it might have been these when I
first tried out such a specific scent
description there babe they're very
pleasant and I just enjoy wearing them
they feel great on the lips if you like
a matte and you like a liquid type
format you might really enjoy these
however the one thing you're going to
have to give up a little bit on this if
you really like the idea of a
non-transferable lip product you can
pull some of this stuff off your lips I
still think it's very long wearing but I
mean it doesn't completely 100% set that
being said it's going to feel more
comfortable on your lips so I really
enjoy those I'm so excited to see that
they've come out with more colors I also
splurged and I got a new palette from
visi art it's actually not a new palette
in their line they've had it for some
time I have looked at this a lot and
finally decided to go ahead and get it
it is their Paris nude palette oh it's
so pretty love the way they do their
shimmery formula I mean I like their
mats as well but they've got just some
stunning shimmers and look how I don't
know just muted and pretty this is see
when the shades are in direct light they
can look decently deeper and I think
that's something to keep in mind with
this palette because what you see head
on in full light may not be the way it
behaves like in the creases of your eyes
where things are getting a little more
shadowed I have only just one time
played with this palette so it needs a
lot more time and attention for me but
what it kind of made me think of as I
was deciding whether or not I wanted to
get it it feels like the lighter take or
like the baby sister to the sultry muse
like do you see some similarities across
these two this one a little more rich
and more intense and this one is just
like lighter and airy
but they have some similar color tones
happening across the to so I'll be
interested to play more with this and
let you know what I think I really want
to do more on the larger Vizio palettes
that I had also I felt like trying a new
BB cream and I thought I would go for
this one from Bobbi Brown it is the BB
cream like could the packaging be
anymore just basic black tube no-frills
BB cream SPF 35 and I have it in the
shade natural I'm wearing it today I
also have you know concealer and powders
and other stuff on my skin but this is a
really really lightweight like it's a
nice little level of moisture but
coverage wise it's definitely nowhere
close to the it cosmetics I'm not really
knocking it because of that because I
don't know the it cosmetics is really
exceptional in that way I wasn't looking
to like try an identical product I
expected this would be different or as
light of coverage as this is I mean my
skin does look pretty good I can see
most everything you know like just
little freckle Y's and stuff like that
that I don't know I just got that kind
of underwhelmed feeling right after I
put it on for his prices this was I
don't know I guess I was expecting just
a little bit more but I can't really
argue with the way my skin looks now I
think it looks pretty darn good so I'm
going to keep this in the rotation this
is a very summertime friendly product
I'm gonna get my use out of this and
apparently while I was on that little
Bobby Brown train I decided to cash in
some Sephora points and get this Bobby's
cult favorites kit I think this was a
500-point
item and this is what's inside you're
getting a lipstick a mini bronzer it's a
mini lipstick too by the way
mini mascara mini shadow stick and a
mini eye creams new I like the eye cream
that was the only thing out of that
bunch that I do have experience with it
comes in an adorable little box because
there are some really good things in
this kit you guys I love this bronzer
I'm wearing this today it's in the shade
medium to that strike anyone as being
like a bit cooler than you might have
expected for a bronzer and I've got it
like around the perimeter of my face
I've got this really like tan zone right
here on my forehead and I don't know
applying some bronzer across that sort
of helps it mesh with the rest of my
skin this is nice works great as
toward us a very contour friendly color
on my skin so enough I said but it is
totally matte in terms of like a really
nice glowy bronzer that I'm laughing
like really super impressed with right
now this Too Faced sweet tea I think is
awesome but anyway back to the Bobbi
Brown stuff the other thing I love from
this kit this lip color and brownie is
so pretty I was wearing this on snapchat
Instagram goodness gracious could this
color work for anyone I'm thinking yeah
it's no shimmer just creamy feels really
nice Bobbi Brown's got a great lipstick
formula so I love having that in the kit
this long-wear cream shadow stick is in
the shade called sand dune and it's
actually kind of matte I think it's a
fully matte shade I mean I used that
earlier in the week and I just put it in
my crease and sort of blended it out
with my finger and a brush and just
smoothed it out all over and that's a
really cool product it's very long
wearing I don't have a lot of shadow
sticks that aren't just like straight up
shimmer balms you know so many shadow
sticks are so this was nice to just
easily pop in my crease and then I put a
little bit of the busy art Paris nudes
like on top of the lid and it was very
nice look last thing that you get is the
smoky eye mascara I feel like maybe I
have tried this before it didn't work
any miracles for my lashes kind of
straighten them out a little bit curl
wise but everybody's lashes are
different and that might be a fantastic
mascara for someone but all in all happy
with that kit really think it was worth
the point to get that I got a couple of
Sephora brushes while on vacation I got
this Pro airbrush concealer brush and
before hand I had mentioned I think that
I really enjoyed this Pro Mini flawless
airbrush like this is a nice size for so
many different things on the face
whether it's blending out foundation
dabbing over concealer doing a contour
just a really interesting brush there
and so I saw this one in person
obviously it's the full size brush and I
thought you know this seems a little
different from some other brushes that I
have like I have a lot of Sigma brushes
that are about this size but not quite
as full and so I use this for concealer
they have been using it quite a bit
actually it blends really
nicely it's super soft I think I'm going
to get a lot of good out of this brush
and I also thought it might be nice for
some cream highlight perhaps so we'll
test that too and then you guys I don't
know really what I was thinking here I
was completely drawn in by packaging I
was in this like vacation haze of oh
yeah I'm on vacation let's buy a
commemorative product by which to
remember this vacation I don't know I I
saw this little I set I think it was
called the ready and 5 I set and look at
this peachy nude colored precious oh I'm
making excuses here this this was not a
total necessity given the brushes that I
have but you know I thought it might be
fun to try and I've been using this a
little bit I'm kind of not quite
comfortable with it yet you know like
you get really in tune with certain eye
brushes that you use all the time you
know what they're going to do you just
know how they're going to perform and
these are really new to me like I'm
getting used to the length and all the
movement that that crease brush has it
comes to a little bit of a point and I
did my eye look with these today and it
did a nice job you know it's just very
long there's quite a taper going on here
so you can kind of get some product in
the crease and then blend it out a bit
this brush here the all-over shadow you
know it's got some flatness to it but
yet it's very tapered also it's like a
flattened out version of my e25 from
sigma so it does kind of you know boost
some shadow up into the crease but it
was pretty good on the lid
can't argue with this little angled
liner brush you know it's stiff enough
but not like hard and Scratchy and I was
able to put some shadow kind of adds
liner right along the lash line and
really like the smudge brush dense soft
but really effective at getting shadow
like right along the lower lash line so
I think I ran into some good brushes
here definitely good quality there
gorgeous to look at something about
those shades and how each brush is a
different color you don't see that a lot
with brush sets and then they come in
this thing each brush has its own little
slot here and the holder this just comes
over and slips right down
it's cute it's really cute it might make
a nice little gift idea for someone or
like you're making a little bridesmaid
gift and you pop something like this in
and maybe your dress colors for your
wedding were peaches and rose wouldn't
that be cute the very specific scenario
there but you know it could work last
but not least I got this Clinique
Moisture Surge intense I tried to get
this Oh quite a while ago like as a
sample and they gave me just the regular
Moisture Surge which I have and I liked
but I wanted to try the intense it says
for very dry to dry combination skin and
I Kurt if indeed II mentioned this is a
nice like makeup prep step and it is
really nice in that way I see what she
means because it's very smoothing to the
skin it's moisturizing but not in a
sticky way but it's a really really
hydrating for the skin so I got this big
old tub of that and I was glad to have
found it in person and make sure I was
getting the right one and then I got a
couple of masks I've tried I think only
the Rose mask from Sephora I got a great
set of Sephora masks and i gifted them
to my sister for christmas time but I
myself have been wanting to try some
more so I got the pearl face mask which
is gosh it said on the whole display
what they're supposed to be I think this
one's supposed to be brightening Oh duh
perfecting and brightening mm-hmm and
then I got zip pomegranate which is anti
fatigue and energizing so I love a good
sheet match because is there anything
easier to just popping it on then you
don't even have to do the rinse you know
you just kind of let that serum and
stuff seep into your skin really nice
and that is it for my haul thank you
guys so much for watching that's not
like some winners in this video and I am
so loving this lip color this fire mmm
that's so nice for summer is it not
thank you guys again and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
