I am so pumped to bring you a bet M a
lip product all today I have become such
a huge
Besame geek I think they make fantastic
lip products if you're not familiar with
this line they are sold on Besame
cosmetics comm which is where I got this
stuff but you can also find a lot of
this stuff on sephora.com as well but
the brand basically is making these
vintage replica lipsticks and I will
link to the first video I did on Besame
below because I talked a lot about the
history and just why they do what they
do but I think it's so neat that each
lipstick that they release is very like
thoughtfully put out they have done and
sought out like a key shade from a
certain era like a particularly R in
history and they find a way to
absolutely replicate the pigments in
that shade the finishes and just bring
these iconic colors back to life is
something we can purchase now in this
beautiful packaging just an absolutely
stunning product just to have and you
feel so just glamorous when you're
putting it on and I feel like the line
is very heavy on reds but I did get kind
of a couple of different shades I think
a little bit outside of traditional Reds
to show you in this video and they've
got other products as well I have a
blush from Besame some of their face
powders brushes I could get into a whole
like maybe hits and misses of Besame in
a future video if you'd like to see that
let me know that for now I thought I'd
just show you what's new because in a
couple of cases I was trying on things
for the first time for this video and I
thought it would just be fun to bring
you along with that but the overall
thing that kind of prompted this whole
was when I saw and I believe it was on
Instagram that there sweetheart lip
glaze was discounted to just 5 dollars
on the best may Cosmetics website so I
thought that's lower than what I'm
paying for some drugstore lip products
these days I should probably check them
out and I'm really glad that I did they
are called sweetheart glaze and this is
the little box they come in even like
the outer packaging of Besame stuff is
absolutely adorable and luxurious but it
says luminous lip protectant and
moisturizer it says thick and rich
sweetheart blade stays where you put it
is not
or running our glazes form a barrier on
your lips to slow the loss of water and
moisture and yeah they say they contain
vitamin E sweetened with natural fruit
and candy flavors for an added treat and
so I got a couple of the colors that
were available one is caramel or caramel
I'm so stuck on saying caramel is just
like stuck in my ways I'm sorry I just
say caramel this is like a creamy tan
lip color and these do have some
Sheerness to them unlike any Besame
lipstick these glosses are you know I
think a very traditional gloss in that
they are slightly sheer there's no
Sparkle and either the shades that I got
but as you see it applied I think the
fact that this is a little bit deeper
than straight-up like light classic knew
that quality in this gloss is what's
allowing it to still kind of show up on
my lips even though it is neutral and
very sheer so I do like the look of
caramel while their lipsticks have just
the most beautiful like light vanilla
scent I'm getting just a teeny bit of a
sweet scent on these it's just really
not something I take note of big-time
one way or the other the applicator is a
very standard go foot it doesn't hold a
lot of product so you may find yourself
having to dip back into the tube as you
apply to the top lip you know after
you've done the bottom lip or vice versa
I get what they're saying about these
being moisturizing and kind of locking
in the moisture on your lips and wearing
for a decently long time because they're
not a thin slippery gloss they're not
going to be sliding outside your lip
line that being said some people could
find these to be I think a little bit on
the sticky side just because of their
sickness to me it's nowhere near
annoying or uncomfortable or anything
like that I think their description is
pretty accurate and it's a thick gloss
and it does kind of lock in the moisture
so I think caramel would be a nice easy
like anytime shade it's without a doubt
the most subtle Besame brand lip product
that I have so I think it's totally
worth the $5 and probably then some and
then I got grape and it looks so so dark
it almost looks like a really like ultra
dark blood-red you know and then you see
it sharing out on your lips and you've
got this just beet berry wash of color
and this one is a little bit harder to
make even on you
lips even though this gloss has the same
thickness I described with the other you
know same formula and just the fact that
it's a deeper tone means you have to be
a little more cautious with getting it
spread evenly on the list it's not a big
deal it's the kind of thing that most
people would probably just do kind of
mindlessly you know just making sure it
gets all nice and even but that's just
something to be aware of I do love this
color this is kind of thing I would
reach for a lot if I'm looking for any
kind of berry tone gloss I could see
myself wearing this on top of different
berry lipstick looks or lip liners just
to have some shine but yet not be
worried about this formula drifting
outside my lip line hackage enough about
the tube part of this holding the gloss
but the cap is so beautiful it's got
that sort of I don't know if you call it
edge design there of a little floral
evine and I think they are so beautiful
and I'm really glad that I looked into
that and it just prompted this little
whole another thing that I wanted to get
is their lip brush and this was 15
dollars on the website I only own really
one lip brush that I find myself using
continuously and you really do have to
clean off lip brushes I think absolutely
100% so you're not mixing colors when
you apply so I thought it might not hurt
to have another lip brush in the
rotation and this is gold my other one
is silver and it has this beautiful like
kind of reddish deep reddish would look
to the handle here and then you could
just use this short style if you wanted
to or you can pop the end in the longer
piece and use it that way and feel very
glamorous tips I'm going to redo this
little ponytail thing kind of got
clipped back here but it's really handy
because I find myself wanting to use a
lip brush with my best mate lipsticks
most of the time so this is great I love
how the brush does come to a soft point
the point is not so extreme that it
can't carry some color but it's
absolutely perfect for getting that
precise line and practically feeling
like you can pick up some color off of
your lipstick and use this lip brush as
a lip liner you know you're transforming
that lipstick into a very controlled
application and you might find this not
just with Besame lipsticks but with
other lipsticks that you own when you
apply with the lip brush you can get a
totally different look
because you can get a really sheer
application and build it up very slowly
whereas when you're applying it straight
from the tube you're going to get kind
of like one level so whether you get
this lip brush or any lip brush I think
a lip brush is worth having now as I
look for the info on the specific
lipsticks I got something neat that is
also on there
Besame cosmetics website are there many
lipsticks for eight dollars so those are
like the lipsticks that were in that
holiday type kit you can get those
individually if you just wanted to try
certain shades I don't think they make
every shade and a mini on there but
anyway one of the lipsticks I got was
one of the most recent ones that they've
released as cold wild orchid and this is
kind of different for Besame because
they make so many reds and this is like
a really pretty like berry with a hint
of violet it has a little sheen to it I
don't want to call it frost or really
shimmer because that's just not what I
see in this color but there are some
great and perfectly lit close-ups on
their website of the shade and you can
just see a little bit what I'm talking
about like there's just the tiniest bit
of pearlescent quality to this lipstick
when it's hitting the light and you
don't necessarily see that when it's not
in full-on lighting but it's a 1952
replica shade and they described it as a
beautiful deep fuchsia red with slight
shimmer a semi matte finish with one
coat full coverage and the lip brush can
be very transformative for the shade
because when you apply it and you see me
applying it like the first coat with the
brush mourn very sheer this looks
awfully pink to me and then what I like
to do and what I've seen advised I think
in a YouTube video from Besame that I
saw you blot off the color and then
apply another coat and once you do that
you get more of the true color that
first step is practically just like
staining your lips like locked in
staying power blot it off apply again
and that's where you're really building
up the color and then you can even blot
that once more if you want to I'm kind
of building it up a little bit just so
you can really see what kind of color
we're working with here and I think it's
absolutely gorgeous I love having a
shade like this from Besame because I
love their formulas so much and this
feels maybe even a little bit creamier
than some that I've tried
like I said the scent on these are the
most beautiful like really natural
really true vanilla scent just love that
so much and if you wanted to apply them
straight from the tube you could there's
no like absolute rule with these
lipsticks I just find that I have the
most precision when I use the lip brush
and with any cream lipstick that you
have at home like try them with a lip
brush doing that to coat technique
blotting once or twice and you will find
that the staying power is shocking like
you're going to really think twice
before applying your dry heavy liquid
lipsticks when you see just how well
your standard lipsticks can apply just
with a little different method so anyway
loving wild orchid and then I find I'm
being very drawn to the orange and
orange reddish shades right now any part
of it just Springs coming on us and I
just really love the vibrant look that
it gives the face I mean look at the
colors on my lips throughout this video
I think it's just undeniably cheery and
fun and so I have a couple of Besame
lipsticks that I thought were a little
bit orange E but I went for the extreme
with the shade called carmine it's very
very orange I still think there's some
red in it but it's just such a
beautifully vibrant color and the
lipsticks by the way on Bethenny's
website are going to cost you $22 apiece
so they ain't cheap but they are so so
worth the money this says a neutral
orange red with mostly orange pigments
perfect for golden and olive skin tones
bright and beautiful on light skin too
semi matte finish with one coat full
coverage so with the wild orchid it was
kind of rare to have that little bit of
pearlescent finish in the lipstick the
vast majority of shades that I've tried
anyway are just straight-up creamy like
this one like carmine and so as you see
it applied I use the lip brush and I got
it completely cleaned off because I
didn't want any of the other shade
mixing with this you could see the true
color going on but I get that first coat
as you can see it still goes on very
full color but I think of this more as
the staining coat and then I blot it
apply more and here I'm really building
up the full color and I think it's so so
beautiful it really brings so much life
to the face
we'll get more shine on your lips from
any of your best and they lipsticks if
you apply them straight from the tube
just because you're getting a thicker
amount of product on your lips it's
going to have a little more moisture on
there it's going to catch the light more
but when you apply with the lip brush
you will really maximize the madness of
the look if you want to and then you can
of course blot it again and really
modify it instantly under any
circumstance but gosh I love this color
so much and it caused me to want to give
you a little comparison here because I
have a couple of other shades that I
think are in the ballpark I wanted to
show you tango red besides this I just
love tango red because it's got a lot of
orange in it but more red so when you
see those side-by-side that should
become clear to you and then I have red
hot red and I thought of that is a
little bit warmer red compared to other
things that I own but you can pick up on
a little bit more of the blue tone
coming out of it when you see it third
in line after Carmine and tango red so
just to give you some reference there
because sometimes when we're throwing
out red red red it's like what's the
actual difference
well carmine is going to be the most
orange tango red still an orange red but
heavier on red and then red hot red
which is the Marilyn Monroe like replica
shade this is more of that classic old
Hollywood movie star red and I love that
color too and did I say carmine is the
1931 replica shade and an interesting
thing that you can see if you go on VES
Amaze website they have a little section
here where you can submit your photos so
you can see different people with
different hair colors skin tones some
people post their swatch pictures you
can see what different people look like
wearing this product I think that's
super handy so anyway that's that and
then the last little thing in this hole
and this is in true hole fashion here
I'm just going to show you this because
I haven't tried it yet I really want to
I don't know acclimate myself to this
application style before I get on here
talking about it but I got the Besame
cake mascara this is a very old-school
concept it says 1920 black cake mascara
applicator included inside that's what
the applicator looks like just a little
brush
and oh my gosh look at this gorgeous tin
hau old-school I'm fascinated it comes
open like this and this is what you have
there's your little brush the brush is
really no-frills
like this brush is built for service I
can tell so alright we've got that and
then I guess your cake mascara is
actually wrapped under the sticker I
feel like I'm opening a wedding
invitation or something Wow okay I'm
holding the mascara I'm just going to
put that in the tin and don't worry guys
there are instructions and it says brows
liner or lashes I never thought of using
it for anything other than mascara that
says Besame Kate mascara is activated
with water to beautify lashes and brows
making them appear longer longer darker
and more luxuriant just rinse the brush
after every use because if it's water
activated formula cake mascara can be
reapplied and layered upon without
clumping so basically it says you're
going to wet the included applicator
this little guy with a small amount of
water rub it back and forth on the cake
until you make a soft paste add more
water to thin the texture if you wanted
to use it as eyeliner and do not add
more than one drop of water at a time so
excited to try this out so I will
definitely have to update you guys on
how well this works but that concludes
my little haul off of Bethenny's website
did I show you guys the boxes by the way
that the lipsticks come in this is what
the glosses look like and then if you
get a lipstick it looks like that and
there's a little tape over the side and
it says this shade is a true replica of
a color from 1952 in the case of wild
orchid right there so anyway it's the
little details everything was packaged
so nicely you also get a little card
that said we want to thank you for your
purchase our goal is to surpass your
expectations let us know if there's
anything we could do better I mean
they're so so classy so neat but man can
I talk for a while on a haul of only
what five products here six products
thank you guys again for watching let me
know if you'd like to see sort of us
favorites from Besame type video because
I do have quite a few lipsticks now and
I think it would be fun to just let you
know what my favorites are what I think
are the most worthwhile ones to try so I
will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
