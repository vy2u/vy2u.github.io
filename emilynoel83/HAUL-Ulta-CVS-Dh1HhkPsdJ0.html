be a little hoe from CVS and Ulta so
I've got a lot of drug store stuff in
this video as well as a few high-end
item icing I ran across was a new
covergirl display in CBS Katy Perry on
it just letting you know what to look
for and there were several new lip
colors and some new eyeshadow quads and
these covergirl eyeshadow quads
I've only swatched these so far but just
a heads up that I think things are going
downhill again with the covergirl
eyeshadows I really remember loving the
ones that were this kind of packaging
helmet old but I feel like I've been in
this makeup game enough years to see
covergirl shadows go from kind of an -
oh my gosh they're getting better
they're getting better and now I feel
like we're on like a downward slope
because these this new packaging these
new palettes I just did not find the
pigmentation to be good at all just by
the swatches I'm gonna try them on my
eyes so that's not the final verdict I
will review these but I just found it to
be much more hit and miss with the newer
products that are released in this kind
of more like squared off packages anyway
the two new ones are nudes palettes so
there's natural nudes which is this one
and then the what's it called smoky
nudes here so you've got like some cool
tones and like a deep plum in there and
just by the swatches you know they're
just kind of inconsistent you know not
every shade is great and really
interested to try these on my lids with
a primer with some bases and see how
they do that way but just kind of
feeling very soso about these after
purchase another new thing that was in
that display seems to be a new formula
or a new line of the covergirl outlast
lip products my mom loves these sue by
the way she's got tons of shades of the
covergirl outlast she just thinks it's
you know one of those lip products that
you can put on you know it's gonna last
you don't really have to worry about it
and so I was really kind of RIA tracted
to this line when I saw these couple of
new colors called outlast
and one was like a light peach and this
one is radiant red and it says new shade
on there so this is a lip system it's
kind of like a paint practically that
you put on you let it sit for 60 seconds
and then you have a balm that you can
put on top and it kind of makes the
appearance sort of shiny and it makes it
just feel more comfortable on your lips
throughout the day so this is what you
reapply and this says last for 24 hours
and I was experimenting with this the
other day and actually see what this
looks like on and what if my beauty
broadcast Express reviews that I shot
and I mean I think the colors really
gorgeous you've really got to keep up
with this moisturizing top coat
otherwise it starts getting a little
peel one of these days I think I'm just
gonna see if I can stick it out a full
24 hours and like wake up and the
morning and see if it's still there but
you like yesterday I had to take it off
at the end of the day but I'm totally
gonna be reviewing this stuff I mean the
difference in the illumina collection
seems to be that this shade and the
peach shade have like a little bit of
shimmer there I won't say I see any
glitter not sure if you can tell kind of
what I'm talking about there on this
close-up but just just a little bit of
Sheen in that product is the thing from
Physicians Formula this little concealer
duo is nothing new but just something I
kind of ran across and thought hmmm I'd
like to try that and review that and
it's called the concealer 101 perfecting
concealer duo and I have it in yellow /
Lite has anybody tried this before I
know I've like walked past at multiple
times and just finally decided heck
let's give it a go but it says in the
yellow pant hide under-eye circles and
then cover minor flaws on this side and
I used a little bit of this today so I'm
gonna keep trying it feels kind of
creamy there in the pan it also seems
like a little bit more of a dry finish
compared to some of the other cream
format concealers especially the yellow
for some reason that seems even drier
and a couple of new hair products
miss Krystal makeup I saw her raving
about this boost it I believe this was
the right one crystal boost it high lift
creation spray because she was talking
about something that just really like
held her style well and worked great for
styling and if you tease your hair at
all you don't really holds that and
that's what this claims to do it says
backcombing finisher could use a little
bit of that in this big hair today that
I'm working with so it seemed to work
really well as I styled it so I'm gonna
keep using that it's not a really big
size I kept looking for a larger size
but this five point three ounces seem to
be the only one they had on hand let's
let's get that down there I was added I
picked up a new hairspray this is the
locket weather control hairspray up to
48-hour hold on this again these claims
like how am I gonna test this I'm going
to try this and like vlog in like over
the course of two straight days to show
how this worked but hairspray is really
one of those things that I have not
bounced around on at all I continually
repurchase my Tresemme trade too so just
while I was looking at these new L'Oreal
products I thought I would give this a
shot moving on to Ulta this is a couple
of different Ulta visits by the way one
time when I was there I was there with
Tyler like on a Friday night
wild and crazy Friday nights what was a
body shop stuff was buy two get one free
and we were just going through there and
he'll be like a really good sport and
smell stuff and I honestly think he kind
of likes just smelling things I don't
have a like a body shop store around
here it's just Ulta that carries them so
I know I could order online but if I
want to smell the stuff altas my place
and they always seem to be out of the
peach scent like anytime I want to go
buy they're always out of this but when
we were going there that day there was a
one and it's called vineyard peach this
is the body butter it smells so so juicy
and delicious I mean I've been putting
this like on my growing you know
pregnant belly
and it smells oh just so fresh I mean
it's so good and I left my I got the
shower gel - that was one of the other
things same scent I left it in the
shower but it really just smells so
juicy refreshing authentic peach scent
oh it's really so so good I I just enjoy
that very much I love the texture of it
snick but yeah I really feel like I stay
moisturized for a long time though yeah
I understand now why that's always sold
out so we got this in the shower gel and
then we're just looking for one more
thing of course you've got to finish off
a bike to get one free so I tried this
Shay body mists it says with community
fair trade essence from sugar cane this
stuff smells amazing - we were testing
this out in the store and it's I'm
wearing it today also it's very light I
don't think it's very long-lasting
because I've been wearing this for like
a couple weeks but if you kind of like
that cocoa butter shea butter the sense
of those sorts of lotions is a lot like
those kind of sense but with a little
bit of a perfume II kind of depth to it
you know it's a little bit richer a
little a little deeper I can't really
explain what the suit is that's going on
there but it might be worth a whiff if
you're walking through openin a few
other Ulta things one is this let got it
I got it I was talking about this uh
beauty broadcast live I'm like why have
I not picked this palette up yet I mean
I don't know this is not new guys this
romantic eye palette has been around for
what at least maybe two years and it
just was one of those things I ever
really picked it up I think I looked at
it I thought it was pretty but I never
went for it and then I stumbled across a
great review um through Pinterest which
I will link to that review below and it
totally just I don't know made me feel
the need to go give it a closer look at
Ulta and ultimately I did pick it up but
these are the shades in there they're so
pretty
and I must say some really fabulous
textures sometimes the questionable
thing for me and
these two-faced palates are the
highlights but these are gorgeous this
shade here quite possibly one of the
most beautiful highlight or like inner
corner highlighting shades that I have
used I mean I just love I am wearing
this today I put some of this gorgeous
like pistachio green on the lid it looks
really pretty side by side with that
deep matte plum so that's kind of on my
outer corner blended some of the pink up
above that and then I've got a mix of
both of these purpley shades on the
lower lash line and I just thought wow
so easy to blend varying amounts of
shimmer in here but you do have some
great mattes like these two are matte
these 3 over here are so I just think
it's a lovely palette I'm really thank
you buying it so far and kinda kicking
myself that I've waited till now to give
it a try along with this look I'm
wearing some lashes a little more pricey
for like drugstore false lashes because
they were marked down to like around 5
bucks
and they are the Kardashian beauty
Bardot lashes and I think these are so
pretty
like I just when I glanced at these as I
was walking through the aisles I thought
those are probably gonna look gorgeous
they are really a stunning shape for the
eye and they're kind of like a
three-quarter lash because they are only
coming in on me to about right here and
going out to here so they're a little
bit shorter than a lot of them and I
love how much they taper down so you
really can't see where they begin the
illusion of a lot of thickness down
around your lash line but then look
really nice and kind of feathery as vago
also the band that the lashes are on its
kind of stiff but yet it's very moldable
it's flexible you know you can move it
around sometimes the bands are so stiff
they want to go stick straight and they
won't curve to the shape of your eye
these you can really kind of manipulate
it before you put it on your lash line
and then it's like laying with a nice
gentle curve that you want right a lot
of lashes this to me seems like just a
very well-made set so I like that
cupcake stop by - say hi Karen all the
birdies outside well nice talking to you
what else here a couple of lip products
one is this special collection from
L'Oreal that I ran across it says
collection Prive and it had like all of
these celebrity spokes women or maybe
most of them and they all had like a
signature nude type neutral lipstick
some were really deep there were only
like four a three or four in stock when
I went by and of those the one that
appealed to me the most was JLo Shea
Jennifer's nude this is what that looks
like
haven't worn it yet let's swatch a nude
dusty rose type color I think it'll be
really pretty
last thing I picked up it was kind of
like out of excitement because my Ulta
and I guess all Ulta so now are carrying
Mally for that matter they're also
carrying it cosmetic stuff too so you
can see it and touch it and see what
it's like and I was just going through
it looking at all the Mallee stuff in
person and I've tried a lot of it
honestly but one thing that I haven't
tried was this little lip system
couldn't remember what it was called
ultimate performance lip system and so
it's a liner and then like a lip lacquer
and I got it in the shade make me blush
and so that's what I'm wearing today you
put this liner all over it's a nice
retractable liner and it kind of extends
the wear of this product this lip
lacquer is I think kind of a different
formula from her high shine liquid
lipsticks which kind of click out of
that brush to maybe a little thicker but
not sticky or anything on the lips but
it really is kind of a long wearing
shiny type product I do need to reapply
like after I eat a meal but staying
power all in all is pretty good with
this plus you've got this like liner and
I will fill in my entire lips with the
liner so even after some shine is gone
I've still got color and it's
comfortable so I'm gonna keep trying
this out
I will do a review but I just had to
pick up something in honor and finally
finding malli in OVA so that's all for
this whole everybody thank you so much

of those new products and some old
things that I just hadn't gotten on the
ball with and thank you so much for
