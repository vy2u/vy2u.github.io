of things to talk about here um I've got
an urban decay product that's real new
and interesting I've got a bunch of
accessory items that are like very
special to me because you'll see the
personal twist that's on everything
there and I've got some elf stuff that I
got around the Cyber Monday like
Thanksgiving weekend time when like I
think I got a lot of stuff for either
half off or free shipping there was some
really great deal hooked in with that so
first thing I want to show you is the
new Urban Decay Naked basics this is the
new shadow craze that's out there right
now and you can bet I'll be reviewing
this one trying to find dupes and
whatnot but this is what it looks like
here it's a six shade palette so it's
pretty small I mean it's a really
compact compact here and you're getting
like three light shades a couple
mid-tone colors and a straight-up black
this shade right here the first one it
has a real buttery soft feel and kind of
a satin finish but from what I can tell
the rest of the shades are pretty much
matte and that's foxy which I know
what's in one of the naked palettes I
think the naked 2 walk of shame make it
to faint which is a really nice cool
brown and then crave which is your matte
black so I wore this today actually I
used the light color and then I actually
blended faint and crave to create that
little bit of Darkness smokiness there
in the outer corner obviously very basic
it's nice to have all those kinds of
shades in one place but I'll definitely
be reviewing it and maybe showing you
some looks with that or showing you some
alternatives to this in the future
because the shades are pretty I don't
want to say common because I think the
special thing about urban decay really
nice quality quality texture to the
shadow but the shades are not
necessarily all that unusual so we'll
see what we can come up with there in
terms of some similar colors to that
next up I've got some sort of
accessories slash random things here but
they come from my sister's CafePress
shop a lot of you may know that my
sister Kelly is a watercolor artist she
has amazing paintings her original
paintings are sold obviously they're
pretty expensive but she also says sells
prints as well I'm blessed to have a lot
of her paintings like all over my house
but now her artwork is being put on like
everyday stuff stuff you just use all
the time and it's sold in this CafePress
shop and the prices are really
reasonable and I got some things I had a
little haul from there and I've also got
some gifts that I'm gonna be giving that
come from there but the first thing that
I have is actually one of her pieces of
art here on this little t-shirt and this
is just this is a woman's size medium
t-shirt but it's the fitted style so
it's not quite as big and boxy but this
is one of her paintings here and you can
see all the details and stuff like that
it fits pretty true to size I think so
gorgeous I love you can choose like
different colors and what painting you
want to put on what background and I
just love this one for the pops of pink
that it has in there so I got that was
so excited when my sister had said at
first that there were little compact
mirrors on there I got one of those and
this has her um this is like a painting
she did this is a watercolor of all
kinds of different jewels and stuff and
she's got like a dragonfly in there
rings necklaces earrings and a lot of
this stuff is like old jewelry that's
like been in the family for some time
and she worked it into this watercolor
but it's great it's like a nice slick
finish here you're not gonna like damage
that top part at all but then you've got
two mirrors on the inside usually it
seems like one would tend to be
magnified but I think these are both
just regular mirrors and it just has a
nice little clip there so I love that
I'm totally keeping this one for me but
I think I may purchase a few more of
these I think it was around like 13
bucks or something it's a really nice
weight to it nice quality so I think you
know that's a one-of-a-kind thing I'm
gonna be giving some people and they
won't have anything
I got one of her journals and this is
one of pups watercolors here by the way
my sister her name's Kelly but I call
her pup like that's been my lifelong
nickname for her but I got one of these
little journals and I absolutely love
the way the peacock feather that she has
looks on there and these are kind of
slick like you could wipe those down but
it's just a blank little journal and so
I'm gonna be using this for like my
to-do lists and all that kind of thing
video ideas probably but it's nice
because it's a good per size even if you
don't carry like a giant purse this
would fit in I also got myself some
little note cards here and this these
are adorable to me because these are
these are just little blank note cards
but this is her cat bun a little
tailless cat has gone through a lot of
health issues but as still as sassy as
ever and clearly supervising my sister
as she paints here it's victory but I
thought how cute you know to give
somebody that and then kind of tell them
the story behind you know what that
painting is so I love those and then
I've got a couple of things that I'm
going to give to Tyler for Christmas one
thing is a super cool 2013 watercolor
calendar so you can probably imagine
what the deal is here this is a new
watercolor for every month it's like you
put up a new painting every single month
so I think this will be a great little
office item for him there's not a bad
one in the bunch there's not a dud in
the bunch ooh there's a great look at
the one I was telling you about that's
on the mirror that's the one with all
the jewels and so I mean she's just got
a huge variety the color is great she
picked some really like bold colorful
ones to go in this calendar so I think
that's gonna be great just hanging on
his wall and he he was gonna get some
prints anyway for his office but that'll
be a nice little addition and then the
coffee cup glass gems on there that's
one of her one of my favorite things
that she's done on both sides of the mug
it's printed twice and it's I love that
the finish is so nice and shiny this
particular painting with white gems is
the kind of thing that you look at and
you just
kind of get lost in it it just keeps you
looking and and traveling through the
beautiful like reflections that are on
there so I'm thrilled I gotta say I've
never bought anything from CafePress
before and I think that just you know
this took her artwork which is stunning
and you have such a high standard after
you've seen it large and in person you
know how good it looks but they made her
stuff look pretty darn good in these
other pieces too also mentioned I got
some elves just so many new things that
I wanted to test out and also some
things that I was looking at as
candidates for like stocking stuffers if
I do a video on that which I will and
also like a drugstore makeup gift bag
type thing so I'll just show you real
quick what I got um the first thing kind
of a big thing they've got this gigantic
neutral palette and it's like I think
maybe a hundred and forty shades I don't
really even know but this is huge it's
like every neutral shade ever matte
shimmer metallic even some sparkly ones
a little bit here and there but I
haven't even dipped into this bad boy
yet I just kind of wanted to see quality
wise like how this stacked up if this
was any different than those smaller
like 32 color palettes that I've had
from l.k this is just my thought here
use it for a week like take five days do
a new tutorial every day and then like
make them really quick ones and then
edit them back to back to back to back
like in one video like if you could do
them fast enough and show people you
know it concise enough information
because I really think even though it's
neutral I can see a lot of looks they're
so excited about that I know I've said I
love the contouring blush and bronzer
powder guess what they did it in cream
they've got a cream duo here no shimmer
in either one it's just a peachy type
blush and then a great creamy contouring
process what I've been using to put that
on with this stipple brush pop-up and
then you just kind of blend it in I mean
this works great with this loving this
so far I think this is awesome this
daily moisture stick I got its enriched
with
and anti-aging ingredients grape cocoa
Shea avocado macadamia aloe and
chamomile and I think I've seen
something like this come out from josie
maran I think she has like a moisture
stick or something so this is what it
looks like it's totally totally clear
and I think you could probably use it on
your lips or any area of your skin that
might be a little bit parched so that's
another thing that I kind of need to
play with a little bit see how I like to
use it the best something I have played
with and can tell you I wholeheartedly
think these are so cool are the
long-lasting lustrous eyeshadows I've
got to show you some swatches here real
quick of the ones that I have these have
like a mousse like texture if you
remember when Maybelline used to have
the dream mousse eyeshadows I loved
those I thought those were so great and
then of course they got discontinued so
didn't have them to use anymore but
these have that kind of a softness to
them you know some shadows are real
creamy and they almost feel a little bit
greasy these feel creamy but light now I
still have not worn these on their own
but the way I do like to wear these is
on top of any shadow look to apply just
a little added sparkle I'll just dab
this over it in the tutorial I use this
shade and on't darn it they don't have
the stickers they don't have sticker
saying what shade they are so I'll have
to check them again I think this one's
called soiree this pinky color but see
how reflective it is there's the swatch
right there in my tutorial I just kind
of patted that shade over the outer part
of my eye and it gives such a pretty
sparkle and then I've got this brown
color here and you know I don't remember
the name but as you can see real
chocolatey Brown and it's got that
gorgeous metallic finish and then the
other one I have is kind of like a
charcoal gray these are just highly
highly sparkly shades I am in love with
the texture in fact Matt recently put
something out I say recently but I'm
pretty sure it was months ago electric
cool I shadow and it kind of had that
same finish but also a similar texture
where you can kind of like
press your finger like dent into it a
little bit a little bit lighter than
some cream products very interesting a
little bit mousse like and so that
reminds me a little bit of those new elf
one and finally all kinds of jumbo
shadow sticks to tell you about the
first ones are just the Jumbo eye shadow
stick just watch these so far and they
remind me a lot of the NYX jumbo shadow
sticks but I have them in feeling lucky
which is this sort of brownish shade
it's like a true medium brown I was and
then this gorgeous blue comes off a
little brighter than it looks here in
the pencil but this shade is called like
a boss and when I was deciding what
shades to get i strictly decided on that
due to the name being called like a boss
so I got that have waterproof eyeliner
crayons and in these I got brown and
pitch black
so just in swatching these on my hand
like these seem to be very long wearing
while the other ones you can kind of
smudge across them even after they've
set for a little bit these seem to have
better staying power I'll have to wear
them on my eyes to tell you for sure to
brown for the waterproof is a little bit
deeper Brown and then the black is of
course black black none of these shades
have sparkle they're all just creamy
colors jumbo lipsticks one is pink
umbrella that's the light pink shade
here and movie star is this red so I've
got those swatched right here you can
see they do catch the light they give
off a little bit of shine a little bit
of moisture I've worn just the movie
star shades so far the pigmentation is
pretty good not amazing but it does
remind me a little bit of like the tarte
lipsurgence in terms of color payoff and
stuff like that notice the staying power
is being that good but I'll keep trying
them I mean I've just recently got them
so that wraps up my haul have links down
