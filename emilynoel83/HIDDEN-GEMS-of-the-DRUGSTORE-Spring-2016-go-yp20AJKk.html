me it's a hidden gems of the drugstore
video I love doing these kinds of videos
every so often just bringing attention
to products that I don't feel like get
talked about a whole lot I would call
them underrated but at the same time I
feel like they're more like underrated
because I just don't hear a lot of buzz
about them or maybe in a certain product
line this particular shade doesn't get a
lot of attention and the thing that gets
credit for making me even think about
doing a whole other hidden gems of the
drugstore video is a kind of lipstick
that I am just feeling so enthusiastic
about it's been on the market I think
for quite a while and it's just really
the answer to people who want to wear
like matte or like a near matte satin
finish lip but don't want the discomfort
or dryness of a liquid lipstick and it's
the covergirl outlast long-wear plus
moisture lipsticks where have these been
all my life like these are so so good
they feel nice on the lips they're
really full color there's a little
thickness to them they wear like crazy
and the colors are so beautiful so I
have 5 shades now in this line and
that's just developed over the course of
a couple weeks here because I just I
love the feel I love that I can get bold
matte lips and not really have to worry
about them going anywhere but they are
definitely nowhere near as drying as
many of the liquid lipsticks on the
market so I'm wearing one of them now
I'm so excited about these this is the
shade called red Rouge that I've got on
right now so it's a great red it's
definitely a red you can feel
comfortable wearing because it's just
it's not going to feather and drift
outside your lips the first one I got
was a shade called fireball and I love
this shade so much it's orange it's kind
of orange with a little bit of red going
on it's a great summertime shade so bold
and wonderful on the lips if you're a
fan of Purple's this shade called vixen
violet is one of those great radiant
orchid type colors going back to and
that was like the Pantone shade of the
year this shade is so so pretty on the
lips really vibrant a nice everyday pink
is the shade called magnetic moth again
if you're wanting pink lipstick that's
something that's going to hang around
like the entire day this
work so well and then I also got a
deeper color called
amazing Auburn so a deep kind of reddish
brown one thing that I do think is
definitely missing from this line are
some lighter neutrals mid-tone neutrals
and nudes because there are so many
pretty bright shades even beyond what
I've mentioned here but I think I would
be really thrilled to try like the
perfect nude lipstick in this formula
because it doesn't make your lips look
dry I was wearing that orange one last
Friday and I gone out to lunch with a
friend and we had salad and pizza and I
came back home and looked at my lips and
I'm like what this lasted so well like
that oily salad dressing is the biggest
offender you know as far as breaking
down a lip product even if it's one of
the longest wearing lip products oils
are what break these down so I just
couldn't believe something could feel so
good and be so long wearing and I love
you know those five shades that I have
it in and I also want to throw out
another product here for those of you
who don't necessarily want the fullest
color lipstick something just a little
bit lighter that feels more like a balm
I tried one of these covergirl lips
licks smoochies and I remember trying
these when they came out and if you look
at the full range in a drugstore you can
see there are a lot that seem like they
might be clear lip balms you know you
can just tell by looking at them but
then there are a few that are really
pretty colorful and this is one of them
it's the one called hashtag double
they're definitely not as long wearing
is what I mentioned but if you just want
something more lightweight I'm just
really getting back into the orange
shades this time of year so I love that
color a blush that I would like to
recommend and I am wearing it today it's
a little bit on the bronzy side and it's
from the Milani baked blush line and I
know I definitely like kind of counted
this out as soon as I got it I remember
thinking oh it just looks like bronzer
in a blush size what's the point this is
a shade called bellissimo bronze and
it's got you know like a lot of peachy
golden as' to it and it really does make
a beautiful blush I'm loving the way
this looks it's not too too shimmery but
it definitely has a glow on the skin it
looks
really nice paired with the highlight I
think this would be awesome on kind of
tan bronzy tones skin to begin with as
you can see I can wear it today paired
with the red lip and I think it looks
really fresh so that's one to maybe look
into if you've been overlooking it I
know I'm guilty of overlooking that one
for a long time just a little concealer
shout out here to anyone who was sad
that the cover girl concealer balm it's
the covergirl plus ole a concealer ball
it was in a dark purple tube that have
been discontinued I know I'd raved about
it as being a really nice creamy stick
concealer and more recently I tried
their covergirl smoothers stick
concealer I have this here in the shade
light and it feels like the exact same
product nice creamy stick concealer it's
not going to be necessarily the highest
level of coverage okay it's it's still
good coverage and I think for minor
problems for blemishes for a little bit
of redness here and there for a
moderately dark under-eye I think this
can do good things but for example the
way I used it today I still corrected my
under eye with a peachy tone corrector
and then just for some all-around
brightness right in that area I use this
so it's very smooth easy to blend and
work with doesn't look too heavy on the
skin and if you really were into the
concealer balm
this may be one that you want to pick up
I am testing out a loose powder from
L'Oreal it's called Hydra perfect and
I'm wearing it in the shade light this
powder I think can only be found at
Walmart that's the only place I found it
and then when I look online it's only on
Walmart's website but I've used this for
kind of setting the under-eye area I've
tried it from both a baking method where
you're really laying it on thick and
kind of letting it sit on top of a
creamy concealer or I've just you know
kind of lightly set the under-eye and I
do think it gives a very perfected look
to that area it does mattify I'm trying
to decide if it feels a great deal
lighter than the airspun powder I do
think this powder has been on the market
for a long time don't hear a lot of
people say things about it and you know
that may be because it's being sold in
like one store but I tried a lot of
products on the under eye area and I
feel like you know this being not
completely translucent
it adds like a little hint of coverage
but it's not too heavy a couple of
little drugstore eyeshadow products that
I think are so fun I'm so glad I
stumbled across these and this one is
from covergirl it's the quad in gold
mine and I'm not really sure why they
gave it that name but I guess it is kind
of a little gold mine that I found this
my hidden gem I'll call it my hidden
gold but this is a really beautiful quad
honestly the star of the show is this
like brownish color here because I'm
wearing that in the crease and sheared
out up above and it has this beautiful
like reddish mob undertone to it it's so
unexpected it's so beautiful and it
looks really great paired with that pink
I've got some of the pink on the lid
some of the brownish color into the
crease and just sheared way way out up
into that you know above the brow bone
area I blend it over the border with a
little bit of this shade which is just
kind of like a soft beige I just used it
it's a blended out type color it doesn't
have a whole lot of impact and then I
smudged some of the brownish shade down
below so essentially for the most parts
like a two shadow look between these two
today but the other day I pulled in some
of this mint green and I had it just on
the inner part of the lid and I thought
it was so cool and it doesn't look that
great in a swatch I thought it might be
kind of a dud type color but just Pat it
on with the sponge tip applicator make
sure you use a primer I use my Milani
eyeshadow primer Pat that color on and
it's so surprising how beautiful that is
just keep in mind as a whole like if you
want to compare these textures to the
balm or urban decay and they're not
going to have that level of intensity
and for some people that's a good thing
like you don't want the deepest darkest
look but I feel like this is plenty of
impact and almost a little more than I
would have expected especially from that
color right there I just love when I
find a fun shadow quad like that that
should be like a whole other video fun
Shanta quads a little fun trio that I
found that I didn't even know was out it
might be a new addition to NYC's line
because I do have several of their
little trios that I've really liked and
this one is called Battery Park Brown
and I find each shade in here to be
really pretty good there's this creamy
soft beige you've got a metallic taupe
and then a really nice dark deep Brown
so you could get a very pretty neutral
smoky eye for this the shades aren't you
know very warm at all so if you do like
the cool brownish gray taupe type eyes
you might enjoy this I just wanted to
point that out because I didn't know if
it's been part of the line and I've been
overlooking it for some time or if it's
just you know a new addition that they
threw out but it is really nice so that
concludes this round of hidden gems of
the drugstore I hope you ran into some
products in this video that you maybe
hadn't thought about trying before I
really absolutely adore those covergirl
lipsticks the outlast lipsticks so so
good and so non drying and just really
fresh fun colors thank you guys so much
for your time and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
