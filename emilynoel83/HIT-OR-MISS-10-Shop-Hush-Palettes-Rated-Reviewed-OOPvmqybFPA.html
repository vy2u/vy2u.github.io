tuning in today in my laps it's a stack
of ten I shadow palettes I got these
from the shop hush website this is also
an app and basically they're selling
really really cheap makeup cheap
sometimes gets a negative connotation
and lower cost makeup I will say like
kind of drugstore price range stuff they
sell a variety of different brands on
there but I think the thing that they're
becoming best known for right now a
variety of knockoff type pallets so
they're taking really popular pallets
from different high-end brands they're
recreating them and several of these
brands I think are doing it really
really well particularly bad habit I
will be showing swatches of everything
as I go pictures of the different looks
that I've done with all of these pallets
along the way since I have ten pallets
to talk about and I think everything is
going to be so jam-packed in this video
I'm not gonna do a tutorial however I
would love to hear in the comments
section if there is a pallet that I
talked about that you'd love to see in a
demo I do have some plans for some more
colorful pallets actually in a special
video coming up and also there's one of
these pallets that I used recently in my
get ready with me videos so if you'd
like to see it in action you can check
that out but I was trying to kind of
organize my thoughts on these pallets
last night and I thought let's do like a
1 to 10 rating system one being the
worst ten being the best just give each
pallet sort of a rating so if it's 1 to
5 which I do have one 5 in my lineup but
nothing goes below 5 if it's 5 its
average above 5 would be above average
and obviously 10 would be like perfect
and I got some tints I got some proud
tends to talk about like I'm not just
searching for something that's good here
if it was all you know not good stuff
I'd let you know too but I've been very
impressed so let's start out here and
talk about this one that I got from the
brand called Beauty creations first off
how cute is this packaging we're talking
kind of the size and shape of a Too
Faced chocolate bar type palette and all
this colorful candy type design and then
on the inside this is what it looks like
I kind of warm neutrals there are mattes
they're shimmers I'm not really sure
that this particular palette is trying
to directly copy something else if it is
I'm not sure was speaking of
oops in this video I only have a couple
of actual high-end palates that certain
ones here are duping I thought you know
if these turn out to be good I don't
need a ton of overlap in my collection
we'll just kind of judge these you know
as they are are they a good palette yes
or no but back to this one I think there
are some really good standout shades
here I really truly like the look that I
turned out there are a couple of shades
that are a little bit pinky in the midst
of all this kind of orange ii brown this
color called jolly here and candy down
here at the bottom kind of a plum ii
shade with a little bit of pink in that
as well so i think there were some
surprising positives with this palette
but it is $18 so we're not talking dirt
cheap here right some of the lighter
shades while some were fine some were a
little more faint than I would have
expected or would have hoped to see here
so I would rate this one at a six I
think it's just above average and what
I'm taking into consideration with my
ratings would be pigmentation and the
ease of application what I thought of my
finished looks the consistency
throughout the palette just how
consistent were all the different
finishes whether they were matte or
shimmer was everything consistently good
also the packaging and the design which
I was impressed with a lot of the
packaging of different things that I
tried and the price / values so
especially considering that this is a
nearly $20 palette it's got a lot of
fairly common shades so I'd give it a 6
now here's a brand that you're gonna see
a lot on the shop push website it's
called Oh :
and I got one palette from this line
it's called the metals palette as you
can see it's got an Urban Decay Naked
type shape although I'm not sure that
this palette again is exactly duping
anything what we have here is a full
lineup of shimmers so everything here
some of them look really metallic you
know the golds and coppers and stuff
just a full lineup of shimmery shades
and I actually found it to be very
consistent one shade to the next they
seem to all perform a lot alike I didn't
find them to be difficult to use or
blend out this is a $10 palette and I
think that's a pretty good buy but at
the same time I also you know how I feel
about palettes that seems sort of
unfinished like they may not necessarily
give you the full finished look that
you're after I mean I did a look with
this and this alone but it's always nice
to have
mix of matte and shimmer so I give this
one a seven a lot of what that score is
coming from I think is consistency the
pigmentation is really nice you need
this palette a lot of these shades do
show up in other palettes where you do
end up with sort of a matte shimmer mix
next up we do have my lowest ranked
palette I rank this one at a5 it's from
beauty treats and it's the 24 rose gold
palette really large palette here kind
of the cheapest looking packaging now
beauty treats has put out some actually
really good surprisingly good palettes
that I found from like five below and I
Kate house and stuff but this palette
that I tried I thought it looked really
promising just this whole color scheme
seemed to be the type of thing that
would appeal to me but there are a few
reasons why this definitely kept getting
docked down some of the shimmers like
these two up here this gold and the pink
it's like you put your brush into them
and they're very very like chunky
meanwhile there were some other shimmery
shades that were quite smooth so a lot
of inconsistency where that's concerned
and then there were a couple of shades
here that were highly shimmery and when
I first watched him I thought wow those
looks so brilliant look a little closer
and I'm 95% sure that there's kind of an
overspray on these two colors here see
how different they look where they've
been swatched and applied and you kind
of dig into the color a little bit and
you're losing some of that brilliance
that was sitting on top there and over
sprays a real pet peeve of mine because
I think that's so deceiving you look at
the swatches and I think you'll see what
I mean like some of these colors are
just a little too faint and looking at
all of what you have to choose from from
this website there are definitely some
better choices that you can make I mean
this palettes $12 that's not a super
high price tag but you will find better
as you'll see from what I continue to
talk about here so yeah I ranked this
one at a 5 didn't hate the look I turned
out with it could probably do several
other really decent looks but it's
straight up average for me okay now
we're gonna move into a bunch of stuff
from bad habit so bad habit is a line
from this website that I think is really
just kill it they're doing some great
stuff the packaging I mean I love the
way their pallets are packaged they
don't seem cheap you know they seem like
they've been somewhat thoughtfully
designed
there's a nice weight to everything for
example in this midsummer night palette
it's got a nice big mirror in there this
is sort of the dupe palette you might
say of the Too Faced natural love but
what's kind of interesting is that they
don't lay out all the shades in
identical places you know so they've
mixed it up somewhat but I could still
absolutely tell at a glance that that
was the palette that this was sort of
fashioned after so we've got a huge mix
of matte and shimmer tons of neutrals a
Pink's some soft lilacs some really
really deep shades like all of greens
and that Browns they've even got the
same color you know from the toothpaste
one that seemed to be sort of a plum
with a blueish shimmer when I was
looking palette to palette I won't say I
found an exact like duplicate for every
single shade in there but I did find a
lot of closeness even closeness in just
the feel of some of the colors and as
you look at the swatches I do think
there's a lot of consistency you can see
some really bold shimmers you can see
some softer more pearlescent shades some
really rich matte colors I was a fan you
know the original Too Faced natural love
palette so obviously this is a color
scheme that appeals to me bad habits
gonna charge you 16 dollars for this and
I gave it an 8 the reason being was
because when I was really trying to
scrutinize the way some of these went on
I do feel like two-face has somewhat of
a superior matte texture they apply and
pick up onto your brush like SuperDuper
evenly and I would classify all the
mattes in here is very soft as well but
I think you have to be just a bit more
careful with them because they can kick
up a little more fallout some
outstanding mattes that if you just have
a little patience with them if you just
pick up and build up little by little
which is my general way of applying
eyeshadow already you're probably gonna
really like them but there is that
tendency to kick up a little extra
powder eNOS and sixteen dollars you know
that they're not giving it away so all
things considered I rank this at an
eight next up from bad habit we've got
the Aphrodite palette and this is the
one that I believe is fashioned after
the Hugh de Beauty rose gold palette
she's got a couple of larger palettes
right the one that I have always talked
about is being kind of the sunset eyes
that desert dusk and
this is the one that I never actually
bought from the Hooda line so I thought
I'll get that from bad habit and if I
love it then I won't even have to pursue
the other one and I must say this is
very impressive so so much intensity
with these colors it's a color scheme
that I definitely am drawn to I love the
Pink's the Reds the blush tones in here
as well there are some shimmers that you
just need to know like you have to have
some patience with I rank this palette
at a nine and the only reason why I
would have docked it in any way is that
there is some flakiness with some of
these ultra metallic shades and just a
little word of advice as you're applying
these some shades some really metallic
shimmery shades from the bad habbit
palettes I noticed when you're applying
them let's say to your lids with a flat
brush don't just try to like go pat pat
all over which you might have tended to
do with a lot of things I find they
actually go on better when I press them
like immediately take the brush to your
lid press it in and give it just a teeny
bit of a tug just a little drag to the
brush and then you'll see things laying
down more like what you see in the
swatch but there are really only a
couple of shapes like these kind of top
to right over here that I feel that way
about like just a little bit hard to
control but the mats are spectacular
like I just love the type of look that
this palette turns out again a mirror on
the inside a real sort of expensive feel
to it if someone just handed this to me
I wouldn't have necessarily predicted
that the cost was what only twelve
dollars if you like this color scheme
it's absolutely worth it next up I got a
sixteen dollar palette that is seeming
to dupe a Natasha de Nona style palette
this one's called solstice and I know
she has the Lila palette which I do have
that particular one and I reviewed that
I wasn't necessarily as impressed as I
thought I'd be with that palette Natasha
de Nonna palettes are super expensive so
I really just expected a ton out of it
and while I thought the quality of the
lot of the shades was really good I
thought the color scheme left a little
bit to be desired but this one this is
the warm palette that I do not have from
Natasha to notice and look at what's
happening in here I mean this may be
like the ultimate war
toned palette you've got red you've got
burnt orange you've got really bright
yellow in a couple of finishes a matte
and a really light kind of yellowy
almost orangie gold to the shimmers in
here will knock your socks off you look
at them in the palette and yes they seem
you know like they would be good shades
but you see him in a swatch and it's
like they absolutely glow here's what's
causing me to give this palette a nine
instead of a ten I feel like this would
have even more versatility if instead of
a couple of dark Browns down here
they offered maybe one or two other deep
rich shades that could sort of change
the direction of things with this
palette right because it's very red very
orange you do get those two Browns to
help anchor the look which are very dark
and rich and I appreciate that but
wouldn't it be cool to maybe even have
one like burgundy in here or maybe one
purple like a deep plum purple I don't
know I just feel like you're a little
bit limited just because Browns are the
only dark tone you have to work with but
that's just my own opinion considering
the quality and everything else this is
a $16 palette I think it's worth every
penny and more and so I rank it at a 90
now we're going to talk about these
little gems and these are also kind of
duping the huda beauty smaller palettes
that she's come out with the obsessions
palettes I own one of them I have the
mauve obsessions and these are gonna
sell for $10 each or you can get a
bundle of these all four of them which I
did for $30 total and I think that's a
steal I think these are so so fantastic
some of my favorite things that I've
tried let me just go through and talk
about each one we've got one called
after hours and isn't the outer
packaging gorgeous by the way like I
feel like that looks absolutely
brilliant and then again you open it up
you've got the mirror they're a little
bit bigger in size than a hooter one the
shades are spread out just a bit more
but your after-hours palette is the one
that goes very rosy reddish muff this is
the one that I used in my date night get
ready with me so if you want to see this
going on like I thought it was a great
look actually I would have maybe
improved a little bit on a couple of
these shimmery shades and the way they
actually built up on the eyes being
super picky here but I think you know
there could have been a bit
more ease with a couple of those shades
and eye contact in comparison to the
richness of everything else in here I
thought that shade could have been a
little stronger that's why I'm ranking
this palette at a nine but overall like
the color scheme if you enjoy Reds and
pinky colored shades I mean this was
like an ideal Valentine's Day look it's
an absolutely beautiful palette I really
loved it then we have after party might
be my favorite palette out of everything
that I'm talking about here like I have
not tried the hooter high-end version of
this but this is spectacular
like I love what's going on here with
the metallics they are just dynamite and
I also like how when you glance at this
you might think oh there's a cool
palette no this morning after shade
which is so close to kind of like
swatching along with my skin tone that
it might not even show up enough but
that is brilliant in the crease kind of
blending out the edge of a look because
it gives this little splash of warmth to
it if you want to plus you've got
trouble here which is this bronzy gold
hairspray is a beautiful like champagne
with a little pink in it tip sees a
great toe black outs great and again
these dark shades while you might treat
them with a little bit of care you know
these mats you need to tap your brush in
don't pick up too much tap off the
excess build up slowly treat these like
you would treat I would say a lorac
eyeshadow but they work wonderfully well
this palette is just so gorgeous so
absolutely I'm giving this a 10 for sure
it's so impressive it's such a great
neutral palette but it's warm and cool
world into one next up
aftershock this one you guys like it's
what you see is what you get it is 100%
what you see is what you get the way
this swatch out the way these apply on
the eyes they look just like that I mean
this yellow a yellow is a great test of
I think a brand's pigmentation and
ability to really deliver on the color
they're hoping to give you and that
yellow is everything your mats are
basically everything right through here
and then these three are your shimmers
so you've got a purple like a true blue
and then a turquoise up here those are
your three shimmery shades and they're
both equally good both finishes like the
look that I did with this I loved it so
much I
worked in you know the warm oranges and
pinks in my crease
I popped some purple in there and it's
just it's undeniable whether you like
color this bold or not it's undeniable
that this palette is a ten like it's
absolutely amazing if you just want a
little bit of color in your makeup
arsenal if you don't want to buy like
some massive palette that gives you a
freaking rainbow of shades you get this
little guy and it's like okay if I want
that shade or that shade I can just plug
it in to another look you don't have to
use this as a free-standing palette
although I did and I love the look and
then the last one we have is the after
dark palette so again with that
beautiful theme I love the continuity of
that theme in the outer packaging but
after dark is your warm palette and I
would say I prefer this even just this
size and this amount of shades and this
particular grouping of shades over that
solstice palette that's duping the
Natasha de Nona you're lower on shimmer
here but it doesn't really bother me
because the one shimmer is absolutely
brilliant and it's the middle shade it's
a true gold and everything around it is
matte I wish I would have tried this
even before I tried that naked petite
heat because this you know this might be
a better way to go even than the petite
heat actually I'm pretty sure of it it's
$10 and I rate this at a true 10 in my
lineup because look at this look that
I've got like that brilliant gold on the
lid the mattes were so easy to blend
going in I thought maybe this won't have
quite enough versatility but yet like
the difference between this orange up
here and this kind of like rosy peach
down here that's pretty profound when
you're creating a look and that can take
you in a couple of really different
directions I love that with your dark
shades it's not just a dark brown but
also this beautiful Merlot color here
for as small as it is I think it's
surprisingly versatile and so so well
executed and keep in mind again that
method with the metallic shade press
your brush directly onto your lid and
give it a little tug and you will see
all that beautiful color from the
metallic shade transfer over and then
with mattes you know it's all about just
kind of patting in the color building up
little by little so did we have some
good findings here or what I think there
were some fantastic finds so
to review let's go through from lowest
ranking to highest ranking that beauty
treats 24 rose gold that was at a five
for me the beauty creations sugar sweets
palette a six the Oakland metals palette
was a seven that had it Midsummer Night
palette I gave that an eight
I gave nines to the bad habit Aphrodite
solstice and After Hours palette and
then the tens for me were the
after-party aftershock and after dark
palettes if you can get that whole
bundle that for $30 those four pallets I
think you will be so so set where
eyeshadow is concerned I think that's
probably the best value that I can see
on their website I would love to know
from you guys what have you tried have
you tried anything that I haven't
were you surprised in a good way or a
not-so-good way from different things
let me know in the comments section and
I will talk to you again very soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
