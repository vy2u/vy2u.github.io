joining me new camera I'm still
adjusting to it I'm still reading
through the text book of instructions
that accompany this thing hopefully I
can keep things in focus for you but
this is kind of my first actual video
other than a little test video that I
did using this camera so please bear
with me as I keep learning it's really
so strange talking to this camera I feel
like I'm talking to a new friend here in
front of me like it is not the same old
thing I was used to talking to but what
is this video about
I placed an order on Amazon during their
prime day isn't so I got some really
good deals and I thought it might be a
good opportunity to try out some of the
different Beauty things that are offered
there now obviously Amazon is going to
sell some beauty stuff that's sold
elsewhere there are certain brands on
there that we're all very familiar with
and it doesn't really make a difference
where you get it from but the things
that I wanted to get in this sale were
things that I don't really see outside
of Amazon and so I want to talk about
some of those I got a couple pallets I
got a little storage things and
eyelashes some things actually I got on
recommendation of a lures little article
that they put out notice they had some
stuff on there so I took a couple of
those recommendations also I want to let
you know that I am going to be doing a
Nordstrom sale like recommendations what
I got type video the thing is I'm
waiting on the stuff to come in and it
was supposed to come in like two days
ago I'm still waiting on it so it will
be one of my next videos I just want to
have the stuff here to show and talk
about some of the things like I've tried
before and I know their favorites of
mine but I still want to have them to
show you so the first thing and this was
a recommendation from allures is a 50
fall slash set from gold rose beauty it
comes in a no frills box you just pull
out these different trays and bare your
lashes so there are 1 2 3 4 5 different
styles and you're getting 10 lashes in
each style this is my first time doing a
real like big lash order where you know
you're just getting tons and tons of
sets like this I took the recommendation
from allure because I really didn't know
where to begin and I got a good deal on
these they're actually selling this set
for I think was a
50 bucks or something that seems really
high to me but I ended up getting it at
around $20 or maybe a little less this
is the style that I'm wearing today
really long like kind of a lush lash
look they've also got a very similar
style to that that I haven't tried yet
that's a little more maybe thickness got
a style that's a little bit more flared
out toward the outside on these it's
very evident like where the longer
chunks are you know they're a little
more PC there's this style that I really
think I'm going to like this very
crisscross II with the lashes and I
think that'll result in a very kind of
wispy a little bit more irregular look
that's kind of what I like and I think a
lot of the really popular more expensive
lash styles that many people gravitate
toward don't have such a perfect cut to
them you see them sort of Criss crossing
and looking a little bit wispy like that
so that's cool to see and then on the
style that I wore yesterday is flared
out the most I would say at the outside
he's kind of remind me of a demi
whispies style but more length overall
the thing that I found with these lashes
well they seem to be good quality it
seems like the way they cut them is very
consistent I've gotten some cheap lashes
here and there where like one lash looks
totally different from the other that
kind of these seems nice I would say
where you run into some issues maybe or
at least I did with both pairs is that
you kind of want to bend them a little
bit you want to get them working toward
that natural shape of your eye and I
think part of the reason why is because
these are only tacked down to their
little holder here in two places just on
the outside so when you end up taking
one of these lashes off they really want
to straighten out quite a bit and so
once you get your glue on there you've
kind of got to bend it into that you
shape somewhat so it starts to mesh with
the shape of your eye I think if you're
the type that really settles into liking
one particular lash style obviously not
every lash and this kit is going to suit
you you know you're going to have some
that are your favorites some that you
don't like so much I can already tell I
like this lash that I'm wearing today
better than this one that I wore the
other day just because I don't know I
feel like this band is even maybe a
little more flexible not too flexible I
trim the lashes down just a little bit
from the outsides and they seem to just
be a good fit for the eye
another thing that comes
with this by the way that I haven't even
used yet but I think is super handy is
one of those lash applicator tools like
a stainless steel type lash applicator
so very much like that one from BH
Cosmetics that I've talked about before
that's definitely a nice tool to have if
you're starting out and you're going to
see me continue to wear some of these in
some of my other videos plus I usually
get multiple uses out of a pair of
lashes I think I'm going to have these
for a while so I would say yes I'm
pretty happy with that deal although I
can tell they're going to be certain
lashes that I like better than others
it's my camera crooked nice time to be
noticing that right next thing that I
want to talk about is wonder brow seems
to be really popular on Amazon I wanted
to try it for myself
it says one-step brow gel perfect
eyebrows that last for days and claims
to be a blend of hairlike fibers
combined with specially treated pigments
designed to fasten onto skin and hair so
basically you're getting a tube of what
you would assume it's like a brow gel
but it comes out with a brush and I have
it this in what shade the black brown
color and you'll see that's not
extremely dark it's kind of cool you
would look at it and define this shade
as black brown but that's what they call
it and basically you just run this
through your brow this color which is
not sheer at all it's very opaque so I
think you have to be very careful with
that step and then you brush it through
with the brush now I did my left brow
with the Wonder brow because I use
something different on the other that
I'll talk about in a second for me
discovered a scar on the outer part of
my brow did a great job of it but do I
need a ton of product elsewhere in my
brow not so much so I've got it have a
really light hand with this I think it
could be a good idea to actually use a
small angled brush and pick up some
product off of this wand and then put it
on like I'm thinking of those who don't
have much of a brow to begin with
to make this look natural you might want
to go in with an applicator that lets
you pace yourself a bit more but then
once you get it on you take your spoolie
wand and that does kind of help work it
on through the hold you can notice the
hold immediately like it really holds my
brows in place I love how it does that
because then I'm not pulling for another
step on top of it and that whole claim
about brows that last for days
yeah
I had to use an actual you know
oil-based eye makeup remover to take
that off I was in the shower I was
trying to you know get it off with my
equate daily face wash cloths and it
could not touch the brow product I could
feel that the stuff was still in there
and it just would not take any of it off
so if you've got removers that you know
have that kind of oil mixture they're
like this one's from Smashbox put a
little bit of that on a cotton round
then you can see it's starting to come
off but this stuff is definitely in it
for the long haul and I could see this
being good product for people who work
in harsh conditions you really want your
brow to stay on like the staying power
is real with this stuff I think it's
just a matter of can you find a good way
to apply it that's really going to look
natural I feel like I got it to look you
know natural and soft and not like too
much in my brow let's talk about what's
happening with the other brow this was
another one of those recommendations
that I saw from a lure and I thought
okay I'll go with it I may not have
necessarily felt the need for this
product but they were kind of raving
about it so I thought okay I've never
tried anything from this brand
Aesthetica and it's the contour series
brow it's got a little guide book it's
got the diagram really nice quality
pictures and instructions here so this
brand seems to be very instruction based
and I think that's cool and then the
setup of everything on the inside
reminds me so much of something I had
from Anasazi I think it was called like
Beauty Express for brows or something
because it has the whole shebang here
it's got multiple shades that could
really be mixed and I think achieved
just about any brow color you want it's
got a light highlighting shade they give
you a wax they give you an actual
concealer to really like carve out the
brow you've got the double ended brush
with the spoolie and the angle brush
stencils in here and a really legit set
of tweezers use these tweezers today
with the slant tip thought they did a
fantastic job so there's a lot in this
kit and I used it on my other brow and I
was mainly kind of using this dark brown
color here I think if you want to cool
it down you go to one of these shades as
well and just kind of bounce around and
mix but I put the wax on there first to
give the powder a little something to
hold on to and when you get done with
that
going to have some hold to your brows
with the wax but it's not going to be
near what the Wonder brow hold was so
that's a huge concern for you you know
when you're using powders it's just a
softer process so you might go over it
with a separate gel at the end I did not
get into the stencils yet I'm thinking I
might try that just for fun sometime the
quality of the angled brush with the
spoolie is nice and I use these powders
as my eye shadow today I just thought
what the heck let's see how they double
up and they did well paid around 20
bucks for this in the sale and I think
that's a fantastic deal for something
that's giving you so much bottom line
with brows it's just like the hair on
your head everybody's going to have
different needs different preferences
it's going to be a more forgiving and I
think softer look on the brows when
you're using wax and powder to fill them
in it's just a very like educational
little kit there but then with the
Wonder brow I think this is catering to
a very specific need with needing
amazing staying power with your brow
product and if you're pretty competent
with the whole fill in process and
making it look natural in general I
think you'd be able to you know make
this work really easily and being kind
of a one-step thing the simplicity might
be what some of you are after so I just
wanted to say I really like both of
these brows things but I think they each
fit a different need or preference the
other thing that I got from Aesthetica
and this was just something I saw as I
looked through you know the things that
were on sale it's the strobe series
radiate palette it says tan to dark and
I didn't know I was getting that shade
range I think they also described this
one is rose gold it totally works on my
skin which surprised me once I realized
I had the tan too dark I thought oh no
this is going to not function as a
highlight for me but it really does
another thing that's made me wonder is
what would the light one even do for me
I kind of want to test that one out just
to see but a strange thing is happening
with me with highlighting products
because I felt like I went through this
phase where tons of highlight palettes
were coming out and I was just sort of
over it wasn't finding them to be all
that interesting or different and now
like I don't know I'm sort of falling in
love with highlight palettes all over
again but just like the brow saying this
comes with an entire kit you've got your
little like guide of where to place the
products it
a really cool face shaped diagram here
to show you where to put like contours
and highlights and stuff and another
thing this came with is this liquid
strobe spectrum pen and I applied this
first and this is kind of like I don't
know a soft golden peachy gold not
glittery and I put that on top of my
cheeks and just blended it out with my
ELF small stipple brush and you can
certainly stop there with that step or
you can layer on some of these pans
which appear to lift out but there
they're in there really securely I'm not
sure how to get them out but you got
these four shades this one I wore the
other day as a blush and I thought it
was so pretty this is the deepest most
pigmented peachy shade and then all the
rest of these act as a highlight for me
this is probably the brightest one and
this is the one that I topped off that
liquid with and it's just so gorgeous I
was wearing this and my get ready with
me video the other day and I am loving
the texture of these I love how they end
up looking on the skin certainly seeing
some shimmer like this is some of the
most intense highlighting stuff powder
wise that I own so if I look up really
close at my skin yeah I can tell that
there is product there but as part of
that pearlescent look on my skin I'm not
seeing flecks of glitter I'm not seeing
like actual pieces particles of glitter
in it it's just more of a pearlescent
look on the skin I guess and you see it
a lot with this shade you see a little
less with these and like I said for if
you're my skin tone or lighter this
color is probably going to be a blush
for you honestly my experience with this
brand makes me want to try more I got an
email afterwards and said like welcome
to aesthetic oh we see you've made an
order on Amazon let us know if anything
and the kid is not to your liking or
whatever like they wanted customer
feedback they seemed like a really
legitimately good brand and so I'm glad
I've tried what I've tried and I want to
try more try try try the final thing
that I got as part of my little Amazon
Prime day situation is this organizer
this is from story and it's the clear
multi-level makeup palette organizer
I'll link to all this stuff below but I
don't know that I got this on any
particular recommendation I just saw
that it was one of the discounted prime
item
as you can see we're looking at four
levels here and I thought this would be
cool for you know just storing pallets
that's how they showed it in the
pictures also looks like it could fit
nail polishes you could stand up lip
products in here you can go like with
these Aesthetica pallets for example
these are a pretty standard width for a
pallet and you can go like two deep
there with that I'm using a small basket
to hold some different palettes that I
want to like not forget to use and stuff
and I feel like this would just be a
better way to store them so I can see
what I've got better it'll just spread
it out a little bit more so I think what
I'm looking for a way to display those
kind of shot my stash items particularly
the pallets this will be nice to have
here just kind of on the corner of my
table where I can really see everything
so as you can see here I've got a lot of
cool fines experimenting with some new
Amazon Beauty things I really would love
to hear your feedback in the comments
section if you've tried any of the stuff
I've tried what are your recommendations
like I think that will be the best thing
to come from this video is just the
dialogue in the comments section like if
you tried other stuff from Aesthetica
are there other lines that I might not
know about being sold on Amazon that I
should test out thing I'm personally
most excited about it's probably the
little highlight phallic event that's
just so beautiful and fun and just that
aesthetic a brand in general I'm really
happy with the thing that I might be
most on the fence about I mean this last
set is pretty dang cool they are a lash
band that does require you to work with
a little bit get it kind of bent into
your shape and then I think with
multiple wears it will form to your lash
line really nicely but you've got to
kind of work with it some of the styles
seem a little longer left to right than
others so you may need to trim up
certain ones and you know we've all just
got our favorite lashes oh so you're not
going to be in love with every single
one in that kit probably but thank you
guys so much for watching this video I
hope you enjoyed and I'll see you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
