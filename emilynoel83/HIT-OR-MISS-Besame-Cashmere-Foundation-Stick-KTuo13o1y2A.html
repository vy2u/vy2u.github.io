today for this foundation review it's a
review on the new Besame stick
foundation when I first heard they were
coming out with the foundation I was
like yes I was so glad to see that this
brand is branching out into things
beyond you know lipsticks blushes and
into something more coverage related I
was really excited to see what they
would do and I instantly thought okay
they're going to put out a stick
foundation what is this inspired by and
I thought about that maxfactor pan stick
and sure enough I went to their website
and they said that the pan stick from
the 1940s ish time I think yes says
that's when the first stick foundations
were used they were called pan stick and
they were full coverage foundations that
came in a stick for ease of application
they also say it would make contouring
for film and photography much simpler
and so if you're not familiar with Besim
aids line what they're all about is
taking like a vintage concept and
putting it into their like modern
formulas I think Besame is such a unique
line I love this brand it's a brand I
love supporting so as soon as these
foundations launched I bought them I've
been trying them out for almost a month
now and I got to tell you if I would
have done a first impressions video I
know people were really eager for a
review on these right away but it
wouldn't have been accurate at all like
there are so many little things that I
figured out about these as I've used
them ways that I think they work great
certain things I can do with them to
make them far from great you know so I
really want to share all that
information with you in this video
packaging on these is just beautiful
it's got this kind of vine and floral
type design that you see on the outside
of their lipsticks only instead of
having any burgundy on this it's just
all gold and I think it's really really
pretty every part of the packaging is
gold and these stick foundations are
going to run you $25 a piece right now
they're only being sold on BET's amaze
website I think that price is extremely
fair I mean we're talking about pretty
much only $10 more than some of the
newest drugstore foundations that are
out there and all the claims for this
say matte finish full coverage feather
light fragrance free vegan non
comedogenic cruelty free paraben free
and made in the USA they come in eight
shades
and they say that they can be used for
foundation concealer highlighting or
contouring use them on their owner mixed
together to create different shades when
I first got mine what I was judging by
for the shade was like this color swatch
picture that they had accompanying each
of the sticks and I found that a little
bit hard to figure out what shade I was
now if you go to Best amazed website
there's a little submit your photo area
underneath you know where you find the
actual stick and the color and you can
see where a bunch of different shades
have been swatched out and I think now
if you were looking for one it would be
much easier to see like what the
gradient is of color but I ended up
purchasing two because I was so unsure
at first so I got true beige which is
number 807 and that is the one that I've
turned out to use is like my all-over
foundation color the other one that I
picked up is natural beige and that's
808 and it's a little bit lighter and
when I first got these I thought perfect
this will be my foundation and I'll use
this one it's like my brightening top of
the cheekbones concealer now I'm not
saying that that's a totally failed
ideas I think you need to be really
really careful when layering on too much
of this foundation because staying power
can become a real concern so I'm going
to get into the staying power in just a
little bit but first off just talking
about this formula and the way it feels
going on now pan stick I'm not sure if
tons of other brands we're making this
alongside Max Factor but Max Factor's
specific pan stick is the product I
think about it's been years since I've
tried that but I remembered it being a
very slick foundation stick kind of
greasy and definitely made my skin look
greasy as I wore it but the coverage was
beautiful it would look like really nice
right after you put it on and blend it
in the best word I can use to describe
that is there is a gray Cena stew that
product this is a situation where I
think Besame has definitely made an
improvement on an older concept with
this product because it goes on a bit
more velvety now that there's not a
total delight across the skin when you
apply I mean there's no stiffness
there's no pull or tug it's not a drying
foundation stick type product but it's
definitely matte kind of
like a natural Matt look as what it has
once you've totally finished blending it
in on your skin they say its
feather-light and I would say it is very
light if you apply a minimal amount of
it and you aren't going in building it
up a whole lot kind of common sense
there full coverage that's a claim where
I think it builds to full coverage but
when I wear it in that way when I apply
enough of this foundation to make it
full coverage on my skin I don't like
the way it wears what I've learned and
applying this foundation is that it's
going to have the best wear for me
throughout the day when I apply just
enough just enough to basically blend
out one layer across my skin not
overlapping and adding more on top of
what I've already put on be it the same
shade or like layering the lighter shade
over it if you want to split up and
apply a couple of shades I think you can
totally do that but maybe don't apply
one shade all over your face first and
then overlap it like kind of give them
their own section so you're not applying
foundation over foundation because what
I see with this is i wear it all day and
I'm a normal skin type I'm not too oily
I'm not super dry either but if there's
too much building up too much
overlapping just too much product is
applied in general it gets a real patchy
look on the skin and when I see patchy
where in other words like some spots
maybe it looks even but a lot of spots
it looks like it's just kind of breaking
down and almost pulling away from the
skin when I see that with foundations I
kind of take it as my cue that there's
maybe been too much applied I need to
pay attention to doing a thinner layer
of product and trying to keep it as even
as possible and when I do that with this
foundation I do have really good staying
power and it still looks really nice on
the skin albeit not full coverage okay
like I said I could sit in front of the
camera for you and build this up to
complete full coverage and we would all
sit here and thank you that looks really
good really full coverage okay first
impression yay but by midday the look of
that product would be kind of separating
and looking sort of patchy all over the
skin as always with reviews what I offer
you is my experience you know I try
things a lot I try to give it plenty of
time and plenty of applications to give
you my best determination of how this
works but it could still work differ
we for different people obviously there
are some people who may be with this
product their skin can just accept more
of it and it just wears well regardless
of the amount they apply but for me the
amount that I put on is a really a
determining factor on whether it looks
good or not so good buy like mid to late
day but all in all just my personal
preference here I really do like stick
foundations I like finding one that can
work well so I'm very pleased with this
and I'm willing to accept the fact that
it's more of a I don't know the fullest
end of medium coverage on my skin it's a
matte but not unnaturally matte looking
finish on the skin I can blend it out
any number of ways and I think I'm going
to take this opportunity to go into my
demo for this product I've used a sponge
with it sponges work fine I wanted to
kind of show you how a brush can work
great for this because some stick
foundations I think really demand a
sponge because they're stiffer and
thicker and they deposit product and
it's like you've really got to find a
way to get that all blended this is very
easy to blend just kind of casually with
your fingers or a brush and I did use a
brush today so first off what I do and I
did the true beige all over my skin
that's the only shade I use just drawing
little streaks of it basically all
around the skin and I've kind of learned
what amount works for me and this seems
to work it gives me an acceptable amount
of coverage without being too heavy and
then I took my little Sephora the pro
mini flawless airbrush and I use that to
blend it all in across my skin and I do
feel like it's mattifying but it's not
too mad it's not too chalky
you know it still has this wonderful
blend ability about it and the skin sort
of feels velvety when you're all done
like to touch my skin it does not feel
sticky at all but it doesn't feel dry
it's a great middle ground that I think
at least for my skin does not require a
whole bunch of setting powder on top
some people with very oily skin might
feel comfortable putting a bit more
powder on top of it for the finished
texture just the feel of it after
application I don't think it's begging
for it that amount of product not
building up anymore when I look up
closely at my skin
I can still see some imperfections you
know I don't feel like it's doing what
full-coverage foundations do for me now
you can build this kind of product up
till the cows come home and you would
achieve full coverage it can go there
I'm just saying I don't like the way it
wears when too much is on my skin what I
was doing when I first got it is I would
do that whole step that I just showed
you in the demo and then take this
lighter shade and like streak it right
up here on top of my cheekbones down the
nose and then blend that out and it
would look great right after I put it on
but then that's when I see like the
signs of too much product as I went
throughout the day and look patchy but
in terms of what's worn with this I've
tried different primers here and there I
think you know for my skin being normal
this product benefits from a good
moisturizer underneath for example today
I'm wearing the Clinique Moisture Surge
intense underneath and I think that you
know does some good things for it in
terms of just other products that I
ended up going ahead and adding to this
foundation I used a little bit of
concealer that's revlon youth FX fill
and blur definitely not like the most
big-time under-eye concealer but i put a
little bit on the under eye area for
brightening I've got some Bobby Brown
bronzing powder in medium to just kind
of around the perimeter of the face and
hollows of the cheek my blush today is
the fit me blush in nude and then I've
got some of this love light blinded by
the light highlight from Too Faced
giving me just this little bit of glow
on top of the cheek finished look
I mean I'm extremely happy with it I
don't feel like it looks too heavy yet
it's a look that's not so dewy that I
feel like I touch it and just pull
product right off my skin I mean I'm
confident and I've seen it happen time
and time again that this will last on my
skin oh and I did set the safe with some
of this Mario Badescu cucumber green tea
and I might also add my lipstick I'm
using their new portrait peach lipstick
which I really really like you know I
love Besame lipsticks if you're curious
about this line by the way and just want
to you know look back and just learn a
bit more about some of their lip
products and stuff I've got a couple
videos that I've done on best man I'll
link to them below but this is one of
their newest lipstick launches and I
think this shade is so pretty and kind
of unique for peach right are so many
peachy nudes that come out shades that
are significantly
lighter than this but have that hinted
peach but this is a nice like real peach
like little bit deeper peach on the lips
and I think it's so beautiful that back
to the foundation I mean it is a hit for
me but it's one of those things like
it's a hit but don't screw it up you
know don't apply too much of this
product I think that's what you'll be
happiest with in terms of the way it
looks in the way it wears if you've
tried this product definitely give your
feedback in the comments section let us
know what your skin type is and how it
worked out for you and again it's being
sold on the Besame Cosmetics website and
if you go there you can read more
customer reviews you can see more
pictures and like swatches of the full
lines a different people wearing certain
shades and I think that'll be really
helpful for you if you want to look into
it some more so thank you guys again and
I will talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
