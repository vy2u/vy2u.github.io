me today we're gonna be talking about
the snow white collection from Besame
and I'm so excited about this I got a
lot of the things in the collection I
can't even remember exactly when I
ordered it but it seems like a really
long time ago I just got it last week so
I thought we would just kind of play
around with it today I have already been
experimenting with the stuff but I
thought be fun to do some of that on
camera for you as well and I am only
wearing right now some foundation some
concealer and my brows we have so much
fun stuff here you guys gonna start out
with the snow white spies lip balm
collection and this is inspired by the
original 1937 snow white movie from
Disney and I'm very familiar with that
movie because you know Belle likes to
watch that kind of stuff now and then we
both really enjoyed some of these older
classic movies and the packaging the
outer boxes and then also the containers
that the stuff comes in is so so
beautiful I thought it looked nice
online but getting at home I'm just like
blown away by how pretty this stuff is
so in the lip balm trio you get three
different ones in its snow white has a
little different expression on each one
is gooseberry pie one is apple pie and
one is cherry pie so let's check these
out my lips are feeling kind of dry
right now so I could use a little Bowl
see how precious I just love that it
says a delicious gooseberry pie for
grumpy it's around the rim here where it
says what kind
so the gooseberry is this really pinky
shade I haven't even put this one on yet
I'm getting a little color on my lips
here from this one they feel a lot like
the texture of like a rosebud salve if
you've tried that really pretty thin on
the lips not the most deeply penetrating
like super hardcore lip balm that I've
ever tried and I apologize I am a little
under the weather today but so the sense
might not be totally coming through for
me but I can still smell just like a
light sweetness with this one so that's
the gooseberry pie remember that was the
kind of pie Snow White was making when
the Evil Queen came up to the window but
that's pretty much as far as my
knowledge on gooseberries goes this
one's beautiful you've got the little
profile of Snow White there and it says
a delicious apple pie for happy
this one just seems to be a light pink
and going on the lips it's really just
clear is what I'm noticing this is the
kind of thing if you're thinking about
getting this you're not really getting
it for the fact that these are
life-changing what mom's you're getting
it because you're like Snow White
obsessed and you want to get the
collection you know and this was the one
I was playing with before this is a
delicious cherry pie for bashful so just
so pretty you just love how the whole
vibe is so consistent with the way
Besame just normally does stuff I just
love how the era in which the movie was
made completely falls in line with the
type of product Besame makes and this is
the one I've played around with a little
bit it's got a nice red tint and I'll
let this one just sort of hang around on
my lips while I'm playing with some of
the other products but yeah the cherry
is definitely my favorite I like a soft
red tinted lip like that so I guess my
thought on the lip balms is again it's
completely adorable where the packaging
is concerned it's not life changing lip
balm but if you've got a real snow-white
fan in your life and you were thinking
about gifting this to them this is one
of those no-brainer things like
everybody knows what to do with lip balm
you know what I'm saying there might be
other products in the collection where
they're like okay this is pretty now
what but the lip balm is definitely I
think universally usable and you can bet
Belle had a fun time looking through
this stuff with me this next thing
absolutely love it want this to be
something I can continually get from
Besame it's the ever after translucent
pearl powder so it's in a beautiful
little box like that but you slide it
out this is going to be so hard to show
with how metallic this is but can you
see how gorgeous the compact is when it
hits light there it's gold it's gold
everywhere but then it just has red and
blue details on it and it's not like a
metal compact it is plastic you open it
up and on the mirror there's little
bunny and a bird and a little puff here
as well it's just it's beautiful and
then the texture of the powder is so
super soft it's like a soft matte look
like they call it translucent pearl
powder and the only way to really get a
feel for it is if you kind of shear it
out on your hand and then move your
and around it's just a very soft like
natural mat like actually think of the
way the finish of a pearl looks you know
it's not blindingly catching the light
there's just a softness to that look and
so this is a kind of powder I feel like
I can wear anywhere I use this little
small tapered brush from ELF and I love
popping this around here on the under
eye I mean again just the quality of the
product is great it's soft it's
beautiful on the skin I like putting it
over areas where I think I've got maybe
a few lines or something because I just
feel like it softens the look of any
imperfections it does kind of mattify
but just not in a super unnatural way
like it's just kind of that dull skin I
guess you might say that Snow White
seems to have but as always when we're
talking about translucent powders I mean
there is some color that you do pull off
of this inevitably and has it smoothes
into your skin and blends in yeah some
of that kind of blends away it would
have been cool actually if they put out
a deeper version along with this that
the tan and rich skin tones could have
really feel like okay that's my color
the next thing is the creme Rouge this
is the with a smile and a song creme
Rouge so you're just getting one shade
in this it's in a gorgeous little pot I
think that's about the size yeah it
seems to be the same size as those lip
balms
but it's that gorgeous gold instead on
Snow White's skin the red the blue
details the kind of thing you get it
home and you get it in your hands you're
just like oh looks so sweet and the
color on this I would kind of describe
it as a bright coral it is fairly easy
to blend and I think you could do it
with your fingers but a standard cream
product like this I think applies really
well with the elf small stipple brush
and by the way they've created almost
what would you call it's like a little
gasket around here so when your top
comes down this isn't going to be drying
out like there's a nice little cushion
seal around the rim which is a nice
thought so I'm dabbing into this with my
small stipple brush this is gonna have
basically a matte finish on the skin
like there is no shimmer in the product
it's just a cream this is a shade that I
think a lot of skin tones could wear I'm
building this up in a very subtle little
by little way but it could certainly go
there any more built up fashion you
apply this with a more dense brush and I
think you could get even more of
color payoff going here but I just love
the light flush and it's funny because
as I look at my cheeks I'm thinking snow
white like I'm envisioning what her skin
looked like in the movie but I didn't
expect that it would be coming
necessarily from a coral like this you
know but yeah the cream blush totally
winning me over it applies so easily but
yet it didn't have to be like goopy and
ultra creamy to get to that place you
know it's a very solid product you know
here in the pan but it was very easy for
me to blend this out on the skin and
then it doesn't leave any unusual
texture on top of the skin it's just the
pure color kind of thing I want to keep
just like putting on dabbing on a little
more a little more
but this brush is perfect for it your
small stipple brush now all I have left
is the big palette which I don't think
is available anymore at least not on
their website I've seen some things
posted recently where maybe they've put
this out in different locations or
different pop-up shops I know if you're
tuning into this video you may be
interested just to see what this is like
regardless so this is the outer like a
sleeve here and then you're gonna die oh
my gosh look absolutely stunning so
incredibly authentic and beautifully
done every little detail like no offense
to elf but you know there have been some
different collections that they've been
you know I've bought them from Walgreens
from time to time like little
five-dollar Beauty books that are
inspired by Disney's certain Disney
movies but there's kind of a cheapness
to the look of those let's be real and
this is just it's so dead-on is all I
can say for what you see in the movie
the vibe of it all open up here and
you've got this mirror now everything in
the palette is inspired by the actual
shades used in the movie this first
little flap here underneath that it's
Snow White's face but the flap that goes
on top is literally pointing out every
little shades as original palette made
from the inks used in the film so I
think that's fascinating then you turn
that page and you've got the story here
I don't mean literally the story of Snow
White but the story of
how this palette came to be on this side
it says to create an authentic Disney
snow-white look inspired by the film
please follow this guide using the snow
white collection so it tells you which
shades to put on your eyes what to do on
the face what lip color to use etc and
then on this other side you see Besame
founder Gabriela Hernandez and she's you
know going through the creative process
with this the actual 1937 ink and paint
department color chart that went along
with the movie an original like sketch
of Snow White and then how she appeared
in the movie it says to celebrate the
80th anniversary of Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs we've collaborated with
Disney to create this exclusive
collection inspired by the original
artwork and color palette of this iconic
film through extensive and careful
research we have painstakingly hand
selected and match the colors from the
original color palette provided by
Disney's ink and paint department to
bring you beautiful and authentic
recreations of the colors from the
classic 1937 film and then the next page
you're seeing the actual palette here it
says character color call-outs Snow
White and it's pointing out every single
shade that's in here and what its
purpose was basically in the art of the
movie it says iconic outfit and rags
outfit so you know that outfit she was
wearing at the well when the prints came
by and the Evil Queen was kind of spying
out the window they've got all that
covered here and then there's again a
nice flap over this protecting it but
these are all of those shades everything
in here is matte and it's just kind of
interesting because it's not literally
like here's how to get Snow White's
makeup it's just simply the colors that
were used to create the snow white that
we know in the movie and then we can use
them in any number of ways we could use
them as eyeshadows I mean you could
probably use some of these as blushes or
whatever you want to do now I've heard
that they may be coming out with smaller
palettes as well like I saw a tweet or
something maybe I can't remember where I
saw it but somebody was asking about
this and they basically said there's
some lower-cost palettes to come but as
far as shadow goes from Besame I am the
liking what I've been experiencing here
like if they do a good job I mean this
is a brand that has never put out
eyeshadows before right I mean what we
know of Besame are mainly the lip
products they do some great loose
powders a few brushes here and there
some pretty blushes as well as shadows
are kind of a new thing and so I want to
do a little look for you with this just
something kind of quick and natural I'm
going to use some Milani eyeshadow
primer first
I'm gonna begin with this saddle 106
shade texture-wise
trying to think what I shadow formula
that exists already that these kind of
remind me of they seem to blend on my
eyes a lot like lorac but maybe a little
less in terms of fallout
I'm gonna use a little bit of the saddle
104 just kind of above what I've done
here softening that out they're just
very soft easy matte shades I guess is
all I can say they're easy to work with
easy to blend not going overboard I'll
do a little bit of this pastel 10 and
use that up under the brow
and then let's use a little bit of this
brick down here really beautiful red
gonna get this on the outer part of my
eyelid
I'm going to this Charles Dickens
holiday themed dinner party tonight so
I'm not wanting to get too super out
there with the look and I am hoping and
expecting that this lasts well all
throughout the day and from what I've
experienced from this palette you know
it will the shades truly are very
pigmented when I use my eyeshadow primer
like I don't have any concerns about
them going anywhere so as you can see
I'm kind of putting that on my lid
wedging it up into the crease there's a
nice depth to that color and then I'm
just taking that e 25 brush again that I
originally used in the crease and that
can help to sort of blend everything
around
then I'm going to go back to this past
Elton it's kind of a soft beige a peach
and see how much pigment that has I mean
just a dab of that on the lid just get
that mainly on the inner part and then
do a little overlapping
and then I think I'll do a little cocoa
103 and just run some of that I love
this shade it's so like hard to put your
finger on it's a little mob it's a
little light brown and it creates the
softest definition on the lower lashline
again I'm so sorry
if you missed out on this palette I
don't know if by chance they will make
more or if you're in a location where
you can physically like go to a store
and get your hands on it but they don't
have it on their website right now but
like I was saying I've heard they should
be coming out with more palettes so this
will give you a feel for how those
shadows work just in general so there's
my very simple matte shadow look I'm
gonna do a little bit of brightener in
my lower inner rim with my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlights I'll also do
some mascara top and bottom and I think
I'll put on some whispies lashes I think
that'd be really pretty with this look
and then we will talk lip products so
there's the finished eye look I don't
know if you guys could tell but I could
when I was looking up close and doing my
eyeliner I had the weirdest like little
patch of unblended concealer right over
here and it was really hard to work with
like it was set I went at it with a
q-tip and I eventually got it off there
but it looked really funky so I'm sorry
about that if you saw that so lip stuff
I chose to get I went with one of their
full-size lipsticks and it is the iconic
snow white red and packaging here again
adorable box at the outside of the tube
it's so like classic Besame but the
script where it says snow white you know
exactly as you know it from the 1937
movie when you take off the cap it does
say Besame right here and then you twist
up and it's the iconic shape of Besame
lipsticks and i would describe this as
kind of a soft red actually when i saw
this on my lips just looking at it in
person you know it's not super
fire-engine it's kind of a little bit
softer that lip balm by the way really
got my lips nice and soft in preparation
for this but I'm gonna put this on with
a lip brush
it's a cream lipstick when you apply it
straight from the tube you'll definitely
feel that like there are certain ones
that they've put out that are more matte
and a little bit more of a dry texture
and this is definitely a very creamy one
but isn't it fun to think yeah this is
Snow White's red this is her red lip
so when you apply it with the lip brush
I feel like I get a little bit more
sheer application although this looks
very full-on and colorful just got a
little bit more of a matte look and feel
whereas if you put it on straight from
the tube you know that's fine but it
comes off feeling a bit thicker on the
lips
you might even pick up on a little hint
of shine coming from it but when you go
little by little with a lip brush you
can really get the matte look and then
of course they advise doing a double
blot technique with their lip products
which really does result in amazing
staying power so that would mean you put
it on blot put on another layer blot one
more time and then you've got this
gorgeous locked-in look and that really
does work but yeah this is the iconic
snow white bread I feel like it's a soft
red with a little bit of pink in it
which was kind of unexpected for me but
it's so so beautiful I mean this is a
great red now the other lip thing that I
got is the Seven Dwarfs mini lipstick
set so seven lipsticks in here and yes
they all do have the little silhouette I
guess you'd say of the dwarf actually on
the lipsticks themselves and you see
them down here and then this is the
layout of colors and I think I'm just
gonna apply these straight from the tube
just to keep from having to clean off a
lip brush every time we've got sleepy
doc bashful happy grumpy sneezy and
dopey these are all matte except for one
dopey is like a sheer shimmer they
totally went a different direction with
dopey and I think maybe that's so you
could layer them up if you want to or
give the other shades a little different
look on but everything else is like a
full colored matte lipstick and I really
do like putting a little yo s lip balm
on as a lip primer under these I think
they glide on so nicely that way if
you're dealing with some especially dry
lips that's a nice thing to do but I
love this selection of shades I think
this collection allowed Besame to put
out just some really different colors
that you don't typically see in their
line I mean they do a lot of different
Reds and I think that's great but this
collection I'm not sure what
specifically inspired each color but
there's like a nude in here there's a
lighter pink I mean it's really fun so
I'll just take you through these sleepy
is this really soft kind of baby pink
again I feel like it's best amazed
classic matte finish on all of these doc
I was so a
cited for because here's your like a
neutral kind of nudie lip from Besame
which to my knowledge I don't think they
have anything else quite like this in
their lines so I would love to have doc
in a full-size really bashful I think of
this shade is like really blushed cheeks
it's like take the color of sleepy but
make it a little bit darker a little
richer shade and again a unique color
for Besame to put out happy is the shade
I've chosen to stick with and kind of
wear throughout the day I love the
warmth of this color it's like a little
bit of a peachy red like kind of a
beautiful soft rosy coral it's actually
kind of a unique color grumpy has a
little less coral in it more of a
classic rosy colored lip I think that
one's a favorite of mine in this lineup
is well
sneezy I feel like they have a shade in
their current line that's just this
really dark rich berry and sneezy kind
of reminds me of that it's absolutely
stunning it's a really vampy rich shade
and then of course as I said dopey is
this just sheer Sparkle sort of color
and you could wear it on its own it
feels like it has a hair more smoothness
going on like despite having the shimmer
there's no grit but as you look at the
ingredients on the back all of the other
dwarves are formulated a certain way and
then Dobby is its own special thing I
really love this collection again I
think it allowed Besame to put out some
different kinds of colors that you maybe
haven't seen the brand work with before
and they're so cute you've got all the
little dwarves on there I'm a huge fan
of lip color minis because it's a great
way to sample and I would call these
like a creamy matte formula they're
creamy enough going on but you've got a
pretty like just full colored matte lip
when you're done and thinking about how
vibrant some of these shades are I do
love having them in the matte formula
talk about sneezy I feel like I'm about
to sneeze here my favorites of this
whole line gosh like I love the classic
snow-white red lipstick I think that's a
huge just you know if you had just one
collector's piece that you wanted to
come away with from this whole line this
is a great one again they've got some
other full-size lipstick shades
available also which I'm thinking about
looking into but those are on their
website so check that I adore this ever
after translucent powder I think that's
just gorgeous on the skin the seven
dwarfs lips that I think is just a great
value if you're into Besame lipsticks
you want to have this set the cream
Rouge I think is totally beautiful it
might not be
for everyone because I know some people
might just love their standard powder
blushes I think it really is a fabulous
shade the snow white spies I mean if
we're just talking about cuteness yes
they're great they're not an amazingly
different mind-blowing lip balm just for
that purpose alone I wouldn't say
everybody needs these but they are cute
and you know if you like you know snow
white enough to want to get that whole
set the palate of course is
mind-bogglingly good I love all the
thought and detail that went into this
I'm sure it was a ton of work to create
all these shades and just get them so
exact but this was really beautifully
done and if you are a snow white fan and
you have a chance to get your hands on
this this is really really impressive so
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this was informative and helped you
out as you're trying to navigate through
the snow white collection - thumbs up
for Besame on this I think they did an
awesome job and I will see you guys very
soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
