holiday reviews and I am kicking things
off with a little kit from bite it's
called the perfect bite and it is a set
of their amuse-bouche lip sticks why is
this the first thing I'm going to be
talking about well it happens to be one
of the holiday products I feel like I
have the most experience with so far
also I happen to know that these little
four packs that bite tends to put out
around this time of year I've really
tried to keep up with these over the
years and they most definitely do not
last in terms of availability up until
the holidays but in this particular set
you're getting four mini lipsticks
sometimes they switch it up with the
different kinds of products that they
put in here but they did stay with the
classic like red tin type of idea here
so this is exactly how it comes you've
got this gold outer packaging and then
you open it up and there's a little
sheet here showing you the shades and
then boom there are your four miniature
lipsticks and I think they did keep the
same kind of like outer packaging style
as a full-sized amuse-bouche lipstick
but just downsized it made it mini it's
25 bucks I believe every year these
little four piece sets have been $25
kits and then there's also a little
mirror on the inside here which is great
for travel now if you've been with my
channel over a period of years you know
what a fan I am of bytes luminous cream
lipstick formula many many people love
that formula byte is known for packing
in high-quality natural ingredients into
their lipsticks I thought the luminous
cream formula was just top-notch but
more recently they have switched things
up a little bit and come out with this
new formula so having never tried that
new formula until this set I thought a
four pack would be the perfect way to do
it small size lipsticks really don't
bother me at all because I've got a lot
of lip products rarely do I find myself
erasing through a full-size lipstick so
smaller sizes are great I also love the
fact that all four shades in this set
are available in full sizes nothing here
is limited-edition so what you are
trying is something that if you fall in
love with the shade you can buy in the
full-size bite says these high-impact
lipsticks have been hand crafted to
deliver extreme moisture sublime texture
and incredibly creamy we're made with 12
lip oils and triple mil pigments these
lipsticks provide saturated color
weightless coverage with a citrus flavor
made from fresh pressed fruit and I have
noticed that little just a hint of what
they're talking about there with that
citrus scent but it's not super strong
and maybe some of it's because I'm
congested a little bit but I can see
what they're talking about but it's
pretty mild one of the things I
absolutely love most about this little
set is the shade selection I recently
was doing some wedding makeup over the
past weekend all of the bridesmaid
dresses were this beautiful like it was
a range of colors that the overall theme
was kind of like barely they're pink
these beautiful blush shades just very
soft really walking the line between
light pink and soft neutral colors it
was so beautiful and this set worked
wonderfully well just meshing with that
whole vibe
none of the shades in this set are
really really bright like they didn't
throw in a red or a bright berry as they
typically do in these holiday sets I
feel like everything stays in kind of a
safe color family they're all different
enough from one another shade wise that
you you definitely know the distinct
effect that you get from each one I mean
I've got them all swatched here but
they're great as freestanding shades but
I found myself mixing them so much I
love that you've got this incredibly
dark color here nore
is like the richest most saturated
brick-red a lot of brown in it too and
it plays so well with these other colors
if you just want to apply a little and
deepen it up somewhat in fact in my last
video of that shade sounds familiar I
mixed that shade in the lightest shade
and got a really pretty you know kind of
deep neutral lip but in getting a lot of
use out of these over the weekend I felt
like they were really pretty standalone
colors but every each and every shade
could be mixed you know to create
something a little bit different not
that you don't have the freedom to mix
any lip color you might want to but this
set I think was put together in a really
smart way because you've got honeycomb
which is sort of your tan nude pepper a
little more of a Mavi but still kind of
deep neutral shade fig is your pink fig
was a very popular
shade I know from the regular luminous
cream lipstick line and then nori that
deep kind of dark brownish brick-red
absolutely love it they all play so
nicely with one another so your little
set is here I will show you each of
these shades going on so you can see
exactly what I'm talking about but
before I do I wanted to mention a couple
things here about the formula and in
each slight change I've noticed from the
luminous cream lipsticks to me I just
feel like these have a little more
moisture to them and I notice that as I
do like one pass across the lips or also
just in a swatch all of these swatches
are just one swipe down swatches and I
feel like that little bit of added
moisture in these lipsticks allows the
color to transfer just a bit easier it's
definitely not a greasy feel but it's
just like an added softness to the
lipstick you know what I'm saying and
the original luminous cream lipstick I'm
not saying that was a hard to apply
formula or anything that pulled across
the lips even in the least you know
there wasn't a tugging or any resistance
but these just have even more softness I
think a little more moisture staying
power I think is very very comparable to
the luminous cream lipsticks i have worn
nori on its own and had no like
feathering outside my lips issues it
didn't seem to travel granted I felt
more comfortable wearing that shade
after I blotted it so did the full
application blotted and then I felt like
okay it's feeling more like a matte
lipstick now I really don't think it's
going to go anywhere you are getting
several kind of medium to lightest
shades in the rest of this collection
and you know these I don't think I've
ever really been known for incredible
staying power it's not like oh these are
going to wear all day without fail for
you I definitely do see fading from
these after I eat something for a creamy
classic lipstick I think that's to be
expected but I actually have fig and
pepper in the luminous cream formula and
I just noticed as I was watching those
and kind of comparing
the shades seemed a little richer in
these it's a very close look to those
original colors but I feel like it's the
original shades with just a little more
pigment and definitely a little more
moisture so I'll take you through each
shade being applied first off honeycomb
this is the lightest shade in the collab
it's more of a tan nude I find it very
wearable I love it on my skintone and I
also love it mixed a little bit with the
following shade that I'm going to get to
which is pepper and pepper is the shade
I've been wearing throughout the video
so wearable across I think so many skin
tones it's kind of like a deep Mavi
spice type color does that make any
sense to anybody that's just what I
think of whining of pepper and then fig
is like a true wearable pink a very
classic pink again a popular shade in
the regular line and I like that you're
getting that in here this is another one
that I like to put all over the lips and
then just add a little bit of pepper in
kind of around the outsides for some
dimension but still keeping it kind of
light and fresh love that shade and then
nori like I said this is the color that
I think gives the kit a whole lot of
versatility seeing as every other shade
is kind of light to medium the depth of
this color is just so extreme it's great
just all over the lips as is or layer it
over one of the lighter shades to sort
of d10 safai the darkness just a bit
about really looking closely at the way
this one wears I can safely say you know
the richer the shade from this line the
more intensity it has on your lips the
more you're going to notice it hanging
around on your lips but fortunately I
did not notice it drifting outside my
lips which was really helpful and all of
these shades are just creamy lipsticks I
should have probably harped on this a
little bit more in earlier in the video
but there's no shimmer or frost in any
of these and you can get I think a
pretty instantaneous matte look if you
just want to give them a quick blot if
you like the matte effect you can
totally get that but bite has done it
again if you are like me and you enjoyed
the luminous cream lipstick formula and
you're thinking okay now's my chance to
do a little sampling of their new
formula I think this is an awesome way
to do it yes the lipsticks are small but
it's only a $25 set it's a really
high-quality formula and I think you
will definitely be able to get a sense
of what these different shades have to
offer what you like or don't like about
certain ones and every single shade is
available in a full-size so I think
that's awesome so I hope this little
review helped you guys out so many more
holiday kits are on my agenda to be
talking about on this channel so stay
tuned and I'll see you guys later
