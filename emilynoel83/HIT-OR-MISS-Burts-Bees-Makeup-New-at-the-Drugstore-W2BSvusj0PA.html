don't know if you've noticed but Burt's
Bees has gone full on makeup mode in the
drugstore they've got foundation and
blush and powder and all this stuff in
addition to just like the lip balms and
the lipsticks that they've had out for
some time now in fact if you look on
Burt's Bees comm they've got this little
message here that says I am NOT
synthetic you are a million things but
none of them are synthetic so why use
beauty products that are so that's their
whole vibe here its natural stuff it
says dermatologist tested formulated
without parabens phthalates SLS or
petrolatum that's what it says right on
the back of my foundation price points
for these things are going to be a
little bit higher in some cases compared
to certain other things at the drugstore
I feel like as a whole prices are going
up at the drugstore but I paid like 15
bucks for my foundation around 9 or 10
bucks for some of the other products so
you know it's it's creeping up there
I've had some ups and downs with this
line to be honest with you I've been
trying this for like a month now but I
had the wrong foundation shades so I
felt before I could review this line
accurately I needed to go back and find
the right foundation shade I had broken
blush need to go back and deal with that
but today I am ready to sit down and
show you this look everything on my face
except my concealer and my eyebrow stuff
and my eye primer is Burt's Bees so take
a look I am just moisturized right now I
am not using any certain primer this is
what we're working with with the
foundation it's called goodness glows
and I have it in natural beige says
liquid makeup with responsibly sourced
meadow foam and that's technically
meadow foam seed oil known for its skin
moisturizing benefits and they claim
that this is a full-coverage mineral
formula that leaves skin smoother and
more radiant with a natural finish
that's not heavy or greasy and did I say
have this a natural beige fun story
about this I initially got the color
called buff and it's so light like I
don't know if some shades are just
deceiving when you see them in stores
you think oh yeah that's my shade you
get it home and you're like what but I
mean if you guys have seen some of the
shades that I have made work and videos
and I feel like this one is just
completely not workable that's saying
something I've had some pretty off
foundation shades at times but I think
it's harder to be off when you're erring
on the light side sometimes
or shades with the addition of a
concealer can kind of work out that
natural beige I went back for it may
return that other shade or it might
actually be the appropriate shade for my
mom but we have a pump with this one
that's a good thing and I'm just gonna
pump out one full pump of this and I
have found that that really does kind of
get all over my face and give me enough
product to work with and feel like I'm
getting the coverage I should have
anytime I've used more than that I felt
like I had like extra foundation I just
had to wipe it off my fingers so I'm
using my Sigma f80 brush here but yeah
they call it full coverage and I've seen
things go fuller coverage than this when
I start thinking about Urban Decay all
nighter or Estee Lauder Double Wear
maximum cover if we're talking full
coverage those really are this I think
is on the highest end of of medium
coverage you know because I can look up
closely at my skin I can still see you
know little freckles and maybe a spot
here there may be a slight bit of
redness in areas where I would tend to
conceal anyway I love the finish of the
foundation and I really love the feel it
does feel like I don't know kind of
moisturizing on my skin kind of like the
feeling you get after you put on a
really good BB cream or CC cream that
has a nice amount of moisture in it it
sort of feels like that that you've got
foundation II excuse me coverage on your
face but I think there's a real like
kind of natural luminosity I'm trying to
sort of turn my head here so maybe it
catches the light somewhat but it really
does leave the skin looking kind of just
nourished I guess you might say because
there's not flecks of shimmer and
sparkle in this but it's giving you a
really healthy look when you've got it
on and case-in-point with this
foundation in my last video where I was
talking about all the bite lip products
that the only thing I had on my cheeks
was a little bit of one of the multi
sticks so it was just pure color you
know there wasn't a shimmer in that
either and I had on no highlight or
anything but yet the skin seemed to have
a certain amount of I don't know just a
little bit of luminosity to it and I
credit the foundation for that actually
because I wasn't overly powdered it's
got
bit of a hydrating feel and I'm liking
that these days frankly you know normal
skin type person I think a dry skin type
would probably enjoy this as well but
that is one pump and that's pretty darn
good for one pump that was not a lot of
product on my skin I do not have a
concealer from this line I can't
remember if they made one or not or if I
just like overlooked it in the display
so I'm just gonna use another drugstore
concealer here it's the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow the one in classic
ivory I've talked about this a lot used
it a lot I think it's just a pretty
decent you know little under-eye
brightening type concealer it's just a
smidge lighter than my skin tone so I
feel like it does sort of help give my
skin some dimension in different areas
and I think it's very comparable finish
wise to what we're working with here
with this foundation so it just kind of
meshes in well so I'm just using a flat
foundation brush today which sometimes I
just really like with concealers and I'm
just pulling that not only along the
under eye area but kind of out this way
too
never really thought I'd like this
concealer way back before I bought it I
remember thinking like a glowy concealer
it's really not glowy it's just a
different texture of concealer I feel
like it's kind of thin and light no it's
not giving you Tarte safe tape coverage
but if you can handle a little lighter
coverage than that I mean it's really
good next up I got their mattifying
powder which is actually a powder
foundation it says with bamboo I have
this in the color sand and it does seem
to work for me it's got sort of that
honeycomb kind of imprint there on the
product there's a mirror and a sponge
down below and I don't really have any
desire to over powder myself I don't
really want to take away from the
radiance that I'm sort of seeing on my
skin from the foundation so what I think
I will do and I've done this quite a bit
as I've tested these products is take a
little bit of it on my ELF small tapered
brush and I'm just gonna dab this up
here on the under eye area and when I
set this area not only do I feel like it
tends to add coverage but it also sort
of helps just the staying power of
everything and also the staying power of
your eye makeup if you're too you know
dewy there right under the eye you can
notice more transfer and more smudge
enos actually it kind of attracts
smudges so I'm working with some of this
powder around my t-zone and yes I do
feel like it mattifies it doesn't make
me look too chalky and I think it
actually helps to extend the wear of the
foundation what I've worn these two sort
of hand-in-hand it's been a pretty good
thing and I feel like I've been
complaining a lot about staying apart
with foundations and you don't always
think of the hydrating foundations as
being able to last a really long time
you know but it's not just about lasting
it's not just for me anyway about a
product still being present on my skin
at the end of the day I want it to
closely resemble the look that I started
with you know I want it to be fresh and
not cakey looking you know not
completely fading from my oily spots but
not clinging completely to the few areas
where I'm a little more dry but overall
my skin doesn't go to major extremes on
either end of that spectrum so that's
why I kind of consider
myself normal but that's what a light
bit of that powder looks like I'm just
kind of focused in on t-zone and under
eye and just lightly elsewhere it takes
the texture of your skin and just makes
it a little bit smoother after that
foundation which felt pretty hydrating
but I know technically it says this is a
powder foundation I have not used this
solely as powder foundation but I do
find it to be a powder that adds some
coverage I definitely found that to be
true and I think it's a nice pairing
with the foundation I don't have a
bronzer from this line but I do have a
couple of blushes my first blush that
happened and this is called shy pink and
I think this is a gorgeous shade it's
like a pretty matte blush and y'all I
dropped this for maybe I don't know two
and a half feet up onto carpet and it
broke and I don't know what that's about
I probably like tossed it in my shopping
cart I was shopping at Walmart and I
don't know maybe this was just the straw
that broke the camel's back I don't know
but note to self these products may be a
little bit fragile
whatever the case though I do love that
shade I love shy pink and then I went
back to the store that when I got my
replacement foundation I also got this
blush in toasted cinnamon and I haven't
worked with this one a whole lot I've
only worn it once so I want to really
put it on for you today and we'll see if
this really feels blush like you know
because it really looks kind of bronzer
II Timmy but I'm gonna pick some of that
up here on my up-and-up blush brush up
and up brushes from Target by the way if
you haven't heard me talk about those I
think they're pretty darn good but this
is kind of a nice little blow here
actually but a lot of warmth if it's a
nice light kind of toasty blush shade
you know it's different and I think it's
gonna work with the eye and lip color
that I'm gonna be putting on but these
are soft like nicely pigmented blushes
maybe so soft they're gonna crack when
you drop it on carpet but maybe I can
just this is just such a mess in here I
need to look up exactly what I need to
do with alcohol to press that back down
because I want to keep using this blush
I'm gonna do a little shy pink just
right in this zone here apple of the
cheek it's so pretty like I feel bad for
it I've got this injured blush here
alrighty guys so I've gone ahead and
done my eyebrows I used my ELF in
lift eyebrow pencil in neutral Brown and
I did some Milani eyeshadow primer on my
lids now this is the eyeshadow trio I
got it's in the shade blooming desert
and this is the eyeshadow with bamboo
and what we've got here are three shades
that they all have some amount of
shimmer the top one is more like just a
satin finish it's barely there Sheen
Center one is this metallic rust color
and then we've got this deep kind of
dirty bronze down here at the bottom
that also has some Sheen but it's not
out of control there so I'm going to
take that one with my Sigma e25 and I'm
just gonna get some of that in my crease
to me these shadows seem like just
straight-up average in terms of
application I mean this brand no doubt
how it has benefits in terms of you know
being natural products and whatnot but
if you're just kind of wondering how
these stack up with lots of different
eyeshadows I feel like they're just kind
of in that average bracket for me at
least this trio you know it's the only
one that I have used from the line you
know it does the job it creates a look
for me but I feel like the shades just
kind of I don't know this middle one
should be stronger than it is and so
everything just kind of blurs right into
each other which I guess it's fine from
a blending sense but if you kind of want
your shades to be a little more
pronounced and stand out from one
another they just all kind of mesh into
one on me so I'm just blending over what
I did there in the crease so a very soft
crease color nothing's gonna get too
dark obviously with this trio of shades
I'm gonna use the lightest one and just
go under my brow there this shade you
know it comes off a little little chalky
looking like there is some sheen to it
but it's not a real pretty smooth pearly
Sheen it just looks a little dry and
then with a flat brush I'm going to go
into the rest in this shade like I said
I mean I I see that color in the pan and
I think it should be full-on gorgeous
but it doesn't look as metallic on the
eyes when you've got it applied like
you're certainly picking up on the color
it's just not quite as rich and you have
to build it up some
definitely a nice fall color I mean it
is pumpkin spice for sure
and see if I can create any contrast on
the outsides by adding a little more of
the bronze maybe not that she is just
not quite dark enough to really deepen
your look a whole heck of a lot but I am
gonna use some of the light shade it's
given me a little bit there you can see
and then as a final step I think I will
smudge some of the bronze under my eye
too
so yeah it's okay eye shadow to me this
was like the most interesting looking
trio that was being sold so that's the
one I got but it's okay you know it's
getting the job done for a very soft
light natural look but one thing I am
going to do because I woke up feeling
kind of tired today and I kind of
irritated this eye and I can see some
redness in it so this always helps for
that it's the wet-and-wild ultimate brow
highlight and you just put it right in
your lower inner rim actually
surprisingly really brightening
and the next thing I have from this line
is their 100% natural nourishing mascara
here so I'm going to curl my lashes
first we all know they need it and then
let's move along with this before I lose
the girl we've got a rubber brush here
on this mascara wand and it is a little
bit tapered toward the tip which I like
that it's kind of medium sized not too
big not too small the bristles are kind
of you know thick seeming pretty tightly
packed and the first time I use this
mascara I was kind of pleased with the
way it built up rather quickly on my
lashes the thing this just doesn't do
well for me it's kind of my mascara
deal-breaker
is holding the curl you know it just
doesn't keep that locked in and there
are a couple mascaras from the drugstore
that do do that for me in case you were
wondering the covergirl super sizer
tends to do that for me and so does the
l'oreal lash paradise so this like just
as I apply it I kind of feel like yeah
they're drooping a little bit but this
does give me pretty nice length and it
adds some thickness to almost to the
point of you know throwing in a few
clumps here there that you sort of feel
the need to comb through additionally
if your lashes tend to hold a curl like
naturally curly lashes on their own you
may have no issue with this really but
there are you know a few little clumps
you might feel the need to just sort of
brush through as you go but it's not too
bad in the length Department I'm just
feeling a little bit of sag from my
lashes in terms of the curl I try to
look sideways sometimes that lets you
see what the curl is actually doing I
don't know if you guys can tell now
something Burt's Bees has had as part of
their line for quite some time of course
are the lip balms you know about Burt's
Bees lip balms but just lip products in
general they really expanded that kind
of product before they put out all of
these like foundations and blushes and
whatnot so I've had and I've already
reviewed so I'll link below on some of
their satin lipsticks and I think now
they have a glossy lipstick formula from
what I saw on their website I haven't
tried those yet but the satin lipsticks
you know they're in these little tubes
with the honeycomb design you can see
through them really good lipsticks
actually nice a little bit of thickness
to them I mean pretty good staying power
good color intensity they've also got
some lip crayons I'm holding the one
here in Sedona Sands I've reviewed those
on their own as well not a lot of shine
off of these particular sticks but they
have a nice little thickness on the lips
I kind of enjoy that one of their sort
of newer lip products to their line that
I've tried more recently that I did not
like really worthy tinted lip oils they
just felt very much like straight up
just oil I guess if that's what you're
going for that's fine but it's so
slippery so greasy as you might expect
on the lips and I just didn't enjoy
wearing them but for more information on
different lip products and where I've
talked about them all linked below but
the color that I want to wear today is
called russet river it's a great fall
shade like this deep kind of brownish
burgundy
I'm a fan of these lipsticks you guys
and I'm kind of like rediscovering them
actually because I have had my hands on
these for quite some time I believe
these one like an allure Beauty award
too they are smooth nourishing feeling
but not greasy not feeling like I'm
concerned about this fading outside my
lip line or anything this shade is so
like fallen winter glam I've also really
liked I've got a couple here but I
really like blush Basin kind of like a
nude neutral with a little bit of peach
thrown in I've also got Sedona sands in
the chubby stick and this is a nice
shade for my like pinky nude lover's
right there so they've got a nice range
of shades but yeah finished look with
the Burt's Bees line I like it you guys
I mean the only thing I really added in
was my brow product today and the
concealer so the bulk of my coverage all
over my skin is coming from that
foundation I thought the powder worked
really well the foundation of the powder
probably are like my top two products
cuz I thought they worked really nicely
hand-in-hand with one another this gave
me pretty darn good coverage I wouldn't
go as far as to call it full but truly
good enough coverage and nourishing
enough to my skin and then I was able to
use this powder and sort of help myself
be more matte in the areas where I
needed it so I like those two together I
have worn them multiple times together
and had a good outcome staying power
wise throughout the day I feel like I
want to love the blushes but I am
skeptical of the fact that they broke so
darn easily so that's a little
concerning to me but hopefully you were
able to get a little bit of a sense of
these two colors I think toasted
cinnamon is actually workable as a blush
it's a little different tone than I'm
used to wearing that shy pink is maybe
my favorite color overall the eyeshadow
is kind of a pass for me I mean it's
okay but looking at just everything that
I've got eyes shadow wise here I've got
plenty and I don't think I really need
to seek it out again from this brand Yun
satin finish lipsticks from this line I
think are definitely something you want
to look into their ultra comfortable
they have a nice um just feeling on your
lips a nice feeling of moisturization
without being greasy or too thin Russert
River the color I'm wearing now I think
is a great fall shade if you're into
something a little bit deeper this time
of year but they do have some pretty
nude shades to look through as well so
thank you guys so much for your time
today I hope this was interesting for
you I hope you learned if
things about the new Burt's Bees makeup
line I'm finding it in my local Walmart
I've not found it at Target yet I hope
you guys have a great day and I will see
you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
