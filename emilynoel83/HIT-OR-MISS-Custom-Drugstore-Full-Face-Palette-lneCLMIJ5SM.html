talking about setting powder and
highlighter and blush and bronzer and
eyeshadow and it's all in one drugstore
palette it's from essence it's called my
must-haves have you guys noticed this on
ulties website yet they've got an 8 pan
palette or a 4 pan palette and basically
you can fill it with whatever different
singles you want and they are offering
both face and eye shadow singles so I
did it I think it was like two and a
half weeks ago when I got mine in so you
get the empty palette and then you get
all these little pans this empty eight
shade palette was $4.99 or if you want
just four colors it's 349 and I believe
every single single that goes into it is
just a dollar ninety-nine yeah I say
just a dollar ninety-nine but by the
time this was all said and done I mean
we're talking two four six eight 10 12
14 16 plus surrounded up to $5 for the
palette
it's a $21 experience happening here
from essence so take that into account
you're gonna have to think how much do I
value the ability to choose my own stuff
that's going in here i shadow x' they
seem like a nice generous size for face
products they might even seem a little
small and because I've experimented and
I bought these but I also have four
additional ones that I was sort of
playing around with I've seen some hits
and misses what I've settled on in this
palette I actually think is really good
quality I do love what I've put together
here in this video I'll take you through
the application of all the face products
as well as the eyeshadows that I have
but I thought I would give you just a
full description and everything first so
what we've got across the top here are
the face products that I chose to put in
again you could choose all eyeshadow
here you could just get the four pans
and do something different you see the
way they come out here there's a little
notch on every one and they're easy to
just pop your finger in there and pop it
out there's enough resistance so you're
not worried about them falling out but
they're fairly easy to take out and
these things are not magnetic what it is
is a pan that's actually in its own
little plastic casing so you stick this
on a Z palette it's not gonna stick this
is customized to fit in this particular
palette just keep that in mind but the
first powder I have in here is called
fix it baby fixing powder it is just a
matte setting powder there so I thought
that was useful to have in this palette
for me I can use that as under eyes
setting powder I can use that all over
the face as I did today and you'll see
that going on I also have a highlighter
powder in here called let it glow they
just had one highlighter and this is a
very subtle highlight I would say it's a
little different tone but similar to the
effect and impact of the essence pure
nude highlighter one bronzer option so I
got that it's called hello sunshine and
it's sort of a light warm colored
bronzer and then for blush I think there
may have been three blush options and I
have strawberry smoothie in here the
other blush that I have which I also
really liked was rosy glow rosy glow
seems to be matte the strawberry
smoothie has a little bit of a satiny
finish but you can see the difference
there's just a little more brightness
here but both really showed up on my
skin and I was happy with both now for
eyeshadows I have cotton candy here this
is a great shimmer and this doubles as a
fantastic highlighter on the skin as
well if you want something a little more
pronounced than the actual highlight
that they offer this matte shadow here
is called ma vie time the bronze is
called miss foxy Roxy that does have a
little shimmer and then there's also a
slight satin finish in black as a berry
this plum again these shadows that I've
settled on having in this palette I
think are definitely the best that I
tried there was also a good cream shadow
and this is called chili vanilla just a
matte cream just slightly off-white it's
nice I didn't really feel the need to
have that in this palette I tried
raspberry frosting and this disappointed
me because it's like there's an
overspray on here that really highly
shimmery stuff that you see around the
outside is not like penetrating the
shadow all the way through so you really
just have a pink and I thought do I
really need a pink shadow when I've got
a pink blush that I could use as a
shadow if I want to do and then I had
also gotten Peach Party which isn't
super peachy is just like a light taupe
and I took that out in favor of the
bronze color just because the bronze had
so much more intensity it just made more
of an impact in my looks and I also
thought the bronze would make a good one
shadow look if I wanted to do that if
you pull up ulties website which I'll
have everything linked below but this is
the shadow selection and I thought it
was a little disappointing that there
wasn't more
warmth offered here I mean you see the
blues you see some just kind of
generally cool shades I was just really
surprised that they didn't go warmer
with that but I feel like what I have
here is just a super easy everyday
workable palette if I were to narrow
this down to four shades if you wanted
to do it that way I would say the blush
is a must-have
I would also probably put in this
eyeshadow because it doubles as a good
eye shadow like a great little
highlighting eyeshadow as well as a
highlighter so I've got that blush that
highlight and then I might go with like
my bronze and my plum eye shadows but I
think a great way to get a feel for what
I've done here with this palette is to
just see it going on so here we go so
we're gonna do some application with the
palette I have and yes you can see my
bra straps through this shirt I thought
it was cute online I didn't really
realize the Sheerness of it so forgive
and forget we're fine right it's just me
and a few of my closest friends sitting
here doing makeup so we're gonna go into
the palette and use the face stuff first
so here we have that setting powder fix
it baby it says fixing powder so it's
one of those matte powders that would
typically be called like a translucent
powder but obviously you apply enough of
it it shows up white and I'm just gonna
dab a little bit of that on my ELF
complexion brush now I did set my under
eye concealer already but I'm just going
to sort of pop this on elsewhere on the
face it just makes things extra Matt and
I have set my concealer with this as
well and it did fine I'm just for a
little light setting like if you just
want to change the texture a little bit
if something's feeling extra tacky and
just to let you guys know also the
foundation i'm wearing is the maybelline
superstay I got my proper shade I'm so
excited
I had been wearing was it warm nude or
something it was too dark and my issue
is that any time I went anywhere to buy
this the selection was super picked over
and there might be one but the caps like
busted off and there's foundation using
down the side and I really wanted to see
it in person this time because I ordered
the other one online and that's how I
made my mistake in the first place so I
wanted to see the shades finally they
had a restock and I got natural ivory
and it's absolutely perfect so if you
are like my skin tone and you want a
really good match with this stuff
natural ivory baby and
my concealer that I've been playing
around with is the makeup revolution
conceal and define and c5 is my perfect
shade in that so anyway we dabbed on
some powder were nice and matte although
we were pretty matte beforehand given
the finish of that foundation but then
I'm gonna go to this bronzer right here
the name of this is hello sunshine and
there was just one shade to choose from
and to me this is a pretty light powder
like I'd say it's the intensity of the
lightest shade of those new bronzers
from the balm if you watched my
favorites video this is a pretty soft
bronzer but the difference between this
one and the lightest one from the balm
is that this one is way cooler and this
one has a lot of warmth to it I'm not so
sure that this would be like universally
pleasing to everyone you know I'm gonna
give myself just a little
something-something over here but it's
it's a little warm even for my liking
like I can make it work I can I can do
the bronzer thing I can lightly dust it
all over my skin and kind of perk up my
skintone but I'm not like super in love
with it it is totally matte and essence
does make some good bronzers that I kind
of like the thing is having that in this
palette you can also easily use this
shade as an eyeshadow and I thought the
eyeshadows selection overall for this
palette was lacking a lot of warmth
which surprised me the warm tones seem
super popular but there wasn't a lot to
choose from so you get your warmth from
your bronzer and you can easily use that
as a shadow so anyway it's kind of sort
of showing up on my skin but it's not
like a game-changing bronzer now let's
do the blush blushes are fantastic this
shade is strawberry smoothie and it does
appear to have a little shimmer but you
get some on your brush tap off the
excess and it's a beautiful soft pinky
flush I mean it could be more intense
like there I didn't tap off any you can
see it's a beautiful color
no complaints seriously like I think
that looks so good and the other blush
that I had tried to was really nice but
my last thing in the top row here is the
highlight and they had one like
technically a highlighter option like
what was actually defined as highlighter
powder and it's called let it glow and
it looks like it has especially next to
that why it's a little bit of a buttery
color to it there's not a lot of glow
happening here but I'm gonna put it on
so you can see and then I have one step
further we can go but it's a little it's
a little glow you're picking up on that
I guess it's not a far cry from the pure
nude highlight that I really like that's
sold individually
maybe my highlighter tastes are changing
a little maybe I'm just wanting more and
more glow but that is actually nice for
a little subtle glow but this eye shadow
down here the one called cotton candy I
believe yes oh five cotton candy this
gives a really like brightened up glow
so I'm gonna add some of that it reminds
me so much of the top shade in that busy
art enamour'd trio that I've been loving
it has like the Mavi blush and the
bronzer and in the highlight and this
looks so much like that's got the
slightest hint of pink to it that I find
to be very brightening and you can use
that as your highlight for sure and if
you really like a little bit more
exaggerated highlight that eye shadow
you want that included in your palate
for sure
like I think that's really pretty I'm
gonna do a little mist I pulled out my
Mario Badescu lavender and chamomile
I am soothed in relaxed yeah and I'm
gonna do a little eyeshadow primer I am
slowly but surely working through my
Marc Jacobs um coconut eye primer he
works great it doesn't really work
better than my Milani but you know I
have it I'm using it it does sort of do
a little neutralizing to your lid I'll
tell you what was just okay for me and
I'm becoming less and less impressed
with is my visi art eyeshadow primer
like it's so thin and runny and I still
shake the heck out of it before I use it
it's supposed to be that way is there
supposed to be at least a little
thickness to that product I probably
look like I have no fingernail here cuz
this is kind of chipped and I really
need to redo my nail polish strips so
these are the eyeshadows that I kind of
settled in on liking the best out of
what I bought so we have cotton candy
this mat here is called ma V time this
one is I think called miss foxy Roxy and
this is black as a berry this one has a
little bit of a satin finish on it
there's some shimmer in this one as well
but here's one thing that I want I do
want to demonstrate I'm gonna use the
bronzer as an eyeshadow too because I do
think it creates a really nice little
started out crease color here for a
little warmth it's kind of nice if you
have both this shade and this shade
because you can kind of decide what your
warm or your cool mid-tone is going to
be
just blend over that a little bit and
then I'm gonna use a little cotton candy
as a little brow bone highlight we're
just keeping it quick and easy because I
think that's kind of the point here is
like you know it's a lot of things all
in one it can be your simple everyday
look
going back to cotton candy I love the
way this shade lays down right around
the inner corner see that it's bright
it's very brightening it's not flaky it
doesn't take a ton of applications to
build it up like I'm really pleased with
that shade maybe if you took one thing
from this video it would be like you
could spend one night and even just get
that single and be done with it if
that's all you need and I just take that
on to my lid just a little bit and then
I went to work in some of this bronze a
shade right here pick some of that up
with my flat brush I found this one to
be nicely pigmented the thing I feel
like I'm just crying out for though with
this palette is a mirror because I'm
like craning to see in this one it's no
huge deal I mean we're not paying big
bucks for this product but it would be
really handy that bronze is a total one
shadow look by the way I mean this could
be lid crease and done
in fact I'm like even pulling a little
bit up into my crease just a touch and
then we'll just go back over the area
with my crease brush I'm trying to go
for uncomplicated here because I felt
like my soft glam eyeshadow tutorial was
kind of overly complex like more than it
needed to be for the way the look turned
out live and learn
then I want to show you this plummy
color on the outside so I'm gonna pick
up a little bit of that with my flat
brush I've always kind of been a fan of
plum and bronze together let's say so
I'm a fan of plum and anything together
I like plum II I shadow dab it just
right there on the outer part of your
lid and then we're gonna take a small
brush and just work it right into the
crease exactly where we want it and all
will be well another pretty look could
be to just do the cotton candy all over
the lid and then fade that into the plum
yeah that would be pretty because the
cotton candy has the hint of pink they
would look nice side by side um this is
just my little makeup academy 315 brush
I'm just gently working that shadow
right into the crease see it's not too
hard to use it's pigmented enough like
it shows but I'm not in this constant
struggle with barely picking up any and
just using a teeny amount like I'm just
I'm just casually using it the way I
would use eyeshadow no special
techniques or skills required
then I'm going to use the bronze and
submerge that for my definition sort of
under the eye it's a perfect shade for
like smudgy liner
it's not gonna look like a super
exaggerated smoky eye or anything just
great down there and there's not too
much metallic shimmer in this shade
either okay so there's that ice shadow
and what I'm gonna do next is just pop a
little bit of my wet and wild ultimate
brow highlight I use that in my lower
waterline area to brighten up I'll do a
little liner on the upper lash line
lashes and we'll come back for the
finished look alrighty guys so here's
the finished look eyes and face color
the lip that I'm wearing is from
Physicians Formula it's called the
healthy lip and it is in the shade of
vitamin beat that have been beat you
vitamin beat it's interesting it's my
first time trying it's kind of like a
matte liquid lipstick but yet it does
have a little more moisture in there I
don't know I kind of like it I love the
color but I guess my sub up on the my
must-haves palette I mean it's cool to
have this ability with a drugstore brand
to really throw anything into the
palette you know face stuff I stuff
really make it your own
the individual pans are a buck
ninety-nine that seems pretty cheap when
you say oh it's only a dollar
ninety-nine that does kind of add up
when you buy eight of them as well as
the five dollar palette although you
could also just do a four pan palette so
it's sort of up to you as far as how
much you value the flexibility to choose
your own shades and also how much you
enjoy the thought of combining face and
eye stuff into one combination palette
because if we're just talking eyeshadow
here I mean the grouping of shades that
I put in here is not especially like
uncommon but to me what makes us a
little more handy is the fact that okay
I've got highlights in here I've got
blush bronzer just kind of a matte
setting powder putting everything
together settling in on these shades
where I really like everything that's in
here I'm happy with it I also do like
the fact that if you're not gonna use a
shade in the palette it has a nice
little like actually click on cap so
you're not dealing with one of those
super flimsy like lids it's an actual
lid and you could store this in with
your other eyeshadows and it wouldn't
get damaged or anything and you could
change up your palette if you want to
has anybody else made one of these
palettes what did you put in it I would
love to know thank you guys so much for
watching today I hope you enjoyed this
and I will see
again very soon by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
