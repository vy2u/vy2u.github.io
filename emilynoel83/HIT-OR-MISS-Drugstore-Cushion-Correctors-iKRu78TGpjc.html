about some cushions color correctors
from the drugstore and I think I alluded
to the fact that I did not like one of
these in the video where I was reviewing
the wet-and-wild highlight and contour
cushions so check out that video if you
want some more info on those but toward
the end I had talked about the fact that
I had tried this one from Physicians
Formula it's a mineral where child-free
cushion corrector plus primer duo and I
didn't really feel like at the time that
this was doing anything for my skin in
particular nothing really for color
correction nothing much for the texture
of my skin it didn't really feel like it
was smoothing me out a lot prior to
foundation application so after using
this even longer I'm going to really
give you my final thoughts on that also
I did go ahead and pick up these wet and
wild mega cushion color correctors from
Walmart because many of you still
expressed interest in these they had
several shades I think there may have
been a green and a lavender but I picked
up the yellow and the peach one because
I thought those realistically were the
ones that I might end up using the most
so I'm going to compare these products
let you know how they're similar how
they're different and just what I think
overall but first off with this
Physicians Formula I have it in the
peach and lavender shade so what you get
here is adorable packaging by the way
kind of this quilted design and their
cushion foundation has that sort of a
design as well but a turquoise packaging
open it up and I do like one cushion
products are put together in this way
you do have some sort of applicator if
you choose to use it I usually bring in
my own sponge or brush but I like that
there is this additional sort of seal on
the product and then that opens and it's
all in one thing besides the sponge
nothing is actually having to be taken
off of the compact but as you can see
here it is a split pan type of design if
you will a split sponge and one side is
the peach one side is the lavender as I
actually stick a brush in here or a
sponge it's a little odd to me because
it's kind of hard to confine it to just
the one side although I also do value
the fact that you're getting two
products and one I kind of wonder like
down in the cushion though what's
happening is there aren't these mixing
somehow and if you're not familiar with
the whole cushion thing in general it
seems like it's a very very liquidy
consistency product that ends up being
just absorbed by these cushions and then
you dip in and apply it to your skin and
it's kind of like a more controlled
application maybe than just simply
squeezing out some foundation or
squeezing out some primer or whatever
you tend to get a very thin lightweight
application on your skin none of the
cushion products I've used have ever
really felt heavy on the skin at all and
let's face it it's a trend right now
it's kind of a gimmick I think for
brands to package their product in this
way and make people think they're
getting something really different when
really you're just getting a slightly
different delivery method on a very thin
lightweight product when I was using
this today I just wanted to show you
like what my experience is with this I
use this brush from ELF I can't remember
exactly what it's called but it's one of
their very dense
you know synthetic brushes seemed like
it would fit this product okay and so I
dip into the one side the peachy side
and kind of apply that around my under
eye area and I realize this is being
called a primer so I'm not expecting
like full coverage with this stuff but I
am hoping to see a little bit of
difference in my skin and then lavender
seems to be a shade often marketed as
something that will brighten and
dullness and the skin side has kind of
applied that everywhere on my face and I
just didn't feel like I saw a big result
here not much whatsoever in addition to
that I feel like this cushion in here is
a little bit on the dry side like I'm
still picking up some product but it's
not nearly as juicy as I would hope and
for as new as this is and that's a
little discouraging but anyway overall
with this I just don't think it's worth
it again I don't see the actual color
correction in my skin number one and
number two for this to act as a primer a
lot of times I like primers to be
something that's going to actually like
smooth out the surface of my skin a
little bit actually improve the way
foundation applies on top of it and I
just like what the heck I don't see any
real advantage to using this now it does
contain SPF 20 that's nice to see but
beyond that I'm not really sure this is
doing anything for me
now these wet and wild
cushions these are called color
correctors nowhere in the product does
it say primer the claims on the backs a
featherweight finish ultra blendable
super convenient I again had the peach
and the yellow but these are not
referred to as primers these are
actually only labeled as being color
correctors the peach says for dark
circles and the yellow says brightens
Dolman I kind of assumed these were
going to turn out to be the very same
effect on my skin as the physician's
formula but that my friends would be an
incorrect assumption because I find
these to be very very different
these to me seem practically like a
cushion concealer there is more coverage
in these products when you apply them to
the skin they're just more like opacity
you're not seeing right through it it's
not just completely blending away on me
so that is something I like to see but
let's back it up real quick and I will
go over just the way these are packaged
you twist off the top and then there is
a little sponge that they give you here
and then a secondary lid that comes out
but it's not connected to the actual
container of product which I don't
really love that just because it's a
little bit more of a hassle but these
are costing you a whole lot less than
the Physicians Formula so definitely
take that into consideration also with
both of my wet and wild mega cushions
they feel extremely juicy with product
like you're barely touching a brush in
there to pick some up whereas with the
Physicians Formula it felt like I was
really dunking down in there to try to
get some out now these are products with
no shimmer in them they are just a
straight-up
color you're only going to see the demo
on one of these because I think there's
only one that really works best for my
skin tone and that's the peach it's a
little bit lighter more brightening the
yellow is really I think true soft
yellow shade but it's not quite bright
enough to brighten my tone of skin if
you're a little bit deeper than me I
think it certainly will have an effect
on some people but it's just not again
quite bright enough to do much on me the
peach so let me show you how I use this
I brought in a flat foundation brush
I feel like this gives me the most bang
for my buck coverage wise although
sponges work great with
and you know probably other brushes that
you might try but I just dab into it and
then pat it on my under eye area because
that's where I can most take advantage
of a peachy corrector product and it's
kind of amazing how much coverage this
had I had used this underneath
foundation but to me like I said they
feel more like a concealer so I already
have my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation on which is kind of a medium
coverage product and then I just patted
this where I wanted more brightness and
it really did work well now I do not
think this peach corrector is ultimate
full coverage it's kind of in a medium
place for me the person who could get
away with using this and this alone I
don't think has the most major big-time
under-eye circles right you just got a
little bit of discoloration in this area
this might be all you need but some
people may need more and I was wanted to
show you how after I use this yes I got
tons of brightness out of this product
and I think I'm going to continue using
this to give me some brightness but for
a real correction on certain spots I
brought in some benefit erase paste and
I just wanted to show you you know the
overall effect that you get when you add
in something a little bit extra there
but just for brightening and brightening
the high points of the face and using it
in that manner
this works really well and what it
reminds me of is the Maybelline instant
age rewind concealer and this is kind of
coming out of a little cushiony tip here
I'm surprised they haven't like
remarketed these as cushion concealers
but it's similar to this kind of thing
in consistency and coverage maybe not
quite as much coverage as one of these
but it's really really close and again
it's that peachy tone that can be very
very brightening on the under eye area
so as you saw I haven't tried every
shade of these wet and wild color
corrector cushions but the ones that I
have used are proving to be very
different from this product from
Physicians Formula
again this is marketed more like a
primer color corrector and these are
just called color correctors and for me
they're performing more like a concealer
would really pretty happy with the peach
and pretty surprised by the effect that
I got and I believe these are available
exclusively at Walmart these in the
other shades of the color correctors
from Wet n Wild so let me know what you
think if you tried them
work for you did they meet your
expectations let me know in the comments
section and I will talk to you guys next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
