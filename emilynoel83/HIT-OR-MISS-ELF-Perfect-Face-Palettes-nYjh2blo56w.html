today I am talking about several new
pallets from elf they are called the
perfect face pallets and it's actually a
combination of eye lip and cheek
products all in one and it is that time
of year where we're seeing tons of
different pallets for both high-end and
drug store brands so I really wanted to
get a review out on these so you would
know sort of how they stack up so you've
got three options one is the smokey
matte palette other one is the Rose
palette and then you also have a nude
palette but as far as how these did for
me quality wise I feel I have a clear
favorite one that I really really like
not just a matter of oh it's the best
out of the three but one that I could
see myself continuing to use and
recommend to people and then there's two
that just kind of missed the mark for me
both for different reasons so I'm going
to jump in and talk first about the one
that I enjoyed the most which was the
smokey matte I just really think there's
a lot going for this palette number one
it's great quality and number two I
think it was just smartly put together
when I look at the mix of shades when I
see it all together on my face I think
yeah that makes sense these colors work
together so what you're getting our
three eyeshadows got this light shade
that's very cool just like a hint of
rose in that color and then this pretty
sort of mix of dusty rose and lilac
which makes a great crease shade and
then your darkest shade which is a near
black and I think it's very easy to use
because it is not a full-on black and
none of these shades feel super dry it's
actually a really nice quality matte
texture and then as far as the blushes
go in here it's actually these seem
identical to the matte blush duo in Fiji
if anybody's got that I really enjoyed
that product I thought it was nice
quality really smooth matte products and
it seems exactly the same to what's in
here so you got a bronzer type product
works fine as a contour I use that as a
contour today and then the blush is just
a nice natural peachy blush now
regardless of you know this palette
being called matte or whatever the other
ones are they all seem to have the same
kind of formula in the lip products
which seemed to be a creamy lipstick
just kind of smushed into a pan you know
what I mean they're not sheer
like lipglosses but they're not like
matte lip colors either so I was kind of
surprised that they didn't stick some
sort of matte formula in here although
maybe there was concern that a matte
formula in a palette it's going to just
be wide open a lot of the time might dry
out even quicker than it should anyway
you're getting a deep kind of cranberry
red and then a really dark wine color as
well so I love the smoky matte palette I
was actually just asked the other day on
Twitter somebody needing recommendations
for matte blushes and matte eyeshadows
at a drugstore price and I feel like
this palette totally does a it's a great
color scheme for fall in winter and the
quality of the matte shadows and stuff
in there is just really really good now
moving on to the one that I would say is
in the middle for me but really these
next two I just don't wouldn't really
see myself recommending them or using
them a whole lot whatsoever but you got
this palette called rose and I feel like
I glanced at this color scheme and it's
all over the place for me you got this
bright pinky blush here there's a really
red lip color and then your neutral
shadows over here where they incorporate
a rose gold and I kind of that's
mentally what I thought going into this
it was going to be more like like a rose
gold soft palette color scheme like that
and really the rose gold nature of that
eye shadow I thought that was kind of
weak anyway it doesn't really stand out
or build up that well on the eyes the
two mats that you're getting in here a
matte cream and a matte Brown I thought
performed pretty well I was wanting a
little more pop out of that center shade
and then as far as your blush bronzer
your bronzer has kind of a satiny finish
and the blush has a little bit of
shimmer to it as well it doesn't show up
super pronounced on the cheeks
shimmer wise but it's very colorful it's
like a bright kind of corally pink and
then you get both a nude and a warm red
lip color and again I just I look at the
whole color palette and where the smoky
matte totally made sense to me 100%
across-the-board this one I look at and
it's just kind of like would I really
see myself pulling for that warm red
along with this color scheme like I'm
not sure and that's a blush that's
really going to show on you too you know
it's going to be fairly bright so with
the exception of that one eye shadow I
don't really have a lot of gripes about
this pal
pigmentation wise but it's more of you
know what I realistically where all
these products and these tones together
probably not and again I just kind of
wonder what part of this was meant to be
Rose was it playing off of the rose gold
shadow was it supposed to be like a rosy
blush or are they calling like the lip
color over here to be rose and
everything's supposed to complement that
I just don't see these different shades
really complementing one another that
much and then my kind of third-place
palette is a third-place palette mainly
due to quality reasons and it's the one
labeled nude and you've got a couple of
decent eyeshadows in here with this
light pearly shade your second shadow is
a really perfect like matte crease color
then you've got a deeper shade that
doesn't offer a whole lot like when
that's sheer doubt on the eyes that
bronzy brown it does not do much for me
and then I was really kind of
disappointed in the quality of both the
highlight and the blush this highlight
is very chalky it almost strikes me more
like a white eyeshadow with a little bit
of Sheen than an actual highlight when
you put your brush in it's just you know
there's a lot of product going on there
and not in the best texture possible and
then the blush I can hardly make show up
at all so that's a soft peach and I know
the palettes labeled nude but you know
I'd at least like to see the blush and
then your lip colors no real problems
here one's a nude one's a pretty rose
color both very wearable when I glanced
at the color scheme I think yeah that
should all work but if it's not all like
really working quality wise across the
board there's just so much palette
competition out there these days I can't
see myself saying yeah I go ahead and
pick that one up but back to the smokey
matte being my favorite I mean I just
think everything in here is really good
another thing I didn't mention is that
this can make a nice eye shadow as well
like a perfect kind of brownish crease
color if you didn't want to take it so
much in this rosy mauve scheme but I
will show you how I put my look together
today with this palette so after getting
you know foundation concealer and powder
on I use the bronzer shade this is going
to be a subtle bronzer you know I'm used
it around my hairline a little bit gave
myself a little contour in the
cheekbones the blush though I love how
it's a pretty peach it's not really
shout from the rooftops hey I'm wearing
a peach blush you know it's one of those
shapes
seems like it might naturally occur from
the skin and again both of those shades
are matte and then on the eyes I prime
my lids and I use that Center sort of
dusty rose color in my crease and I love
it love that type of shade in the crease
and then I use the lightest shade up
under my brow and I also patted some of
that shade on top of my lid then I took
the darkest shade again with a flat
brush and I just dab that on my outer
corner up into the crease a little bit
you guys could have probably glanced at
these three shades and predicted how I
was going to use them but you know
that's the way I think they look best
then I took some liner across my upper
lash line and I came back in with the
black just to sort of link in with my
wing a bit and get some liner going on
the lower lash line finish the look with
some mascara some false lashes the end
result I think is very wearable I think
you can totally customize the amount of
the deepest color that you throw in and
take it into more of a nighttime smoky
look or eliminate that shade altogether
and just use these two as a duo and you
would be fine for a natural daytime look
but I was wearing these colors in a
recent video and a lot of you asked
what's on your eyes what are you doing
there and so it was this palette then
the lip color and like I said these are
not met even in the matte palette you're
getting a cream like standard kind of
creamy lipstick and so I used mostly the
wine color all over my lips with my own
lip brush and I put a little bit of the
red just in the center of the lower lip
just to switch things up a bit before
going out I would probably give this a
nice blot so I wouldn't be worried about
the darkness of this color sort of
drifting somewhere it wasn't supposed to
be not saying it's a bad formula but
it's probably not going to be as long
wearing as say one of those elf matte
lip colors would be but still I
thoroughly enjoy the shades that they
put in here like I said very fall/winter
appropriate and I think it plays so
nicely with that eye as well so guys
that's my take on these perfect face
palettes and like I said they're just
tons of palette competition out there
these days so I'm looking very
critically at these but I was pleased to
see that there is one that I really
really liked
I think I'll definitely latch on to this
I would definitely recommend this to my
matte
and blush lovers the other two you know
they've got bits and pieces of them that
are positive points but for the most
part it's not a palette I would look at
and recommend or get a lot of use out of
just my take my personal opinions but
thank you guys for requesting this video
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
