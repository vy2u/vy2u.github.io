here and in today's video I'm going to
be telling you a little bit about this
estee lauder double wear nude water
fresh makeup and I am a big follower of
the whole double wear line I feel like
whenever there's a new double wear
product I definitely want to try it out
and I think the og like regular double
wear makeup is amazing great coverage
great staying power I have enjoyed that
stuff so much over the years and when I
was dealing with melasma in its fullest
state I felt like the Double Wear
maximum cover was one of the best things
to cover that up
and do it basically without the
assistance of any other products it's a
really great thing so I was really kind
of surprised that I ended up enjoying
this water fresh makeup as much as I did
it does come under the Double Wear
umbrella so that leads you to believe
that it's going to have good staying
power and it's going to you know provide
some coverage I guess but I really just
did not think I was going to like it as
much as I do because I feel like I've
been burned by some different super
lightweight foundations in the past
because I do love coverage but I'm
willing to go with something that's
going to give me the look of beautiful
skin you know even if it is a little bit
lighter coverage if it's something where
I can see the finish in my skin and not
feel like I'm seeing makeup makeup
makeup but I'm just seeing you know kind
of a naturally perfected skin even if
I'm seeing some freckles through it like
these days I'm coming to appreciate a
product that can actually give you the
look of real skin but just maybe more
radiant skin more hydrated skin kind of
gently evened out skin and I can rally
around something like that if it's going
to look really good so this product I do
have it in desert beige it's a really
good like skin tone match for me and I'm
going to get into the application of
this product in this video not just this
but also like the concealer and powder
and stuff that I like to apply alongside
it to get a really fresh look but this
does claim to be medium coverage and it
claims to be for all skin types they say
it has a satin finish SPF 30 and I guess
the short story on this foundation if
you look at Sephora's website I say it's
a fluid long wear makeup with SPF 30 and
antioxidants that feels like you have
nothing
on they also go on to claim 24 hours
staying power with this product they say
it hydrates continuously upon
application and then they go on to say
that it's also oil free and oil
controlling so it's going to
continuously hydrate you yet it's also
going to control oil sounds a little too
good to be true that can be doing both
of those things but I think maybe it
could also be described as a skin
balancing foundation like it might take
people who are on the extremes and just
kind of make you a little more normal
but I am wearing this foundation all
over my skin today and I could not be
more pleased with just the overall look
of my skin I am wearing some concealers
with this on my key areas where I need
concealer and wearing a little bit of a
very natural finish powder which I'm
going to definitely explain to you in
this video what that is but just looking
up close at my skin like yeah I can see
some of the freckles that I have I feel
like I'm not hiding my natural skin in
this product but the finish is so not
makeup II and it really does feel ultra
lightweight it is so super thin but yeah
it's not quite as thin as this guy the
makeup forever water blend I felt like
this did nothing for me
this truly is as thin as water and it
comes out with a pump this one does not
have a pump and I kind of wish it did
it's just standard bottle type packaging
they say shake it well you just kind of
get sent out on your finger and apply it
I'm just kind of playing around
swatching this one on my hand again and
it's so thin it just kind of turns
invisible immediately this stuff a
little bit thicker than that it does
definitely feel a little more
moisturizing than this one and without a
doubt quite a bit more coverage they
claim that this is a medium coverage
foundation I feel like I get kind of a
light coverage initially and I build to
medium with a little added product and I
think you got a lot of control with this
foundation some foundations there's that
really fine line where it's like it
looks good with just a little put on
your skin but then you get too much and
it's blatantly obvious that your skin is
covered in foundation this I feel like I
can go back to certain areas apply a
little bit more and I really can't see
it but yet I have improved the coverage
somewhat so I don't say
I'm going to get more than medium out of
this so you got to know that going into
it not everybody may be a fan of that
and if you want more than that
then I would look to more of the
traditional Double Wear type foundation
I think part of what I'm enjoying about
this so much is the weightlessness of it
I definitely am just as is kind of a
normal skin type and I think this
foundation keeps me there throughout the
course of a day it doesn't make me more
oily and at the same time my dry areas
don't start to look more dry and more
patchy as a day wears on so it's really
keeping me kind of balanced in middle of
the road there and I love that wearing
this foundation on and off over the last
couple of weeks I've been trying to keep
such a close eye on staying power and I
think I've put it through you know more
than just the standard climate
controlled environment I mean it's been
kind of humid down here lately I've been
outside quite a bit there's just been a
lot of playtime a lot of activity in my
life chasing after two little kids and
Eva's crawling now and still I look at
this at the end of the day and I can
tell I still have product on now it's
not going to be as blatantly obvious
like it is when you wear double wear and
you look at your skin at the end of the
day and you can really kind of tell that
there's makeup on your skin here it's
not going to be blatantly obvious that
you've got makeup on your skin even at
the onset like looking at myself this
close-up I know there's makeup on
because I just applied it but you know
what I'm saying it looks light to begin
with so it's still going to look light
by the end of the day but I take it off
like with my face washcloth and there is
a full face of you know foundation
coming off onto my face washcloth at the
end of the day so this stuff is not just
like sunk into my pores are just worn
off somehow it's definitely staying on
there over the course of an entire day
24-hour wear though I don't know you
probably would still have this on your
skin after 24 hours but I wouldn't give
any guarantees as to how fresh it would
truly look after 24 hours I'm not really
into doing a full-on 24 hour test of
something because I'm a believer in
removing your makeup you know at the end
of a reasonable day but all that being
said I've had some pretty good skin
lately like I'm not dealing with major
discoloration I don't have major texture
issues there have been times in my life
where I think I would be completely
unsatisfied by this level of coverage
and if you've got major discoloration
major redness lots of spots that you
want to cover on your skin you might
just feel like gosh this wasn't really
worthwhile but if you're wanting
something that feels lightweight if
you're having pretty good skin and you
just want to absolutely give yourself
like there's this hard to put your
finger on luminosity that comes with
this product and they call it a satin
finish I guess that's probably about as
accurate a term as I could come up with
- you know you can't see any flecks of
anything in this that would make you
think it's pearlescent by any means but
you put it on your skin and immediately
I just love the look of my skin even
more it is a your skin but better type
of product but here's another thing that
plays into why I'm satisfied with this
overall look it's the way I combine
concealers with this and the way I use
powder with this which is very very
minimal because you can take a light
foundation and you can powder yourself
up to smithereens
and then feel like you don't look
natural and you know what that's not the
focus of the foundation that's your own
bang fault for layering on too much
powder so you got to keep it light if
you want to take advantage of the
lightweight natural skin like look so
I'm going to take you through how I
actually put this on so I use the
product and it says shake well shake it
up and then I just kind of tip the
bottle get it out on my finger and I
begin dabbing this all over my skin I
probably go back and you know turn the
bottle three or four times as I get it
patched all over my skin and then I like
to use a nice dense brush to blend this
out on my Sigma flat kabuki works great
it's the easiest to blend foundation
ever it takes like next to no effort
this is not going to set quickly on your
skin the way normal Double Wear does so
you take your time get it all blended
out it's no big deal
and then I will often times dip back
into the prize and I'll show you how I
do that I just add a little bit more
right on the under eye area kind of top
of my cheeks that's probably my biggest
problem area and I think even just
adding a little more foundation there
helps the look of that area a whole lot
but my work here is not done I go in
with concealer and most days I would say
I use a little bit of this benefit
boying a brightening concealer this is
the new erase paste y'all check out my
video
misted sort in that whole situation out
but I wear this in number two and I get
a little bit of that on my deepest
darkest areas and my little caverns on
the inner part of the eye and then on
top of that I dab on some L'Oreal
infallible Pro Glo concealer in classic
ivory this is a great concealer to pair
with lighter coverage foundations
because it doesn't like out coverage the
foundation you know what I mean it wears
well with more lightweight like BB cream
natural finish looking products it
doesn't make you look like you've got
this huge mask on the under eye and then
this light coverage everywhere else you
know I'm saying with that so it blends
really well also with the texture of the
raised space I used my Sigma P 84 but I
could use a lot of different brushes if
I wanted to to get the job done here
just blend that all out I also have that
concealer kind of on the high points of
my face I've got a little blemish like
on my upper lip area and that concealer
even though it's not the most heavy duty
stuff in the world it's enough to get
the job done and it just wears well with
a lightweight look this powder here me
here because this is super important the
Milani prep set and glow illuminating
transparent powder don't be scared of
the word illuminating with this because
it's not like a highlight really it's
just a super soft luxuriously textured
counter that has just so much smoothness
to it so much skin light quality it's
only going to come in this one shade and
I like to use my ELF small tapered brush
dab dab dab it in kind of press it in
right there on your under eye area and
it's just the perfect thing and then I
also do it maybe a little bit around my
t-zone but keep it very light it just
gives my skin the best natural look
without accentuating the look of texture
it also doesn't make me look too flat
it's just a really good pairing with
this stuff but I am NOT applying a ton
of that product then I just continue on
the final look with whatever bronzer
blush eyeshadow you name it that I want
to use on a given day they actually used
some stuff from this in the balm of your
hand volume 2 palette yes they came out
with the volume 2 I called that way back
in the day but I'm wearing some of these
shadows
the Bahama Mama bronzer on my skin the
insane houndstooth blush and also the
mary-lou manizer highlighter on my lips
if you're curious it's the l'oreal color
riche matte pencil in the shade
mastermind it's a really great natural
color and then moon lust this metallics
paint kind of in the center of the lower
lip like a lip topper idea hmm lip
toppers that was a recent video also
anyway guys the finished look I could
not be more pleased with this look I
just love how the products come together
I think that double wear nude water
fresh is really a surprisingly good
product I mean if you got it in your
head about how some of these water blend
or water type foundations if you think
you know how they are yeah you might be
right with some of them but with this
one it's got just enough thickness and
just enough like I don't know richness
in the formula to actually give you some
coverage but also just give you this
beautiful like healthy radiance to your
skin but as I said if the way I
described this if that doesn't like meet
your foundation criteria and if you need
coverage to the max or you need this or
that you know it might not be for
everybody but if you're ready for that
kind of lightweight approach to makeup
you might be into it I was surprised how
into it I ended up being so thank you
guys so much for watching if you have
any questions let me know in the
comments section and I can definitely
try to clarify some stuff for you but
thank you for your time and I will see
you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
