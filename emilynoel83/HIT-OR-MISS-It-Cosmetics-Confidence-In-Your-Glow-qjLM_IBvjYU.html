for this video it's going to be a little
review on a new sort of blush bronzer
highlight combo product that I've been
using lately it's from it cosmetics and
it's called confidence in your glow and
I have all three shapes that this comes
in and it's interesting because there's
part of this product that I really agree
with I really love the quality I like
that basically they've included three
different elements in one but alongside
this product they've also come out with
this brush called the one sweep wonder
and this is said to pair with these
products and you can just sweep it
across and pop it on and you've got the
full effect on your face I'm just going
to get that part of the review out of
the way right now I mean this is a soft
brush it's incredibly soft and as you
can see the bristles become a little
more I don't know sheared out they're a
little bit softer and lighter up toward
the end if you've used it cosmetics
pressures before you know they're good
quality they're super duper soft this is
about the size you're looking at sweep
across the cheek I'm not really
criticizing it in that respect but if
you want to just go across all these
products with it junk and then put it
right on your cheeks I guess I just
don't feel like that's the best effect
I mean you end up with a glowy neutral
blush essentially it's not a bad look
and I certainly can't argue with the
speed of just going through it going
like that but I guess I get more
satisfaction out of these products when
I actually use each thing individually I
use a brush that's suited to the contour
and then I apply the blush and then I
use the highlight that's just what I
like to do with it I really think that's
the way everything comes off the most
finished looking on my skin is when
things are sort of compartmentalized
they're not saying you couldn't use this
brush and things would still look
alright but at the same time you could
also get that effect with probably any
blush brush you have at home just by
dipping across the different shades and
then sweeping them on so the brush I see
is a little bit of a gimmick kind of
tied into this product might be
something that gets people to make that
extra purchase but let's talk a little
bit more about the face products here
and I've got a little card that said
some claims as with a lot of it
cosmetics products they're kind
blurring the line between makeup and
skincare so these are said to be infused
with anti-aging ingredients their talc
free it also says they have a fresh
orange scent and they do have a little
bit of an orange e citrusy vibe going on
and it says they're also infused with
vitamin C and just pigmentation wise the
appearance on the skin the way
everything applies like the richness of
color I love these I mean obviously
there are some other benefits associated
with the product but just for the makeup
itself I do enjoy it and the one that
I'm wearing today is probably the most
natural one I was kind of going back and
forth between which one I should demo in
this video that I thought the instant
noodle oh one might be the one that
there would be the most questions
surrounding you know because it's the
softest it's kind of the most natural so
how much does it actually show on the
skin that is the one I'm wearing both
ads like bronzers flash contour blush
and highlight so the way these are all
set up is it's sort of that kind of
ombre effect one fades into the next I
do kind of like that they did that
actually I mean so many products that
come out these days we see that one two
three your bronzer blush Isla and this
does make it a little different and if
you did just want to buy that brush and
sweep across it all that allows that
option and something else that I like
about these palettes one to the next is
that they've switched up every color
it's not like you're just getting a
different blush shade in each one you're
getting a different highlight blush and
bronzer and every one of them also
packaging is really cute you've got this
little like it cosmetics medallion here
and there's a mirror in each one of them
but here's how I would help you kind of
sort through these color wise you've got
the nude glow and this is going to be
your softest most natural color palette
then there's one called instant warm
glow and I feel like this is everything
in the new glow palette just stepped up
a notch intensity wise I feel like the
highlight is more pronounced the blush
is more intense the bronzer is a little
bit deeper if there were any of these
palettes that a deeper skin tone would
be able to wear the best and have the
most color payoff with it would be this
one you can probably see exactly what
I'm talking about here here it's like a
soft peachy blush this one it's a bold
coral blush and here I think the blush
has just maybe a little
of a satiny finish not a super shimmery
blush if you just wanted to confine your
brush in here and have a not too shiny
look on the cheeks you can do that but
this one is absolutely without a doubt a
matte blush in the middle like I said a
little bit deeper bronzer a little bit
warmer bronzer and I find the highlight
to be more intense it kind of contrasts
more with that deeper blush shade so
that's what's happening there and then
this next one is instant natural glow
and as you can see here it's going in
more of a pink and berry direction I
feel like everything is softer in this
one for some reason I'm nothing it's not
pigmented but the blush isn't super
intense the highlight is definitely the
softest out of all of them and the
bronzer is just a nice light tone as
well it's definitely pretty everything
really does show up on my skin I'm not
saying that I just feel like it's a
little I don't know a little less
intense especially compared to this guy
right here if you're not a huge fan of
the peachy blushes you go more toward
the pinks and berries and mauve you
might enjoy that one more so personally
I think this one the instant warm glow
is the most bang for your buck color
wise I think a little goes a long way
with this and I think the darker skin
tones would love this and this is very
everyday and this one I've really been
drawn to because I feel like when I
don't really have any direction with the
lips that I've decided on for the day
this ends up just kind of looking good
with everything for example I'm wearing
this today and I am sporting a berry lip
and I think it all totally works you
know and I'm also wearing this on my
eyes that's the other like little
multitasking element that all definitely
demo for you I mean the eye is so easy
it's not like it takes any real
instruction by just pointing out that
these palettes take their highlight and
take the bronzer heck even take the
blush if you want to and put it on your
eyes it really does work so here's what
I did today to apply the instant noodle
oh I already had foundation on and
concealer and a little powder and I have
my brows done and then I took my ELF
complexion brush went into the bronzer
type color here and I went around the
perimeter of my face I took it under the
cheekbones and thought wow you know
there's some color payoff and it doesn't
look too orange it looks SuperDuper
natural I think and then the blush as I
said before we're talking a soft peach
color here
and it might have just a little bit of
Sheen especially if you pick up any of
the neighboring highlight that's
practically overlapping with this color
but I use my defining powder brush from
Estee Lauder just loving that brush for
blush these days I also love the staying
power of these products I really feel
like they hang around all day and then
for a little highlight I use my Moda
highlight and glow brush and put it on
top of my cheekbones down my nose
Cupid's bow area wherever you want to
highlight I think it works really really
nicely I would describe the highlight in
this particular trio as having just a
little bit of a champagne color to it I
wouldn't quite go golden with it but
there is just a little bit of warmth to
it and then if you want to really make
your look low-maintenance like I did
today I put a little eye primer on first
and then I patted with a rather large
shadow brush and just patted the
highlight shade all over my lid and then
I put a little bit of that up under the
brow as well and then in classic
sandwich method as we sometimes call
this technique I just put the bronzer
right there in the crease and this is a
very eye brightening effect whenever
you've got the light shade both on the
lid and the brow bone and then just
something for a little contrast and the
crease is so so easy and I've done that
with every single one of these palettes
by the way oh and I did take a little
like pencil style brush and use the
bronzer part just on the lower lash line
as well it gives the eyes a little more
definition and then to finish off the
look I did do a nude liner in the lower
inner rim and mascara top and bottom and
a little lipstick and that's the look
it's so so simple I really do like the
quality of these products I think
they're all nicely pigmented they all
have good staying power like I still
feel like I'm seeing my blush and I'm
seeing my highlight as I go throughout
the day and again you do have that
option of taking one brush and sweeping
it through everything and just applying
it to the cheeks I mean frankly this
brush that I'm holding right now this
elf complexion brush it has that sort of
similar taper up towards the top and you
could do that with this brush I don't
think you have to go out and buy this
heavenly skin brush one drawback for
these if you are continually using
everything individually and you might
wonder about the pace at which you go
through the different products like are
you really big on using bronzer or are
you really big on using the highlight
just the blush like you might wear down
certain parts of this palette faster I
guess that could happen with any like
highlight blush bronzer palette you're
using you might use more of one product
than the other
I think what's good about these is the
quality is consistent from thing to
thing so if you are like me and you like
to use them all individually they all
stand out they all hold their own I
don't feel like I'm struggling to pick
up one like oh gosh when I want to use
that blush I've got to pick up a ton on
my brush and really work at it each
thing I'm just kind of dabbing into it
and putting it on it's very easy the
instant new glow is the most like
can't-miss option for me but like I said
if you're not so much into a peach look
on the cheeks you might think about this
one and this is not like bold peach you
see it side by side with the one that's
more coral and you totally get that this
is softer it's just not as much orange
not as much brightness in it so I love
this one this might be my number two and
then this one called instant natural
glow still liked it but it's going to be
the least intense highlight and bronzer
/ contour side of all three I think so
guys that's my take on the confidence in
your glow compacts from it cosmetics I
really like them they're $32 a piece
which I think pretty much falls in line
with the cost of a lot of it cosmetics
things
it's beautiful packaging there's also a
mirror it's a generous amount of product
here so yeah I'm definitely a fan if
you've tried them let me know what you
think and I will see you again in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
