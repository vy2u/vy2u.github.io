some eyeshadow palettes from Jordana and
I don't know how many of you actually
have access to Jordana's full line in
your stores I know some people do around
me Walgreens is the store that carries
Jordana but it's just like a small
amount you get some lip liners some lip
glosses few eyeliners and that's kind of
the extent of it so some of you have
probably seen these in store but if all
else fails they are online that's where
I ordered one of mine and then I happen
to be sent three of these from the
company and there are these six color
eyeshadow palettes and the quality on
these is surprisingly good these are
gonna run you $7.99 apiece and I was
just really impressed by how bold and
how smooth and consistent the shadows
were in all of these palettes so I just
kind of wanted to talk through the ones
that I have in this video and point out
the things I like about them and then
there one overall thing that I can't get
past that I don't like about them now
Jordanna and Milani are under the same
ownership so that kind of explains why
perhaps you see some overlap in their
lines in certain products you might
think well that's really similar to that
thing or that seems like the same
formula to this Milani has not too long
ago come out with eyeshadow palettes
that look like this they're called
everyday eyes I've got the smoky
essentials one the earthy elements and
this one is the must-have neutrals or
must-have Naturals I'm sorry but these
are gonna run you $9.99 a piece so
that's usually the way it goes
Jordana is just a hint cheaper and I
feel like Milan ease packaging is
probably a little more expensive instead
of getting a double-ended sponge tip
here you're getting like a double-ended
brush and there are still six shadows in
each one of these Milani palettes but
you're getting a little bit different
configuration you know one might be
wider you got two over here and just as
far as the quality of these eyeshadows
go I think it's totally there in both
lines you've got shimmery shades that
are really smooth and pigmented you've
got matte shades that are very very bold
I mean the swatches I'll be showing you
throughout this video if the Jordana
palettes are done with one swipe of the
finger on no primer so you're just
seeing bare bones like what can it do
but
all difference that I've noticed in all
of these Jordana palates that I'm going
to go through and show you I feel like
we've got shimmery shades light shades
you've got really really dark mattes but
there's no like medium mid-tone matte
just for a soft crease color you're
either really light or really dark and
there might be some shimmers that fall
in between but as far as just like a
soft natural crease shade I feel like
everything that you might put in your
crease in any of these Jordana palettes
is like one of two really dark colors
and all of these you know like a black
or a really dark plum or a dark navy of
really dark black in that one the odd
thing is that the random three Milani
palettes that I have they are all more
well balanced than that you've got dark
shades you've got light shades but in
every one of my Milani palettes I've got
at least one color maybe even more that
can be that soft you know neutral crease
color that you want for a more natural
look you know something that's gonna
create contrast but isn't like a black
or near black charcoal so it just really
surprised me that in the four pallets I
have from Jordana not one of them seem
to have a color like that where you know
you've really got all your bases covered
with in one palette now it doesn't make
these palettes unusable by any means and
you can totally go to town with one of
these pull in one of your many other
eyeshadow palettes or eyeshadows singles
that's got that transition color neutral
matte crease color that you're after but
when I do reviews on palettes one thing
that I always look at is you know could
it be used just as a free-standing thing
and give people that convenience like if
you just grabbed that one it would be
everything and I feel like with these
there's a little something missing and
it just is funny to me that the Milani
ones all had that little element in them
and then the Jordana ones did not but I
really truly for the price of $7.99
cannot pick apart the quality of the
eyeshadows that you are being given
because I do think they're really good
so I want to take you through swatches
of each one of these the first one is
the palette called beachy keen and this
one is you know full of neutrals you do
have a couple shimmery pops you've got
this really light shimmery golden pink
at the start of the palette that I think
is really nice a pinky shade your matte
Brown a matte cream a gold and then
almost a borderline all of e-type color
don't rely on that for a lot of green
but it's kind of like a dusty brownish
olive then they have a palette called
make me mad and this one is 100% matte
so all the swatches here read from shine
free from any sort of shimmer the second
shade in this palette I might have
thought would be that soft neutral
crease color but sadly it's just a
little too light for that it really
blends in with my skin when I put it in
my crease I don't feel like it shows a
whole lot I would have to do a little
bit of maybe mixing with the next
deepest shade just to create something
that would work there your two lightest
shades are very very close to one
another so I mean one of those I really
think could have been that nice soft
neutral matte crease next one is called
plum believable and these shades really
look beautiful and I do have a little
bit of a fallout concern with the second
to last color that did cause a lot of
glittery issues for me when I was using
this before as a whole it's a really
pretty color scheme here second really
metallic taupe is gorgeous straight-up
matte plum in here is really nice and
then you've got a near black at the end
of the palette and as you look at this
one compared to the next one you can see
they've put a true black in this one
called what a steal and this one has
some really unique shades that second
color is like golden there's a teeny
hint of green coming out of that very
interesting a matte navy blue that's
super intense that pretty turquoise a
true rich black and then let's not
forget about the first color in this
lineup which is a pearly white that is
so so vivid like I mean there's nothing
sheer about that shade whatsoever and
then I should point out on the back of
each of these palettes your colors are
numbered and you've got that sort of
like paint by number here's a few looks
that you can get one of them says to
hang out to go out to stand out and
that's the way they're all identified
the looks on the back but out of all of
these shadows from Jordana I mean I
would say my only real quality concern
was like this shade which I think is a
gorgeous like rosy soft metallic shade
but it's got so much sparkle in it it
can be hard to control I think you can
like rain that one in a little bit maybe
with a stickier primer or like a cream
color base or something but beyond that
everything worked really well and I
think 799 is a super fair price tag for
a palette of six shadows that are of
great quality I just wish the whole
palette was a little more complete if
you know what I'm saying just gave me
like one more thing like all of the
Milani ones managed to do but I used the
palette in beachy keen today so I'll
walk you through the looks you can see
these products in action I do have a
primer on my lids and I used that very
lightest shimmery like borderline pinky
gold around the innermost corner and
then I patted some of the gold on to the
inner part of my lid and I kind of
transitioned out of that color into the
pink I thought it would just like make
an interesting little overlap there I
went to my matte Brown and just used a
smallish crease brush this is the one
from anyway professional I got at CVS
and just went with that pretty dark
matte brown in the crease and you know
you can blend it out you can kind of
soften it a little bit as you blend and
another thing that can help get a little
softer look out of a color like that is
taking one of the mid-tones like the
pink and then sort of going right over
the edge of that I used the lightest
matte color up under my brow as a
highlight I'm about Jordana might as
well use my Jordana color Envy liquid
liner in black Envy across the upper
lash line and I pulled in some of that
olive color actually did use all six
shades in this palette use the olive and
smudge it on my lower lash line and
applied some mascara got some demi
wispies lashes on and that is the
finished look and I do feel like it
looks very finished but like I've said I
think there would be even more
opportunities for softer more natural
looks with these pallets if they gave
you something that was matte but not on
the darkest end of the matte spectrum
you know and all that being said I
haven't tried every single palette from
Jordana so maybe if you've tried other
ones outside of these four you might
notice that maybe certain ones had a
soft like neutral mid-tone matte thrown
in there and I think that's something to
look for in just about any palette you
grab because it gives you the
opportunity to not make your crease
shade be the deepest darkest ones of
Bunch it gives you a little more
versatility and that's what I loved
about the Milani palette so I hope that
was useful for you guys thank you so
much for taking time to watch and I will
see you very soon in my next video
