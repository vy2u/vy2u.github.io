mega pro 3 and ever since this has come
out I've seen loads and loads of
questions on my channel about it so for
the past few holiday seasons lorac has
been releasing a large eyeshadow palette
that contains basically double the
amount of eyeshadows that you would get
in a regular like lorac pro 1 or pro 2
get two rows of mattes at the top two
rows of shimmers and in this particular
palette it's a lot of neutral a lot of
warm neutrals with some cool neutrals
thrown in here and there let's start off
with the pros and the things that I like
about this palette first off consistency
lurex quality of eyeshadow seems to stay
really consistent not only from what you
already know about the brand and what
you've come to expect from their
eyeshadows if you're a fan of their
shadows the way they feel the textures
the way they are to work with on the
eyes you're getting that in here I do
think there's some of the most pigmented
shadows out there and I love working
with both mattes and shimmers from this
line and in this palette I feel like I
am getting what I would expect quality
wise and I also feel like there's a lot
of consistency throughout the whole
palette like I like the mattes over here
just as much as I like the mattes over
here in the same story with the shimmery
shades I don't feel like I was running
into hit and miss shadows all over the
place shade selection is somewhere
between a hit and a Miss for me because
are these shades pretty and wearable
absolutely can you get some great looks
with these colors sure thing but I mean
does it excite me that much the one
thing I'm trying to get past in my mind
the one thing that I think is really
exciting me about this is just the fact
that it's new like oh it's the latest
big Laura palette for the holidays I'm
excited but then you know I get it in my
hands I start doing looks with it and
it's just kind of like leaving me
wanting a little bit more in terms of
excitement there are so many neutral
eyeshadow palettes out there lorac
themselves already have a bunch of great
neutral eyeshadow palettes so I feel
like when one of these mega pros rolls
around it just makes me want something a
little bit extra not that it has to be
anything in addition to eyeshadows but
just something within the eyeshadows
that makes them pop a little bit more
I was really excited about the mega Pro
2 last year the one in the navy blue
packaging i thought they had just some
really interesting and unexpected pops
of shadow happening in there and i
wouldn't even go as far as to call it
like a colorful palette it had a lot of
neutrals but it just went in certain
directions that made me think wow that
will cause me to do something a little
bit different with my eyeshadow and i
got a lot of use out of that palette
here I'm seeing shades that I have seen
over and over again in this neutral
palette world that we live in for $59
this is what you're getting and the most
condensed way I can speak about this
palette is that if you get it I do not
think you will be disappointed by the
quality of the shadows that are in here
but if you do already own a lot of
neutral palettes I don't know that
you're going to be that excited about
this shade selection just saying these
are my personal opinions I'm just
calling it like I see it maybe you are
just entering the world of eyeshadow
brand new to palettes and you think this
would be a good place to start from that
perspective maybe so everything in here
is really nice quality and if you
especially like your warmer neutrals I
think you've got a lot to play with here
let's jump in and look at some of the
swatches I'm going to go row by row so
your top row of mattes you do have a
light shade and pink cream that maybe
you could highlight with some really
easy kind of soft crease transition type
colors a nice little trio of Mothe -
eggplant shades and also a dark navy
your second row I'm just as consistent
with the quality in my opinion none but
this is the row I think of it's like
basic neutral City here because you've
got your light beiges moving into medium
Browns a dark brown ultimately a
jet-black that is really really black
and really good now your next two rows
are shimmery so you've got snow which is
going to be that really bright shiny
white highlight type shade cider is one
of a couple highly metallic shades in
this palette Bellini with a little more
peach really do like brown sugar and
Sequoia you know your dark shimmery
Browns a lot of warmth in those shades
too and then glacier and deep fog at the
end of that row offer something a little
more cool and just like classic smokey
eye type look bottom row a lot of warmth
happening here with your first several
shades and then rose quartz
that's that rosy shade that is highly
highly metallic little disappointed that
olive on my eyes just doesn't show up
very olive greenish at all I'm wearing
it all over the lids today on the
granite is like the one shade like
raising its hand out of the sea of
neutrals saying hey look at me down here
and then licorice is like your dark
blackened plum with some shimmer the way
I feel about this palette kind of
reminds me of the feelings I was having
when the lorac Pro on 3 palette came out
you know I look at it and I think pretty
shades yes I can get on board with
what's happening here but is it nearly
as exciting and like iconic and
memorable as the pro one you know it all
comes back to this but here like each
shade has that unique personality each
one stands out and has a real purpose
there is so much variety to be had in
this palette I think this is such an
essential thing if you take your pro one
and you pair with it
your lorac unzipped palette I feel like
you've got just endless possibilities
you just unzip palette I don't know how
many of you have tried this but this is
part of their regular line but this
feeds all of my needs for wine and rose
gold and bronze like it's a gorgeous
palette and you know a lot of those same
things are happening in here but this
goes I think maybe even further with a
rose gold vibe but these are just my
personal opinions on this thing you know
if you're coming here just to confirm
that this is good quality and you know
the swatches worked out well and whatnot
yes it's good everything in here was
really consistent it's been nice to work
with and easy to work with on the eyes
just what I'd expect from lorac palettes
but whether or not this shade selection
really excites you that's your own
decision you know that's I'm going to
need to be made person-to-person because
I like what I see here but I'm not
jumping up and down over it there's this
little piece of me that says doesn't
they have put in a few things that were
really different but I am sure lorac has
decided that neutral palettes are what
sell big there's an olive green down
here I've got that olive green all over
my lid and I think it looks really muddy
and doesn't look like olive green at all
I mean the shade itself is a nice
texture it is what it is but just the
color they chose to put in there I just
feel like well
I do really enjoy what's happening up
here the mobs the eggplant shades but
that's all happening in my unzipped
palette and I really like that anyway
the thing I really have to keep asking
myself throughout the whole holiday
season of palettes is and I excited
about this thing just because it's new
or am I truly excited about it because
of what it's going to do for me and how
much I'm going to use it in the future
for this I'm excited about it because
it's new and I can't honestly say I'm
that excited about the shades in it now
as far as demos go with this I didn't
end up shooting a demo on this
particular look that I'm wearing today
but I will insert another little
tutorial just so you can watch some of
these shadows in action so for this look
I want to show you I first prime my lids
I use my Smashbox primer which I'm kind
of testing against my Milani a little
bit using a large brush I just went all
over my entire lid and under the brows
faced with the shade called crepe I
think everything will go on a bit more
smoothly with this all over I used my
e25 brush to apply maple which is a
really warm brown into my crease we're
going to cool this look down a bit with
glacier this is this really pretty
silvery shade i padded that on basically
the inner path of my lid and then I
overlapped with a little bit of deep fog
that's the state I woke up in this
morning getting out of bed and I patted
that on the outer part and up into the
crease just a little bit too then I used
a black liquid liner across the upper
lash line winged out the outer edge in
my lower inner rim I use this aqua XL
eye pencil for makeup forever in the
shade m22 it's a nice blue and I applied
that to the inner rim and my lower lash
line also and went over it with a smudge
brush then I pulled in dark maybe to do
some overlapping this is not because
dark Navy isn't pigmented enough but I'm
trying to bring out more blue in it
that's sometimes my strategy when I do
layering on the lower lash line like
this and added a little bit of deep fog
as I got toward my inner most corner I
also used a little bit of dark navy with
my small shadow brush just to deepen up
the outer outer part of my crease and
then I thought a nice finishing touch
would be to go back in with maple and
sort of reinforce that warmth on the
border of this look as my sort of
transition shade
and then I applied mascara top and
bottom some false lashes these the Coco
lashes in the shade called Misha and
that is your finished look kind of a
smoky eye with just a hint of blue so
again thank you guys so much for
watching
you'd be the judge on this palette you
know what you like you know what you'll
use I'm just trying to give you some
information to go on also my personal
take on and after doing a handful of
looks with this palette I mean I just
feel like the kinds of things I'm
getting are the things that I could get
with a lot of different eye shadow
palettes out there thanks for taking
time to watch many more holiday reviews
still to come and I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
