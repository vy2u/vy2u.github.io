we're gonna be discussing the lorac mega
pro 4 it seems like around the holidays
every year before the holidays in
anticipation of the holidays they put
out a big old palette like this a 32
color palette half matte half shimmer
this one's gonna run you $59 at Ulta and
every year I look really critically at
these palettes they put out and I think
is it worth that price I think back to
the first one I remember contained a lot
of like a burgundy plummy kind of colors
also a lot of neutrals as well while I
love the color scheme I remembered
thinking I'm not sure that this
constitutes a palette this large because
it stayed so kind of in one zone then
the second one came out and I thought it
was fantastic it inspired a lot of
creativity a lot of different kinds of
shades were in that palette it was just
a great mix a lot of unique shades as
well that I hadn't really seen before so
I love that one then the three came out
just a big neutral palette honestly look
kind of common in the scope of so many
neutral palettes that have been and
continue to be coming out now keep in
mind I love the quality of these
palettes that I'm mentioning but it's
more of a shade selection thing and you
know you're thinking about paying nearly
60 bucks for one palette you want it to
be like everything you want it to exceed
your expectations and now the four comes
out and I am brought right back to that
place where I was at with the two where
I am loving it so much it's a perfect
mix of shades that take me a little bit
to the edge of my comfort zone but also
a bunch of shades that I feel super
comfortable wearing as well and there
was a time in my makeup using days I'm
thinking back to really the early days
of my channel where it was like if I
just had a big palette with a ton of
shades in it like give me 88 colors and
I'm gonna be happy you know just a lot
of quantity in a palette seem to excite
me and now I'm more in a place where I
like a small palette and just give me
you know important colors give me colors
that all make their own unique impact
not a bunch of BS repeated shades I mean
let's face it there are a lot of
palettes filled with BS colors you know
they're so close to this other shade by
the time you get them blended out on the
eyes they would look exactly the same so
why are you here I don't want to palette
full of why are you here colors this
everything has its place if I were to
imagine how the meeting went down over
this palette among lorac staff I would
say they probably sat down and said
let's try to throw in some shades
nobody's seen before that nobody's doing
in palettes and then if we have some
really good basics in there let's just
make them next-level good let's make
them as good as they can possibly be
okay team break and then this is what
they came up with and it's amazing and I
think it's totally worth the money and
then some like I'm not exaggerating here
I'm not getting like swept up by hype or
whatever I don't even know if this
pallets been hyped up I haven't honestly
heard a lot of talk about it yet I've
got a lot of other holiday stuff sitting
around here that I've kind of looked at
and swatched through and let me tell you
all that stuff has a really tough act to
follow because this is just really
impressive it's a palette of really cool
eye shadows doing lots of unique and
interesting things this is a palette for
all seasons like I absolutely see this
working at any time of the year for any
type of look you know light kind of
barely there really natural looks deep
sultry ultra smoky types of looks warm
cool it's a great mix of pure shades
shades that just look at you and say I
am blue you know I am rust I am green
but then some really interesting kind of
murky shades where you know you look at
it and they call it misty mauve and I'm
thinking I don't see the mauve in it but
then I use it or swatch it I'm like yeah
I do see them off and they're you know
like the shapes that kind of mess with
you a little bit I love that something
unexpected something that like I said
kind of pushes me out of my comfort zone
a little bit gives me ideas for unique
shade combinations and I'd like to think
that I'm the kind of person that could
just sit with a random you know a bunch
of makeup on my lap and just pull from
here pull from there just really get
this super creative unusual look but
honestly I am very steered by the
palette that I'm using and so when a
palette does give me some different
things to work with then it gives me the
inspiration it gives me the thought to
combine that shade in that shade to set
my look up in a little different way so
this is going there for me it's giving
you those same feelings of excitement
that the two did but just in a different
way a different selection of shades
happening here and I'm so excited about
it before I dig into the shades and the
swatches just the construction of the
palette itself it feels exactly like
even one of the smaller lorac palettes
you know it's thin its
over packaged it's really gonna be I
think easy to travel with and take with
you there is a huge mirror in here so
you could like prop this up on a dresser
so your entire face in it as you do your
makeup and then I love how it completely
folds back behind so if you're like me
and you're sitting at a makeup desk you
just want to hold this in your lap it's
so so easy you know you're not dealing
with a bunch of bulk a bunch of
weirdness on the packaging it's just
about the makeup so I'm gonna go through
all these shades will talk swatches and
then I will show you the eye look that
I've got on today which is definitely
giving me like Cinderella in the blue
dress vibes on my lower lash line I'm
loving this top row of mattes up here
we're looking at a really bright white
matte with cotton flamingos super fun
shade to work into your crease actually
I love that pink cool taupe butterscotch
you know lighter shades that could work
as either highlights depending on your
skin tone or even a priest color there
with butterscotch cedar a nice rich
basic brown mocha there's a shade that
tons of people are gonna love to set up
a look within their crease denim so
accurately named like this reminds me of
just an old school perfect looking denim
pair of jeans that I would have had is
like an eight year old I've used that
shade in my crease and it's kind of fun
and then shadow is your dark matte
charcoal quality-wise these are what
you're going to expect from lorac the
only shade that's really surprised me
thus far is flamingo its pigmented but
it didn't kick up a bunch of fallout the
rest of these shapes like mocha kicks up
a decent amount when you put your brush
in you're gonna see some powder going
around
I've talked fallout before some people
that really irritates them for me it's a
matter of just building up your look
little by little tap off the excess I'm
no stranger to lyrics palettes so I've
seen shadows show up this way in their
you know original palettes these larger
palettes that they do it's no surprise
to me they're really good quality though
they're very pigmented they go on very
evenly so that top row was your warm up
now moving into the next row pink peony
has a really amazing brightness almost
as bright if not brighter than cotton
just for the fact that it's got that a
little bit of pink in it which is
interesting
oat would make a nice basic crease color
it's different from butterscotch and
mocha which I've already mentioned
saij get out of town I do not have a
light green color like this that is just
barely there green like mix of green and
cream it's sugar cookie another kind of
weird shade that looks just like basic
taupe but it's got a little smidge of
some lavender in there mahogany and
Blackberry these are shades where you
gonna glance at the palette and be like
Oh a couple of dark Browns no no no sir
mahogany is a dark dark mauve is how I
describe that and blackberry is a really
rich plum II Brown spice everybody wants
spice so spices in there yay I love it
dark chocolate just that really nice
dark cool Brown everybody needs now
these shimmery rows over the top over
the top like let's just jump in foam is
coming at you from another planet here
this is like the single best shimmery
highlight type shade ever it is so
opaque it's so full-on you see what I
mean when I said colors that maybe we've
seen before that they've put in this
palette they're just taking them next
level honey gorgeous gold pearl slate
really pretty taupe shade there's a hint
of gold in that as well
I love the brilliance of Moss you'll see
that turning up in today's look steel
wool is equally out of control just like
foam I mean it's like what is going on
here this is so metallic this is so
gorgeous copper pearl is like that
dirtier richer deeper version of honey
peacock is screaming it is so oh my gosh
it's so gorgeous the purity of that blue
and the shine that it has is just so so
stunning and then Lagoon it also works
that into today's look I mean that a
swatch cannot do this shape justice dark
teal with shimmer it's just killing it
do you see what I'm saying about the
uniqueness so far though like the honey
shade the copper pearl spice one of
these colors you throw those together
and you have like the classic fall
makeup look that everybody's doing but
then you've got Moss peacock steel wool
crazy good shades now let's go down to
the last row I'm like crying over these
colors unicorn Lotus and fairytale just
behold these are so good unicorns such a
fun shade it's like lilac with a little
bluish twist Lotus and fairytale okay
you swatched
you're gonna notice a little bit of a
drier consistency a little more flake to
these but I tell you before I even touch
these shades with my fingers I started
just using them and looks on the eyes
and they apply great they build up
wonderfully fairy-tale is what's giving
me like the Cinderella lower lashline
today and I just love that shade misty
muff you're gonna glance at this and say
well that just looks like kind of brown
but it is so good when this shade sheers
out it's doing something interesting
there is most definitely a Mavi Brown
thing going on there Silver Fox plum
these are shades that you can work into
like every day I looks but they're just
different like plum has that slightest
bit of pearly Sheen like it's barely
belonging in these shimmery rows and I
love how not every shimmer is exactly
the same here some are super metallic
some just have this little bit of pearl
some like Fairy Tail are just like
knocking the door down vamp is gonna be
your dark smoky plum and then raven
gorgeous rich sparkly kind of charcoal
blast so words of advice when using this
palette I would say use an eye primer I
do with absolutely everything I mean
it's just kind of an essential step for
me and especially when you're dealing
with colors like this they're very
pigmented and a little bit goes a long
way tap off the excess and then you know
what if you see some excess tapped back
into that shadow just pick that up and
use that on the other eye you know you
can get use out of it all I would say
just build up little by little and you
will have control over these eyeshadows
but there are so many shades in here
like I said that can do the basic easy
everyday just kind of not really wanting
to think about it too much just give me
an eye look kind of days and then when
you want to experiment you have all of
the means to do that as well and I love
the thought of combining warm and cool
I've done that with some looks I mean
one that I love particularly I worked in
a little spice and I think it was mocha
in my crease and then I had a
combination of unicorn and Lotus on my
lid and it was just glowing I mean it
was so beautiful I want to give you a
little talk through of the look that I
did today so as I mentioned primed the
lids with Milani eyeshadow primer and
then the first thing I put in there was
flamingos I kind of like using this as a
crease color sometimes this soft pinky
shade then I used a little bit of mocha
in my crease as well kind of the outer
part so you can get a feel
for that I think this is a color a lot
of people are gonna want to reach for
often just really add some richness to
the crease without even going to dark
just yet I also use cool taupe as my
highlight right up under my brow and
then I'm going to be working from the
inner part of my lid outward so I
started with foam and this shade just
pops just a tiny bit of this shade gives
you this opaque brightness and then I
padded maus all over most of the lid
leaving a little bit of a gap on the
outer part of my lid and that just packs
on so easily so beautifully and then
today was my first time using Lagoon and
that shade is teal richness it's so
beautiful to see it kind of overlapping
with moss a little bit work that up into
the crease ever so slightly and
periodically throughout the look you
know I'm taking a blending brush and I'm
just kind of making sure the edges are
all sort of smoothed out and after
you've done some blending you may want
to you know go back and add a little
more intensity I like to take a little
more Moss just to make sure that that
shade didn't get blended away at all and
then on the lower lash line what I did I
took this teal liner from the L'Oreal so
kissimmee line and I use that in my
lower inner rim smudged it a little bit
on the lower lash line and then I used
Lagoon smudged over that as well so
we've got now rich dark teal coming on
top of it and then I took Fairy Tail
which is this gorgeous like light kind
of bluish silvery shade and I took that
all the way inward on my lower lash line
and by the time you've got then some
liquid liner on the upper lashes may pop
on some false lashes
you've got your lower mascara on I love
the way that shimmery lower lash line
peeks through there it's just gorgeous
so just an example of a fun look a
pretty look you know a really glamorous
look I think that was kind of creative a
unique fusion of shades altogether that
I wouldn't have really thought to put
together without this palette I'm not
sure what else is left to say but thank
you for your patience for letting me try
this out doing multiple looks with this
and really getting a feel for it I never
like to just you know use a palette once
and then hop on and here's my review
especially a big palette like this it
takes some experimentation even though I
knew after my first look that I was
falling in love with this I kept using
it kept going for some different color
combos and learning about the unexpected
nature of some of these
it's really something I think you need
to get home get in your lap and just
start using on your eyes to fully
appreciate what's going on here
but I enjoy it so so much I would highly
recommend it I think it's gonna be one
of the top picks for sure of the holiday
season makeup wise for me so yeah if
you've tried it let me know your
thoughts in the comment section and I
will see you again soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
