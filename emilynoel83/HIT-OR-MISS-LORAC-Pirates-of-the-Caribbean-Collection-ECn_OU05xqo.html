tuning in I am excited to share with you
in this video the lorac Pirates of the
Caribbean whole collection so I have the
eyeshadow palette I have a couple of lip
products and I also have a cheek palette
and I've been playing with this stuff
for what seems like a really long time I
was sent this collection from lorac
which was kind of surprising because I
rarely get things from them so thank you
to the PR team there who sent me this
sample I do appreciate getting to test
it all out and in this video I will be
showing you swatches of everything
you'll see an application of both of the
lip products that I have on also the
cheek palette and the eye palette and
I'll definitely share some of the other
looks that I've taken pictures of and
done as I've been testing that palette
out because it is a rather large eye
palette I'll start off talking about
that it's an 18 color eye palette so
there are definitely a lot of different
directions you can go with this thing
and the palette itself is rather big you
know we're used to seeing a lot of just
very streamlined flat no-frills palettes
from lorac and this one is probably I
don't know three to four times as thick
as most of what they put out and there's
an odd little drawer on this side with
nothing in it I don't know what the deal
is that if you bought this was there
actually something in there let me know
but you've got a great big mirror on the
inside which I always appreciate and
you're getting a little eyeliner let me
talk about this front of the line Pro
liner in black for a second this is
fantastic
then slacks so well in the waterline it
reminds me a lot intensity wise of the
Marc Jacobs a liner that looks actually
packaging wise so much like this in the
shade called blacker it glides on so
smoothly it lasts really well but I want
to remove this at the end of the day
especially if it's on my skin I have to
go in with a special like actual eye
makeup remover because my normal method
of removing makeup just won't get it off
it's so long wearing really creamy so
that's a fantastic little extra I guess
you'd say to have in this palette in
terms of the colors in here like I said
18 shades it's a mix of matte and
shimmer I do think they've given you
some key Matco
that are important to have like this
shade right down here is matt bones and
pirates chest you know those are going
to be valuable matt like transition our
soft creased colors tell no tales i
struggle to do a look without that shade
i just love it so much kind of a
blackberry color very unique has a
little bit of mauve in it and down here
the shades menace and silent mary are
matt as well you look really closely at
curse you can see a little bit of gold
sparkle in that shade it really does not
translate to the eyes like i can't see
it hardly at all
so that basically turns out to be a
matte black but the rest are either kind
of a pearly finished metallic finish
there's no sparkle floating around in
any of the other colors and even in
cursed it's not enough sparkle to be
something that creates a lot of fallout
or anything it's just you know little
particles but i really love about this
palette is the quality of the shade
seems to be right on par with what
you're used to seeing in their lorac pro
palette like let's say the pro one you
know the master really buttery and
smooth everything super easily blendable
the metallic shades really are soft and
have a nice shine really good just
creaminess to these powder shadows so i
appreciate that a lot I recently had
purchased the I love brunch palette and
I know they were going for a little
softer color scheme there so maybe they
intended for some of the shades to be
more sheer as a result of that but I
just didn't think the feel the texture
of the shadows with everything that I
loved and expected from like their older
palettes and this seems right on par
with what I would expect so I love that
I think what it's going to come down to
what this palette is do you like the
color scheme and there's very little in
terms of warmth in this palette if you
look right here in this row these are
your warm shades and you can use those
and get a totally warm look I did that
in one of the look that I was playing
around with but you cover those up that
red and that kind of more mesh medium
brown and this buttery shade up here
cover those up and you've got a ton of
just cool smoky type tones you know I
think sea haze is a really unique color
here this blue up here called starry
night can definitely hold its own black
pearl is an interesting shade it's
almost like a borderline duochrome
you see some blue in it as it shears out
it almost looks warmer there are a few
interesting things here there but for
the most part it's a palette that's
going to create a lot of cooler smokey
looks for you there has been such a warm
trend going on lately I know some of you
prefer the cooler shades and so this
might be music to your ears that it's
not just a ton of oranges and all that
kind of stuff thrown in here over the
last say week week and a half I've
really made an effort to get different
looks out of this I've tried to work in
as many shades as possible I believe
I've worn every shade in the palette at
this point and you can totally achieve
variety with this I am one of those
people though who does really like the
warm tones and as I said you're just
getting a sprinkling of those shades
also for whatever reason tell no tales
like might be one of my favorite shades
in the palette I think it's kind of
unique I like that it's matte I like
that it's a little bit purple leaf like
a deep mauve and I found myself using
that in so many looks that I've done
with this palette but having said that
well I still love this palette toile
anyways I like the way all the shadows
feel I like the way they blend and go on
the eyes there's not that many colors
that I'm really falling in love with you
know that I just feel like oh that just
knocked me over because it's so
beautiful I mean there were a lot of
colors of that type that I was running
into in the Too Faced natural Love
palette that's a little bit softer more
feminine just a totally different vibe
in that palette this one as I said
deeper rooted in really smoky cool type
tone so if you like that type of look
you might enjoy this palette it's a
strong like for me but maybe not a love
palette you know what I'm saying to be
completely real with you if I was going
to put my money into an eyeshadow
palette these days it's the busy arts
eerie palettes you know the smaller size
palettes that come out with new shades
I've just gotten a couple of those in
the night ordered and I'm like yes these
are so smooth these are so impeccable
quality wise but really just absolutely
gorgeous shades the pink lovers the
purple lovers there's really nothing in
this one for you and I'm certainly not
criticizing lorac for that because it's
the pirates of the caribbean dead men
tell no tales theme you know it's going
to be like this sort of I don't know a
slightly more matte
stealing deeper smokier color palette I
can see where they're coming from with
that so those are my thoughts on the eye
palette I think it's going to come down
a lot to personal preference there but I
think you will like the quality if you
like the other lorac palette let's talk
about this cheek palette real quick this
I think is a little gold mine right here
I love this thing
I love the size they went back to
standard slim lorac fabulousness there
there is a really good mirror in here
and then six very generously sized cheek
product here's your highlights here's
the blush type shades this color called
lost soul is interesting this would be
the shade people will probably have the
most questions on it's a very beige
extremely dusty peach type color and I
find it to be very close to my skin tone
what I like to do with that shade it is
very pigmented everything in here
supremely pigmented very soft and nice
to work with but I find myself sometimes
liking to smooth out heavier blush looks
with a color like that it works really
nicely and then go on top of that with
your highlight and the highlight pops
even more sometimes intense blush can
take away from a glowy highlight so
that's sort of a balancing type of
smooth it out type color to me Caribbean
right here this is the blush shape for
everyone that I see working for
absolutely everybody it can look soft
and rosy it can be built up to look
borderline plummy on the cheeks I think
it's so pretty and bold spirit right
here shimmery blush topper type of color
I mean it's totally unrealistic what
I've just done here on my finger like
I'm showing you the beauty in the shine
of the shade you know but sheer doubt
you're going to actually see a little
more rosiness in that shade when it's
not so intensely packed on and I am
wearing that when I cut to some demos of
both of these products you'll see that
going on fortune destined star reader
three tones of highlight one is a light
pearl one is a little bit peachy and
star reader is kind of like a buttery
light golden highlight they are all so
intense so rich but yet not packed with
filler not packed with flakiness glitter
Sparkle they just have this beautiful
Lesson Sheen to them if you don't like
highlights if you don't enjoy a lot of
glow on your skin this isn't going to be
the palette for you because all of this
is shimmer right here and then these two
are matte I just think there are a lot
of ways that you can play with the look
you know you can put this on and you can
sort of adjust the look on your cheeks
by using any amount or variation of
these different highlight and glowy
shades I just think it's gorgeous and
the textures on these powders are just
divine it's wonderful so this is
probably my favorite not probably this
is without a doubt my favorite piece
from this collection love the cheek
palette and then finally I just want to
address the little whip duos that
they've put out they sent to just two
random shades but I think there might be
four or five more so the deal here it's
lipstick on one end and then a lip gloss
on the other and there's a built-in
mirror I'm really kind of becoming
attached to the built-in mirror idea I
wish
lots of lip glosses would have that
because I really use that and I found
that very practical very handy I like
the lipstick formula with both of these
so what I'm holding right here is called
bar bossy it comes off on the lips I
think exactly how it looks in the
lipstick it's kind of this brownish warm
a little bit of rusty red thrown into it
but not a lot of red and I like the
formula of these I the last lorac
lipsticks that I tried were quite some
time ago and they were their alter-ego
lipsticks which I felt were way too dry
these feel creamier to me so I enjoy
that very very soft sweetness to the
scent it's a solid lipstick and then
with that one you've got this gloss that
looks almost a little bit coppery and I
like the contrast that this creates like
once you start dabbing this gloss on top
of the lipstick it creates a really
pretty shine and you can just go over
your entire lips with that you can just
spotlight the center of the lower lip if
you wanted to but it's nice it's a solid
lip product I don't think anybody who
got that would really be disappointed in
it shade that I've been wearing
throughout the video is called trident
and this one is giving you I think a
classic nude lipstick here really like
is very full coverage on the lips
there's no Sheerness to the lipsticks at
all if you were just to wear the
lipsticks in either of these
that I have you just have a matte look
they're just matte lipsticks and then
the gloss going over the top of this one
is just this pearly peach and I think
it's a beautiful look this these are
very wearable wear at any time type lip
colors personally I kind of prefer
trident I think it's great to find a
nice nude lipstick like that I like the
gloss over the top I like the mirror
this is a nice thing to be able to throw
in your purse and just take with you so
I really do enjoy that but like I said
before I think the top pick is the cheap
palette but I do want to cut to a demo
so you can see the cheek and eye palette
in action go first off with the eyes I
primed my lids and I use the color bones
which is a very neutral soft Brown I
used that in the crease and then I
padded Silvermist
over I would say 3/4 of my lid and then
I used black pearl again with a flat
brush to get on the outer part of my lid
and sort of overlap a little bit of
silver mist I was just curious as to
what that would do since black pearl is
sort of that shade that can look
different ways at different times I work
some of that into my crease as well and
as you share that shade out a little
more reddish warmth comes out of that
color I used a bit of math Li just as my
highlight up under the ground then I
decided I wanted to deepen up my outer
corners with the color curse this is the
one that has little flecks of gold
sparkle but you don't really see that
coming across on the eyes honestly I
feel like it's just a more for show
shade like as you glance at the palette
you're like oh that looks pretty but it
doesn't do that much on the eyes it's
just going to be matte black and for
being in that black it is fine
so I padded that on the outer corners
and then I took the eyeliner that comes
with this put that on my lower inner rim
smudged it between the lashes a bit and
then I took starry night which is the
metallic blue this shade can really hold
its own it doesn't need some sort of
base to make it stand out I took that
all across the lower lash line
I finished the eye look with some black
liquid liner and mascara top and bottom
I used a really big lash today but I'm
happy with the look you know I think
that's pretty I think the blue on the
bottom makes it a little bit different
but yeah just add this to the mix of the
different eye looks I've been
experimenting with with this palette
there's a lot of variety that you can
get it's just a matter if you like the
smokey looks do you like the cooler
tones mostly because that's
mostly what you're getting and then the
cheek look that I did today I did have a
little bit of bronzer on my skin just
lightly and then I used Caribbean as my
blush gives me this nice rosy flush to
the cheeks I talked it off with a little
bit of bold spirit which I do think on
certain skin tones could be a standalone
blush type shade but it just gave my
cheeks a little more glow and for the
really pronounced highlight I used
destined that's the middle highlight
shade in the palette gave such a pretty
look to the tops of my cheeks so yeah I
don't think it looks overdone it doesn't
look like fake glittery nough sitting
there is they're just beautiful
beautiful pearly highlights and then
like I said the lip color I am wearing
throughout the video is trident and
that's both the lipstick and the gloss
so thank you guys so much for taking the
