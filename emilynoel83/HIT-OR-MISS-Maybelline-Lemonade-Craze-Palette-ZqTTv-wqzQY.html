joining me today the topic in this video
is a new drugstore palette I know we
just came off of a video last week
talking about a bunch of different
drugstore eyeshadow palettes but there's
one more to throw into the conversation
and it's the maybelline lemonade craze
palette and considering the fact that
there's not a carnival situation that I
attend without getting a lemonade shake
up I felt I needed to try this
no really Jen loves reviews was over at
my house remember we did that anti haul
video here on my channel and this was
one of the things she anti hauled and I
was like well you know I might go ahead
and get it just because I'm kind of
intrigued and here's why guys I don't
think this is a color scheme we often
see in the drugstore the yellow orange a
strong red eyeshadow yes it's being
flanked by a bunch of neutrals but I
just kind of felt like this was
something I might be interested in I
like the idea of a lemonade theme you
know I think it's kind of whimsical and
fun and also just judging by my prior
knowledge I know that Maybelline does
have a decent eyeshadow formula in fact
in my favorite palettes under $20 video
I was referencing Maybelline's City Mini
palette the matte about town one so
they've made an all matte city mini and
I thought it was actually really great
nice smooth textures to work with that
apply very evenly it's good for a
natural matte look I just really enjoyed
that so to back it up a little bit this
palette is a 12 color eye palette it's
gonna sell for $10 and change at Target
or Walmart and a little over $13 if
you're gonna buy it at Ulta I would
overall call eight of the shadows in
here Matt coral punch is a little bit on
the fence but I do think it performs
pretty matte on the eyes and then citrus
strawberry lemon-aid main squeeze and
sugar coated as you might be able to
tell are the shimmery shades they're not
all identical shimmer finishes like main
squeeze and citrus have a little bit
more of a flakey quality to them like as
you swatch them and you look at what
does that shadow actually made of like
they're just little identifiable
shimmery bits and they can have a
tendency to get a little bit airborne a
little bit hard to control if you're
doing a look with them but then you have
strawberry lemon-aid and sugar-coated
which are a bit more
metallic and smooth just pay attention
to what's going on here this this is
just a leftover swatch see how those two
shades are like a really smooth almost
foiled quality and they hang together
better on the eyes and they just have a
better color payoff I don't want to
overlook the nice like natural mattes in
here like sherbet and Sunny's is really
smooth sweet tea down here old-fashioned
like there are four just very nice basic
matte shades that deliver you know they
apply really nicely
sweet tea I could see a lot of people
using is just that starting point like
getting a little depth in the crease and
then pairing that with any of the bright
shades on the lid old fashioned just in
itself I like that shade in terms of
being mixed with everything else in this
palette I don't love it I almost want
even more contrast even more depth like
a really almost black brown or a really
dark burgundy might have been pretty in
this palette because the other day when
I was using this and I was kind of like
trying to get something going in my
outer corner it just really wasn't
happening and I think a high level of
contrast is what can really make some of
these bright shades pop a lot for
today's look in case you were wondering
and you'll see a full tutorial with it
but I didn't even use either of these
Browns because I just wanted to see you
know what will the brights do but
looking at the swatches I mean I think
it's pretty obvious that the mattes are
nice and smooth there's good
pigmentation there there are a couple of
the shimmery shades like I mentioned
strawberry lemon-aid and sugar-coated
which is more of a copper those both I
think have nice intensity the weakest
links in this palette are probably
citrus and main squeeze and those are
the shimmers that just have a lot of
flakiness going on there's not this nice
like steady build ability with those
shades where you feel like okay I can
add a little more add a little more no
once you've basically like coated
wherever the primer is on your eye you
can't really go back and add much more
because then it just becomes flaky and
it can't cling to itself as far as the
statement colors I think there's clearly
three in here we've got lemonade craze
which is the yellow and first off I just
like to say I like to see colors like
this coming out in a drugstore like
mainstream palette I think that's cool I
support that decision in a spectrum of
yellows all things considered like
thinking about you know my busy art more
matte palette has a nice yellow in there
I would say this yellow falls somewhere
in the middle you actually can build it
up it's a nice tone it's pretty smooth
the staying power is really quite
disappointing by like midday without a
lot of activity and no touching my eyes
I feel like that shadow tends to fade a
lot
hunch is a shade that I incorporated
into my look today as a crease color and
I thought it performed rather well I
think you're gonna like that shade kind
of as a transition it's just a nice sort
of border look but probably the
strongest color in here is ice pop
that's a really bold shade it's a red
with a lot of pink infused in it it
looks pretty layering up over some of
lemonade craze or coral punch it makes a
pretty crease color today I actually
used it more under the eye but it's bold
it applies well and I'm really happy
with that but I want to show you next is
a little talk through tutorial on the
look that I'm wearing now so you can get
a few more details on how the products
apply and then we'll wrap things up with
some final thoughts okay guys so I've
already primed my lids I used my Urban
Decay anti-aging shadow primer and I'm
going to start off with a little bit of
coral punch I think in the crease so I'm
gonna grab that with my Sigma e25 let me
reposition my mirror right quick okay
this shadow was kind of like hard to
figure out just watching it I've worn it
sheer but haven't given it a major role
you know in an eye look with this
palette yet so I just really wanted to
see how that would go on it seems like
in this sort of soft crease type
capacity it's doing okay but I do feel
like I'm picking up quite a bit of
product I feel the need to build it
quite a bit just so you know but it is a
nice tone and I think it makes sense to
have a color like this in this palette
you know with the red and the yellow and
I'm pleased it makes a decent you know
soft crease color or a transition color
is how I've used it before next let's
play with one of these shimmers I'm
gonna use main squeeze here this is a
really light like golden yellow shimmer
and there's a lot of like sparkle it
feels kind of a little bit loose and
dusty you know the shimmer is kind of
fine any sparkle in it is
pretty fine but yet it's not a shade
that does a great job of hanging
together I'm kind of going around the
inner corner like that you can keep
building if you want to but I think it
kind of becomes a lost cause once you're
no longer actually clinging that product
to your eye primer and you're more so
just trying to build it on itself then
it just kind of starts going everywhere
like I'm in a little tornado of shimmer
right now I don't know if you can tell
let's actually take a little bit of
strawberry lemonade and see if we can
see I can already tell that that shade
is just a different kind of texture it's
more metallic and it's less loaded down
with little shimmery flecks I feel like
you need to see lemonade craze going on
so I'm in pickup some of that with my
flat brush and we're gonna pat pat pat
this is a matte yellow that's one fairly
generous application like the brush was
pretty loaded up right there with that
shade now I'm going to add a little more
I feel I've had to build this to get
kind of satisfied with the yellow level
it's not terrible it's not maybe gonna
blow your mind but you know it will
definitely give you a yellow look on
your eyes I think what may frustrate you
is the staying power of it that shade
really faded on me to where I could
hardly tell the other day that I had put
a yellow on you know it just looked very
very soft I think I'm actually going to
try to fill the lid with that and do
something with the reddish shade sort of
just on the very outer most corner and
kind of along the lower lash line just
to give it a little different look than
what I've done before
take ice Popp this shade I really do
like I think it's able to achieve a nice
intensity pretty quickly
I've liked it in the crease I thought it
does really beautiful things as it
sheers out because it is a pretty you
know intense sort of watermelon II color
you know it's like a bright pinky red if
you're waking up in the morning and
you're feeling ultra tired and you think
your eyes look really tired I wouldn't
necessarily recommend putting it right
along the lower lash line but I'm just
trying to do something funky with them
okay because I've used this on the upper
lid before and I I want to give this a
different vibe
and then what might be fun is just
taking a little bit of ice Popp and kind
of carrying it like literally connecting
to your lower little liner look we've
done down there and coming up from that
and only letting it be right here in the
outer corner
and as you might expect is a little bit
of that red overlaps with some yellow it
does start to look orange art 101 I
can't decide if it's raining or a bunch
of birds or just landing on top of the
house oh no something's going down here
a little screeching and squawking so now
I'm going to add some liner some mascara
and we'll see the finished look so the
finished look here you go I went ahead
and put on some black liquid liner
that's the makeup revolution Renaissance
flick pen I'm wearing some Koko lashes
in Misha nice and full and fluttery but
they give you that sort of peekaboo
effect when you look down I've also got
my wet and wild ultimate brow highlight
in the lower inner rim which I would
highly recommend if you're using a lot
of red around the eye because it kind of
wakes up the eye brings it all back to
life once I went through those steps I
did kind of go back over and
re-intensify the yellow a little bit I
also added in a bit more of main squeeze
really trying to get that here around my
inner corner I don't have a lot of
confidence and lasting really well
throughout the day but for the moment I
was able to layer it up on my lips I'm
actually wearing this Urban Decay
beached collection lipstick the nice
warm red called 100 degrees I'm gonna
check and see if rich-girl red from
Revlon Super Lustrous line is still
available because it's almost exactly
like this this is said to be a sheer
formula and that's exactly what rich
girl red is I know I've talked about
that before is a great like summer red
lipstick so yeah they're really really
similar but final thoughts on this
palette I mean if you want a one to ten
rating I think I would give this a solid
6 I think there are some really good
things happening in here I like that
they're putting in some fun pops of
color Maybelline is doing some really
nice matte textures they're shimmery
shades can be a little hit and miss
basically any shimmer that they do that
doesn't have like identifiable bits of
sparkle turns out to be pretty good but
it's the sparkle that tends to like seem
to make their shadows more loose and a
little more flaky as I said before I
would have liked to have seen maybe even
a darker color in place of that dark
brown because we already got this good
solid medium brown let's have like
really really dark red something where
you could pop that on your eye and don t
can't do this with other stuff in your
collection but I'd like to judge a
palette as a palette but something that
you could add to your look and it would
absolutely make some of these bright
shades sing on the eyes you know but
another thing that's kind of frustrating
here and I don't usually have a lot of
staying power concerns with eyeshadow
but I have used this with some very good
eye primers and I just can't make that
yellow really stick around all day and
look really intense and strong and eye
shadow is really not something that I
like to have to touch up unless I'm
purposely taking a look from day to
night like I did in my last video just
to get through a standard day my shadow
isn't something that I want to have to
really cater to and tend to so bottom
line it's not one of my favorite
palettes but I also don't hate the
palette it's really just kind of in the
middle for me if you think you'd mainly
be buying this palette just for the
neutrals
I mean Maybelline it's got other things
you know the city mini palette like I
said the all matte one is really good
but if the warm colors in here are
really exciting to you one thing I might
throw out is this bad habit after dark
palette I know it doesn't have that
yellow but it's got great warm reds warm
Browns coral amazing dark colors to pair
with your look a gorgeous gold in the
center and completely top-notch quality
so I'm just gonna throw that out there
but I hope this review was helpful to
you guys I mean it's just important to
note I think that not all products fall
at the ends of every spectrum you know
not everything is junk not everything's
a winner some stuff is just gonna be
kind of in the middle and I think that's
where this palette is for me so thank
you again for your time and I will see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
