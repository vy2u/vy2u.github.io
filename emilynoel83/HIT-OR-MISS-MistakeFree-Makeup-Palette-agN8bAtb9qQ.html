about a new palette that I've been
playing around with it's just palette
central you know these days with all the
holiday releases and this one is from
the Fiona Styles line and that is one of
Alton's newer brands I guess one of the
latest brands to come to Ulta and it
says mistake free makeup so that in
itself drew me in iron face contouring
palette so it really does contain a lot
of things in one it's a rather large
palette here really pretty as far as the
outer look of s so many palettes that I
hold up just end up looking filthy after
a couple of uses just from fingerprints
and the makeup itself but this one's
pretty nice and it's got a lot of weight
to it as well as I was holding this
throughout the entire application I was
kind of using this mirror and I was like
doing my wrist is feeling it after a
little while but it maps out everything
that's in this palette on the back and
then as you can see here that large
mirror very travel friendly and then in
a nutshell what's in here is a quad of
eyeshadows you also get a bronzer two
highlights and two blushes and I'll
point out more specifically what those
are as we go I got this palette as an
early Christmas gift when I was back
home visiting family and I think it's
normally $39 and kind of a good deal on
it right now it's down to 29 at the time
I'm sitting here shooting this video
another advantage to that price is the
fact that what's in here is not just a
bunch of limited edition stuff I just
think you end up as the consumer with a
better value when the brand puts things
that are typically in their line in
these pallets because then you're like
oh you know I could spend X amount of
money for just one blush but here you
know you're getting two blushes that are
in this line two highlights that are
typically in the little highlight trio
that Fiona Styles sells a bronzer that
you can always buy and then this is an
actual quad of shadows that's part of
the line as well and considering the
quality of everything in the palette I
do think it's a good value on this line
I think is a little bit underrated I
mean I don't feel like I'm hearing tons
about it here on YouTube and I do have a
few other things that I've kind of used
and like from this line that I'll
mention before the video is over but
certainly some nicely pigmented products
I think can definitely hang with you
know other high-end brands that are out
there
one thing that initially gets me about
this palette is all of the I don't want
say wasted space that's kind of what it
is you know it's like there's this big
gap there and it's a rather large
palette and it's like maybe they could
have scrunched in this palette somewhat
and made it a little less big or if they
had all this extra space you know give
us a few extra eyeshadows or another
blush or whatever just a thought because
it really seems like there's a lot of
bare space there that just caught my eye
from the get-go but I'll just kind of
talk about each thing and show you some
demos as I applied them and this bronzer
this is actually called the bronzing Sun
veil and this is the shade called
Western and it appears that generally
there are two bronzers available in this
line and this would be the richer the
two judging by what I could see on the
website and it is a matte bronzer and I
just applied it kind of around my
hairline I also took it down the neck
and decollete area that's just kind of
instinct for me just keeps everything
kind of looking the same color and then
I used a smaller brush a little bit more
of a contour brush to apply this in the
hollows of the cheeks and I thought it
looked fine it's a little warmer than
you know some things I've used recently
I'm thinking about that TARDIS contour
palette where I really like the tone of
the contour stuff in there because it
just seems so so natural it really
looked like a natural shadow not saying
this can't but it's got a little more
warmth to it than that I do like the
pigmentation of this bronzer though I
think that fair - really light skin
tones would want to use a pretty light
hand with it I mean I felt like I was
using a fairly light hand because I
think you can go a bit too far with that
product because it just does pick up
very easily onto your brush
speaking of pigmented there are two
blushes in here that as I said are from
the regular line and they are the soft
cheek veil in Lex that's the kind of
peachy orange color and then there's one
called Maiden Lane and this is described
as a warm neutral pink tone but
certainly more on the cool side compared
to that peach and I went for the peach
today it was my first time using that

and Wow um this is a really really
pigmented I only dabbed into it once and
I had more than enough like you kind of
want to dab tap and then maybe like tap
it off on your hand a little bit if you
really want to build up slowly because I
feel like I almost had a little bit more
than I needed on my cheeks as I applied
that both blushes are matte the pink is
very pigmented as well but for whatever
reason I feel like that peachy orange
shade just really popped on me today you
know I'd rather see things kind of
verging on the very pigmented side as
opposed to not showing up enough as far
as my blushes go and I also like that
they're matte because you're just
getting the pure color and then you can
control how much glow you have on top of
that with the highlights so that takes
us into the highlights you're getting
two one appears to have a little bit
more pink in it while one is slightly
more golden but still both are very
light I think both would be very able to
work on any skin tone no matter how
light you are and it says they're
Universal shades from our iconic light
illusion prism palette so that's a trio
of highlights that's being sold from
this brand so considering that that
you're getting two out of the three in
here I think that product normally sells
for close to $30 so you're getting two
thirds of that palette in here which is
pretty cool but these are super subtle
highlights I was kind of surprised at
just how soft they are if you've got
your eye on this palette because you
think I want the glow you know I want a
really really glowy look I think you can
tell by what's on my cheeks today it's a
very kind of soft focus type glow it
reminds me of just a step up from some
of the hourglass ambient lighting
powders that I have which aren't really
designed to be a pinpointed highlight
you know but sometimes they give you
certain ones give you just this very
soft glow this gives me like a little
bit more glow than those today in my
application I used the lighter of the
two first and I just use my up-and-up
highlight brush because I do like how
that kind of pinpoints the product and
so I applied that on top of the cheeks
and then I kind of thought well maybe I
can build up this color just a little
bit more and I
added I layered a little bit more of the
golden highlight and I did notice my
skin getting a bit more glow once I did
that but this is not like you know Becca
highlighters in here they're not the
kind of thing worried is going to be
like boom reflection on the cheeks it's
just a very soft glow honestly you could
probably just tap into one of these and
apply it very lightly all over the skin
and it wouldn't be too much so if you
like your subtle highlights I think
you're in business with this palette and
then let's talk about the eyeshadows
here you're getting four and this is the
same shadow that's in the artist
eyeshadow quad in the shade canyon says
a range of flawless metallic bronze
tones and I will say nothing in here and
really feels like a true highlight to me
just FYI it's fine because you've got
literally two highlights right over here
but in terms of something really light
that's going to sort of pop out on your
lid I feel like the lightest color in
this quad it's kind of golden but it's
sort of a deep gold so keep that in mind
on darker skin tones that may pop a bit
more on skin tones like mine as you'll
see in the application you know it's
just got a little more depth to it than
you might expect for being the lightest
shade in a quad and you're getting one
matte color among the eyeshadows and
that's a really nice warm Brown although
don't forget that this bronzer could
make a fine eye shadow as well if you
want just a slightly different brownish
tone you really love this coppery color
kind of the third in line here I think
that's just beautiful has a really
pretty shine and then you have this
metallic bronzy brown at the bottom so
three of the four shades do have shimmer
it's quite a bit of shimmer so you know
that's something to keep in mind if you
generally try to steer clear of shimmery
eyeshadows only one of those four is
truly mad that being said I worked all
four of those shades into my look today
and I was pretty pleased with the
finished result and I would have used
this a few different ways as I was
traveling also used it in a more
simplified way like just with a couple
of the colors and I thought oh that's a
really cool look I have always liked the
warm bronzy colors with my eye color I
feel like those tones look really pretty
on brown eyes they also have a tendency
of making blue eyes look super intense
so it is nice to have those tones in
here they're the kinds of colors that I
personally see myself getting a lot of
use out of if I were to just travel with
this palette I could get some good looks
with that and like I said go to here for
your lighter shades but just to walk you
through real quickly on a tutorial on
this I first applied the matte brown
eyeshadow in my crease with my Sigma e25
brush it's really nicely pigmented it
applies so smoothly I was very happy
with that color and then I padded that
lightest golden e shade right there on
the lid and as you can see you know it's
got some brightness to it but at the
same time it's not SuperDuper light and
then as I work my way outward on my lid
I just deepen things up as I went so I
took the coppery color and I dab that
basically around the center of my lid
area and once I got that sort of blended
out I went to the darkest shade and I
used that right on my outer corner with
a slightly smaller brush Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush and shadow wise I end
up with this pretty kind of bronzy brown
look on my eyes and then I use the
golden e highlight and to actually
highlight under the brow and also go
around my inner corner I used a brown
pencil this is a Smashbox always sharp
cold liner in Sumatra I use that both on
my lower inner rim my waterline area and
my upper lash line as well and then I
kind of smudged out some of that liner
on my lower lash line applied a little
bit of the deepest bronze right on the
outermost part of the eye and then went
inward with the matte Brown with a
softer pencil brush just to really get
this bronze e smoky eye working on all
parts of the eye next up I just curled
the lashes applied some mascara I popped
on some demi whispies false lashes
because I thought that would really fit
the shape of the shadow and end result
like I said a very workable smokey eye
that doesn't get too dark so is it
really mistake free makeup um I don't
know that I totally believe that that's
the case in here because like let's look
at the blush for example you could
totally go overboard with either of
those blush shades and I'm not saying
that's a bad thing because I like my
pigmented blushes but just you got to
watch out for that and the eye shadows I
mean
they're great eyeshadows but they are
pigmented they do show on the eyes that
you have the potential of being screwed
up but is this a well-thought-out
palette I really do think it is I think
it's something that could work for
someone who really wasn't sure what
kinds of shades to pair together here
you've got a couple of really gorgeous
blushes some very soft highlights that
aren't going to make you look like a
disco ball and that bronzer well being a
little bit warmer than some other things
I described it's still not like oranjee
by any means and the nice thing about
these eyeshadows is that they are all
somewhat close in terms of their color
tone your darkest shade isn't like knock
it out of the park dark you know they're
all kind of close and I think that does
make it a little bit easier when you're
blending together shades that aren't
like ones over here and ones off in left
field over there you know what I'm
saying so I do think that allows for
some ease with this kit very happy with
the large sized mirror there because I
think that's just always handy when you
can see your whole face I'm not really
criticizing the overall size of the
palette too much because let's face it
they did fit a lot of different things
in there but I do think they probably
could have downsized it even a little
bit more just by scrunching some things
in couple of cons might be you know if
you were expecting a whole lot out of a
highlight something that's really going
to be metallic and just very very
vibrant on the cheeks that's not really
what these are also you know this might
not be everyone's ideal eyeshadow color
scheme maybe you like cooler tones maybe
you expected more matte in here you know
it is 3/4 shimmer just while we're on
the topic of Fiona Styles here because
this has been in Ulta stores for a
little while now so I have had a chance
to play with a few different products
and I have really been getting into sort
of all over again I mean this was new to
me a few months back and I'm sort of
diving back into it but this luminous
finish foundation concentrate I am
loving this this foundation I think just
really does have a beautiful finish on
the skin and the coverage is really
really unexpected I guess for as thin as
it is and I've just been really happy
with this I got it in the shade zero for
one of those that even though it has
- in the name I don't think they took it
too far at all I've enjoyed applying
that just with my classic Beauty Blender
another thing that I've been using on
and off and I am wearing it today is the
full cover perfect finished concealer in
the peach corrector shade and check out
the caps in that cool like the loose
powders like that - very I don't know
makes me think of sort of an
architectural inspired design or
something but this is what that looks
like it really is a good peachy tone
it's not maybe quite as richly peachy
pigmented you know what I'm saying as
the benefit array space but this still
does correct for me it can't effectively
you know cover up some issues around the
under eye and the inner corner if you
feel like benefit erased paste is a
little bit too amoliant for you has a
little bit too much moisture going on
this is slightly drier but yet it's a
little more creamy than pixie correction
concentrate this is a quality product it
really does work it it has nice coverage
I think for the most moisture in the
under eye area if that's what you're
going for you might like benefit here a
space better and then I have this
invisible finish loose setting powder in
the shape Madison zero three zero four I
kind of set my under eye area with this
today and I just used it very very
lightly everywhere else it's okay maybe
I need to give it a little bit more of a
chance I mean I haven't been using it a
ton lately but I'm not like instantly in
awe of this product you know as being a
really super special or super different
type of powder it's just kind of you
know your basic matte finish loose
setting powder but anyway thank you guys
so much for taking time to watch and I
hope maybe this answers some questions
if you had any on that mistake-free
makeup palette certainly not mistake
free literally but I do think it's a
well-put-together palette with really
nice quality products and I think it's
an awesome value so thank you guys so
much for tuning in and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
