going to try to keep it slightly more
bite-sized compared to my last couple I
know I've had some long ones out
recently but just got been the nature of
the you know the subject matter of what
I was talking about but today should be
a fairly quick review on a couple of new
sponges that have hit the market there
for real techniques one is a mini sponge
that's sold in a little duo pack here
and that is called the miracle mini
eraser sponge and then you've also got
this wild little character this is
called the miracle sculpting sponge so
this is geared toward highlight and
contour they say on the packaging I
first found out about these when I was
scrolling through my youtube
subscription feed and I saw I'm
subscribed to Real Techniques and they
just had a couple little videos out kind
of introducing these products and so I
thought where can I find them I
definitely want to snatch those up and
review them so the only place that they
were being sold at least at the time I'm
shooting this video and on that day it
was on the Real Techniques website I'm
not sure when Ulta is going to start
carrying these I assume they will just a
short backstory before we get going here
I love the Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge if you go back and
watch like my top 5 bottom 5 of blender
sponges you know this one received a lot
of love there I think it's awesome
quality I've used my up two of them use
them for a long time have not had
durability issues when I clean them you
really get them saturated with water
they get incredibly soft and I think
they do an awesome job of blending out
foundation I really love using like the
flat side to just dab around the skin
and then you can use your point inside
to get more detailed areas that's just
the way I like to use it but I
absolutely love that sponge and have
been super impressed with the quality so
first thing I want to talk about are the
miracle mini eraser sponges so little
purple sponges and if you get a good
look at them you can see they're like a
downsized version of the regular miracle
complexion sponge they do have a flat
edge you've got a pointed tip on the
opposite side and then one kind of
interesting thing is that it's cut flat
right across the top instead of really
finishing off to an edge like that it's
got a little flattened out
there it cost me six dollars to get this
duo and I'll just tell you the claims on
the back here it says from flaking
mascara eyeshadow fall out these little
miracles help sweep away your makeup
mishaps the thing I was definitely most
excited to use this for is concealer so
I'll show you that in a second but first
I just want to show the size comparison
with the one that was still in the
package and this is the one that's been
saturated with water then completely you
know wrung out and you can see just
about how much it grows now here's a
comparison to the Beauty Blender micro
mini sorry this is a little dirty too
but you can see it does get considerably
larger than the micro mini but
ultimately I feel like the amount of
point or the angle of the point is still
pretty pointed on both even though this
sponge gets a little bit bigger than
this one now I've really really loved my
micro mini for a couple of reasons first
off the texture is just so so soft and
spongy and it's just really really
lightweight to dab it around the eye
area you feel like you can actually plan
something out without applying hardly
any pressure to the skin and that's a
pretty delicate area you don't really
want to be you know pulling too much on
it and I really get to put my hands on
something that is also the mini size
that is super duper soft and can just do
the same job for me but I really think
this is it so I'm so so excited it's
really soft and spongy and you have a
flat edge which I found out I especially
love the flat side for baking it's
really really good for picking up that
powder so here's what I just wanted to
demonstrate for you in this video since
I am kind of doing a comparison with the
micro mini I put benefit erase paste
under each eye and then on one side I
used my micro mini just to blend that
out like I normally would you know it
does a fine job I really really love
this product about what I found is that
the Real Techniques sponge can do the
very same thing it can get into the same
spots for me but it does it just a
little bit faster given that the size is
slightly larger but it's still super
soft it seems like maybe even a slightly
softer material than the original
miracle complexion sponge and it could
just be that the smaller size makes it
even more squishable you know that
really can't complain about the finished
effect that I get from this and
something I've started to realize is
that this little cutoff you know nothing
in there could be pretty good for
wedging in right up under your lower
lash line like some people like to do
their eye makeup first that little blunt
edge there could possibly keep your
product a little bit more confined to
exactly where you want to place it so
overall I am really really happy with
this little guy and it's gone through
just one cleaning so far so I'm sorry I
can't really comment on longevity and
just how durable it is over the long
term all I really have to look at is the
reputation of my larger sponge and I
know that that's been good but two
little sponges for six dollars total I
think is a great deal I'm probably not
going to bust into this other one until
I really feel like I need to but I do
think this was a missing piece for Real
Techniques they had this great you know
full-sized sponge that works very well
all over the face and you know having
something just downsized but in a very
similar shape to that I think was a
really smart idea
now I want to move on to this other
sponge that looks really different I
don't own anything else like this so
this won't be so much of a comparison
review but just how well does this guy
work it's called the miracle sculpting
sponge
this was also six dollars it says use
damp or dry designed to help create
shadows or highlight your favorite
facial features so what you've got here
is this real light kind of hourglass
pear-shaped type sponge and there are
two flat edges a big flat surface right
there and then a much smaller flat
surface that's almost a little bit
triangle-shaped right there on that side
and the little diagram on the back of
the packaging identifies this part of
the sponge as contour and this part is
highlight but you know you kind of just
have to use it for a while and I think
realize what's the best purpose for this
in my life but overall just the feel of
the sponge very very soft and squishy
just like the purple one that I had
saturated with water I also did that
with this get it really really damp
under the sink and then wring it out
completely so it just feels kind of
slightly damp to the touch but you can
tell it's very soft and the size has
just blown up a little bit from where it
originally was
so the way I use this product I brought
in my little Maybelline master contour
stick I don't think I've used this on
camera yet but I have it in the shade
light and I just drew that product on
basically wherever I wanted it and then
I used the light side which is just like
a light matte creamy highlight and I'd
add that anywhere I wanted to highlight
going along with the instructions on the
packaging and then I went back and
rewatched the Real Techniques video that
was pointing out the features basically
they're thinking this flat side could be
what you use to blend out the contour
and for me it seems like just a little
too big like if I want to use that and
really spread my product it would be a
little too much you know a little too
wide of a surface area on my skin and
when I was playing with this yesterday I
just thought I'm immediately it's my
instinct to turn the sponge a little bit
and use it more around this side this
kind of curved edge as opposed to the
flat side for blending contour and I can
definitely achieve a decent one using it
from the side but I don't think that was
necessarily the intention but I went all
over the face getting the contour all
blended out and then you've got that
additional flat side or more rounded
surface area up top where you could use
that to blend out your highlight I kind
of like the idea of two distinct sides
to a sponge so when you are blending
light and dark product one right after
the next you're not really mixing it or
you're not having to go give it a rinse
under the sink first or something like
that so it's a really soft sponge I
think it's very easy to work with and I
think it did a fine job of blending out
that product all over the skin I guess
the feeling I come away with is that I
might actually like and take advantage
of this larger side a bit more if I was
just blending foundation all over my
face actually but that's very much like
the flat side that you get with the
original miracle complexion sponge which
I already love which I already found you
know was something that could blend out
contour and blend out cream highlight
and do all those different things so
whereas the mini sponge I think really
had a need and a place in this line of
sponges this one you know I wasn't
sitting around thinking gosh I need
something else that can blend out my
cream contour because this sponge can
really do that for me and just turn it
on its side I can squish it a little bit
I can use the flat side if I wanted to
but primarily I like using that on
foundations I don't really see this one
as a total like oh I got have that in my
collection or it's doing something
completely game-changing that this one
could do because it's not really for me
you do also lose some surface area that
you're actually going to do anything
with like this pinched in part is never
really going to touch the skin with this
sponge you can conceivably use
absolutely any portion of this and get
use out of it on your face now I want to
talk about baking for a second so
applying a real thick amount of powder
let's say to this under eyes zone here
leaving it on there for like five
minutes or so and then dusting it away
and you've usually got like really good
coverage a really smooth look to the
under eye I've used the flat side of
both of these to bake my under eye area
and just pick up some loose powder and
dab it right on yesterday I had used
this on one eye and I found that the
flat side was maybe just a little more
surface area than I was really looking
for but using the mini for that and the
flat edge is I think absolutely perfect
when I've used a beauty blender sponge
to try to pick up powder and bake or
anything that's rounded off I have so
much more trouble actually getting it on
there and doing it quickly like dab dab
dab
okay it's there I'm done that's not
usually my experience I got to keep
going back and getting more and more
okay is that enough you know it's kind
of tricky but this little flat side and
this smaller size sponge picks up just
the right amount for the under eye area
and I just dab it right on and I'm good
and then you know I let that sit on my
skin for a little while no more than
five minutes and then just dust it away
with the brush so I hope this video was
able to sort out some details on these
new sponges from Real Techniques again
very very impressed with their mini
sponges too for six dollars I don't
think you can beat it just as easy to
use as my micro mini but maybe a little
bit quicker in the concealer application
plus I love the baking capability that
you have with that flat side this other
sponge I like where their heads at with
the dual purpose of each end but I don't
feel like it's a necessity for me
because I think I could do any of those
things with this sponge including
foundation
thank you so much for spending some time
with me today I really appreciate it and
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
