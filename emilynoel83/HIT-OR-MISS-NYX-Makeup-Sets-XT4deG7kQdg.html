for this video because we are talking
about some gift ideas that are from a
drugstore brand a couple of things from
NYX that I picked up from Ulta now just
because we're saying drugstore because
NYX is a drugstore brand these kits
still aren't the lowest cost things ever
I'm one of them is like $24.99 one is
$21.99 I'm thinking I will have a video
talking about like even more inexpensive
like really drugstore gift II things
more stocking stuffer oriented items and
I thought each of these things carried a
somewhat substantial price tag and you
might be curious as to which one is
better or just wanting to see more as
far as swatches go so one of them that
I'm going to tell you about is this kit
which I did do a look with this palette
in my last video it's called
brighterdayz
and you're getting a 10 color eyeshadow
palette a matte lipstick and an eyeliner
and that one is $21.99 and then for
$24.99 you've got the NYX loves la set
and I've had a lot of questions about
this one and this contains 12 eyeshadows
10 of them are termed eyeshadows 2 of
them are called pressed pigments I've
taken the little shadows out of there so
I can have something to kind of look at
visually because when you see this whole
thing in its package you don't see any
colors so I've got to have them out but
when you put them all in here in the
right order which can be a bit of a
puzzle but you know I'm into puzzles
these days I've got a toddler but when
you put them all back in you get this
like la scene and my look today is using
on that set of singles and I will have a
little demo on that at the end of the
video so talking about this brighterdayz
set first what really drew me to this
palette and I mentioned it in my last
video it looked like the layout of Nyx's
Avant pop eyeshadow palettes with which
I think are fantastic quality just
really smooth very consistent with both
matte and shimmery shade and so I went
out on a limb with this one hoping that
would be a similar formula and it really
is every shade in here is very smooth I
think there's better quality in some of
these metallic shades than I've seen in
a lot of high-end holiday palettes this
time around and I just love the jewel
tones you know this garnet color the
sapphire blue the gold the green
and then I felt like there was enough
neutral to balance it out your mats in
this pallet are the matte brown up here
and then a matte gray and an outstanding
matte black so three out of ten shades
being matte that's not a whole lot of
matte if you're a huge hardcore mat
lover that may not sound great to you
but for me I do think it's enough in
terms of getting different looks you've
got this like really dark kind of
borderline charcoal slash dark brown
color here and there's not a lot of
shimmer in that one but everything else
you know these colors right here you've
got this light pearly shade the silver
it's all quite metallic and the texture
is just really really great my last
video I do look spotlighting that green
shade a little bit and you several the
other colors as well so if you want to
check that out for a little demo on this
palette please do but I mean I was very
very happy to see all the quality that
was in this thing and I just think it's
a really awesome palette if you're into
I think richer colors shades that aren't
super pop and bright but still have a
lot of nice pigment nice texture
something that I really like about the
burgundy and the blue and the green in
here especially sometimes those shades
and different eyeshadow sets and
palettes they can be so dark that you
don't get really quite the colorful
effect that you would hope for on your
eyes these have a certain amount of
depth to them that green is a little bit
on the bright side but they really show
up on the eyes I feel like every shade
in here is very true to color on the
lids in addition to this palette you're
getting a matte lipstick and that's the
shade I'm wearing today and it's really
growing on me and it is the shade honey
moon from Nyx's matte lipstick line
really great quality matte lipsticks by
the way these may have fallen under the
radar slightly since so many people are
into matte liquid lipsticks but there's
just something about putting on a cream
lipstick I mean I'm always going to be a
fan of that I've had this on for about
an hour and it still feels like mmm when
I press my lips together there's still
some creaminess there I'm seeing like a
mix of mob and light pink and a little
bit of gray and I know that is kind of a
trendy type shade really do you think
it's pretty and then you also get this
thing that just is labeled as NYX eye
liner and it says black and it is
retractable I have not used this on my
eyes yet but it does feel rather
and when i swatched it it did totally
set so it wasn't something that like
rubbing across it i was able to smear
away or anything so i was happy to see
that so all around i think this is a
really nice little giftable set or maybe
something you might be interested in for
yourself
I think $21 is a very fair price and I
would certainly put this up against some
different high-end palates quality wise
because it's just everything in here is
very consistent from the mattes to the
shimmery shades I have no complaints now
let's talk about this NYX loves la set
I'm sure NYX is working on the NYX loves
the Midwest set NYX you want to collab
on like a NYX loves rural Illinois thing
NYX loves boondocks open LA oh so
glamorous so we've got 12 ice shadows in
here and like I said earlier two of them
are called pressed pigments I'll just
show you those right now and they are
both very bold matte shades and this is
one called West Hollywood and this is
Sunset Junction here that orange you'll
see in the swatches those do really
stand out but before I get too ahead of
myself
basically you're dealing with an eye
shadow single set here and when you take
them out they're in like little
cardboard boxes they say the name on the
outside here so it says Malibu right
there Malibu on the front and then
there's your shadow now I open them all
up and I took a picture so I'll show you
the whole spread of what this shadow
color selection looks like in addition
to those two bright pressed pigment
shades you do have a matte cream shade
there's also a matte gray but everything
else in this set of 12 does have at
least a little shimmer or in some cases
a lot of shimmer several very bright
pops here certainly some deep rich
shades to kind of balance things out I
wouldn't say I was as 100% pleased with
all the shimmers in this set as I was
the palette there's kind of a khaki gray
shade in here called Abbot Kinney and I
did use it in today's look and it's got
like just a teeny splash of green in
there but it's sort of this khaki
grayish color and I thought that lacked
quite a bit of intensity I was a little
disappointed by the rose gold Pasadena I
did a look with that last week and I was
kind of expecting the texture of that to
be just a little more creamy but truly
as far as quality goes of these singles
I don't really
have that much to complain about I mean
maybe a couple shades lacked a little
intensity for me but for the most part
these shadows have been nice to work
with on the eyes and then the color
selection is really quite varied you've
got some really safe neutral tones to
work with those two pressed pigment
shades are quite vivid and really can
pack a punch on the lids there's an
electric shimmery blue and then I do
like having that deep burgundy the dark
plum one shade that's an example of a
color that looks pretty in the pan it's
nice and rich and dark but it just can't
translate as well on the eyes without
something else mixing in and that's the
color called Brentwood look at that it's
like a dark dark jade green dark forest
green it's got some shimmer in it and
I've got that on my lower lash line
today I popped in like a more shimmery
greenish liner in my lower inner rim to
kind of help the shade pop a little bit
more but it's so dark you do lose some
of the greens so if you're a real green
lover I'm just pointing that out at that
shades kind of lost so here's my biggest
concern with this palette it's just in
the practical use of the palette because
when you put all your little shades back
here in the container you have no
indication of what color you're pulling
out unless you're really good with
memorizing oh yes Pasadena is the rose
gold shape you know or whatever you're
not going to really know what you're
pulling out and I wish they could have
given some even tiny dot of a color
indication on these little boxes or on
the opposite side just something so if
you're sitting down to do your makeup
one day you're not like taking out shade
after shade trying to find the matte
cream color you know the kind of thing
you scroll through altas website you're
like oh that looks cute a whole set of
singles yeah and then you start to
realize oh man it's way less convenient
than just having a little palette where
everything's there and you open it up
and you can see it all so I feel like if
I want to get the broadest use out of
these shades I've practically got to
open them all up sit them all in front
of me and say okay what do I have here
what color combos do I want to put
together good idea but if you're really
used to the convenience factor of a
palette I mean there's it you just can't
beat that in my opinion but maybe some
of those singles really appeal to you
color wise maybe you're like yes I
that hot pink I want that orange and you
know the other shades are speaking to me
as well go for it you know I don't think
the quality on the shadows overall is
bad they're just a couple that maybe
lacked a little something for me but
it's a decent quality set it's just a
little frustrating as I actually put it
into use I'm like gosh I've got to pull
out all these colors to find the one I
want quick walkthrough of the look I'm
wearing today I put on an eye primer and
then I used the shade called Abbot
Kinney all over the lid and up into my
crease and I wasn't in love without this
shade applied but it gave me a little
base to work with and then I use
Silverlake which is a matte true gray
and I use that to sort of build up the
color in my crease and outer corner then
I brought in the matte creamy color
which I'm glad this is in here it's
called Santa Monica a really nice
texture on this one used it up under the
brow and around the inner corner i line
my upper lashline with black and then I
used a green in my lower inner rim from
soap &amp;amp; Glory it's the smolder kohl
smudged it out a bit and then applied
brentwood this really dark teal kind of
over the top of that with a couple
different brushes trying to get the most
color out of this shape possible it was
a little tricky because this wants to be
very very dark but finished look I
applied mascara and some demi whispies
lashes and there you go my top
recommendation of what I've talked about
today would be the set that contains the
palette the lip and the eyeliner I just
think this is a great little palette I
love the jewel tones I think it's very
fall it's very like right now or into
the holidays perfect deep rich tones to
play with I think they're the kind of
shades you could give to someone and you
know maybe they'd be like oh that's
something a little different for me but
they're not going to flip out like
thinking these colors are totally
unusable wearable pops of color I think
is what this palette is about so let me
know if you tried either these kits what
you think of them I will let you know
though there is another color option
actually of this palette set this is
called brighterdayz the other one is
cosmic style same price $21.99 maybe
overall more light shades in the palette
you are getting a reddish color maybe a
dark teal a yellowish shade but those
colors are sort of bookended by a lot of
very soft neutrals it looks like
so anyway just my two cents on those
sets I will have more both drugstore and
high-end holiday gift set palette
reviews coming so stay tuned and thank
you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
