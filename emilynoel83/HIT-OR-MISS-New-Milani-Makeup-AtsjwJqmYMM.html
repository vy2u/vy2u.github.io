kind of a quick review on a couple of
new products I came across from Milani
in my Walgreens store one is the
concealer and the other is a contouring
product so I thought I would show you
how both of these work in this video and
kind of give you my review on them I've
been wearing them for a few days now and
I've sort of figured out how to work
with them and yeah just come to some
conclusions on what I think about them
it is that time of year where drugstores
are getting in like tons and tons of new
products so you probably are going to be
seeing a lot of reviews or reviews slash
demos for me in the near future but
first thing I want to mention here is
this Milani retouch + erase light
lifting concealer I saw this and I
thought well it's just a little
concealer 2.2 4 fluid ounces turns out
it's just a little bit more than what
you get when you buy the maybelline
instant age rewind but the format of
this concealer is a squeezy tube and
then it's got like this little sort of
cushion bowl at the end and product just
squeezes straight up through so I highly
advise looking at that and seeing the
product squeezed out before you start
putting on your under-eye the first time
I use this I just kind of like all just
squeeze as I go got way too much on
there but I have this in the shade zero
to light and I'll tell you a little bit
about the claims it says conceals dark
circles covers spots blemishes and
imperfections brightens and revitalizes
Lang cap quick and buildable coverage
color corrects through light technology
minimizes the look of dark shadows and
wrinkles blends easily won't crease or
settle into fine lines so apparently
this is just God's gift to all your
facial issues I picked this up in a
shade that I thought would be sort of
just maybe slightly brighter than my
skintone since so many of the claims
pertain to brightening and it's called a
light lifting concealer so I got
something that I thought would
definitely be brightening on my skin and
the way I applied it like I said I kind
of look for the product to come up
through the tip and then you can totally
just dab that around wherever you need
it they say that you can just use the
tip the mess proof cushion tip
applicator to blend it
but you're really going to be having a
lot of product to work with if you do it
that way so I kind of like to get it on
there where I want it and then I took my
little swiss pers sponge or you could
use a brush I just think something other
than that little tip that's already kind
of saturated with product and just dab
over it to blend it in and it really is
pretty easy to blend in and used a brush
with it before I've blended it in with
just my fingers and it's a nice texture
to work with it's really not anything
that feels like a vastly different
texture from a lot of the liquidy creamy
consistency concealers that are out
there and I feel like it definitely does
brighten up my under eye area but what
really tells the tale for me because
let's be real here I'm sitting head-on
at the camera I'm in pretty bright
lighting but when I turn that's when I
can start to see the darkness coming
through you can really tell when you see
yourself at an angle like oh okay but
you know it's still there this is the
difference between trying to cover up
dark circles with a skin tone concealer
and trying to cover them up with an
actual like peachy tone corrector that
can truly camouflage them so I guess
what I'm trying to say here is depending
on how dark your circles are I don't
think this is necessarily going to be a
like one and done concealer for you I
would really advise if you've got like
those bluish tone kind of ashy looking
circles right in here I would definitely
advise covering those up with a PG
corrector first and then you can use a
concealer like this to fully like
brighten up the area because I do feel
like I'm very bright and like all in
through here that's where I applied it
and also down the center of the face as
well it worked nicely there and the
texture I like that and once it got all
blended in it didn't like dry to a
completely like there is no moisture in
the area anymore
the under eye area was not totally
zapped from moisture it wasn't as tacky
as like and it cosmetics bye bye under I
don't know I just kind of felt natural
it was a good consistency a good texture
and for some people it might be enough
if you've got just barely there
discoloration and just a little bit of a
brightening concealer tends to do the
job for you
and you know this could be great this is
all I'm wearing I didn't like go in and
add any more concealer the only thing I
added on top of it actually was just a
little bit of some setting powder a
little bit of the Laura Mercier loose
translucent powder then playing what
this is like under eye setting powder
I didn't bake the area but I just
lightly added a little bit more and that
kind of helps that effect you know the
head turn effect where you're still
seeing a little bit of darkness there
that powder actually adds a hint of
coverage to be used most effectively
again I think it's a brightening step I
don't think it's a really like cancel
out all your darkness step even though
the claims kind of make you think that
it's going to just be a miracle worker
now the new thing from Milani that I
tried and I really really enjoyed was
this contour and highlight cream and
liquid duo I thought this worked so so
well and I really like the tone that I
got I got 0 - light / natural and I
think there was one shade lighter and
then several deeper colors as well
there's on the go strobing and contour
made easy don't know how much I'm going
to just like be slapping this on on the
go you know let's be serious here but
basically they're giving you two
textures at product one light looks sort
of like a lipstick bullet that's your
contour shade and then you've got this
liquidy like kind of wand applicator
highlight I'm guessing that depending on
the shade you choose you know the
lighter you go with the contour color
your corresponding highlight is going to
be lighter as well to cater to a lighter
skin tone but bottom lines on this
product I like the way it applied it
went on really really smoothly and light
it didn't feel like I was applying like
a ton of product or a ton of heaviness
with this stick it was a really natural
looking color on me I felt like it just
gave that natural look of a shadow you
know kind of a cool tone contour but at
the same time not too too dark and I
could kind of put it wherever the heck I
wanted to on my face I went under the
cheekbones I even put a little down the
sides of my nose which I rarely do
around
caroline and i had time to go around and
blend all those things out and not feel
like i was in a hurry it didn't set
immediately on me and i really like
using my Real Techniques contour brush
to blend over a cream contour like that
and I just love the effect I thought I
got a really like pretty chiseled look
out of that and it did so for me very
easily it's hard to get I think all
things working in one product sometimes
it'll be the tone that you like but the
texture will be really really stiff and
dry or sometimes it's the reverse it
kind of made me think of the effect I
got from that Tarte contouring palette
and remember there's a cream contour in
there and I use that in a video and I
was just really impressed with the color
tone on my skin how easy it was to blend
it which is a good product this reminds
me of that but in a stick format so when
I got that all applied on my face what
did I do next I did go ahead then and I
set my under eye just a little bit I
applied some blush which is probably a
blush I'm going to be reviewing soon
from Physicians Formula on one of their
new butter blushes and then I moved on
to the highlight end of this product and
I think there are a number of ways you
could use this for the most potent
highlighter application I think you
could dab this directly on the skin and
just blend it out from there and I'm
actually going to try that right now
because so far I've just stuck to my Old
Faithful method of like putting it on my
hand first picking it up with a small
stipple brush and then blending it out
but I'm going to just on the spot here
try applying a little bit more right on
top of the cheeks and see what I end up
was here yes you do get a much more like
I don't know pronounced bellowing and so
when you do it that way when you go
directly to the area where you want it
and then blend over but I love this
creamy liquidy highlight I think it's so
easy to blend out I love that they
didn't load it down with glitter they
really didn't load it down with a ton of
metallic shine either it just gives your
skin this natural sort of sheer glow
this particular shade I got again it's
light slash natural and this
has a little bit of a golden hue to it I
think in this highlight but the way I
did apply it for my demo I just put a
little on my hand pick it up with a
small stipple brush dab it right on top
of the cheeks I think that's the most
subtle effect you can get really that
brush really does kind of disperse
product pretty well but you could use a
little bit more concentrated brush a
little bit more of a dense brush if you
wanted and even more like pinpointed
application or just do what I did there
and dab it right on your cheeks you
could blend it with your fingers blend
it with a brush but this is a nice
little duo product I am very impressed
regret store price tag you're getting a
very effective contour shade that by the
way does not stay tacky on the skin
either that really dried down nicely and
I'm happy for that and then this pretty
glow on top of everything that I was so
pleased with so in my opinion I think
Milani has got a real home run with
these contour sticks like I said they
come in multiple shades even a lighter
shade than what I used in this video and
the retouch and erase light lifting
concealer not a dud product either
definitely effective at brightening a
good texture it really doesn't seem to
totally dry out my under eye area with
wear throughout the day only thing is is
that I don't think this single-handedly
reverses like actual dark dark circles
like you may need to go to that extra
color correcting step but it is
brightening I think if you buy it in the
right shade it absolutely can be
brightening all over the face so thank
you guys so much for watching many more
fun new drugstore products out there
that I will be testing out and bringing
reviews to you about and I will talk to
you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
