well in this video I'm going to be
giving you little reviews on four
different eyeshadow palettes each one is
very different from the other and it's
probably going to seem kind of random I
mean they're they're truly not related
at all they're four different brands
they're very different palettes and I
don't know I may throw around some
little comparisons here or there but
more or less I'm just doing this video
to get out some reviews all at one time
and kind of just you know here here's my
take on these palettes and then we can
move on to some other ones I might
actually do a part two palette roundup
type video but there is no question I
feel like brands are cranking out
palettes like never before because I
think they know that's what people want
there is a good value I think in getting
a palette and getting so many shades
enclosed in one little place there's
definitely an appeal with palettes but
as a youtuber you get buried in them
very quickly admit it's like what am I
going to do how am I going to actually
get all these reviews out so I hope this
is useful for you and the first one I'm
going to be talking about here is the
Too Faced glitter bomb and I'm going to
go by the way from the palette I like
least to the one I like best so we got
four palettes the one I really like
least is this Too Faced glitter palette
however I do love the packaging what
they've actually done here with the word
glitter is put loose glitter in there
like you can shake it around and see the
glitter moving I don't know if you can
see that but that's really cool I
respect that and then what's happening
inside you do have the mirror there and
then flitter each a dough's and they are
kind of bookended by two matte shadows
one is a truly matte white and a matte
black and the white sands brightening
base the black says intensifying base
and as I look at these glitters like
they look really pretty in the pants and
I have worn them and I thought yeah
there are some interesting looks that
I've gotten with these on the eyes like
maybe confining two of them to the lid
and blending one into the next and
making that really be my pop on the lid
or I've taken a couple of these shades
like splashes kind of pretty in this
manner you know take a full colored
creamy eyeliner pencil along the lower
lash line and then sort of top that off
with one of these shades and you can get
a real pop going on there
I think it's rather obvious that this is
not really a standalone palette okay so
you're going to maybe use one of these
shades as like I said the pop on your
lid for example and you're going to
maybe pull in something more neutral to
be your crease colors or to create a
little contrast but that being said it's
almost as though they have attempted to
make it more of a standalone palette by
giving you these two matte shades and I
don't really think these two fully matte
you know complete opposite ends of the
spectrum shades really play that nicely
with these fully glittery colors I just
don't really see it happening I've tried
doing some layering putting one on top
of the glitters or going even underneath
it and putting the glitter on top of one
of the masks and it just doesn't seem to
work really well I feel like the glitter
looses some cling like that really does
need something to cling to and I've been
using by the way the glitter glue primer
from Too Faced along with these and that
works nicely these definitely that's a
huge point about these they have to be
topping something that's got some tag to
it and that glitter glue definitely goes
a step beyond other eyeshadow primers
with being a little bit extra tacky I
mean I wouldn't say it's hard to work
with it all it's not like unbearably
sticky once you do top it off with
something you're not going to be like
feeling the stickiness of that but these
kind of shades need some of that and
while these you know white and black
shades in their own right are nicely
pigmented colors and they're good
eyeshadows it's like this glitter
palette was clearly not going to be a
standalone thing for most people and
then they threw in these two shades that
I don't think really layer all that well
with what's happening with the glittery
shades and with most of these they're
not like straight glitters what they are
is like a powder shadow that's been
infused with some very fine glittery
particles so as you would swatch one of
these you would see some actual like
powder pigment but it's got a lot of
concentrated glittery flecks in it and
some of the shapes I think are unique
like this glitter gold color see how
that's like a multicolored glitter but
in a topi gray shadow like it's really
pretty there are some cute accents that
you can do with this kind of palette but
when I look at it as the palette as a
whole
not that I'm expecting it to be a
standalone palette but I just don't love
what was done in the attempt to make it
I don't know more versatile with the
white and the black shade it's full-on
glittery shadows or your thing and you
feel like you can never get in Dussel
them in different palettes or in
different singles you might enjoy having
the selection of 8 here all in one thing
because they can layer up and look nice
when one complaint is that I usually
they'll get me through about half the
day the staying power on these it's not
that they disappear from my eye colors
all managed to stay on my lids with like
a glitter glue primer yet you know about
half the day goes by I can absolutely
see that I've got glitter on my cheek
and it didn't start the day that way but
some fell away some lost the cling and
so that's something to be aware of I
guess if you're considering this palette
and its really such a personal
preference thing isn't it I mean as far
as just the glitter shadows go they're
going to be some people who are all
about it like give me more of that kind
of thing and some people are saying no
those are the kinds of shadows I like
least in any other palette I own the
thing that I don't really get with this
like I said the Mac's that were thrown
in here I almost feel like if they threw
in a slightly pearly color or something
with a hint of a satin finish it
actually would have meshed with these a
little bit better because he's pulling
that shades I just don't feel like they
layer that nicely with the glitters okay
next time I'm going to talk about is
from Tarte and it's the clay play face
shaping palette so this is going to be
one of those dual like eye and cheek
type palettes they've given you three
shades down here that you could
absolutely contour your cheeks with
you've got all of these shadows here
which could double as both eyeshadows or
eyeliners it could be brow colors so
there's definitely a lot of versatility
with this palette the coolness of some
of these shapes like these right in here
yeah I can put those in my eyebrows and
certainly get a look with them and these
shades you know not only are they
contours but they can be eyeshadows
right along with everything else so
there is multitasking happening in this
palette there's good quality on this
palette it smells good I don't know
slightly vanilla ish scent that you may
have noticed in some Tarte palettes I
think the shades are easy enough to use
they're pigmented there's not really
much that I can even think of disliking
about the
formula I think it's just the palette as
a whole I you know I've seen it the all
matte palette and I'm a fan of all that
looks I can be very happy with an all
matte neutral I look but I've got this
over and over in my collection right now
I really like my matte busy art palette
and I've got Kat Von D shade and white
and I've got makeup revolution to take
on that very same palette and just from
various drugstore brands that have
eventually rolled out they're all matte
neutral palettes it's like okay I've got
it
and on top of that I've got a lot of
contouring palettes as well and I find
myself overlooking this palette a lot
for the contouring shades that are in
here because I'm just I don't know I've
got it in my head that it's an eye
palette and when I pick up a face
palette I think of going for something
different and this is my own like kind
of operator error here with forgetting
the fact that this is kind of a
two-in-one thing think what they have
here is a very common concept for the
eyeshadows that we've seen over and over
again with the matte neutral palettes
they tried to switch it up by putting in
some contours but it's just even still
it doesn't excite me it's just enough
out there right now this was sent to me
I don't know that I would have sought it
out to like buy it on my own the shades
aren't a problem I'm not complaining
about quality it's just more so the
concept and something that I think has
been played out okay next palette and
remember we're working our way up to
through these four pallets flowing from
the one I like least to the one I like
best and the next one I'm going to talk
about is the naked heat palette from
Urban Decay and I have had this on hand
for what seems like a really long time I
remember taking it on vacation with me
and really digging into it then and I've
been using it on and off ever since
here's what I have to say about this
palette in a nutshell I think it's a
beautiful color scheme
I love the warm color scheme for
eyeshadow palettes I don't have a
problem with the quality of these
shadows I think they're pigmented they
apply nicely I like the matte and
shimmer mix here they've got some shades
I have a really beautiful sheen to them
and then some mats that are just rich
you know like a really rich plum also a
dark burgundy shade here I like so much
of what's going on in this palette but
it is one distinct color scheme all the
way through it's definitely different
from like naked one which kind of
peppered in several different color
schemes I feel like here it's one
general look and as many different ways
as I attempt to use this I always end up
with one kind of similar look and it's
just because that is the color scheme
that's in here and if that's what you
want then you go snatch up this palette
if you love warm shadow looks this
palette does it really well and I like
the look I have been so pleased with
what I've done but in terms of
versatility you might go a little bit
off the beaten path with some of these
you might leave out maybe a lot of
what's happening here and then you've
got just this really basic neutral look
or maybe you could skip a lot of the
central portion of this palette and go
to the plumy shade and then just work in
some of these neutrals but what I find
myself doing it's like I am going to
jump to some of these mid-tones at some
point for my look and those shades end
up being really warm and they really
warm up the crease and it's pretty and I
like these shadows and I like their
qualities but this spell it just doesn't
take me in a lot of different directions
maybe I should really challenge myself
and see like how many truly different
looks like make a real point to do a lot
of different looks with this I guess
what I'll leave you with on this one is
that I like the palette I like it
because I enjoyed this color scheme but
if you buy palettes and expect
versatility and expect like I want to
get a big range out of one palette this
wouldn't be the one to go with now
leading up to my thoughts on the
subculture palette so without saying
anything now the theme of this video you
know leading up to the one that I like
best out of everything I've tried and
this may be really like unpopular
opinion because I feel like now I
haven't watched a bunch of reviews on
this palette but I look at my YouTube
feed and I see all of these thumbnails
with like you know really strange faces
and they all say like oMG WTF and people
just look disgusted and so this
obviously is not getting rave reviews
and I do think that influencers if you
want to call us that can sometimes be so
influential that they influence other
influencers opinions yes I said it I put
out a tweet about this not too long ago
and I said you know I'd love to see what
people might say about certain products
if the opinions could all be like car
laid out on the table all at once and
nobody knew what everyone else was
thinking about something and they just
truly had to 100% think for themselves
and put it all out there I don't know I
think that would tell everyone a lot I
really don't care what anybody else says
about this palette my experience is with
this have been really really good
honestly I've enjoyed the palette as I
will explain here I don't think it's
completely without flaws but I
personally like what's happening here
after using naked he you know some of
these other palettes like I opened this
up and I thought this is a creative
really interesting color scheme to me
just really nice kind of off the beaten
path type colors in here and oh as a
whole I think the color scheme is so at
um kn'l so fall to me and I love that I
love that it's fall without purely being
like warm pumpkiny shades but it's like
these dark teals and this color that I
lovingly referred to as honey mustard
and like all these different things
happening here that I think it's a
brilliantly laid out palette I really
like it and it's very heavy on mass the
shades that are shimmers are cube up
here and electric and adorned and
there's something know about these
shimmers the formula of these um they're
not like your average shimmer shadow
where you just kind of dip your brush
into it and I would like dab dab dab it
on my eyes with these I would actually
dip my brush in and find I got the most
effective like color transfer onto my
lid when I would apply some pressure and
give it a short swipe you know what I
mean because these almost feel a little
bit creamy to the touch and if you
picture yourself applying like let's say
a cream shadow to your lid you would
apply it maybe with just a bit of a
swipe not like a full-on pink brush
swipe across it but just like short
little swipes kind of like this with
your brush and that is what I think
causes those shapes to transfer down and
be as pure and as pigmented as they
appear that they would be hue biz so
interesting it has this pinky sheen to
it and I find myself becoming like
addicted to that color with whatever
look I'm doing it's like I taught that
on and everything in my look becomes
kind of unexpected and interesting and
it's a great overlapping shade like it
some really cool things to other colors
kind of a transformer type shade and
before I say too much more about the
eyeshadows this brush that's in here I
always love the brushes this is a great
little blending brush and this is nice
for those likes kind of short swiping
motions that I mentioned with the
shimmer they always include a fully
usable brush in these palettes so I like
the color scheme I like that there's so
much matte in here it definitely
inspires creativity it definitely causes
me to I don't know just make some
different choices with my eye shadow
looks but a big thing to know about this
is the texture of the shadows when you
stick your brush into these and certain
shades more than others but when I put
my brush into these shades it will kick
up some fallout it will kick up some
additional shadow and it's not
unexpected like the very first time I
used this and I hadn't even heard one
thing about this palette from anyone
because I ordered it as soon as I could
like the day it launched
I remember dipping into this Roxie shade
thinking that is kicking up a little
more fallout than just about anything
like it's maybe a little bit more than
let's say a lorac matte shadow and those
I would say tend to be some of the
softest shadows in my collection that
being said they're also some of my
favorites because they are so intense on
the eyes they have such a capability of
being really really true to color and
very intense so I didn't see that and
think gosh I hate that shadow I thought
and thought well this is the way these
shadows work not every eyeshadow in my
stash has to perform the exact same way
and also here's my tendency with
applying shadows I'm a very light handed
person with them if you've watched my
tutorials I almost always go pretty
light with about anything I try and then
I build it up from there so I'm talking
I will barely tap into a shadow and then
go with it and is anything really hard
to blend when you go about in that just
apply a little at a time mindset no I
think everything actually applies rather
easily when you do it that way now if
you are with a heavy hand dipping your
brush into these and getting a ton on
your eye at one time could you be in a
real pickle there yes you absolutely
could and these shades given how dark
some of these are it can take that
heavy-handedness that some people might
tend to have and make it a real problem
potentially I generally give every
pallet this shot I start small in
application with about every pallet and
unless it teaches me that I need to do
otherwise you know that's what I do so
when I see a shadow is kicking up some
fallout here's what I've ended up doing
with some of the shades in this palette
and I've seen it most with Roxy and also
a little bit with Dawn as well when I go
into that and I see okay it's giving me
a little bit of extra powder enos with
this shade I'll go back into that
godforsaken fallout with my brush and
just apply it to the other eye you know
get use out of it it doesn't need to be
completely blown away tapped off the
palate entirely just use it I don't know
it's been working for me and I don't
find these to be hard to blend together
when you just go a little at a time
be light-handed with it these are dark
shades these are rich colors you know
that just by looking at it if you're
really trying to wrap your head around
this and think what do I want it do I
need it I think there are a couple of
factors you should look at number one do
you even like these shapes at all like
if you don't think that these colors
appeal to you whatsoever if you're
looking and seeing that like I don't
know several of them you just absolutely
wouldn't ever touch then skip the
palette but if you are interested in the
shades now let's think about the formula
does it really frustrate you when you
have to be a little bit goes a long way
type of eyeshadow applier or do you just
want to be able to casually toss the
brush in and get the look and not have
any fallout to deal with potentially if
that idea frustrates you then maybe you
want to skip this palette because these
are soft shades they're so rich some of
them like if you do make mistakes with
it it can show but I would not say I
have had any more difficulty using this
palette than I have other palettes that
have had rich pigmented shades if I
compare this to a busier palette like I
was kind of looking at this one like my
dark matte palette here with these
shades for example they don't kick up as
much fall out and they are really
pigmented and I would say I find them to
be a bit easier to work with that being
said I use very little of these two and
these are a little goes a long way type
shadow but you're going to pay $80 for
this palette
like $45 for this one so I don't know if
there's your difference but I do like
that this threw in some random like
really random and kind of fun shimmers
to kind of pop in there with these dark
really pretty mess but does it kick up
some fallout yes
is it unmanageable no and you guys know
me I'm no like shadow application
prodigy here and I purposely did my look
today with this palette and I said I'm
just going to use this quickly because I
have kind of fallen into looks with this
where I'm like just using so many
different shades I end up taking a
really long time not because I have to
but kind of cuz I want to so I just saw
today can I just turn something out as
quickly as I ever have with any palette
and I used honey mustard here or that's
actually called edge but I call it honey
mustard and put that on the lid I've got
Roxy in the crease didn't take much of
that shade by the way one of my favorite
shades a little bit in the outer corner
this all-star shade and such I've got
some of fudge in the outer corner also
quick look pretty much all confined to
the upper part of my eye today and I
love it you know that was easy this was
a very everyday type look but very fall
you know I would say the modern
renaissance shades kicked up a good
amount of fallout for me to maybe not as
much as that Roxie shade did in this
palette when I first used it like I said
zero preconceived notions on the palette
didn't know that there was going to be
some public outcry on this I kind of
thought oh noted that's kind of a
loosely packed shade there and what gets
me is that I look around at the whole
palette landscape and I think about all
the things that I think are far inferior
to this palette that people have raved
on and it kind of just seemed to become
the thing to do to do a real like ooh
shocking you know like video on this
palette when it's really not like I
don't know top story news I don't think
of these four pallets I'm talking about
in this video it's definitely the one
that I enjoyed the most so there's my
two cents on subculture naked heat the
Tarte clay play and the Too Faced
glitter palette I hope this was helpful
for you guys I'm just offering my
perspectives and just stir that up in
the mix of everything else that's out
there and I've given you a few different
things to consider and thank you so much
for your time
really appreciate it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
