it is January 9th as I shoot this it is
Yves birthday her first birthday so this
time last year we were in the hospital
getting ready to have her and it has
really been the best year ever having
her in our lives and seeing her and
Belle together like there's nothing like
watching your two kids grow closer and
closer together and you might think well
they're so young is that really
happening and yes yes it totally is
every single day in some way I see Belle
like assuming this loving big sister
sweet roll toward her it's really
amazing and fascinating and sweet and I
just love what she is brought to our
lives it's been just amazing so happy
birthday little one and now that I'm
about to cry here's a change of subject
the game last night who watched the
national championship Alabama Georgia
what a game what a storyline I'm a
sucker for a storyline so as soon as
they brought in that freshman
quarterback Alabama did and it was like
they hadn't scored the whole first half
so is he gonna come in and be the hero
I'm like yes I'm standing in front of
the TV him like one thing amazing things
to happen for this guy didn't that poor
kicker at the end he totally could have
like sealed the deal with that last kick
and he missed the overtime and I was
just like I was all in like I couldn't
even go to bed I was so like up here I
was on like a whole different
vibrational level so Burt would say but
that was fun to see and I'm not even
like a hardcore
Alabama or Georgia fan like I just
wanted a good game I like an exciting
game I think I was kind of hoping after
Alabama lost the national championship
last year which we were in the hospital
watching that game after we'd had Eve
but I was hoping they kind of come back
and redeem themselves this year with a
win but ultimately as a viewer you just
want something fun to watch and I was
like gosh I hope they get it going in
this games and score them they did let's
get to the point of the video already
it's the Sephora favorites give me some
new lip set so I've tried give me some
nude lip I've tried to give me some bold
lip and various other sets that they put
out over the years but this is the first
give me some new lip that I've seen
and what they say is it Springs latest
arrivals and let this set features the
newest must-haves in an array of
finishes from Matt tie shine and
metallic and I'm so excited about this
because often times I'll get one of
these kits and they put in maybe some
real like already-established super
bestseller type things not that some of
these haven't probably sold big just on
their own but I mean more often than not
I've got like at least one thing in the
kit that they're putting out and this
time I didn't have any of it so I was
really jazzed about getting it twenty
eight dollars you get five things and
you get two of them in full-size the
Marc Jacobs product and here's full-size
and they're giving you a full-size
Smashbox liquid lipstick so I thought I
would go through this with you and try
them on we've kind of chat about the
formulas and what makes them special but
this is a cute little just cardboard box
I like how it opens so neat might be a
way to spend that Sephora gift card you
got for Christmas but I've just always
been a lip sampler person especially if
you can give me that lip sampler and
like switch up the brands so I can try a
lot of different things and you give me
the small size so I don't feel all that
pressure about you sync it up you know
but the first thing we're gonna talk
about is this little guy this looks like
something I swear I when I was I don't
know six years old I had a set of Avon
lip balms that looked like mini crayons
like this like they actually had that
kind of tip I don't know
am I making that up that was back in the
day when I used to go up to my
neighbor's tree house and like eat a
little they had more taste back then
okay but this is in the shade Barbados
berry and it's from tres teak and I do
have some other stuff from this line
that I need to dive into more but this
is the mini plumping lip balm lip
treatment in Barbados berry and I went
to their website to get a little bit
more of a description of what this is
but when you take the top off it looks
kind of like a you know an EOS style lip
balm but it's tinted it's like a soft
berry tint and I found it to be
buildable but it really just felt super
lip balm II and I didn't get the
plumping thing so I looked at more info
and it says infused with organic shea
butter maxi-lip and marine collagen
microspheres for full moisturized lips
lips look up to 32% fuller so this
doesn't have any kind of tingly
chemically
gonna make your lips feel like pins or
poking it into them and you've got
bee-stung lips or something like it's
just smoothing out the surface of your
lips making them appear to be a little
bit fuller but I love the color I like
that you can add a little bit more as I
did and intensify the shades just kind
of this nice reddish berry the kind of
touchy thing about it is that it's so
rounded and yet it is tinted it's hard
to get a lot of precision so I would
definitely want to apply this with a
mirror just to make sure I wasn't like
you know that I do like the product and
I think it's very comfortable and very
cute next thing here is this huda beauty
metallic lip gloss in the shade snobby
and it says lips strobe here on the
packaging so just like a really shiny
iridescent cool gloss it looks neat in
the tube because you're seeing the pink
and the golden sort of shift but it's
not until you put this on your lips that
you start to see the depth of it like
it's rosy peachy looking very golden as
it hits the light looking a little bit
deeper and more rosy when it's not super
cool layering product I'm actually
wearing this just a little bit of it
layered over another part of this kit
and it's just really cool it's very
transformative and it will take on a lot
of different chameleon like looks
depending on what you put it over top of
but even worn on its own I think it
looks really nice and I'll do the
metallic thing if you give it to me in a
glossy finish because I don't think the
lips end up looking over dried and this
is actually a really pleasant texture to
wear too not too sticky whatsoever it
has like maybe a barely there sort of
sweet scent and this by the way I wasn't
picking up any scent on you know how
sometimes you get a kit and there's one
thing in it that you love so much you're
like yep this is the thing that's worth
the price of admission like this one and
this one alone makes it worth getting
this from Marc Jacobs and it's called
the Lamarck liquid lip crayon and the
shade is 3:10 night moths or Night Moves
in that context moves actually had mixed
more sense really cool product it looks
like a jumbo lip pencil type thing that
you've probably tried time and time
again it's not like massive jumbo I mean
obviously I would still say it's
definitely slim but it's thicker than a
normal lip liner
Geron this is awesome it is like a
liquid lip but it doesn't have the
uncomfortable dry down of a liquid
lipstick but it just goes on
weightlessly
but it feels like liquid like a thin
liquid but yet opaque it does say it's a
16 hour long wear lip crayon I'm not
sure how they're gonna pull that off I
need to test it more in that capacity
and by the way this is what I've been
wearing throughout the video with a
little of the hooter on top this
description of this product is
definitely consistent with what I
experienced here it says it melts into
lips with a lightweight liquid sensation
providing powerful one swipe color with
bold impact like it really was you know
you didn't have to build it up but it
felt so tremendously light and yet oddly
liquidy it was weird a dose of
innovative ghost pearl they call it
gives the matte look a dimensional sheen
which becomes more visible at certain
angles to give the lips a modern
never-before-seen finish and you do see
that I remembered looking at this when I
first got it and swatching it on my hand
and thinking there is just a bit of
Sheen to that they call it ghost pearl
hey you know I like saying ghost pearl
more than like subtle sheen or whatever
but I don't know if you can tell like
it's nothing that makes your lips look
like dry and cracki and unattractive but
it's very unique and really interesting
and I feel like just even judging by the
way the swatch is on my hand I think
there's gonna be sort of a staining that
happens with this because it's tough to
fully remove the color like just to wipe
it off and another key thing about this
when you put the cat back on there's
like an added little snap there and that
may be part of what keeps this feeling
so light and almost like liquefied once
you put it on your lips it's really a
neat experience the color is great too I
mean like I said I've got a hint of the
gloss on right now on top of it but what
a workable easy shade for anyone moving
on the next thing is from Smashbox and
they're giving you an always-on metallic
matte the shade is XO it's kind of a
like gold and copper mix I maybe call it
a soft copper it's a really super pretty
color put it on my lips and I think
here's the thing
just don't like things that are metallic
and have some sort of dry down on the
lips I just don't think it's a pretty
thing on lips you just see every little
crevice there and I don't really want to
see that I mean you got this nice thing
that sort of takes away the look of
lines if you want a little metallic e
interesting shine the hooter thing
doesn't make you look super parched and
over dried but for just a liquid
lipstick in general I'm finding I do
like this formula because even as it
dries down it doesn't go uncomfortably
dry or anything but still it's not shiny
there's not a ton of moisture there and
I just don't love the look that that
gives but I'm wondering if I can find a
way to work this in kind of as a more of
an accent type color given the lightness
that this shade has I wonder if it could
be kind of mixed into another lip look
and look kind of cool in that manner and
lastly how cute is this like undeniably
cute this is the fenty Beauty
Mademoiselle and the shade is called
candy venom so we've got a matte
lipstick here super cute nice attention
to detail with the actual Finn T Beauty
logo stamped into the mini lipstick like
they're doing it right or just like
really pretty bright pink shade I love
this kind of color it's so saturated and
it's immediately matte on the lips so
you do feel I guess a hint of dryness is
you're moving this across your lips but
that's kind of gonna come with the
territory when you're achieving matte
instantly there's some matte lipsticks
where they go on exactly like a cream
and then maybe after a little wear they
finally look fully matte this is for the
people who want to commit to the fully
matte lip and have it instantaneously it
says an ultra slim lipstick with a long
wearing petal soft matte finish she says
the finish on the lips was inspired by a
rose petal and if you wear this and kind
of lick your lips you do sense that like
it's that sort of feeling I definitely
wouldn't call it uncomfortable by any
means but there's just a difference when
you put on a matte lipstick you kind of
know what you're getting into it's
definitely gonna be a different feeling
from the Tres deke not as comfortable as
the Marc Jacobs of course this is like
its own special animal type of product
you're really excited about that
but no the Fendi is nice and the color
is outstanding so from my perspective I
would say this is definitely a kit worth
getting I think it would be a great
giftable type
thing if you want to experiment with all
these different colors and textures I
mean they're only given you 5 products
but they gave you five very different
things two of the things are full-size
and it was what $28 yeah definitely
worth it oh and can I tell you guys do
you remember when I did that video on
Sunset I palettes like that trend toward
eye palettes that have orangie shades
but also kind of a purpley tone to them
as well have another to officially add
to that list the makeup revolution
flawless for that's what I'm wearing in
this video and I've got some of the
peachy tones and the purple on there
altogether and I love it also I'd like
to add have been still playing around a
bit with my Patrick Starr powder from
Mac first time I use this I instantly
thought it was very very dry looking and
today I made a very specific effort to
moisturize myself and prep my skin in my
eye area really well and I thought it
was less dry and I still used a
substantial amount of product because I
baked so just throwing that out there
but I found to be kind of brightening
and I really like the way at work today
so thank you guys for putting up with me
today in my random rambles that came
alongside the actual point of this video
I appreciate you I love you and I will
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
