joining me I'm gonna be talking about my
Sephora play box today the contents of
it I had brought this up on Twitter that
I just started getting this little
monthly subscription thing from Sephora
and I asked if you'd be interested in
seeing what I got or the application and
stuff like that and a lot of you said
you did want to see it I'm not gonna lie
I did pilfer through it already a little
bit because I wanted to try the skincare
thing that was in here and let you know
how that worked but the way it goes like
you fill out a profile type thing on
sephora's website and from what I
understand that allows them to customize
the kinds of things that they put in
this bag for you came in like a smallish
black and white striped box a theme for
the month I guess is complexion type
products so it says public display of
complexion which i think is adorable and
then you get this whole like page it
seems like a little newspaper
practically of tips and then the
specifics on all the products that you
get and also they give you a little card
here with 50 Beauty Insider points so I
guess you can like apply those to an
upcoming purchase you make now this is
not a brand new thing I know Sephora has
been doing this for a while I just now
got on board with it so I thought it
might be fun to take you through the
actual application of some of this stuff
and just give you my thoughts as I go
alright guys we have the little bag here
the Sephora play bag and I'm going to
just grab out some things and we'll talk
about them a little bit and then figure
out what the sequence of the application
needs to be so one of the things as a
fragrance this is the Tory Burch Belle
as your give it a little whiff here it
smells nice reminds me of my mom for
some reason that scent hmmm very crisp
clean a little bit floral definitely
different from those Elizabeth and James
from the warm and spicy set that I got
all right we've got a primer here this
is the Urban Decay optical illusion
complexion primer okay that's a decent
little sample size we have a setting
spray or maybe just a hydrating spray
this is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
marine boosting mist this which I use
last night this is the dr. Brandt pore
dermabrasion pore perfecting exfoliator
I'll just talk about this for a second I
mean this is awesome I probably never
would have thought to try the
had it not been included in this little
sample bag and it was so good like next
level even better than the philosophy
micro delivery wash which i think is
good but this I mean whatever particles
are in this are absolutely miniscule as
you rub it in on your skin you're just
like man this is really doing something
everywhere I touch it's not like that
issue with some scrubs where all the
little bits sort of navigate to one area
this is so like concentrated with the
little scrub ease and the softness
afterward was so good like I thought my
skin was soft before hand it was not
after I've used this I'm like yes it was
soft and I used I would say even just a
little smaller than a pea-sized amount
of this all over my face so yeah I think
I need to be placing in order for that
we got a foundation here this is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
they've sent it to me in y2 45 so we'll
see how that goes interested to see how
good of a match that's gonna be and also
from makeup forever
this skin booster serum and this is I
think supposed to be put on right before
foundation or mixed in with a primer and
a couple of these things like I've used
before I've used the Ultra HD I remember
I think using it when my skin wasn't
maybe quite so good and I thought well
you know it's an okay looking foundation
like the finished look of it's very
natural on the skin but I wasn't quite
satisfied with the coverage right now I
feel like my overall skin tone is pretty
even so we'll see like how well that
works again and then I swear I've used
this serum before but I don't know that
I really came up with a great purpose
for it so now that I've got my
moisturize are already on I'm gonna do
primer and then I'll do a little bit of
that make up forevers serum just to add
some extra moisture so this is the
optical illusion complexion primer from
Urban Decay it says smoothing rosehip
and argon pore perfecting I do love my
argon I'm gonna give it a full pump
they're out of that little guy I love
what even sample sizes have pumps that's
great whoo this feels thick rific mmm
but very smooth I feel like I'm putting
on a light pink mask okay as its warming
up into my skin it's feelings
super silky but yet there is some
thickness to this very interesting
texture how about the pores though it's
kind of giving me that effective like a
benefit Porefessional type thing we're
like the Smashbox photo-finish
pore perfecting type primer like it
really is sort of blurring what I'm
seeing around my nose you I probably
should have done some of this marine
boosting mist before I started any of
this thing it wasn't thinking about that
I'll use it as a setting mist at the end
for now we'll use this makeup forever
these little drops how cute is this
bottle okay I'm just gonna do like maybe
a little bit right here little extra
here
wow that's really silky smooth to my
wonderment is though if that is going to
kind of dilute some of the effects of
that poor disguising primer you know
but my nose still looks pretty good the
pores around there still feeling good
okay I feel hydrated I feel prepped now
I'm going to use my foundation again
this is in y2 45 little pump also
they're bringing it with the sample size
packaging I'm gonna blend this around
this may be a really good match for me
guys I mean it's looking a little yellow
II as I put it on right now but I just
in terms of depth I don't think it's
going to be way too light or too dark
and then I'm using my Real Techniques
insta pop cheek brush which I think I
use this the other day with a foundation
and I think it's a really good size for
foundation
this foundation is a little better
coverage than I remember it being
okay here are my thoughts the surface of
my skin looks very skin-like
you know it looks very real I think some
of that has to do with the I already
moisturize before I did any of this
stuff and then you know the primer did
some favors for pores but I added some
extra moisture here and then this
foundation itself isn't particularly
like drying it's not like it has an
ultra dewy look to it but it's just kind
of natural you know but as I look up
close the way I can still see you know a
lot of freckles little spots and things
here there I give it a straight up
medium coverage description I suppose
color like I said the depth I thought
was right on for me it wasn't too dark
or too light maybe just a little on the
yellow side but that in itself I think
serves to correct some redness that I
have kind of around my nose so I guess
my last step is my little spray so I'm
gonna go ahead and do some more makeup
and we'll do that at the end so I've got
basically my whole face on at this point
and I'm just gonna do this marine
boosting mist we'll see what this does
just for the finish overall my skin's
looking really matte right now like I've
got a little bit of highlight on but my
blush is matte and you know I've got
some powder on over that foundation some
concealer as well so let's see how just
the appearance of the skin changes with
like for mists of that that's what I
usually do with these myths I do like
here here here and here I check the
sprayer first all right looks good
really hit myself right in the mouth
with that last wouldn't I give it one
more the mist is really really fine
getting kind of frustrated by the mist
because it's very fine and to go a
normal distance from your face what
would normally work for a lot of mists
it's like I can hardly feel it so I have
to get really close and then you risk
getting too close I don't know that one
was pretty direct to there feel like my
skin looks slightly do here and I can
definitely feel the moisture in my skin
from that last mist but sort of
frustrating to try to you know strike
the right balance for spray there I feel
like I'm not in a place right now where
I'm really
seeking you know a really good new mist
because there are so many that I like
from the ones that sort of enhance the
staying power to the ones that do give
you that added hydration I love the
Mario Badescu ones I really love that
hard-candy sheer envy primer mist and
stuff like that the thing I like about
this afford play box is that they're
giving me brands that are like relevant
to me things that I want to be informed
on and the stuff I want to be trying and
I can always use the mini sizes because
I'm not one who's gonna go through
makeup really quickly I am the kind of
person who for my channels sake and just
for my own like what I like to do I like
to try different things out so I do like
trying the minis I do feel like I'm
given the way I filled out my little
survey thing as far as what my skin type
was and my needs and blah blah blah I
can tell that some of the things they
gave me in this are kind of adhering to
the way I filled out that survey as it
stands right now and I'm a mess with
some of the stuff a little bit more like
this primer I want to use some more I'm
kind of interested in that and I want to
see how it stacks up with some other
pore minimizing primer 'z that I have
the Ultra HD you know I've used that for
a makeup forever before it was this was
just sort of refreshing my memory on it
and I'm kind of middle-of-the-road on
that stuff it's not giving me a look on
my skin that's making me like super
excited like oh my gosh my skin looks
better than ever it's not like ultra
transformative in terms of giving
amazing coverage at the same time it's
given me a little better coverage than I
remembered I'm not like super in love
with the Tarte spur as you could see but
it's something that I may continue to
use or take with me places if I want to
have that kind of thing on hand I am
interested in the Make Up For Ever skin
booster it gave my skin light just this
instant little drink I want to do some
more mixing with this type of thing that
was one of the things they suggested and
I think going into even drier months
here this could be a really great thing
I got no problems with the fragrance
there either that was nice at the pore
dermabrasion from dr. Brandt this is a
really different skin care thing for me
like it's fun to try something that's
unlike anything you've used before so I
love that so that is it for my Sephora
play box or my play bag for this month
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this was somewhat useful for you
and given the kinds of info you put on
your profile you know you might not end
what the exact same stuff as someone
else from what I understand what these
that if you were just wanting to get
sort of a feel for what this thing is
like I was pretty impressed with what
you got in here I enjoy how there's sort
of a theme to it so everything you know
pertain to complexion and prepping the
skin and the foundation I like that that
was in there so thank you again guys and
I will talk to you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
