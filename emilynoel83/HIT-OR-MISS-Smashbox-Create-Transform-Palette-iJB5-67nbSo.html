tuning in the day has come I am
reviewing the Smashbox create and
transform palette you probably see me if
you follow me on Instagram and snapchat
I have been talking about this palette
over the course of the past week week
and a half or so I've been playing with
it I've been trying to do a lot of
different looks it's most definitely not
the kind of palette that you could just
like try on once and whip out a review
and not that's my style anyway but this
palette does so much you really have to
spend some time with it so this is a $65
palette and that is kind of how smashbox
rolls with these master class palettes I
own a handful of these different
palettes that they've done over the
years they're very solidly constructed
they're very good quality lots of
product inside but as a result of all
that I think you're going to pay a
decently hefty price tag but I think
when you start breaking it all down and
seeing all the things that you've got
inside it really doesn't seem that
ridiculous you know but lately when
they've been putting out these palettes
they seem to have a little bit of a
theme and so this one is called create
and transform and the packaging as I
said it's solid as a rock you're not
going to be worried about this really
cracking or breaking like it's really
solid has this kind of film strip design
on the outside and then you open it up
it does have a magnetic closure on it it
opens to be completely flat so if you
want to lay this on a table it's going
to lay flat and then it contains four
pop-out palettes one is of eyeshadows
one is of the transformer shades for
both cheeks and eyes you've got a
contour and cheek palette here and then
a lip palette and these all actually if
you look closely at them these have that
kind of film strip detail on the
outsides too which is very cute and they
pop out really easily the back said
Smashbox they do completely closed as
well so if you wanted to just throw one
of these in a makeup bag individually
you wouldn't be worried about it doesn't
have to live in this Smashbox talent so
you guys know that concept is already
speaking to me here because suddenly
you've taken something that's kind of
bulky and made it super duper portable
for a person's specific needs so I'm
into that at first with the eyeshadows I
thought okay they're giving you some
rich eyeshadow shade
and they're giving you some pastels like
what's really so special about this what
is interesting about the transforming
shades now that I've used them quite a
bit is that they all have their own kind
of unique shift to them I would say with
the exception of this lightest white
color which I actually prefer to use as
a cheek highlight I mean I wouldn't say
prefer it's fine on the eyes as well but
if anything is going to really highlight
the cheeks it's going to be this shade
and then your gold and your peach pink
lilac and light blue each have like a
little bit of a color shift to them and
that's what makes them interesting when
paired with these other eye shadows up
top here specifically the shades that
have shimmer in them if you go put in
one of these transforming shades on top
of them that you know it might lighten
them up a little bit but we're the real
transformation we're the real
interesting color shift and twist
happens is when you layer any of these
transforming shades which all have a
certain amount of shimmer to them on top
of the shimmery shade from this row and
then like really cool things happen I
mean you can just go nuts play with
different color combos you're going to
get an interesting look no matter how
you slice it but we're going to back up
a little bit and I think the way I want
to attack this review is going just kind
of section by section of this palette
I'll just go in the order that I would
put them on because I'm going to have
demos to accompany everything here so
the first thing I would do after
applying some foundation and some
concealer and whatnot I would go to this
cheek palette portion of it and you're
getting two blessed shapes one is guava
and what is rosy and these seem to have
just a little bit of a satiny finish
it's not like screamin at you but it's
not a 100% matte blush and then you have
the contour bronze and highlight and
this is a matte kind of buttery colored
highlight and I've talked about their
contour and highlight stuff for so long
they actually make this individually in
just a trio of products and it's great
it's wonderful quality really nicely
pigmented shades like I have no gripes
about the way Smashbox does their
powders they're really nice these are
going to be all Mac and so what I first
did I went in with the contour shade and
just contour my cheekbones I also like
to take that shade actually incumbent
with a little bit of the bronze and use
that around my hairline and then just
use some of the bronze on its own to
warm up my skintone overall I think that
works really well I am like I said
familiar with these products I love to
see them include them in their larger
palettes because they are just top-notch
great powder contouring products I used
the guava shade as my blush today and it
just gave this really pretty kind of
peachy tone pop to the cheeks as far as
this highlight shade this will brighten
up the skin in a sort of a similar way
to a laura geller baked french vanilla
type product this also because it lacks
shimmer and a pearlescent type shine
that works really well as an under eye
setting powder also as I said very
velvety texture with these it doesn't
take a lot of these powders to get the
job done so keep that in mind you may
want to tap off the excess that's on
your brush so just a light bit of that
you know on the tops of your cheeks or
around your t-zone can be kind of
brightening then I went to the
transforming pallet and you do have to
cheek transformers one is called amp it
and what is called fuse blown this is
AMPA and fuse blown and these both have
some shimmer I don't see these as
pronounced like highlights I guess
nothing couldn't use them that way but
on me I don't feel like I get the most
out of them in that manner first I
thought that was what they were going to
be but now I see that they're very much
like a layering tool so you can take
either one of those layer them over the
other blushes and kind of change the
shade you do make it a little more glowy
because these are glowy colors here so
for example I use the more peachy color
as my blush and decided to shift it a
little bit with the more pinky toned
transformer shade and I thought I'd got
a really cool look out of that you could
also do the rosy colored blush go over
it with this and it's kind of a very
similar shade to a NARS orgasm type
blush so you can play around use
different amounts of the blushes paired
with different amounts of these because
these do get off some color on the skin
that's why they're not necessarily a
pure bright highlight they do offer some
pigment but also kind of an interesting
shine as far as this whole transforming
concept goes with this palette for me
it's most fun with the eye shadows the
cheek idea you know yes you can do some
cool things with it your
Asians aren't quite as widespread as
they are with the eyeshadows and you can
do some lip transforming stuff as well
but the shadows are definitely like the
coolest feature for me first just a
standard eyeshadow palette I mean this
is a great eye shadow palette you look
at the price tag of this whole thing and
you're thinking $65 but you're getting
like full-sized eyeshadow shades in here
and a 10 color palette and Smashbox I
love their formula so I'm pretty much
gaga over what's happening here in this
palette it is a matte and shimmer mix so
you've got a matte shade I think this is
their vanilla color here you've got a
light brown a deeper brown and then a
matte plum the black here has a little
bit of like an iridescent sparkle to it
it kind of shifts purple and blueish
colored little bitty sparkles that
doesn't show up very obviously on the
eyes your really shimmery shades in here
are going to be this peachy color it's
interesting kind of pewter color this I
have not played with on my eyes yet but
just in swatching I've tried layering
some of the Transformers over that and
it's stunning I can't wait to use that
sorry tickle in my nose I feel like I'm
gonna sneeze at any moment here I've got
this coppery shade shimmery kind of
peacock blue it makes me think of a pika
for whatever reason and this pretty mom
like mix of pink and purple and then as
I said the black has like a very micro
shimmery particle in it then alongside
those colors you've got the transforming
shadows which can be used on their own
or you can layer them over or under some
of these other shadows and like I said
when you're pairing any of these with
any of these shimmery shades that's
where I see the biggest effect like they
really play with each other nicely color
wise so you've got a white kind of a
gold soft golden a yellow shades the
peachy color has kind of a golden tone
to it when it hits the light a really
pretty pink that has almost a cool light
lackey Sheen to it a purple when that
hits the light it almost twists a little
bit toward the blue side and then the
blue kind of reverses it it's almost
it's like when you look down the line
the next color shifts a little bit in
the direction of the one that follows it
but then blue comes back and almost has
a little bit of a purpley look that
gives me kind of
boy stur like feel I don't know as I've
topped it off with some of the deeper
shades that blue is gorgeous but I'm
going to show you that I look that I'm
wearing today and I'll talk about a few
others that I've done also but the way I
like to start especially if I know I
want to do kind of a fun statement
transforming thing on the lid I get the
matte neutrals out of the way first in
the crease so I use the lighter matte
Brown just all throughout the crease to
start building some definition there I
also picked up some of the deeper brown
and use that mainly in my outermost
corner and then all over my lid
I used this shimmery kind of plumbing
mauve shade and I just patted that all
over my lid and then I decided to work
just with a small brush a little bit of
the matte plum into my crease just to
tie all that together another thing I
love to do with this palette is take the
coppery shade and use it kind of as a
transition color you might look at that
and think it's way too shimmery for that
no absolutely not when this is sheared
out it's just a gorgeous transition
there and then I use the vanilla shade
as my highlight up under the brow so
we've laid the foundation now the fun
begins you can use these transformers
with a brush or your finger I like it
either way but I chose to take a little
bit of that blue and just tap it on the
center of my lid overlapping the plumy
mauve shade and you get this really
pretty like lilac twist to the look and
then I even went around my inner corner
with that bluish color as well like I
said these can all be standalone shadows
if you want them to be but they're so
pretty paired on top of some of these
deeper shimmery shades one of the first
looks that I did I didn't even really
mess with you so much and I just did
kind of a plummy you know eye look with
this one palette and that was pretty
really loved the look and got so much
great feedback on the look that I did
where I pulled in this shade on the lid
and I also went over that with the blue
and that created this just really cool
effect kind of like the inside of a
seashell or something did a quick look
with this palette just using some of the
most natural shades at this end I can
see a lot of people using it in that way
if you just don't really have time for
all the transformation and then today's
look so so happy with this this might be
one of my favorites they claim that with
the eyes there are 76 plus eyeshadow
possibilities just showing you different
Durham's that you can get with these
shades and when you think about it if
you just use the white shifting shade in
varying amounts with these different
rich shadows that are in this top pallet
here and you could get a number of looks
but then when you start pulling in like
these tinted iridescent shades it's like
a whole world of options there and what
I also like about the transforming
palette because it comes out so easily
you could go traveling with you know a
pallet you just love to use on its own
and then take the transforming pallet
with you and you can layer those on top
of any eyeshadows that you have so
that's really cool to me I love the
option to lift out the pallet so last
part is a look left pallet in the thing
is the lip palate so with this they've
labeled three shades as Transformers
although with any lip palette isn't any
color a transformer really like any way
you choose to blend it it can kind of go
that way but this transformer shade
called bankrolled is like a sheer black
it looks like pure black here but when
you swatch it you can see there's some
Sheerness to it and that is what
actually makes it work to transform a
shade without completely covering it up
right you wouldn't want that to be an
opaque black then you've got this lilac
with like a blue tone shimmer in it
that's very transformative in a cool way
and then a warm tone transformer with
this peachy shade that has more of a
golden shimmer in it and then these
three shades which I believe this is all
their be legendary lipstick formula
you've got an audition red rage and
witchy this is like a really deep wine
color and then this is the every woman's
dusty rose nude and there are so many
times where I go full on with the eyes
with this calyx I'm just so excited
about the eye transformation and then
I'm left kind of going pretty light or
neutral with the lips just because I
don't want to take away from the eyes
now so that's kind of what happened
today I find myself oftentimes starting
with audition and then using one or two
of these other shades along with it so
today I started with audition and I used
a little bit of the bankrolled color
just on the outside to start to deepen
the shade a little bit and actually
shift it away from being so much of a
dusty rose and turn it a little bit more
of a taupe color so I thought that was
kind of interesting alongside the
I look and everything I really like the
other day was just combining these two
shades you know you bring in varying
levels of red you're not rocking like
the pure red lip that you make this
shade a little more rosy you can make
anything more berry with this color and
then these shades you know let's just
take a little bit of this purple right
now and just use that a bit here these
transforming shades are sheer enough to
where you know you really do see the
other color underneath that you can just
kind of change the way the look is
hitting the light you know with that
lilac or the peachy one right here so
the lips are fun I would say my favorite
aspect of this in terms of satisfaction
and fun and just playing with new shades
would be the eyeshadows this lip palette
I mean I love that they've made an
effort to make all of these you know so
portable but there are I think three
things that make a lip palette something
that you may actually take in your
person use number one is size number two
is a mirror and number three is
containing an actual brush in here that
you don't have to fish around your purse
for separately with this you are going
to have to use your own brush with it
there is no mirror size-wise it's super
travel friendly but I am kind of lacking
those other elements there that make me
really want to pop this out and put it
in my bag you know like I may start the
day with a lip look from this but then
ultimately I'm going to pull something
actually handy from my collection to
throw in my person go with so just
something to keep in mind there but on
the whole I'm really really impressed
with this palette I mean I love the
quality of Smashbox as powder products I
like their lip colors that they've put
in here as well but I found myself
getting surprised over and over again
with how special these transforming
shades actually are because it kind of
might strike you almost as a gimmick at
first like do I need these special
shades can I just find those particular
colors in my collection but they've made
them like just the right finish just the
right color twists happening within
these shades that makes topping them off
on top of these other shades so so
interesting so who is this for out there
I mean if you like to play with your
looks if you're trying to get yourself a
little bit more out of the box with your
eyeshadow looks I think this is fun
because none of these shade
you'll notice are necessarily shouting
from the rooftops like neons or anything
super crazy like that and that's what I
really like about it color wise I'm
getting shades here that I actually
would use and then I get to put my own
little creative twist on it but you'll
notice it's very much in my wheelhouse
of wearable color so that really means
something to me I'm very happy about the
color selection the cheek palette you
know everything's here for me I love
that like I said I actually go to this
white shade or even this yellowy shade
as a highlight on my skin if you want
the pronounced highlight these shades
here are going to add glow on top of the
blushes but not really replace a super
glowy highlight if that's what you want
I certainly have a lot of fun with the
lip color layering as well though like I
said the eyes have kind of taken
priority for me so if you like to play I
think you're going to love this
who is this not for if you're looking at
this and thinking not another step
please if you're thinking like I just
want to do the bare minimum get my
eyeshadow look done and be gone or maybe
you're just not a huge eye shadow person
in general I shadows are kind of like
half the palette here so it may not be
for you and there are days that I'm in
such a hurry I would look at this and
say please no like it's a no eye shadow
day is the only mascara day for me right
now like there are times when this is a
bit much for me
the only thing speaking to you is the
cheek stuff right down here you can get
you know their contour products
individually if you love and appreciate
a good magnetic closure come to mama you
know it's great for me it's getting to
thumbs up I say thank you to Smashbox
for another well-thought-out palette
something that has so many usable
elements very practical with the lift
out idea there I hope they continue to
do that with these master class palettes
but thank you guys so much for your time
thank you for requesting this video and
I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
