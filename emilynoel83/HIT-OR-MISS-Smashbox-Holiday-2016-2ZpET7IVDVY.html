couple of sets from Smashbox for the
holiday season
they are the lighted up collection so
some really packaging here I've got the
lighted up LA lights palette contour
blush and highlight and then I'll also
be talking about the lighted up 3
palette set which has eyes contour and
lips and the way these palettes are on
the outside this is just a little like
sleeve that pulls right off so you've
got this flat clear top and that will
totally come off all together the inner
tray that holds the product will come
out so you do end up with a usable kind
of hard plastic box there which I first
thought gosh this stuff is way over
packaged and I still kind of feel that
way but at the same time I think that
could do pretty well in my like shallow
storage type drawers so both of the
palettes are that way so starting off
with the 3 palette set its $45 I got
both of these palettes or both of these
sets at Ulta by the way and this is what
it amounts to it's really a very small
amount of product you get these little
palettes they're very brightly colored I
feel like this is a true sampler type
collection for Smashbox because you're
getting to try the photo op eyeshadow
formula you're getting their contour
products which are the same quality with
one slight difference I noticed in one
of these products overall same formula
as their little contour palette which I
really love and then you get six lip
products in this lip palette and they
are all actual lipsticks that you could
buy full-size from the be legendary
lipstick line the bottom three are matte
the top three are just the standard
cream finish so in your little eye
palette it is the photo op eyeshadow
formula I've talked about loving this
shadow formula for years I feel like
it's creamy smooth pigmented really like
the way the products blend across the
eyes it's definitely one of my top
favorite eyeshadow formulas and while
these pans are small it is a nice
sampling of what they had to offer the
shade you're getting are vanilla and
totally nude
now vanilla was in the master class 3
palette and totally nude was in there
recent lighting theory palette just FYI
it was were the only two that I found in
recent pallets from Smashbox then you've
got another mat down here with dark
cocoa very very like nearly black brown
and then up here in the center is
flamingo it's kind of a shimmery peach
and russet your shimmery brown down here
in the center bottom is amethyst which
is like a shimmery medium purple and the
sparkle in it is kind of gold tone so
that's rather pretty I do find the
quality of these shadows to be
consistent with what I expect from
Smashbox and I did a little demo for you
I put on some eye primer first and then
I went in with the shade called russet
and I took that back and forth
throughout the crease even though it has
a little shimmer it kind of makes a nice
mid-tone crease color and then I padded
vanilla on the inner part of my eye and
I also use that as a highlight under the
brow and I went in with my deepest shade
which is dark cocoa and use that in my
outer corner and just the outer part of
my crease also took that shade with a
pencil brush just under my lower lash
line and blended that in smudged it out
quite a bit and then used russet as well
on the inner part of my lower lash line
then it's kind of a transition for the
look I pulled in flamingo right on the
border just warming up the upper edge of
my eye look and then I finish things off
with some black liquid liner some nude
liner in the lower inner rim and I have
on some salon perfect 615 false lashes
so a very basic look from this palette
Chado quality overall is really good
happy with the pigmentation I've worked
with the photo op formula quite a bit
and I don't really have any complaints
honestly the little eye palette is
probably my favorite part of this trio
of products in here because well I love
the contour products absolutely love
this is what it looks like full-size I
love this it's great to have these three
matte shades one is nice and cool one a
little bit warmer you can easily mix
those shades kind of get your perfect
custom contour color or use them
separately and then the matte creamy
color is just dynamite the only
difference I've noticed between that
palette and what they're giving you in
this collection is that the creamy shade
is a little less like buttery in tone
a little less yellow in this shade I
don't really mind that but just you know
a heads up that's the only difference I
saw but another big difference is just
the size and that does make it kind of
difficult when you're putting in you
know full-size face brushes into these
products and not everybody's contouring
with just a tiny brush that's like that
wide so I found that as I was using this
I even used a smallish contour brush
which is from Sigma and I was able to
get in there okay but I found I was
paying attention to not just stamping it
in the product once but really making
sure I got my brush evenly covered so I
wasn't going to end up with a streaky
look on my cheeks so they've got good
quality product in here in just a format
that makes it slightly more difficult to
use I think because what if I want to
use a nice full brush in there with the
bronzer like I did in my demo you know
you've just got to watch it a little bit
more if you want that brush evenly
coated with product and you don't want
to get into one of the things on the
other side and then the light shade like
I said I think this is a great formula
it's a nice brightening type of powder I
could see some people even using this
lightly
as an under-eye setting type product
it's really smooth really pigmented but
it doesn't seem chocky on the skin so I
love the formula I was just when I saw
how tiny it was I knew it was going to
be a bit of an issue for application and
then the last part of this kit is the
lip palate and everything in here is
actually a full-size or available in a
full-size single lipstick so I do think
it's nice to have that as a little
sampler type thing here however if I'm
honest with myself I know that when
things come in little it's rarely do
they get taken with me places like I
know it's just not the easiest most
convenient touch-up type thing as just
throwing in a lipstick or lip gloss in
my purse you know it's just never gonna
quite match up the one brand that I've
seen really do a lip product or a lip
palette right recently and I'll probably
talk about this in an upcoming video is
Urban Decay they put out a couple of lip
palettes they enclosed within those lip
palettes their own lip brush and
everything was just so nicely put
together and well thought out here I
realize just a little palette you know
what really can they do I don't know
I could've shoved a lip brush in there
somewhere but that alone would have made
it I think a little more handy for me
let's go through the shades here you're
getting cognac up here which is your
most neutral of the bunch and these
again the top three or creamy and then
you've got pretty social right next to
that which is a soft pink and then
inspiration which I'm wearing on my lips
mostly today and that's that creamy hot
pink and on your lower level these are
all three matte finishes you got first
time jam on it and Bing
so Bing is a nice bright red jam on it I
kind of mixed in with my lip look today
a little bit just to add I don't know a
little bit of depth on the outsides but
the formula is fine you know even the
creamy shades aren't like too too creamy
to where they feel like they're just
going on streaky or like there's
something that's greasy that's gonna
just drift outside the lips so the
formula is nice the color selection I
mean I feel like you've got three kind
of softer shades and then three more
bold shades I just know that for me
personally if they would have put in
like miniature lipsticks into this kit
instead of a lip palette I probably
would be reaching for those things a lot
more and definitely enjoy the
portability of those more so this is
kind of tough because it's a good
sampling of smashbox products but i
don't really love the way it's all
executed I mean the contour products are
great the eyeshadow is really great as
well the lip products you know it's a
good formula but you're just not getting
a lot of product overall you have to be
really pretty careful with the
application on the contour product and
how often am I really going to take this
little lip palette with me somewhere
even though it is a very like compact
purse friendly size what about the lip
brush and am I really realistically
going to use it for me like I said the
eye palettes fine I would have enjoyed
this set more if they went with a
slightly larger size palette for the
contour and then maybe made the lips
individual lip products instead of a
palette make your own decisions you've
seen the information I've been able to
provide here but that's just my take now
let's talk a little bit about the LA
lights palette so that again is coming
in this big kind of boxy form at $39 and
this is the palette that you end up with
so pretty streamlined looking palette
actually and I think the size is in here
are super super generous if you are a
fan of matte blushes
and you also like your highlights to be
pretty much on the muted side I think
you may really enjoy what's happening in
this palette because I find that these
blushes are nicely pigmented they have
the intensity that you would expect from
like the rich row everything in this far
row is rich rich coral rich very rich
bronze and then you've got true coral
true pink berry and true flush and then
highlight coral highlight berry and
highlight gold we got a giant mirror up
top which I really enjoy and I just like
the tones I feel like I could wear every
shade in this palette you know granted
the rich side I would probably be a
little bit more light handed with
because those are deeper and I think a
little more pigmented I've really been
bouncing around this palette a lot
lately and I do think it's a lot of fun
I mean you look at the corals with your
rich coral it's even more like a deep
orange coral the true coral is like a
pinky peach and then your highlight
coral is that shimmery peach again the
only products with shimmer in this whole
palette is the stuff happening in the
highlight room and then down to the
berry row you know that rich berry is a
nice rich color that really would stand
out on deeper skin tones a true pink
berry is gorgeous a great everyday color
and then highlight very is just this
soft pink with a little hint of a golden
glow in that shade and then the bottom
now this is referred to as a contour
blush and highlight palette the shade
you get in the bottom here is rich
bronze and in terms of the way Smashbox
does their whole contour bronzer type
idea it's most similar to that Center
shade in this palette which is their
bronze shade so while I call it a
contour palette they're really only
giving you the shade labeled bronze
which is really not the shade I would
use to contour with most often and this
specific color swatched up against the
bronze the center shade in this palette
this is actually even a little bit
warmer still so I feel like you're just
getting one bronzer shade I wouldn't
rely on this necessarily to be a contour
and blush palette and I do think that
limits this palette somewhat because for
the size if you're thinking about taking
this somewhere toting it around I'd like
to think that it was every cheek product
I would possibly need you know but I do
think it kind of leaves out a true
contour that a lot of people would be
happy with anyway moving along you
true flush here which is a gorgeous more
neutral a little bit peachy but overall
the most neutral looking blush of the
bunch and then highlight gold is
definitely the boldest highlight of
these three but they're still all very
subtle I mean I only see the coral and
the berry as really working for me as
like a blush topper if I decide I want
one of these matte blushes to come
across a little more glowy I may just go
right over the top with one of these and
it will give it a very softened glow but
it's nothing super bold where I feel
like I could put just a little bit of it
right on the top of my cheek and have a
really noticeable highlight there
they're just so soft and even the gold
is soft too so I'll show you what I did
today I used the true pink berry as my
blush so I just used a standard blush
brush with that put it exactly where I
would normally apply blush I thought it
looked really pretty and then I used the
highlight berry like I said just kind of
over the top to show you how I might add
a little more glow on top of one of the
matte products and then with a smaller
brush I used highlight gold to go right
on top of the cheeks and as you can see
even though I'm really spotlighting and
concentrating that color right there on
top of the cheekbone it's still
relatively subtle so if you're going for
bold glam you know really reflect the
light type of highlighters that's not
really what's in here so keep that in
mind also I feel like the palette is
lacking a true contour shade not that
you couldn't make this work but given
what I know about Smashbox and the
different products they've put out for
contouring this is one of their much
warmer tones but I really can't pick
apart you know the quality of these
blushes they're so pigmented they're so
nice but yet I don't feel like I've got
to watch myself that much just mainly on
the rich coral and the rich berry shades
you're really getting a generous amount
of product in the pans and I think
overall this is the kind of palette for
people who want some blush variety you
like your matte blushes and if you do
ever use a highlight you like it to be
really on the subtle side that's the
crowd who I think will benefit from this
palette most so those are the things
that I've been experimenting with from
Smashbox this holiday line I don't think
anything really jumped out to me as
being like the perfect gift product or
the perfect palette smashbox definitely
has
some quality things out there not my
favorite things of this holiday season
this time around but good products if
you want to know the best product from
Smashbox is line in terms of a really
great gift it's probably their lighting
Theory palette I already have a full
review on this so I'll link to it below
but this is shadow blush cream
correctors cream contours cream
highlights it's got a buttload of things
to experiment with a fantastic eyeshadow
selection in here too and just a really
well-constructed palette more expensive
no doubt than the other two sets but I
kind of feel like this is the thing
that's got the most going for it so
thank you guys so much for your time
today I really appreciate it and I will
see you soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
