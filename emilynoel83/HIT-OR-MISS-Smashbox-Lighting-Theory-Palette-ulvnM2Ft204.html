I'm going to be talking about this big
old thing this is from Smashbox it's
called the lighting Theory palette it's
part of their whole like a master class
series which I've talked about those
kinds of palettes before these large
palettes that almost look like a big
binder and they open up and you've got a
couple of sides each one covered by a
plastic panel here the palettes
themselves actually lift out if you
wanted to lay them flat on the table or
this lays flat and then generally these
palettes are accompanied by little
handouts like these instructional sheets
that can help you figure out exactly how
to use everything but if you've been
with my channel for a while you know
I've had pretty good things to say about
smash boxes photo op eyeshadow formula
which tends to be contained in these
kinds of palettes and also just you know
the master class idea in general I have
really enjoyed these kinds of products
so when I saw that not too long ago this
became available on sephora's website
$65 so again it's not a cheap product
but there is a lot packed in here I
thought maybe my viewers will be curious
as to what I think about this so
basically with this lighting Theory
palette you've got half of the palette
devoted to cream face products and then
over here you've got all powders your
three powder blushes at the bottom and
then a bunch of eyeshadows now I've only
had this palette and been working with
this palette for about a month so I
can't really say exactly how long these
creams are going to stay fresh and
creamy and wonderful but I can say that
I have had other smashbox palettes that
have contained creams that are very very
old i'm thinking back to that red
palette that came out on QVC and i've
kept that not really for use but just to
have because I love that palette so much
it was one of the best makeup releases
of all time that thing contains so much
stuff in one and it did have creams and
some of those creams are still creamy so
I do think Smashbox understands how to
put a product in these palettes that is
going to have some longevity for you and
stay creamy but anyway the creams that
are in here are for color correctors a
contour bronze and highlight shades that
are all creams and then you've got three
different tones
kriem highlights like i said over here
three powder blushes across the bottom
and sixteen eyes shadows that are in the
photo op formula even though I mean this
seems to be the least amount of shadows
in a master class palette that I've seen
normally they're kind of split side to
side in some former fashion I absolutely
love the color selection that ended up
in this one you know plenty of mattes in
all of the tones where you really want
math you know your matte black your
matte dark brown you've also got a full
row of matte basics right across the top
and you know this nice matte cool grey
down below it and then fun shimmers a
couple pops of what I find to be very
wearable easy color so I think that's
cool but one thing overall I think you
got ask yourself about this palette is
am I going to use it actually because
well I think this is an awesome quality
palette and I have tons of good things
to say about the different formulas the
way they apply all this and that if
you're one who says I'm just not going
to use the color correctors because I'm
not into that or I don't do cream
contouring or I'm never into cream
highlighting if you go more for powders
with your contour and highlight and you
don't think you'll use that whole chunk
of the palette I mean that's a lot of
the palette going unused and it may not
be worth the $65 to you to things that
will get the least use from me out of
this palette will be the lavender and
the green color correctors it's not that
they're not you know a workable formula
or something I could you know blend with
other shades to deepen up or change the
tone of I could still make them work if
I absolutely needed to use them but it's
just not the type of thing I'm going to
be prone to reaching for I love my
peachy correctors I do enjoy these cream
contours these are nice too also one
little critique on these Luminizer 's if
you are looking for absolutely like
glass type shine on your skin these are
more subtle than that they're not the
type of highlight that looks like
glitter they're not the kind of thing
that you lay on and you're going to see
a big streak of on your skin they are
just a subtle highlight I think
consistency is huge when it comes to any
kind of cream product on your face
whether it's a concealer especially with
like cream contouring products these go
dark so if you're going to be you know
anywhere from a fair skin tone possibly
using this
all the way to someone much deeper you
know this has got to be able to blend
you don't want to be putting a streak of
that contour on someone with super light
skin and feel like you can't get it
totally blended out or you can't just
use a tiny bit of it and have that be
effective you know what I mean it's got
to be workable and very easy to blend
into the skin and the consistency of all
of these products is so so easy I mean I
did not feel like I had to work hard at
all I didn't feel like I was messing up
my foundation underneath to get my
contour blended out or go over the top
of it with some cream bronzer you know
that all happened very easily same with
the highlights you know they're very
lightweight they don't feel like thick
heavy creams on the skin and you don't
have to use a lot of them another thing
I really love that they put in here is
the fact that this highlight is just
like a matte sort of skin tone concealer
type color so you can use that if you
need to lighten up the peach or you know
you're doing some mixing here and you
wanted to lighten up your contour shade
you know you could dab into that a
little bit and sort of adjust the tone
and you'll kind of see how I work with
that in the demo but I just want you to
know I find the creams really nice
really easy to work with the photo-op
shadows the powder blushes those were
really less questionable for me going
into this because I knew you know if
they really stayed true to their photo
while by shadow formula I would love
them and I do there's truly not one that
turned out to be less than I expected
just judging by the way they look I mean
they are what you see is what you get
and the blushes are wonderful too you're
getting two matte blushes here with
candlelight and spectrum so candlelight
is a little more plenty deep mauve
spectrum the one I'm wearing today is a
little bit more like a dusty peach and
then this middle one carnation has been
in past pallets and that's kind of a
shimmery soft pink as far as the shadows
here that we're in like the master class
3 palette there were only three repeats
that I found and that is nectar which is
this peachy matte shade black out a
matte black and Sumatra which is your
dark matte Brown so three very basic
shades I'm not really surprised that
they're in here and I'm frankly glad
that they're in this palette because
those are all the types of shades that I
would want to see in here just for basic
everyday use so I do want to show you
some swatches row by row I'm say
and totally nude nectar almond your
basic mats are all in the top row almond
and totally nude are perfect soft crease
colors then in the next row you've got
truffle which is a nice cool matte shade
Lightwave seems like a mix of rose gold
and taupe it's so pretty sunrise is a
great gold sunlight that pretty peach
next row you've got optics that's kind
of like dirty topi bronze metallic
violet gorgeous metallic bronzes
beautiful metallic brick this nice deep
copper and then some really rich deep
shades in your last row with nocturnal
which is a gorgeous navy blackout in
Sumatra your basic deep mattes and then
back light is this pretty dark burgundy
plum I wanted to just briefly show you
how I like to use this palette so I
started with a very light foundation
already on my skin I was wearing the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi so not too much
would get covered up and I like to just
start out with that peach corrector on
the under eye dabbing that all around
that area and then if I've got some
extra deep spots I may Pat a little bit
of the actual orange shade on top of it
and then I can just blend that out with
a brush Sigma p84 is just really easy or
you can use your Beauty Blender type
sponges to blend this out the contour
shade has the potential to go very deep
and dark and you can get that right
there in your cheekbones around your
hairline super easy to blend I did that
with my Real Techniques contour brush
which is just perfect for blending you
know these smaller areas the bronze is
very easy to work with as well I find
myself using this a bit more sparingly
maybe a little across the forehead tops
of the cheeks it even can make a pretty
like natural blush type shade you can
use the highlight shade to further
brighten areas on the under eye or like
I said use that as a mixer shape
customize the peach or the orange or
whatever you're using to lighten it up
the consistency of these creams is not
cream to powder and I do like that it's
a nice sweet spot of having creamy
products that are rich pigmented easy to
blend they don't come off looking dry on
the skin but they're not too goopy but
at least for me I think they can stand
to be set with a little bit of powder so
I will go on the under-eye
you can bake that area if you want to
you can do a little dusting and powder
all over the skin if you like to do that
or if you like to keep powder out of
your look entirely you know you be the
judge I'm just kind of showing you the
way this works into my life here but
moving right over to the powders I use
spectrum today which I think it's an
interesting shade if you're questioning
like what blush should I wear with this
look that blush I think would work with
any look and then if I'm going to use a
cream highlight I like to top off at
this point with that type of product so
I chose luminous cool that's probably my
favorite of the highlights and use my
small stipple brush just dab that right
on top of the cheeks could not be easier
to work with you could definitely use
your fingers with these two they blend
so easily and then I just wanted to take
you guys through this eye look as well
just to give you a little idea of how
these apply I put on my Milani eyeshadow
primer and then I use this totally nude
shade which I love for the softest of
soft crease colors it's beautiful in
there and I like kind of doing that step
because when I go in then with anything
darker in the crease it just blends more
easily
I applied nectar a really really soft
peach shade as my highlight up under the
brow I padded sunlight all over the lid
beautiful peachy shade love and then I
took metallic violet also with the small
shadow brush and patted that on the
outer corner of the eye and up into the
crease it's kind of throwing back to my
bare minerals happy place quad love the
combo of peach and plum and I love that
that in this palette I also smudged a
little bit of the metallic violet on the
lower lash line and I just I love this
look I love that particular combo of
shades I finished things off with a
little nude liner in the lower inner rim
black liquid liner on the upper lash
line some mascara some lashes and that's
the look like I said before even though
there's a smaller amount of eyeshadows
in this collection I really love
everything that's in here gorgeous
shades some unique shades some little
interesting shimmery pops but all the
matte basics a person could need truly
there are little folder areas in the
front and back of this palette so you've
got color correcting explained
contouring and highlighting explained
and strobing so where to use your ultra
shimmery shades in this palette and then
you've got four I two two
real typeface charts that say magic our
daylight office hours and night time so
each one of those looks very different
from the next and it does suggest
different blushes to pair what those eye
looks also so I got to give it up the
Smashbox they have created yet another
very well thought out palette that I
think combines so much into one from a
practical standpoint these kind of
palettes are so heavy-duty I really
don't see anything breaking in them or
the palette itself breaking and there's
just a lot contained into one it can be
very space-saving for you when you think
about what all of these things could
take up space wise if they were in
individual compacts and individual
palettes I think the thing to keep in
the back of your mind is I rave on and
on about these things is am I actually
going to use everything that's in here
if you are I say go for it you're going
to love this I truly don't think
anything in here quality wise is going
to disappoint you but thank you guys so
so much for watching this review I hope
it helped you out and I wanted to tell
you also what's on my lips I'm wearing
the Burt's Bees jumbo stick in Niagra
over looks so kind of a Coralie matte
type shade and then I topped it with
this metallic gloss and this is San
Tropez from honest hacia that little
summer lip kit all righty my memory card
space says it's time to go I'll talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
