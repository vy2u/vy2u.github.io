joining me today the topic here is
profusion if that name sounds familiar
profusion palates seem to be lurking
around in the drug stores every year
around this time I feel like Walgreens
is the main place where I've turned up
products from this brand before they've
got this whole massive amount of holiday
pallets and they might not even really
say out loud profusion and big letters
on them they just look like kind of
generic holiday type drugstore pallets
right but then you look closely and it's
like okay it's this profusion brand
that's putting it out well they seem to
be officially coming out in target now
with what's been sent to me and so I
want to go through everything for you in
this video try some things on and let
you know what I think okay so I've got
my foundation concealer and powder on
right now and we're gonna jump into this
little brow palette so you open this guy
up and it has a hair in it don't worry
it's my hair I've already been playing
with this but this is the 8 piece brown
makeup palette it says so all your
powders are across the top there is like
a beige highlight powder right here and
then all of these brow shades they range
from medium brown to soft brown
chocolate and ash brown soft brown has a
little more warmth to it and there's
also an ash brown brow pencil and then
you've also got a little double-ended
guy here with the angled brush and the
spoolie so I think what I'm gonna do is
actually use a little bit of the pencil
first and this is actually an OK pencil
at least for my coloring and what no
it's just kind of one of those Universal
topi colored pencils it's nothing
fabulous like it's it's a little on the
dry side but I do kind of like that I
don't like when pencils deposit like way
too much product in my brows because
I've got a lot of brow hair
so just a little filling with the pencil
or you know you could totally skip the
pencil if you wanted to and then I'm
gonna take my angled brush here and go
into the wax this is just a quick little
demo of how I would use wax and powder
to go through my brows and I used to do
this all the time if you remember the
two-faced brow Envy palette that's
basically what that palette was at the
little wax and then all the powders and
it is a really I think easy way to fill
in your brows especially if you're just
getting started with any sort of brow
filling process I think powders and wax
is a really great way to do it and then
I'm gonna use this medium brown right
here this is a really topi shade and I'm
gonna start with that again with just
that angled side of the brush and just
go through my brows like this then
around like my arch to the end of my
brow might go toward a deeper shade like
chocolate
and then you do have that little spoolie
wand at the end to brush everything
through this is mostly a cool palette
and really beyond just this shade right
here I think it's a little more suited
to brunettes unless they make another
whole shade of this palette that I'm not
aware of but they make it seem like it's
just an eight-piece brow palette with no
real identification as blonde or
brunette or whatever so for me if this
filled in my brows just fine I mean the
pencil was good it's not gonna be like
as finally tipped as a brow Wiz type
pencil it's just a standard pencil you
know so very basic there but the powders
are nicely pigmented they will show up
in your brows and the wax does help them
cling and also you do have this shade
right here which is a very pigmented
matte powder if you wanted to use that
as more of an under brow highlight I'm
going to be using eye shadows today but
that is in their brow palette by the way
is $6.99 and now we're gonna move on to
this $9.99 blush and bronzer so a pretty
large sized palette here and the overall
theme on these palettes seems to be like
a rose gold print and trim and they do
include a little brush here it's
actually not unusable sort of a fluffy
soft not too dense brush that maybe you
could use for some contour or some
highlight it probably wouldn't use this
for blush but this is included in this
palette and also I think the highlighter
palette now I know when I did my Tarte
video I talked about a lot of blush
palettes and I sort of complain like you
know it's only blush and I wish they put
in some other things to make the
palettes a little bit more multitasking
and just do a little more for me and a
lot of you guys said in the comment
section like if it's a blush palette I
only want Bush so to each their own on
that standpoint but the reason why I do
kind of like this palette here is
because they have blushes and they have
a good range of them to that got like
neutral II kind of blushes more rosy
ones a peach bright pink you've got kind
of a gold any highlight something that
says light bronzer and medium bronzer so
it's more than just a blush palette and
so I kind of like that I'm going to go
into the light bronzer here and just
take this kind of around my hairline I
might dip in yeah
a little bit to that medium bronzer as
well I feel like I kind of have to use a
lot of these that's the thing the
bronzers are not necessarily a little
goes a long way product for me with
these pallets and it kind of surprised
me because the blushes are that way like
they're really pigmented it doesn't take
much to stand out and there's another
palette that they have that combines
like a lot of different things and I
thought wow the bronzers are really
subtle in here these and this palette
turned out to be a little bit deeper but
I still kind of have to build them up
more than I expected it's almost a
feeling as though when I put them on and
buff them in with the brush somehow I'm
blending them away instead of blending
them into my skin you know then for
blush I think I'm gonna use this color
right here called blush just because I
think that's sort of one of those
exactly how does that show up that
shades so I'll show ya it's very pretty
just a really soft kind of dusty teach
color see in that a pretty look there I
love that
and then I think I might do just a touch
of a pink pop right on the apple of the
cheeks with first date
okay so there's that I'm kind of
impressed by the blushes but not in love
with the bronzers the highlight in here
is pretty but I'm not going to be using
that right now because there is an
actual highlighter palette that I'm
gonna go to cue the highlighter palette
this one is called strobe and glow exact
same like shape and design as the other
palette it also does have that little
brush in there
like we said but here is just a series
of different highlights and we've got
light ones medium ones deeper ones some
bronzy kinds of colors here's a pinky
tone one this is the only one down here
this one called glazed that seems to
really have like some glitter in it if
you swatch that out you will definitely
see the glitter it's not really thick
glitter but I mean it's glitter fairy
dust up here is kind of interesting
because this has this sort of iridescent
like purpley blue look to it obsessed is
gorgeous because instead of being as
metallic as most of the others it's a
softer more pearly highlight and I think
sugar crush is really wearable as well
and it has a real like gold any
brightness like a brighter white gold if
that makes sense
so what the heck am I gonna choose here
I think I'm gonna choose fairy dust at
least to start actually no I'm gonna use
obsessed first because this one's more
subtle and then I can layer up on this
to let you see more but obsessed is
really pretty if you like that softer
more pearly glow but see there's still
definitely a glow happening there and I
mentioned this in my blending video but
I kind of like to buff my highlights in
a little bit more and give them a more
natural look less like just powder
sitting on the skin so obsessed is
really pretty and I mean the
pigmentation on these is really nice
like there are some super popping
highlights in this palette I guess the
question is do I need a palette this big
just chock-full highlights my answer to
that question is not really but it's 999
and if you just want to do some
experimenting you might like it okay so
that's what obsessed looks like so
really soft and beautiful and then I
think I want to use a little bit of
fairy dust just to show you what kind of
look we get here because like we said
this one has like that iridescent
kind of pinky brightness that is a fun
shade not gonna lie pretty
and I mean for these highlights to show
up in this directive lighting sometimes
you almost want to be in a dim lighting
and then look at the high light because
that's when it really has a chance to
pop you know it hits what light is there
and then it really pops off your face
more than your other makeup does need my
Liza here with three lights in front of
my face and expect my highlight to just
really bounce off my skin
can't argue with that highlight I do
really like it it's a pretty selection
of stuff in here I think you got to be
pretty like highlighter obsessed who
want this entire palette of nine
different shades it's a pretty large
palette to just keep that in mind now
I'm going to bounce ahead to lips I've
got this mixed metals lips kit and it's
too long-lasting metal matte lip creams
and a matte lip liner and I was playing
around with this a little bit yesterday
and they are pretty long wearing lip
cream and the idea of metal matte
usually really turns me off honestly
like I don't like the idea of that
metallic finish getting into all the
lines and crevices and then looking
totally dry you know on the lips so this
one actually doesn't end up feeling
super uncomfortable I would say the feel
of these liquid lipsticks is kind of
similar to the Tarte maybe not even as
drying as that yet they're not sticky
either so if you like this kind of thing
you might want to take note the kid is
$4.99 and I'm going to start off by
using this matte lip liner in berry vamp
and this is retractable and I'm just
going to use this to get a little base
color going on my lips
and I'm doing lips before eyes right now
because I know the lips will end up
being kind of deep and it'll sort of set
the tone for the eyes and let me know
how dark I want to go there and I do
have a little lip balm on right now as
well and that's helping the lip liner
glide on a little more smoothly
first I'm going to use this shade called
metal vamp and so this is just a rich
like reddish very metallic and it feels
super thin going on
and I think before that hits the full
dry down I'm going to go to this other
shade called metal berry and I'm just
going to get a little bit of that off on
my finger and dab right here in the
center
this shade I think is where most of the
metallic look comes from for me this
isn't the finish of product that I'd
probably wear all the time to be honest
with you because once it does dry down
and you've worn it for say a couple
hours I feel like the dryness really
does kind of show on your lips but I do
think the color tone is pretty and if
you like metal matte I mean it's not
uncomfortable on the lips so for eyes
I'm going to be using this sultry
palette this is the same size as those
big blush and highlight palettes were
and we've got a really wide shade
selection happening here everything from
jewel tones warm colors different
finishes we've got some mattes and
really metallic shades some deep matte
neutrals over here so I think I'm going
to start out actually use the brush
provided which is a soft blending brush
and also a flat brush for packing on
shadow and I'm gonna use this color down
here called ideal and I've already put
on some Milani eyeshadow primer but this
is gonna sort of give me a little base
color sometimes I remember to do this
and it helps the rest of the shadow look
go on a bit more smoothly just having a
little bit of a light neutral shade all
over and then I'm gonna go into ecstatic
which has a little bit of sparkle but
overall it's one of those matte shades
you know where they're just tossed in a
little bit of shimmer and I'm gonna work
this shade into my crease see once I get
it on my eye I can't see any of that
sparkle anymore sometimes I think brands
just do that to make stuff look good in
the palette or be a little more
eye-catching in the palette and I'm just
sharing that shade out here just a bit
and then I'm gonna go back to the color
that I used sort of as base shadow and
I'm gonna use that around the edge and
under the brow then I think I want to go
into this color called Xing with my flat
brush it's a kind of dark to medium warm
Brown get a little bit of that on my lid
here outer corner still just kind of
building up the base of this look and
these mats apply nicely they blend
nicely it's kind of surprising
pigmentation to see out of a palette
like this where you're used to kind of
like scrubbing into a shade picking up
as much as possible here I'm definitely
going
tapping off excess and then having
plenty to get color payoff on my eyes
then I'm gonna use a little bit of
nimble here this plummy shade and really
get that going on the lid and we'll see
how much actual purple we're getting out
of this I mean it's not like a bright
purple shade obviously there's also a
shimmery purple as well that I might
work in here just wedging it up into the
crease a little bit as I Pat it on the
lid to then blend that up into my warmth
I think I will try a little bit of
bewitched which is right below nimble
this shade is not really patting on as
fully as the mats were like the shimmer
I don't know what's going on with that
maybe I need to use my finger
no you'd think it would have just as
much if not more intensity but it
doesn't really now I want to do kind of
a splash of a shimmery shade here I'm
gonna go into celestial and we're gonna
see how that works here on my inner
corner definitely got some chunks in my
eyes
honestly I feel like for a shimmery as
it looks quick swatch there on my finger
first shimmery as it looks in that
swatch it's feeling a little dull and
flaky on my eyes like I don't think that
did any favors for the look I'm gonna go
in with maybe a little bit of snazzy
this is more of a pearly satiny finish
shade and see if I can salvage what's
going on there because I just wasn't
nuts about the way that came off
that's the thing about shadows you just
don't know until you apply them exactly
what they're gonna do because they could
be gorgeous and a swatch but not always
pack on the way you expect going in with
zing again and I'm gonna work this up
into my outer corner I'm trying to just
make a little bit more of a thing of my
outer corner since I'm just not that
impressed with the light shimmery inner
corner and then I'll go back in with a
little more nimble because I do like
when plum meets with a warm Brown
and then this blending brush on the end
of their double ended brush works pretty
well the flat side is decent too and
then I think I'll do a little bit of
wonder on my lower lash line and I'm
using that Real Techniques the smaller
of the two brushes from the eye pop duo
I talked a lot about these in my get
ready with me video I used them there
too but this is just a real standout
from some of the new Real Techniques
brushes that I used and then maybe a
hint more plum just on the outside it
gives you just this instantly smokey
lower lashline but yeah it doesn't go
outside of the zone you know where I
want shadow to be so it's really good
for that love between just a little bit
of light colored liner here on the lower
inner rim this is my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight I just love what
it does have that in there if I'm going
for that kind of a look you know if I
want it to be an even darker look I can
just put black in there then I'm going
to bounce over to a different kit here
there's a mixed metals eye kit I'll just
pull out this tray you'll be able to see
it better and there are a couple of
liquid shadows a loose pigment and an
eyeliner and and so far I've just
swatched these on my hand and I can tell
that there's a lot of locked in staying
power with these they'll start to smudge
a little bit when some moisture hits
them but as far as just your hand being
dry wiping across then they don't move
actually some of this lighter of the two
liquid shades maybe I'll just try some
of that in my inner corner here and just
see how it goes this is a rose gold trio
so I'm just going to put that on there I
kind of blend it out I don't know that I
helped a little bit but what I really
wanted to use from this kit was the
eyeliner because I wanted to see how it
would sort of go over the top of my
shimmery lid it's a really juicy feeling
eyeliner pin it's almost so juicy I feel
like it's running around a little bit
you know like it's kind of hard to
control it never thought I'd say a liner
pen was too juicy as far as these
metallic liquids I think if you're gonna
use them in a real full-on sense they'd
be prettier especially the deeper of the
two this more berry color is very pretty
then I'm going to go
to my palate get a little of this black
called nightlife first off I'd love to
just have something that pulls my wing
more like into my look and just makes it
seem a little more finished but also the
edge of that liner is just looking a
little rough on the bottom so this is a
nice way to just smooth that out so it
is nice that they've incorporated a
really nice dark black shade in the
palette there's also a dark brown so now
it's some mascara and lashes on there
there's the finished look I would say my
overall impression of what's happening
with this profusion line that seems to
have been sort of revamped and
reintroduced now at Target I would say
better than expected
overall I mean the prices on this stuff
these kits we're talking like right
around the $10 mark or less for the
smaller things for me to be this pleased
with you know the blush the highlight
overall I think the shadow look was good
I just think these palettes are gonna
have some hits and misses in them and
for a palette as big as that sultry
palette that I put on here you know the
mattes were really good and I've noticed
that throughout some of their other
palettes like they've got a really
strong soft matte formula but then some
of the shimmers will feel almost creamy
to the touch but not as good in
application and then some shimmers will
just be great so it's really tricky and
kind of hard to know but this little
info card that I have here says October
5th 2017 profusion cosmetics calm
October 13th
at Target calm and November 5th Target
in-store although I know some of you
have already been asking me about this
line that you've already been seeing in
stores so some stores have gotten it out
early
it says included in your package is a
sampling of our 30 item collection and
there are a couple of other things that
I didn't incorporate into this look that
I want to mention one of those things is
this amber eyes palette what do we see
here is this a total like modern
renaissance inspired palette I think so
in fact I think inspired might be
putting it a little generously I think
this is kind of a copycat palette here
but swatched out this does look really
beautiful there are a lot of mattes in
this palette which might explain why I
like it and if I have the chance that I
probably will I'm gonna insert a little
law
using this so you can actually see it
going on but this was not listed among
the holiday things this is just kind of
like an extra thing that they threw in
sorry my lighting is not ideal for this
part here I couldn't physically walk my
large light over here because I may have
sprained or done something to my ankle
last night on Halloween night that I'm
not sure it's just really hard to get
around right now but I did want to show
you this amber eyes palette and let you
see how the shadows actually go on here
because seeing this I thought this might
have been one of the most promising
things that profusion sent over this is
a $6.99 eye pala and keeping with what
I've seen in a lot of these other
palettes then that's our really really
good the shimmers you know in the look I
did today I thought well they're not the
best I've ever used but they seem to
perform a little bit better than what I
saw in my other palettes so that was
exciting so I want to just walk you
through this look real quick that I did
and it's nothing fancy but again I just
wanted to see how the shadows went on so
I primed my eyes and then I used the
color called outgoing a kind of a peachy
peachy matte all throughout the crease
and I used the brush provided for some
of these steps as a double-ended brush
then I added a little bit of fearless to
my outer corner too and got that all
blended out and then I worked in the
dark rusty red called outspoken into the
outer corner as well and got the edges
blended out I used the matte cream shade
called ideal I used that up under the
brow I patted the color called chatty
this light pearly shade with some
shimmer on about the inner two-thirds of
my lid and again I thought it went on
better than some of the shimmers and the
other palettes not the best I've ever
used but it certainly didn't pack on in
a really flaky like hard to manage way
and then I used the color called devoted
which is really dark rich berry I've had
that on the outer part of my lid and
then I wanted to see if this darkest
shade this dark brown called cozy could
actually really anchor the look and give
a lot of contrast and I thought it did a
nice job again the mattes are really
good in here
so I used a small brush with that and
then I used thoughtful that's that
deeper shimmer mix of
van Brown worked that on to my lower
lashline didn't do any liner with this
look I really wanted you to see the
eyeshadows so I just curled my lashes
put on some L'Oreal lash paradise
mascara and you know pretty happy with
the look I would say I think this is a
very affordable palette I think it's a
super affordable alternative to the
anastasia beverly hills modern
renaissance palette just something to
keep an eye out for and definitely one
of the more impressive things that I saw
that the brand sent to me and as I look
at some of the other things too just the
format of the palettes some of the shade
choices just the way the little shade
names look and everything on there it
seems to be a very honest ostia Beverly
Hills inspired group of products for
example they have this other palette
which is kind of neat it's got this kind
of squishy nice feeling exterior on it
and it's a 32 piece face palette in here
and it does have not a clear sheet but a
little clear tray that comes over the
top you guys know how I feel about that
but anyway what we're looking at in here
shadow wise actually reminded me a lot
at a glance of the a BH Mario master
palette that was out like around I think
it was last year at this time gosh that
seems like a long time ago but it's
those kinds of shades down here really
earthy a lot of warm shades just a lot
of neutrals happening there a couple of
highlights up here some brow powders and
a wax and then you've got two bronzers
which the bronzers in this palette
seemed to be so much lighter than the
bronzers in the blush combo palette
these barely would show up on my skin I
mean these are both very similar to like
benefits hoola light so if you're super
fair-skinned you might get a bit of a
result from these but me not so much you
got a couple of blushes and a highlight
and then two really decent brushes that
actually hold into this palette kind of
nicely one could be a nice highlight
blush under-eye setting type brush and
we've got just a bit of shedding
happening off of this but it is a nice
soft blender type brush but much like
with that larger eye palette that I use
today I noticed that some of these
shimmers like the ones in this second
rrrow just weren't giving me enough
color payoff for something that looks
golden or bronzey you want that to
really shine and catch the light and
they weren't doing that so much some of
the deeper shades were a little bit
better about that and again the mattes
were really nice of the things I did use
mixed metals lips I mean you be the
judge are you liking the look of what's
going on here I really did like the
quality of the lip pencil I thought it
went on easily it's a nice retractable
pencil I'm not the biggest fan of
metallic finishes in a matte dry down
type of formula just because already you
know this has only been on my lips for
maybe 40 minutes at this point and it's
already just starting to look a little
bit slightly patchy slightly worn you
know I think it would have been a more
flawless look if these were just matte
lip colors as opposed to having that
metallic finish so not necessarily my
cup of tea but somebody out there might
like it the brow palette I thought was
quite good if you're interested in
trying a series of brow powders with the
wax with the pencil and a decent brush
to apply it all you might be into this
this is $6.99 and is part of the Holiday
Collection a strobe and glow palette
I mean intense highlights super intense
I'm also seeing the a BH kind of
inspiration happening here because they
do a wide range of highlights they've
got some of these sort of bronzy
highlights I've tried one on Stassi of
Beverly Hills highlight palette and it's
the one called Sun dipped and I do see
some similarities with these more bronzy
shades it's a nice range if you're
really into something like this maybe
you want to check this out because
pigmentation wise it does not disappoint
the blush and bronze kit really wanted
to love this because I like the blushes
a lot and I like this glowy golden
highlight up here it's just that the
bronzers weren't delivering enough for
me and they seemed as though judging by
a swatch they would be deeper than what
was included in that whole multi palette
and they are but yet they still seem to
sort of dust away on my skin they just
don't really adhere I don't know what
that's about so can't really give my
fullest recommendation to that product
the sultry palette I would say overall
I'm surprised by the quality of this I
mean I really do like my eye look today
I was just disappointed that some of the
lighter shimmery shades couldn't really
give me everything I needed
this look to really pop and glow but the
mattes I mean really nice I wish they
would have just put out a flat out all
matte palette and people would be really
impressed but again they're saying
included in your package is a sampling
of our 30 item collection so perhaps the
most important thing that this whole you
know situation is establish here for me
is interest I'm interested I want to see
more I think this brand definitely has
some potential and I could see myself
uncovering some hidden gems down the
road this will not be the last though of
my drugstore related holiday gift things
I'm just starting to get into some more
things in that price range I feel like
the high-end holiday collections every
year those start coming out and like
late August but the drugstore stuff you
kind of have to wait til that trickles
out to the stores so I will be doing
