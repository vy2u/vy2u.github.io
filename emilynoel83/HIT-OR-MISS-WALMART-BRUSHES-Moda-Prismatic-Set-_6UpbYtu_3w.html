today some new makeup brushes that I
picked up from Walmart they are from the
royal and langnickel line that will
logos down there but this particular
type of brush is called the Mota
prismatic Pro makeup brushes for peace
face perfecting kit and as soon as I
laid eyes on these I thought hmmm I
think my viewers might be interested in
this type of thing and I got to tell you
I haven't tried the artists or artists
whatever they're called the really
expensive version of these like paddle
type makeup brushes haven't used those
what I kind of thought stumbling across
this more affordable kit was you know I
don't even know if I'm going to enjoy
this style of brush whatsoever so I
won't put a ton of money into it and I
can dry these out and just you know take
you along with me for the experience but
I paid under $20 for these I think it
was like somewhere between 16 and 18
bucks for this set of 4 makeup brushes
and it says excellent for blending
foundation concealer moisturizer and
primer waterproof handle sturdy flexible
handle for precise application and dense
soft fibers so these are like incredibly
dense brushes I don't know how many of
you are familiar with this style of
brush but the density of these bristles
they're really really soft synthetic
bristles and they are so so tightly
packed and I've been using these brushes
pretty much like non-stop since I got
them almost all of them one of them
which I'll get to you know it's not
really my favorite but it's truly a
different style of application from what
I've gotten used to especially with the
blender sponges which is all about like
tapping and pressing in the product and
here it's like you're really moving it
across the skin quite a bit and so yeah
the whole construction of the brush this
feels like kind of a flexible will not
like rubbery flexible but there is some
flexibility to this plastic handle you
can see there and as this comes in
contact with your skin you can see how
there's a little give to it and all the
brushes are like that but I noticed that
especially with this largest one because
there's the most weight there
at the head of the brush gorgeous color
on these I mean aren't they fun the way
the bristles are they're two tones so
they're teal and purple and then you've
got this kind of reddish violet look up
here at the top of the brush and then
that kind of blends to a bluish purple
and green so they're just gorgeous to
look at so I'll take you through what
each one is called this is the 801 this
largest one they claim that this is for
your all-over cream or liquid foundation
move the brush in one fluid movement
over your face to apply and blend so
that is one that I've used for
foundation and then the 802 is the next
largest size and that's this one right
here so in comparison you can see it's
quite a bit smaller and the 802 they say
is ideal for blush or bronzer
application this one I actually used for
cream contour the next size down from
that is your 803 and this says create a
flawlessly blended contour under your
cheekbones along the jaw line and you
can certainly use this type of brush for
that as well but I use this one for
concealer so just to show you again on
size huge quite a bit smaller smaller
yet and then the littlest one is the 804
and they say this one is for precisely
applying concealer blending makeup under
your eyes or contouring your nose or
small areas of the face and I did find
myself using this for a concealer just
in addition to the next smallest one so
I use this for those really hard to get
to areas right on the inner part of my
eye around the nose I've also seen
people like in Instagram videos using a
really small size brush similar to this
to dot around let's say some contour or
some cream highlight and just dab it on
and then blend it in with a larger brush
so as with any brush set I think you've
really got to look at it and think how
am i best going to use this you don't
necessarily have to go along with all
the instructions on the box but you know
after a couple of weeks of use I got to
say quality wise I don't see anything
changing and how these you know I'm not
seeing little bristles kind of spiking
up out
of the pack which was some synthetic
bristle brushes in particular I do
notice that from time to time but
everything looks so even and you would
know you know because this is a really
like dense seemingly even brush so I
think if something was poking up I would
really see it and I can't say enough for
the softness of the bristles just
incredibly incredibly soft like I again
haven't tried the artists the really
expensive version of this type of brush
but I can't imagine it really being that
much better or any more dense or more
soft than what I'm experiencing with
these as well as far as any sort of
paper around the outside the bristles do
get just a little shorter around the
edge so you're not dealing with like a
complete you know 90 degree angle type
cut here there is that gentle taper
which as you're blending and you know
slightly turning your brush it allows
you to really make use of the brushes
right out to the edge I think also I
wanted to make sure I put these through
a cleaning before I reviewed them and I
thought they were going to take forever
to dry just with how dense the bristles
were I expected that I'd be waiting like
an extra long time for them to dry but
it didn't take any longer than any of my
other brushes really I used some baby
shampoo and I just really you know
scrubbed it in there and felt like I got
the bristles fully clean even you know
the brushes that were applying long
wearing types of foundations or
concealers I felt like I got them
totally clean and then the way I dried
them I just set them flat like this like
I put them on a paper towel and set it
like that and I didn't feel like that
affected the bristles whatsoever there
is no bending because like I said
they're so dense the bristles are so
short I didn't notice anything happening
in there but by fitting them on top of a
paper towel a lot of moisture was kind
of I felt sucked south out of these
brushes by laying them that way and so I
watched him like one afternoon and by
the following morning they were totally
dry and they may have been dry a little
sooner than that even but generally when
I clean my brushes I like to give them a
full overnight period if I can to get
dry so again quality wise I really don't
have any complaints
these I think they're really nicely made
brushes and I've heard really good
things about other brushes from this
royal and langnickel professional makeup
brush line what I think this is going to
come down to a lot is your preference in
just makeup application the way you like
to put your products on the types of
products you like to use because I think
and these brushes can lend themselves
specifically to certain types of
products over others so now as I explain
these a little more specifically in
depth I'll cut to some demos so you can
see them applying the particular
products but talking about this 801
brush first which is the one they say is
good for foundation it's huge
you know this is this is massive I feel
like I put it over here on my cheek and
it just felt so big as I've used it more
it's a little bit less of a shock to my
system just the sheer size of this brush
so I think with how dense the bristles
are it applies a more liquid consistency
foundation better than a thicker cream
foundation or a mousse like foundation
or anything like that those types of
foundations I truly still think benefit
the most from a blender type sponge has
been saturated with water that can
almost thin that kind of foundation just
a little bit and make it appear more
natural on the skin I've used this with
some thicker foundations and I just did
not really love the way it was blending
it across the skin and in some cases it
came off a little bit streaky even with
a bit larger of a brush and in this
video I used a little bit thinner and
slightly more liquidy foundation this
Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating tint
not only is this not a thick foundation
but I think anytime you're trying to
build up coverage with a foundation a
more dense foundation brush can help you
with that I dotted this all over my skin
and then I just blended it all around
and it does still just feel really big
to me you know getting in under the eye
area is not super easy and of course
you've got smaller brushes that can help
you with that but just thinking of this
as a foundation brush I don't see myself
using it on the regular you know if
there was something maybe two-thirds of
this size I think it would have been a
lot better for me for foundation
this to me just seems really really big
you know the flat plains of your face
getting on your cheek going across your
forehead you know it's not really a
problem but to even get close to your
eye area it's a little bit of a struggle
there now I'm going to skip over the
next size down for a second because
that's what I use for contour the next
one that I brought in was sort of the
third one in line and that's called the
803 this is the one that they said could
be used for contour and it definitely
could but I like this for concealer and
I really like it for concealer I used
again a product from Neutrogena the
hydro boost hydrating concealer and I
just swept that under my eyes and
anywhere on my face that I wanted to
brighten because it is just a hair light
and then just the size and shape of this
brush I think is really nice for the
under eye area in particular it did a
good job of maintaining the coverage you
know I didn't feel like I ended up with
a streaky look at all with my concealer
I didn't think any of it looked too
heavy I've used this with a lot of
different concealers that I have
actually whether they're more liquefied
or thicker and I felt like this brush
could pretty much handle all of us
probably my favorite brush of the whole
bunch and the one that I am most likely
to continue using it just did such a
nice job and my finished look didn't
come off heavy that was kind of my fear
with these brushes was that any product
I put on my skin would look a lot
heavier than I was getting accustomed to
with using my sponges so much which I
think do a great job of really melting
product in with your skin and in some
cases spinning down thicker products I
was really pleasantly surprised with how
this one tackled the concealer and then
the very smallest one I brought that in
for kind of finishing touches of
concealer as well I thought it did
nicely like I said on my under-eye
getting right in there into that area
where product sometimes collects and
decreases I feel like this actually got
rid of some excess there and then any
other small area it was a nice little
brush for that and then backing it up to
the 8:02 which again is bigger than the
brush that I use for concealer this is
the one that they said as ideal for
blush or bronzer application and I think
this is a pretty good size for a cream
contour and I use my mascara
a 3d foundation compact there's a nice
contour in there and I just applied that
to my cheekbone area I also used it
around my hairline and I both applied
the product to my skin with this brush
and I continued to blend it out thought
it did a really nice job this is kind of
like my second most essential brush
after the concealer one I think the size
of this brush is really perfect just for
my face shape I guess and for the
application of cream contour it's so
dense you get a really really effective
blend with it and the blending was
pretty effortless you know I wasn't
applying a lot of pressure to my skin
some of that comes down to the type of
product you're actually putting on I
mean there are some really stiff not so
good quality cream contours out there
but I love that one from mascara force
blend ability and a brush like this just
makes it all more easy to apply so yeah
very very pleased with that one as well
I think my two most essential from the
kit like I said it's the one on called
the 803 that I use for concealer and the
802 that I use for contour this one you
know the tiny one is nice to have and I
may try doing some applications maybe
applying or dotting on some products
with this first and then blending it out
with a larger brush the one that's
probably my least favorite is the large
one and I think again it's some personal
preference happening here it's a nicely
made brush it's good quality just as
good quality as all the rest but this
just feels like a lot going across my
skin it's just not the one I'm going to
realistically be reaching for all that
often again these are cruelty free 100%
vegan no animal products used in these
so synthetic bristles the quality is
good the cleanup was good the price is
really fair I think for as well as these
are made for brushes coming in at under
$20 I think is awesome and I can tell
you for sure I will be going back to
this brand this royal and langnickel or
Moga pro makeup brush line I know they
had different kinds of brushes available
there at Walmart and I am definitely
like tuned into this line now I want to
try more because I think they are really
well made one thing though I did not see
these brushes being sold individually
but still as far as the set goes for
someone who's interested in this style
of brush and just wanting to experiment
I think it's a great way to jump in and
came out with you know overall three
brushes that I really liked to that I
think are especially great so make your
own decisions but they are fantastic
looking brushes I gotta say so overall
I'm pretty happy with my purchase so I
just wanted to share that with you today
ever since I showed some pictures on
snapchat of these I've had so many
questions saying have you tried them yet
have you tried and though I feel like
I'm definitely giving them a good run
with different kinds of products and
hopefully this helps you out as you make
your decision whether or not to get them
thank you guys so much for taking time
to watch and I will see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
