video I'm going to be talking about
these cushions from wet-and-wild so
funny because I had done a video all
about like wet and wild new foundation
powder concealer I think it was maybe
the day I posted that or like the day
after these were starting to be talked
about as people were seeing them online
and in their stores and I'm like dang it
I just missed it I was able to round
these up recently in store actually I
found them in my Walgreens I also found
a cushion lip product that I'll be
talking about in this video and then
these are also online as well and
they're selling them for right around
five six dollars and another cushion
thing that they're releasing that I
don't have my hands on yet is a cushion
color corrector type product and I do
have one of those I'm just going to talk
real quickly about it have one from
Physicians Formula
see how it's half and half it's the
cushion corrector and primer duo in the
peach and lavender and this is one of
those things that I just don't have a
total thought on it yet I mean have you
ever used some things and you're like
okay what is it doing I'm not sure like
it's not really a great sign for this
product that I put it on and I've used
it quite a bit and I thought what's the
real advantage to this is this something
I need to be using or does the color
just kind of disappear into my skin I'm
not really sure about this yet just so
you know wet-and-wild has put out like
individual shades of these cushion color
correctors as well but what I'm going to
be talking about in this video is the
contour and the highlight and it seems
to me that they just come in one shade
each the contour is called cafe au lait
and then the highlight is who's that
pearl and it says for both featherweight
finish ultra blendable and super
convenient I would argue a little bit
about the convenience with the packaging
on these because now first off I realize
they're charging less a lot of these
cushion foundations and the drugstore I
feel like they're charging an arm and a
leg form like I got Mabel wings recently
and I think I spent like 16 bucks on
that or something these little guys are
you know definitely a fraction of the
cost but the packaging seems a lot
cheaper and really not that convenient
got a twist off a cap here okay that's
going to go somewhere then you've got a
sponge fitting in here and
and you've got a lift out on this little
stopper and that's got it goes somewhere
else too so I feel like you've got to
take apart these multiple components to
actually get to your product but it
seems like most of these other cushion
related products you're able to just
flip a top back top your brush or
applicator in and it's just really easy
and it took me a while to realize this
but when you put your little stopper
back in it's not enough to just kind of
press it down around the sides you
actually have to put pressure right in
the center for it to totally go down
otherwise it's going to be kind of
popping out so yeah on one hand it's
cheaper on the other hand I don't love
the packaging but if you're interested
in you know this cushion format for your
contour and highlight there aren't a lot
of brands putting those kinds of things
out right now that I'm aware of far as
the consistency of this product if
you're not familiar with these different
cushion foundations it's really that
kind of a consistency it's very liquidy
and what you're dealing with in here is
like a saturated sponge a sponge that's
really just soaking up all of this
liquid and then you can press into that
with a sponge or a brush or whatever you
want to use the color tone of this it
almost makes you think a little bit of a
bronzer because it doesn't have that
ultra cool
borderline greyish type shadowy look
that some contour products have but it's
not super warm either it's just kind of
like a middle-of-the-road like the type
of bronzer type product that I would
enjoy but it does work as a contour for
me and the consistency is such that it
almost makes me think of a stain because
it's so liquidy and as i've swatched it
on my hand I've got like a little bit
right there in a very awkward boys hairs
on my hand and that's kind of an example
of I've put it on it's dried down and it
actually like doesn't move it really
does lock in as far as the color now I
want to show you the application and I
applied it two different ways for you on
each side of my face actually was both
the highlight and the contour on this
side of my face I applied them with
brushes and on this side of my face I
used Beauty blenders so the brush that I
use with this contour and really like is
this Real Techniques contour brush I've
actually enjoyed this with a lot of
different cream contour products and I
just dip into the product swipe it on
right where I want it to be and then
sort of buff it in in circular motions
or whatever you need to do to get that
blended and I applied that both to the
under the cheekbone area also a little
bit around the forehead thought it did a
great job this isn't the type of product
that I think you want to have sitting on
your skin for very long because it's not
long before it goes totally set so I
would say you want to stick to one area
of your face at a time get it on there
get it blended and then move on but I
did feel like it was fairly easy to
blend with this method and then on the
other side of my face I use my Beauty
Blender blusher which is a really nice
size for this type of thing first off
whether you're doing blush or contour
it's obviously larger than a micro mini
it's smaller than the classic Beauty
Blender and I just used the rounded end
of that dabbed it into the contour and
dabbed it right there in the hollow of
my cheek and I thought just also did a
fantastic job blending it in I mean I
don't see a pronounced difference one
side of my face to the other and I felt
like both were equally easy and I also
went around my forehead with this too
it's just kind of like which do you
prefer which you have on hand
that might dictate what you want to use
but I thought either method was fine
really my take away on this product is
that I like the look and I kind of like
the application but at the same time I
feel like it's just a little bit fussy
compared to a powder or even a cream
contour that I might like and use
already it's like the work that I have
to do to get into the product and I know
it's being kind of nitpicky but you've
got all these separate parts that you
have to take off all for a finished look
that's really similar to what I might
get with other random contour products
anyway and if I'm being really honest
with myself when I'm in a hurry I take
the path of least resistance you know
I'm going to want to pop something open
just dip a brush in it and go and not
have a lot of other little pieces to
deal with sometimes this whole cushion
idea just feels a little gimmicky to me
but I would still say that a couple of
advantages to this would be the thinness
of the product it does not look heavy
obviously not powdery on the skin or
anything like that and it really does
stay it has almost like I described a
staining type of effect so I think
that's cool now let's move on to the
highlight this is the one that I think
really sets itself apart and might be
worth it for me
grab for me because I think it's such a
pronounced highlight on the skin and if
that's what you're looking for this
looks really good and it seems to be a
pretty dramatic highlight without
packing in a bunch of glittery shimmery
filler you know it's like just a nice
pearlescent highlight so you look at
this packaging wise it's the same deal
as the other going to twist the cap off
you've got that little spongy if you
want to use that and then there's this
stopper that you also remove and I used
a brush on this side of my face I use a
smallish brush and I do think this gives
you a lot of kind of bang for your buck
in terms of the appearance of this
highlight on the skin I used 2 Sigma P
84 and I just dipped it directly into
the highlight and dabbed it right along
the top of the cheekbone and I thought
yeah that gives me a really nice
highlight and it's the type of thing I
can look up really closely at and I
don't feel like it's overly metallic yet
it was super duper brightening so I was
very happy with that method there and
then on the other side of my face along
my cheekbone I use my Beauty Blender
micro-mini the Beauty Blender blusher
could have worked for this just fine too
but I kind of used two separate products
because I didn't want the color mixing
from one to the next so I just dabbed
the micro-mini in there and put that on
top of my cheekbone and again it worked
just fine I wish I could say like oh one
method of application is distinctly
better than the other but I really think
it's just a matter of what you haven't
like to use because either way seems to
mesh really well with this consistency
of product which again it's very thin
very liquidy it does last nicely on the
skin but the highlight is the thing that
I come away feeling like yeah that's
really gorgeous that's kind of setting
itself apart from a lot of the
highlights that I have in my collection
and the bronzer or the contour here it
really reminds me of the effect that I'm
getting of matte contour products be it
cream powder consistency it's all kind
of looking the same on my skin so I'm
not getting a distinctly better look
let's say now the other cushion thing
that I picked up that I want to talk
about is this mega cushion soft matte
lip cream and I wasn't really sure what
to expect here of course they're all
sealed up in the store and I get it home
and I look at the tip and it's just the
same tip is that Milani concealer that
is
in using I never really considered that
to be a cushion but it is kind of a
spongy I guess cushiony ball at the end
of this and you're going to just squeeze
the product right up through and the
shade that I have this in is 100 a melon
it like it is and this as you can see
I've had it on my lips throughout the
video I don't think it really meshes
with my outfit wonderfully well but it's
this pretty orange e coral shade
definitely is matte and I think it feels
a little thinner than a lot of like
cream matte lipsticks might and also a
little bit thinner and lighter than a
lot of the liquid lipsticks out there
also it stays pretty true to colors so
with a lot of the liquid lipsticks you
put them on they have this dry down and
then they deepen up somewhat from what
you initially saw going on your lip this
lip cream I really kind of like it for
the fact that it's just that it's a lip
cream it doesn't lock in and have like
the most incredible staying power
because I can definitely pull some
product also there but it's not maybe as
drying as a lot of liquid lipsticks and
it doesn't have that color-changing
thing happen it's pretty on the lips the
packaging is cute but at the same time I
look at it and think I've probably got
just a matte lipstick that would give me
this type of look on my lip the other
day I was keeping an eye on how this
product really wore throughout the day
and it's not as locked in like I said of
some of those others same time it
doesn't wear off in a patchy way either
but it does feel pretty drying on the
lips not offering a lot of extra
moisture one of the best things to
compare this to might be those NYX soft
matte lip creams which aren't really
like a liquid lipstick but they have
this similar deal where they don't set
100% and to me that has a similar finish
on the lips to those but a lighter
weight feel so to me personally it's a
like not a love just simply because if
I'm looking for a matte lip color that
looks like this I've probably got it in
my collection in the form of the
lipstick I don't see it as a total
must-have and one other thing that I
would have mentioned that's not a
cushion but I do really like it and I
got it at the same time as these other
things it's this gel lip liner this is a
really nice lip liner I got it in the
shape plum together and I was wearing it
a recent video along with this l'oreal
glossy balm and petite plum so it really
is the same kind of color as this you're
seeing a lot of this lip liner coming
through on my lips in that video and
it's retractable and it goes on so
smoothly like ultra ultra creamy lip
liner you almost can't believe how
lightly and easily this is gliding on
your lips so I love that I would
definitely be into trying some more
shades of this lip liner so I just
wanted to let you know that that is
really good thought it stayed well a
color this dark I was really
apprehensive for as creamy as it was I
thought is it probably going to bleed
outside my lip line and I did not see
that happening all day long but yeah
what do you guys think about these
cushion products are you into using a
highlight and contour in this format you
think it's necessary I mean for me
personally I think there are some
advantages to this formula but the one
that really sticks out to me is
something that's different from a lot of
things in my collection and has a really
I think brilliant and beautiful look on
the skin is probably the highlight if
you were just kind of holding yourself
to one new purchase I would say that one
is the best and a lip liner you might
want to try one of those lip liners also
but thank you guys so much for watching
I really appreciate your time and I will
see you soon bye can I add one other
thing real quick I judge into my
collection for an eye palette I wanted
to use an eyeshadow palette that I
hadn't used in a while and I think I
might be falling in love all over again
with my Too Faced chocolate bar
semi-sweet palette I really do like this
thing I got a pretty you know kind of
warm look the shadows in here they do
blend really well I've got a lot of this
on my lid some of the peanut butter
shade some of this cocoa chili color
those are kind of my main three that
I've got on my eyes today and I really
like the look so just thought I'd share
that but thanks again guys I'll see you
later bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
