reviews in this video today why do we
like these videos I think it's because
they are big hits and big misses there's
not always a lot of in between here and
sometimes the things that I like I
really love actually from ELF and then
some things that don't work just fail
miserably so today's video is a mix of
some makeup and some skincare I try to
stick to a lot of new things because
these were the things that I hadn't
previously tried from the line so one
new thing is this new brush that they
have it's called the pointed powder
brush and they are coming out with more
and more brushes that have this sort of
two-tone look to the bristles they're
synthetic very very soft and most of
what I had had before was more of like a
tightly packed brush the kind of thing
that would be like a dense blending
buffing foundation brush so I thought
was cool to see them come out with
something that was a little bit larger
like this and it does kind of remind me
of a couple of different things I'll
pull out here I have this brush that's
kind of like egg shapes from it
cosmetics it doesn't have a specific
name on it but you know really nice
fluffy just super tapered brush there
and then also Real Techniques has a
brush very similar to this one but the
elf is a little bit more pointed I guess
towards the top but still pretty softly
pointed I would say if you already own
that Real Techniques blush brush and
you're happy with it I don't necessarily
think you need to go out in search of
this one because they're very very
similar but there is a reason why I like
this kind of a breath when you're using
a brush it's always you know the ends of
the brush hairs that are actually able
to pick up the product so here when it's
so so tapered and you've got all of
these different lengths in here you're
able to really utilize so much as a
brush in different ways you can kind of
lay it flat into your product and get a
lot right there on the side or use it
more on the tip and you could highlight
with that end you could apply blush with
that smaller surface area so I guess
bottom line I do like this brush I was
happy with this purchase
another brush that I think is super
versatile from ELF is the complexion
brush and I like this because see how
when you turn it sideways it's got a
little bit of narrowness to
it can really be a great like contour
brush or all over the face powder brush
it's got some nice taper here toward the
end I just think it's so like
user-friendly and easy and this is kind
of along those lines and for being
really versatile but just a different
shape to work with and I have no
complaints really about the softness of
that complexion brush but this whatever
they're working with here these really
fine brush hairs are very very soft like
little baby bunny saw so I do like that
and yes if you're wondering about that
reference I have petted a baby bunny
before this next thing that I got in the
new category on else website is this
highlighting and blending sponge they
call it as a dual ended sculpting sponge
that provides highlighting on one side
and blending on the other so you've got
an angled side right here and then this
side is flocked it's like kind of fuzzy
using a lot of makeup tools I kind of
look at and I'm kind of scratching my
head for a second thinking how best do I
use this what is the real intention here
and because I take a lot of sponges and
I dampen them under the sink but with
this floss and I didn't figure that
would end up drying and that really
needs to be dry for its intended purpose
so I'm using this dry actually one thing
I did with this end because see house
got a little bit of a I don't know taper
here toward that part of it I thought
that might be nice for baking so I did
bake my under eye area with that side
today and I thought it laid down the
powder pretty nicely but that being said
there are tons of sponges on the market
right now I did a whole video on sponges
that have this kind of slant wedge cut
to them so it's not like this sponge is
absolutely necessary for that purpose
but do I really see myself applying
powder or liquid highlights with a dry
sponge I don't really think so that's
what they say they say the angled side
of the sponge applies products
flawlessly for an illuminating effect
but actually I just kind of like using
the flawed side for a little bit of
highlight and I thought that applied it
pretty nicely actual highlight that I
put on today it's pretty subtle on but
it's the benefit dandelion twinkle so I
kind of dabbed this product in there
I'll do it again just real quick and
then I kind of just blotted it it was
sort of a blotting feel
across the top of my cheekbone so I
guess I see that side of the sponge is
sort of both applying and blending out
but I don't know that I love it more
than just using a small brush you know
to apply highlight right on top of the
cheekbone but please let me know if you
have a product this one or something
from another brand that's similar to
this how do you most like using it like
what's your essential function for this
here's something I absolutely love from
ELF
there's lip pallets they put out a
little it called like the runway-ready
lip palette the first one they did and
it has such a nice selection of colors a
really nice texture great pigmentation
we're not talking like just sheer
do-nothing type of lip products packed
into a palette wet and wild I'm looking
at you with this crazy old thing over
here this is not like a play make up lip
palette it's a legit good lip palette
with a nice mirror a brush included and
so they put out this two version and
I'll show you this other one just so you
have a little comparison in terms of the
color selection because I really like
the color selection on this first one I
thought it was super varied you know you
had really deep dark like berries Reds
little purpley shade pink nude it really
ran the gamut this newer one the lip
palette - I see it being a little more
springy and the shades are a bit lighter
there's a wonderful coral in here that
I'm wearing on my lips today a kind of a
light nude and a really soft pink I love
this neutral shade in here I think any
lip palette really benefits from a shade
that's kind of soft not too pronounced
in terms of being really pinky or red
but a little bit more of a just a
neutral dusty rose because you can blend
that in with any of these shades and
kind of contour your lips almost a
little bit with it and just take any
color down a notch gorgeous pink right
here with just like a hint of an orchid
vibe and then this shade looks kind of
reddish at a glance but it's got a lot
of pink to it too a very pinky red but
as far as what palettes go you know
there are so many that come out like for
example the one with wet and wild
doesn't even contain a mirror you know
if you're going to even think about
taking this on the go with you the
palette itself needs to be fairly
compact it needs to have a mirror and it
needs to have a brush included those are
the things that have to have
for this to be at least somewhat handy
because I think applying a product you
know separately with the lip brush and
using the palate is never going to be
quite as no fuss no muss and just
grabbing a quick lipstick or lip gloss
from your purse you know I mean if we're
all honest there that's the easiest way
to go about it but what palettes can be
fun especially when you're into sort of
blending your custom shade and stuff
like that on my lips today I'm wearing a
lot of the coral like I said a little
bit of this shade right beside it just
kind of on the outsides but I think it's
just beautiful the textures on these too
not too slippery not too thin they're
not just shiny lip products packed into
a palette here and you can't
differentiate one shade from the next
they are each pigmented they're each
their own unique shade if you like the
first palette and now you're looking for
just a little bit lighter you know color
variation for this time of year I think
this is awesome you won't be
disappointed by it another lip product
new the elf is put out is a tinted lip
oil and I want to show you the packaging
here because they have kind of stepped
it up a little bit from elf typical tube
doe foot type applicator products it's a
little bit more weighty
a little bit bigger too but at the same
time you know don't be fooled you're not
getting like a ton more product because
when you look at it this way you can
tell it's just a lot of surrounding
packaging right but just the feel of it
it feels a little more expensive
typically than elf
tube products are but it's a doe foot
applicator I have this in the shade
coral kiss and yeah lip tinted lip boy
alyssum to be kind of a trend that
brands are putting out right now I had
most recently tried some from Burt's
Bees and they were very very thin they
were like literal just lip oil no added
like thickness or real tackiness to it
this doesn't feel quite as thin as that
did it to best describe this like take
your vision of a typical lip gloss let's
say it's a little bit on the sixth side
very shiny and just send that
consistency down a little bit and that's
what you've got with the elf tinted lip
oil and it's going to be sheer you know
you can tell by what you're seeing here
it's not totally
what-you-see-is-what-you-get as far as
looking at the tube you're not going to
see
color that full-on on your lips and if
you're looking into coral kiss don't
expect it to come off as like a super
orange e-either it's more like just kind
of a soft pink on my lips and it feels
nice enough it's not one of those things
that I'm shouting from the rooftops
everybody needs this there's nothing
incredibly unique about it just think of
it as a slightly thinner softer feeling
gloss one way I actually did kind of
like to wear it was I put this on
lightly like I didn't group it on too
thick but it just gave my lips some nice
moisture and then I went on with a
couple shades from the lip palette and
that was like a quick easy way to give
my lips a more like moisturizing
treatment almost alongside these shades
but you can really take that step with
any balm that you love underneath these
colors just to make it even more
moisturizing so again not a total mess
try it out three new skin care items
from ELF two of them are pretty good one
of them is like the worst project ever
and let me guess you want to hear about
that worst product right now it's the
elf nourishing oils of foam cleanser man
this product started off on the wrong
foot when it arrived having leaked out
quite a bit kind of out of this bottle
and into its box that it was packaged in
and even out of that box it would had
leaked a little bit more it didn't
obviously ruin any of my other products
but you know that was not cool and it's
something around where this twists on I
think is where it leaked out of now you
can see how thin this product appears to
be I mean it looks like the thinness of
water in there and it's coming out of
this pump like and it actually squirts
out with a ton of force it goes
everywhere what I squirted out of this
bottle because you've got something as
thin as water that you're trying to kind
of contain and think okay I'm just going
to put this in the palm of my hand here
and it comes out so quickly and so
forcefully out of this pump that it goes
everywhere and then the smell of this
product all I can think of is soap
initially but old soap this is gonna
sound so weird but like if you had an
old like musty cabinet or something and
you smell the wood in that cabinet it
kind of that's kind of what it smells
like there is absolutely nothing
appealing about the scent of
product to me now you're supposed to
apply it to dry skin and gently massage
in a circular motion to cleanse wet
hands and phase to work into a rich
lather now it does go from oil to foam
it does kind of suds up for you but I
did not think it did a good job of
effectively removing my makeup because I
tried to use that product and that alone
to get rid of it and I could tell
because I followed up with a face like a
face washcloth and I could see all of
the stuff that this thing missed but on
top of that it burned on my eye area so
bad the scope of all the products I use
I feel like very few things irritate my
eyes but that really did not feel good
so we've got potentially a problem with
the actual bottle with it being leaky I
don't like the way it comes out of the
bottle I don't like the way it smells
and it burns my eyes and it doesn't
really remove makeup well need i say
more something I tried and did like is
this illuminating moisturizer with SPF
15 I feel like I've got probably a
handful of products that claim to be
illuminating moisturizers and none of
them contain SPF so that really causes
me not to reach for them very often you
know for my morning skincare this does
not smell bad it just has kind of like a
light sunscreen each type of scent but
it's very very pronounced on the
illuminating effect and I kind of like
that because you know you buy something
that says illuminating moisturizer
it's nice when it actually does what it
says it will do but you see the glow
kind of bouncing off of my hands there
even after this is like pretty much
fully rubbed in it's very glowy this
would be good for a person who wants to
add some glow to their skin but not too
much weight it still feels very like
lightweight on the skin you're getting
some moisture there but it's not too too
heavy and you can look very closely at
it and there's no like identifiable bits
of anything like I can't see any shimmer
in it I just see some glow eNOS coming
through so that's kind of a cool product
I was really glad I got that final thing
that I tried skin care wise were these
hydrogel under-eye masks it says with
purified water seaweed extract and
licorice and this little box contains
three sets of single-use eye masks so
when you get them out of the box they're
in these little pouches so
Louis feels nothing's going to come out
and then you take out this little tray
and everything's kind of goofy when you
take out the tray just so you're aware
there's a lot of like moisturiz
type serum that's surrounding these
little patches and on the back here it
says actual size so they are kind of
contoured just to fit right in here
they're see-through just gel looking
very very thin little patches that you
just lay down there and it says after
cleansing remove patches from their
packet place individually under each eye
for about 10 to 15 minutes and then you
discard the patches after use and pad in
any excess formula I use these at
nighttime fun last night and it was
funny because I was so tired I was
really like on the verge of just sitting
in my chair falling asleep but I had
these on and I couldn't help but feel so
like awake still it was really weird
like I wanted to fall asleep but my eyes
just couldn't have that tired feeling
because he felt so nice and cool even if
they don't feel incredibly cooling when
you first put them on just let him sit
there for a couple minutes like after
the first two three minutes they start
to feel even more cooling under the eye
what I came away with thinking was this
would be a nice thing to use like on a
special day before makeup application
you know it would be a great way to prep
the skin because I looked at my skin
afterwards and I thought yeah it feels
really nicely hydrated but whatever
serum that these are kind of soaked with
does not feel greasy at all so you can
rub it in and you can feel like yeah
that feels nice I could apply makeup on
top of this it wasn't anything weird
that I felt like oh I got to get this
off my skin now right it felt really
nice the whole under eye area felt
nicely hydrated really refreshed and
then I was you know ready to go to bed
but you sees in the morning if you do
makeup this would be a nice like pre
makeup step on a bride or I don't know
whoever oh and they also stayed on
really nicely I was not concerned
whatsoever about these like moving
around on my skin or slipping off I
didn't have to even touch them once I
put them on so yeah that's really all
I've got as far as new elf stuff right
now I'd love to hear if you've tried any
new elf things what's worked for you
what hasn't worked just looking in front
of me at what I've talked about here I
mean the war
saying obviously this oil to foam
cleanser not cool but I was really most
impressed with the lip palate I like the
illuminating moisturizer really like
these little under eye patches too and
then my middle ground would be that lip
oil and the highlighting sponge I don't
know until I find a really like perfect
use for this I'm not seeing it as too
much of a must-have thank you guys so
much for joining me I hope this was
useful to you as always and I will see
you soon in my next video bye I wait
with my left hand I always with my right
hand okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
