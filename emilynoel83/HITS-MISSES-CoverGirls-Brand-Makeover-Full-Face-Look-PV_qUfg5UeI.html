nice to have you here today we are
talking about covergirl stuff and the
fact that it would appear that covergirl
is undergoing some kind of extreme like
image changed the look of the new
products that are coming out
I mean it's black and white it was just
a happy coincidence that I ended up
wearing this shirt today but there are
so many things that are not only
completely different products that I've
never seen covergirl release before but
it's a totally different like aesthetic
to the line also perhaps a totally
different strategy in terms of getting
the word out there on their brand
because I would say over the course of
my channel in terms of PR for covergirl
I've maybe I think I might have been
sent a super sizer mascara
somewhere along the line but maybe two
three weeks ago I got a box of just a
random assortment of these new covergirl
products and I remember looking at like
wow this is covergirl they're really
switching it up so in this video I am
gonna be trying out all of those new
things and kind of filling in the blanks
with maybe some older products that I
have on hand it's the kind of video that
I did with new Milani products not too
long ago and a lot of you really enjoyed
that style and I do like that kind of
old meets new gives us a chance to
practically redo a one brand tutorial on
this brand because it's been years and
years in some cases since I've done one
of those on certain brands looking at
the little like card that they sent me
they say the glow up is real with cover
girls new vitalist healthy glow
collection and here's what's also
interesting let me pull up the text the
other day David my friend David makeup
artist New York City he sent me an
article from The Wall Street Journal and
it was titled aging beauty brands won a
facelift and it says drugstore staples
like covergirl and Maybelline try to win
back women in a world drawn to online
upstarts and higher in brands and then
the article fades out because I am not
subscribed to the Wall Street Journal so
that's all I could get maybe I need to
be subscribed to the Wall Street Journal
and read more stuff but maybe if they
did more articles about makeup I would
that doesn't sound good but I'm speaking
truth here I thought that was so funny
that on the day that I decided I was
going to do this whole video on
covergirl he's
me that and it's very obvious that
covergirl is trying to make themselves
over a little bit here not my first
rodeo once again with these products I
have been using them I have been trying
to assess how the staying power is and
different ways to apply and stuff like
that so I can give you everything I can
in this video so what I have already
done here I've actually applied like a
hydrating serum I believe it's called
active hydration concentrate it's from
Rodan and Fields and I've been using
that every morning it's a serum but it's
still pretty moisturizing and so I'm
gonna forgo using another face cream and
I'm actually going to use this vitalist
go glow luminizing lotion this is in
shade one day break and it says a
lightweight moisturizer with vitamins E
B 3 and B 5 light reflecting pigments
shaped before use it's just kind of like
this sheer glowy lotion this isn't
really intended to pack in any coverage
and it smells you guys it smells kind of
like corn chips like there's something
about this scent it's a little bit like
like a teeny bit sweet but our Queenie
bit Fritos it's kind of a nude color
when you squeeze it out the tube and it
does give your skin a little bit of glow
whether or not you can look past my dark
circles and my slight bit of redness you
might notice that the skin is getting a
little glowy I also have shade too
called Sunkist and so this one is coming
out a little more bronzy so it kind of
smells the same but as you can see more
of a bronzey look and the other day when
I was playing with this I just sort of
started blending this more in areas
where I might use a broad so you can see
it's so sheer like it's not making a
huge impact so if you really wanted to
take either of these shades and
regardless of skin tone pop it on all
over your skin for a little extra glow
almost like a glowy primer
they're so sheer I don't think the shade
is gonna make or break you but here I am
I'm primed and ready to go I do not have
like a brand new foundation from
covergirl but I do have two but I do
have something from the vitalist line as
there
the elixir foundation which I have done
a full review on it was months back it
was when there was still light and green
showing out of my window when I shot
videos I have this in creamy natural I
think my overall take on this was
basically that it was a really pretty
looking foundation especially at the
onset but I didn't have amazing staying
power out of this I noticed a breakdown
kind of after midday and I've shot my
stash with this product worn it a little
bit more on and off since that time and
it's kind of a situation where the more
I'm willing to set it to more I make a
point to really powder those problem
areas the better it will last for me but
it's not a super like hardcore full
coverage it's more like a medium
coverage foundation you ever notice you
can get away with being a little bit
more off shade wise when your foundation
isn't like totally full coverage it just
has more of that capability of sheering
out across the skin I'm gonna use my
little Real Techniques expert face brush
that I'm sort of addicted to these days
and I'm just gonna blend this in yeah
creamy natural I'd be not not horribly
off but okay it always shows up a little
peachy
but I truly do love the way this
foundation looks freshly applied and if
you've got super dry skin it might be
really nice for you it does feel kind of
nourishing I don't know y'all I might be
coming away feeling like this even
covered a little better than the Rimmel
did the Rimmel lasting finish breathable
got some in my hair over here I hope you
guys didn't see that but you know I'm
really pleased I look up close I don't
see makeup it's kind of funny because my
camera always like since getting my new
camera it seems to saturate a little bit
more then I'm used to having like in the
past it seemed like cameras would never
pick up on enough color and now like I
get a little color on and it's really
whoa but we're gonna move on we're gonna
try a new thing here this is the vilest
healthy concealer and it's coming in a
click pin form and a totally new look as
you can see it says it's available in
six shades cover skin imperfections
without piling on a heavy layer thanks
to its creamy formula it also claims to
have the vitamin C B 3 and B 5 did I
mention the luminizing lotion is gonna
sell for $8.99 each and the concealer
will be $8.99 and it says all this stuff
will be in stores in January I don't
know that I've seen all of this yet like
for example in my Walmart store which my
Walmart store seems to be pretty you
know southern Illinois finger on the
pulse of the makeup community but I
don't feel like I've seen all this stuff
out there yet so this shade that I have
is light/medium so I'm gonna click it up
and this is what always happens with the
click pin doesn't this always happen
stuff just goups out the side of the
click pen like without fail okay I use
this pretty generously the other day and
I thought it actually looked pretty
fantastic it's a pretty lightweight
concealer like you can just tell going
on this ain't no shape taped you know it
doesn't have like the ton of coverage
you're gonna use a little bit extra but
given the lightweight feel it's
something you feel like you can really
get away with right nup down here make
sure I get it around my nose where had
some redness around here and I'm gonna
first off take to that with a large
brush I kind of try to use as large of a
brush as I can get away with when
blending out large areas of concealer
because it really maintains the
Everage nicely and I'm also I am kind of
getting back into beauty blenders too I
was using my micro mini the other day I
didn't take the time to wet it this
morning um but I was using that the
other day I was like oh my gosh I
remember why I loved this it's the most
gentle little touch there on your lower
you know under the eye area it's all
blended out and then we can get our real
assessment going so for this being only
concealer and for this being a pretty
lightweight concealer I'm not mad at
that result really like I had some
darkness and I feel very brightened and
it does not feel super heavy I mentioned
you know it's not like shape tape the
thing about shape tape that I hope
everybody has come to realize by this
point is that it doesn't take a lot of
that product to do a very profound job
on the skin well some people in the
YouTube world may still be slapping that
stuff on as heavy as I just put this
stuff on like you don't need to it only
takes a few little dots of it and it's
potent so this is not that level of
coverage even with a lot more product
but it's cheaper and I do like the way
this looks and it also wore really well
and I didn't even bake it here's what I
did this takes me into my next product
this is the covergirl CG smoothers
powder this is an example of one thing
that's not part of this new covergirl
vitalist black and white collection but
see how they have even changed the font
of covergirl that's different from the
way it used to be but this powder I have
in translucent light the thing about
this like this has been in the line for
quite some time it's one of their
standard pressed powders you know they
have the clean pressed powder the clean
fragrance free all these different
things and they have the CG smoothers
line and this is supposed to be a powder
that like doesn't over dry years and
years ago I probably got it and before
this whole release I had repurchased it
cuz I was kind of looking for a good
little purse touch-up powder you know it
has the little puff here the reason why
it is kind of good as a touch-up powder
is because it doesn't have as much
coverage to it as like a L'Oreal True
Match pressed powder or that newer
powder / powder foundation from Milani
the LA Colors mineral pressed powder not
as much coverage as any of those and if
you're just looking for a little
touch-up or a little light setting it
could be just what the doctor ordered so
I've got this I'm using my little elf
small tapered brush and I really like
the result with this yesterday too and I
am just lightly dabbing this to set the
under-eye area like not a ton of product
and I kind of like the way it looked and
the way it mattifies but it does not
seem overly drying and I'm definitely
gonna get this on the t-zone like I'm
hitting the t-zone on purpose because I
know this healthy elixir sometimes makes
me a little shiny and then I'm just
gonna gently set the rest of the face
with a larger brush this is my ELF
complexion brush now I've set that
foundation all over so I should have
significantly better wear than if I did
not set now a bronzer from covergirl I
do not have anything new really where
that's concerned but I do have this
trublend bronzer which I have enjoyed
really it just says bronzer I was
expecting to have a shade name for you
there but it looks like this it appears
to be like a baked product but it's not
like that dry sort of chalky baked stuff
it actually feels really soft and nice
it's kind of a sunny type of bronzer so
I'm gonna give myself a little dusting
of this oh my gosh Tyler and I are still
keeping up this no night snacking thing
cutting ourselves off from the food
after dinner and normally like we
haven't really been talking about it we
haven't been complaining about it but
for whatever reason last night he'd gone
to a basketball game he came back and we
were watching TV and it was like sonic
ads would not stop coming on the TV
they're showing a burger they're showing
like big hot pretzels that you're gonna
dip in cheese they're showing like
everything I want to be eating in that
moment sorry if I just made anybody
hungry by that little spiel but wasn't
that I even so much was specifically
craving sonic they were the business
that was speaking to me in the moment so
subtle bronzer but it's giving my skin a
little something there and then also
guys I'm going to be using a very
old-school blush I'm going for my
cheekers blush and soft sable yes the
old cover go
you truly cannot go wrong with soft
sable though you just can't like this
shade it's neutral if you want that kind
of neutral blush little bit of Sheen
looks fantastic with like anything else
in your makeup look any lip color I look
you name it it's a winner but this whole
like brand makeover kind of makes me
wonder what are they gonna do with the
cheekers line like are they gonna
totally class up this packaging and I
know if David's watching this he's
laughing at me for holding my brush I
just love that blush I think that's
gorgeous but here's another new thing
they're rolling out in their line these
healthy glow highlighters in little
glass spots I mean covergirl is doing
some things they have never done before
so these say vitalist healthy glow
highlighter and I have them in shades 4
and 5 and both of these actually happen
to be too dark for me as I said these
were sent in a probably kind of a random
PR package so I'm gonna swatch these and
let you see what they look like they
might be great on a deeper skin tone but
they just don't function as a highlight
for me but they feel like two completely
different textures this shade 5 feels
absolutely lovely it feels light and
soft and borderline whipped that's that
kind of bronzy color right there and
then shade 4 feels kind of dry and it
almost pulls a little bit but you know
there is some pretty glow they almost
seem like maybe they would be nice cream
eyeshadows on me but the highlighting
thing they're just not gonna work I'm
going to take some of this daybreak
shade some of this stuff that I
basically used as a primer earlier get a
little bit of that on my finger and I'm
just gonna dab that on my cheekbones for
a little little deenis not too much
because I've nicely set everything I'm
just gonna dab dab dab and then I'm
gonna very simply dab over that with my
foundation brush again
I don't know maybe not the intended
function but sure doesn't look too bad
and then we have the first ever from
covergirl we have a setting spray it's
look lock up all day setting mist any
juicy tidbits about this over here its
name be $9.99 and it says works as hard
to keep your glam in place as you do to
apply it
make sure your look lasts all day by
spraying a light mist all over to lock
in color and keep your face looking
fresh little difficulty with the sprayer
the sprayer is kind of direct with this
you have to be a little bit careful
trying to assess this smell and to me I
was thinking this yesterday I still feel
this way it smells like a hair spray and
that I've used in the past maybe it's
got some hairspray like ingredients in
there I'm getting is just such a fine
mist and it's kind of like I don't want
to spray it too close I got a few like
larger flecks of spray on there which I
hate when that happens you know when you
can see the little droplets and you
don't want it to dry that way but my
face does suddenly look a little bit
more like everything looks a bit more
melted in I would say after that step so
it's doing its job in that respect but
it does kind of smell like hairspray I
do not have a covergirl brow product so
I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows I'm
busting out a good old honest hacia brow
wiz here in the shade medium brown I'm
gonna do that and then I'll join you
back with an eye look got my brows on
and in case anybody was wondering I feel
like these highlighters are in it for
the long haul here I can rep across them
they might make good eye shadows
actually but covergirl does not seem to
have at least from what I've been sent
or what I've seen myself they don't seem
to have a new eyeshadow product so what
I thought I would use in the spirit of
us being near Valentine's Day I would
use my true naked Rose's palette because
it's kind of pretty very feminine and
soft and has this sort of ma V berry
thing happening and I still think I'm
gonna do maybe like a Valentine's II get
ready type video I'm going to try
squeeze that and before the holiday
happens I thought this might be a fun
palette to use today and I thought I
might even throw in like a real
brightening kind of shimmery shade from
this infallible paints duo this is the
one called nude fishnet but one thing
that I
did notice and I didn't pick it up but
they had in this lineup of true naked
palettes in my Walmart stored they no
longer had the goldens they had the
nudes the roses the jewels which is the
more colorful one I did review that like
long ago but they did have a smoky one
now and the shades just kind of like
shades I've got many times over in my
collection it was just all kind of dark
and sort of I just saw it looking like a
dark muddiness on my eyes so I didn't go
for that but that would be the newest
covergirl thing that I've noticed in
their lineup so what I'm gonna do first
is get sort of set up here on the crease
I'm gonna take this lightest matte color
looks like just a soft sort of berry I'm
gonna gently blend that into my crease
this palette you know it's been a couple
of years now that they've had these out
and they are a surprisingly nice
drugstore eyeshadow palette I wouldn't
say they're doing quality wise like what
the new Milani ones are but they're
still pretty good there is some powder
eNOS that you'll notice when you dip
into the shades but it's kind of like if
it's a color theme that you like if you
like this general idea and you never did
go for Urban Decay Naked 3 just go for
this like it's actually pretty decent
quality now you may have seen I dipped
into the slightly deeper matte shade
right here and I am getting that here on
the outer part of my crease I'm blending
it sort of outward and upward somewhat
and then right next to that shade
there's something a little bit deeper it
has some sparkle it doesn't show up with
a ton of sparkle but it's kind of this
deep and dark berry I'm going to also
gently blend that into the outer corner
as well so we're just kind of focusing
on crease here for the moment
of course covergirl also has their
classic you know shimmering sands I
think that's where every kid my age
probably started and I think it's a
great beginner palette because it's
never gonna take you too dark it's just
gonna like dip your toe into the water
of first using eyeshadows and then you
can graduate to okay now we're gonna
just use a bear brush and blend on the
outside these shades do blend very
easily I will say that and then I'm
gonna go to the lightest color and we'll
use that as a bit of a highlight here
and that's a that first one in the
lineups I'm Matt and now I want to do
something kind of fun I think I'm gonna
take the shimmery end the real pearly
end of this infallible paints and nude
fishnet I know I'm going off the beaten
path here with brands but just let me
have my fun here for a second I'm gonna
put this on the lid I'm not really
attempting to blend it with this
applicator Real Techniques I don't know
what the heck happened to the brush I
would normally blend this with
and so this is going to kind of work as
a bit of a base so I want my light color
to just really pop to the heavens here
so I'm taking this shimmery shade with a
flat brush and I'm going to get this
around my inner corner see how
brightening that is they're dabbing up
on to the lid they're a bit
and then I go to this kind of rosy gold
shade and pet that moron to the main
part of my lid
lastly I'm gonna dab some of this
darkest shade here not really lastly
we're not quite done yet but I'm gonna
just use that little sponge tip that
comes with this and we're gonna dab this
in on the outer corner I just want it
really you know placed in a very
concentrated spot and the sponge tip was
clean so I'm using it
and then with that same shade there on
the end that really dark berry I'm just
using a small crease brush and we're
going to work that just a little bit out
from the eye
I've been getting asked a lot lately
what's in your water line it's the
wet-and-wild ultimate brow highlight I
mean I mentioned this in a lot of my
videos but I am gonna put this right
down here in my lower inner rim it
brightens like none other
it stays on pretty well and it just
completely extends the the whites of
your eye bright and sup the eye yeah
it's not a full-on white it's like an
off-white with a little bit of pink in
it now I'm actually kind of wanting to
keep this look pretty soft on the lower
lash line so I think all I'm gonna do is
take a smudge brush to this shade this
is sort of getting on the darker side
berry and I'm just gonna blend that
toward my lower lash line a little and
this is gonna be a liners liner list
look I don't have a covergirl liner on
me and I just I don't feel like it's
really necessary sometimes when I'm
going a little more natural just in
terms of the lashes and everything just
using a mascara I feel like the lashes
pop more when I don't do a liner so I am
going to just curl my lashes here real
quick and then we're going to be using
the covergirl peacock flare this also
has the new covergirl font although it's
not a total black and white packaging
it's got this more like simple font so I
can tell it's sort of a little bit part
of the remake and this mascara I
mentioned it I think in my cute
packaging video it reminds me a little
bit of super sizer in terms of the
effect that I get but it's a little bit
drier than that and I don't dislike the
mascara like I think it actually kind of
you know has a nice look after one coat
but when you really go back in and
you're trying to build up more and more
more length the annoying thing is what's
happening with the brush and kind of the
lumpy bumpy Ness of it like maybe you
can see how some parts are kind of
blossoming out and then it goes out a
little bit here and there and when
you're really just trying to get up
close to the lashes and get in there and
really build up it's almost as though it
takes a little longer to get the effect
you want because the brush is that way
brands always feel like they have to
reinvent the wheel when it comes to
mascara
Juan's because they got to get noticed
and they got to do something you know
that's different but sometimes you go a
little too different you just make life
harder for everyone and I did use a
little bit of this on my lower lashes to
test it there the other day and it wore
pretty well there but the hard thing
again this brush is so hard to get in
that area and get right up close to
those little lashes especially it's the
hardest on the lowers bottom line on
this mascara you can get a pretty effect
but you got to work for it I'll take my
lash Paradise thank you very much
mascara got a little clumpy on me
actually over here on after a couple
coats and it hasn't done that to me yet
until now so I look I still think
regardless you know you can throw in
another mascara of course or whatever
but I do feel like that's kind of soft
and fresh but a little bit smoky and
then the last new thing here I have to
talk about is the vitalist elixir lip
oil here's another new thing cover girls
bring into their line they haven't put
out before and I have two shades these
this is just randomly what was sent to
me I have melon granita and cherry crush
and they are very sheer they really are
like a true lip oil feeling it's a kind
of thing where I thought oh I love the
look of them going on initially but I
thought man they're gonna be way too
slippery this is the pink one obviously
I thought it's just gonna be way too
like kind of greasy feeling well it does
have a little bit of that greasy feel
when they're freshly applied but I gave
them each a chance wore them longer and
they start to feel fortunately more like
one with the lips like I don't know if
they're just absorbing a little bit more
or just the wear of them within just I
don't know an hour or so of regular
where they just kind of start to feel
comfy on there I actually kind of like
them even though they're super sheer I
think this light pink shade is just
gorgeous on it doesn't it look fresh and
pretty with this look off but I wanted
to show you the red too
I'll pop this cherry crush on as well
because I want you to see this this is a
little more colorful but of course not
nearly the red you see on the tube oh no
I might like this even better with this
look considering how soft the eyes are
today the thing you might be noticing
here is that the applicator doesn't hold
a lot of product say you you will find
yourself dipping back in for a lot it's
such a pretty look I would say it has a
feeling that's just a little thicker
than a straight up oil not as thick as
those like Milani lip oils that came out
even though it's feeling borderline
greasy right now it does feel really
nice with just a little bit of wear so
that was kind of a fun discovery so
overall look here what do we think we
first tried out these vitalist go glow
luminizing creams and they were nice
enough I don't really like the scent of
them but they did kind of give my face a
little lift in terms of being a little
added moisture a little added glow kind
of like a primer and this one shade the
daybreak did make a pretty little soft
subtle highlight so I don't hate these
it's just not a super new thing to the
market you know there are plenty of
primers or plenty of kind of glowy
products out there right now so I don't
know that I'd seek these out like once I
ran out of them of course the healthy
elixir foundation already been reviewed
on my channel but I loved the first
effect it's just something that I have
to kind of watch it once I hit about the
mid day point usually with my skin and
I'm not super oily I'm more of a normal
skin type but I can help that by
applying some powder on top and while
this is not like any brand new powder on
to the line the CG smoothers is nice if
you just want that lightweight powder
that is going to absorb some oil but not
look too chalky and dry but it's for
those of you who are looking for a
powder that's not a coverage packed
powder like this can be a decent little
touch-up powder the concealer was really
pretty good for me all things considered
like it took I think a decent amount of
product for me to be satisfied with the
look I've used less of this and thought
I need to build it up some so I just
kind of went full on with it today
actually wears pretty decently well I
would say it's up there with the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow maybe a little more
coverage than that my bronzer and blush
that I used today we're
they knew of course you know I love that
soft sable blush shade and I do love the
roses palette I don't think the quality
of these palettes from covergirl are as
good as what Milani is putting out but
granted they're like half the price of
one of those Milani palettes and if this
is a color scheme you enjoy
I think this palette does do a good job
the mascara it's kind of like the more I
use it the less I like it the brush just
kind of frustrates me a little bit and
if you are gonna rely on it to go down
and do anything on your lower lashes
it's really tricky and the lip oils if
you're a shear lip product person if you
tend to enjoy something that's not super
full coverage you might want to try
these out and just bear in mind like
they do feel oily when you put them on
but as you wear them just a little bit
they become just like this comfortable
almost balmy feel it's interesting I
hope this was useful everyone thank you
so much for taking time to watch tell me
what do you think of covergirl kind of
remaking the look of their brand and
putting out so many products that like
they haven't done before
oh speaking of which the look lockups
spray I don't love the sprayer on this I
feel like it's actually a little bit
direct it's hard to sort of manage where
you're gonna hold this in relation to
your face and sometimes you get it too
close and you get the droplets there's
an instantaneous look of less powder
enos when you put it on
yes it's doing that but I really don't
feel like I know yet what it's doing for
the staying power later in the day like
I have to use one of these setting
sprays consistently for quite a long
time for me to figure it out but thank
you again guys for spending time with me
today and I will talk to you later bye
okay guys I really meant to do this
progress check yesterday but in the
evening the late evening I took a shower
and I was like oh no I was gonna update
you on how the makeup wore so what I did
is I got ready today to use the same
like foundation concealer everything
products just I used the nudes eye
palette everything is wearing really
well and very consistent with the past
experiences that I have had now keep in
mind I did set the healthy elixir
foundation with the powder but I feel
like the under eye is wearing pretty
nicely I'm sensing that maybe the
healthy elixir foundation might have a
slight tendency of oxidizing a little
bit because it just seems a little bit
deeper than when I started but overall
the staying power of the look
been good I have caught myself like
touching my face leaning on my hand
doing different things and it still
seems relatively fresh so we're talking
about 10 hours of we're at this point so
I just wanted to update you on that I
think that's about all I have to share
but thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
