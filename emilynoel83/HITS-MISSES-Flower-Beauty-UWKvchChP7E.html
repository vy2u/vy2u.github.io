may notice my eye look is a little bit
dramatic today I am taking part in a
special little challenge so I'm in the
midst of that
so hopefully this isn't too distracting
for you as I talk about some completely
unrelated products but I do have some
demos and some little tutorials along
the way in this video but I wanted to
talk about a bunch of new things newish
things that pride from the flower beauty
line that is a line of makeup that's
exclusive to Walmart drew Barrymore
created it I noticed in my list of
videos I went back a few years and I did
do a video reviewing a handful of
products many of them are still part of
the line just right after everything
first launched so I will link to that
video below if you want some additional
product information but since that time
I've been sent a few things I've looked
into a few more things in my local
Walmart store so I just wanted to share
with you what I found out from this
little trial and error process first
thing I want to mention this was one of
the things that I was sent I just had
kind of like a random little assortment
of like five different things that were
in a box one of those things is called
an EE
erase everything so we've seen BB CC
there our DD greens this I guess is
calling itself an EE erase everything
ultimate foundation and the shade they
sent it in is called uf1 and it says
sheer tint well there is zero tint to
this particular shade of this product I
mean it appears to be white and it is
it's like a white just primer and the
description here says it's a miracle REE
erase everything ultimate foundation
fills in uneven skin texture and fine
lines while hydrating the skin apply the
cream like balm directly to skin for a
silky matte finish use a loan for a
fresh look or as a primer before your
favorite flower makeup so when they put
in that use it as a primer that kind of
gives you the indication this isn't
really erasing everything like that
erase everything title i think is so
misleading it might make you think oh
this is going to be a full coverage
foundation type product because they do
have some skin tone shades along with
this but this was what I was initially
sent and I was like what you know this
is called sheer tint but there's no
color to this but it's one of these
products where you just school
use the tube and it comes out through a
brush this is not the kind of brush I'm
ever really going to use to help me
blend it's just a means of getting the
product on to the skin so I would just
assume you know that was taken off and
we just have regular squeeze bottle here
cream like balm yes it really does feel
like that there is a thickness to this
product it almost has the teeniest bit
of a cooling feel when I put it on I've
noticed that every single time that I've
applied it I thought oh it feels kind of
cool it's interesting a silky matte
finish yes I would say it's definitely
not glowy on the skin it doesn't look
unnatural on the skin either it doesn't
look like insanely flat and it claims to
hydrate the skin but I definitely would
not use this on my skin in place of a
moisturizer I would use this in addition
to a moisturizer that I already have on
and this one you know really just acts
like a standard primer I think you know
you're not probably going to wear this
alone and really take a lot of
satisfaction in coverage because there's
no color to it it's not going to address
discoloration but one thing that I
definitely think this does do it has an
effect on the look of my pores and it
does have a claim about uneven skin
texture and fine lines and I think I can
kind of see that happening when I have
used this I can especially tell it when
I put a foundation on top I feel like
every everything on my skin like around
my nose and sides of my nose things tend
to look a little bit smoothed out when
I've got this underneath so I do think
this can be a really effective primer
step but I think the erase everything
name and the sheer tint name given to
something that has no tint to it
whatsoever can be a bit misleading but
anyway this was the one I was sent and
so I thought well maybe the tinted
versions that are available in this line
did a little research online realize
they did have some skintone shades
I thought maybe these are like
incredibly full coverage and they're
really not this I thought offered a tint
of color I have it in the shade uf4 it's
the buff tint there wasn't a really
broad and deep shade range these were
available in either just FYI
same kind of brush type applicator and I
applied this as a little demo for you
just to see what I'm talking about
but it's extremely extremely sheer if
you've got discoloration this stuff
can't really touch it it's just so light
coverage and I think you could use
either of these as a primer the colored
one might offer my skin just the
slightest bit of sheer coverage but it
is just practically undetectable to me I
think it's just important to manage your
expectations a little bit these do not
erase everything you know they can be
helpful I think for pores or uneven
texture I see these either one
completely is something that's going to
continue to be a primer for me not a
foundation so all that being said I did
apply a foundation on top of those
you're seeing my skin here not just with
those products but with the Kardashian
Beauty no apologies liquid makeup I told
you guys I was going to put this on so
you could see what it looked like on my
skin I would say this is a straight up
medium coverage foundation has a very
basic natural finish on the skin not
super glowy not super matte either and I
wear it in the shade natural beige so
this video isn't about that but I just
wanted to let you know I did follow
those steps up with a foundation and
then I want to move on to the concealer
this was something I picked up in my
Walmart store it's called Hollywood
secret concealer kit I have it in the
shade hs1 I can't recall if they had
other shades available in this as well
I'm always intrigued when I see you know
cream style concealer from the drugstore
because I think there's a potential for
really good coverage to happen out of a
product that's you know kind of put
together in this way so there's a teeny
tiny brush that comes with it I'll admit
I haven't gotten much use out of that if
at all but there's also this insert that
says you have a brightening primer here
and then all of the rest are labeled as
concealers two of the shades this one
might even be just a little bit peachy
but two of the shades kind of just cater
to all over skintone and then this is
like a neutralizer this has a little bit
of an olive tone to it and this I must
say in all the color correcting that's
been happening there's a lot of light
green stuff that's come out and that's
supposed to counteract
this I've always felt like the light
green has done nothing for me but this
all of the shade I've used at a time or
two when I felt like I was extra red
around my nose and it actually worked
so if you feel like the greens generally
do nothing for you maybe something like
this it has a little olive to it
might help but if this is looking
familiar to you it really looked
familiar to me because I am a longtime
user of the Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda
concealer palette now instead of having
something that claims to be a
brightening primer this one has a
setting powder in it and I love that
feature of this product I think that was
actually an excellent quality setting
powder and just comparing the two
texture wise of all the creamy
concealers that are in here these are a
little bit more emollient there's just a
little bit more moisture and creaminess
in these it makes it easier to blend
across the skin these you know I'm not
saying they're really hard to work with
but there's just a little more stiffness
with it you know it's not bad I'm not
comparing this to like my LA Colors
dollar-store concealer that you know it
was really hard to pull across the skin
these are good they're just not quite as
creamy as they could be but for my demo
I applied that brightening primer which
is a different consistency from the
other products it's thinner and it's
kind of lightweight and it does sort of
prep the skin for being really really
brightened on the under eye and then I
used the deeper of the two kind of
peachy skin tone colors all over that
area and anywhere else where I needed it
and I just used a brush to blend those
out I didn't end up reaching for the
olivey green shade today I didn't really
think I needed it but overall I think I
achieved pretty good coverage from this
product but if we're talking like I said
similar price range I do kind of prefer
the Sonia Kashuk hidden agenda over this
but this is still a really nice product
now another thing that really really
interested me that I sell in my Walmart
store is this DB daily brightening
under-eye cover cream and so this is a
little rollerball product it came in
several shades I got DB - it was really
hard to decide what shade I might be
because I think you were just going off
of a little sticker on the packaging but
here's what it looks like you know you
just got that metal rollerball in there
kind of took me back to using that
Garnier rollerball that just comes in
one like tinted shade and I know a lot
of people have enjoyed that for the
under eye area just for light coverage
but this is interesting because I feel
like it's more coverage it's probably
the most coverage I've ever seen in
anything that's this kind of format and
instead of staying kind of dewy tacky
moisturizing on the skin it really does
set this isn't the kind of product that
you would absolutely have to set and I
know I already had this concealer on I
probably didn't need to use a whole lot
more but I just wanted to show you a
little bit of this product in action
just kind of unlike the tops of my
cheekbones and I applied it straight
from the rollerball the cooling
sensation is immediate you definitely
feel it and I love that about this
product I almost wish they would put
this out it with like a colorless serum
in it because that rollerball is just so
effective and feels so cooling pop it on
you could blend it with your fingers
blend it with a brush whatever you want
to do but it does have like some decent
coverage it is not shimmery at all and
putting some on my hand here I mean it's
really just like a thin lightweight
concealer you don't want to let it sit
on your skin for too long because it is
a very fast setting product but it has
so much coverage to it I was really
impressed one bit of advice you may want
to consider storing it downward because
I've recently started doing that and it
definitely rolls off of the roller ball
easier that way when I first got it I
felt like I was having to go back and
forth and back and forth and yeah the
roller ball felt good but where's the
product you know so it helps to kind of
shake it a little bit downward into the
roller ball or just store it like this
another thing that I tried out this was
part of the little sample package that
was sent is this zoom in ultimate
mascara and I had had this once before
and I don't think I ever got around to
talking about it but this is a really
innovative type of mascara from the
drugstore because you're getting a brush
that can transform three ways so you
pull it out and it looks like I have a
typical wand it's got rubber bristles
and then there's a little tourney thing
a little knob on the end attorney thing
and you turn it once and the brush
actually twists just a
so it kind of changes the configuration
of the bristles it makes them look a
little more spiraled around and then you
can turn it one more time and it really
scratches the bristles down a little bit
so I don't notice that much effect and
difference from the second phase of this
wand but going from the first one where
it's totally straight to all the way
scrunched in it takes those bristles and
I think it makes them come closer
together so that can be kind of neat for
separation like you initially apply it
this way and then you twist them all the
way in and apply a little bit more I
absolutely love the concept behind this
product
I wish the brush wasn't quite so big to
start out with just because I think it's
a little hard to control and the
bristles like it's hard to get right in
there you know really close to your lash
line and feel like you're making good
contact so I feel like I'd like this
better if the brush was just downsized
somewhat overall I got to be honest the
length that it builds is just okay for
me the curl holding ability is not that
great it is kind of volumizing and
thickening but I do think it's one of
those products that definitely involve
some trial and error on the part of the
user you know what way do you like to
use it best what form of the brush works
best for you but that really is the only
mascara I know of drugstore or high-end
that does something really
transformative like that with the wand
without having to be like a double-ended
thing last but certainly not least this
was one of the products I was also sent
as a sample and I liked it enough to go
seek out another shade in the store this
is the Hydra silk ultimate lip butter
and I love this you know design this
format of a lip product that is the
skinny stick it's kind of like the
colour-pop lippie stix you know it's all
the fullness of color and the creaminess
of a lipstick but just a little bit more
precision and the shade they sent was
rose petal absolutely love this shade I
mean I see why they probably sent this
out to a massive amount of people
because it's so universally workable
just a nice soft kind of dusty rose
color and there's so much shine these
remind me of the Sonia Kashuk shine luxe
you know the sheer lip products that
have
tons of shine but the color of a
lipstick love those and this is like
that all over again they feel so
moisturizing this is not going to be a
product where you're incredibly
impressed by the staying power but they
feel so comfortable to apply it's like
it doesn't really bother me to reapply
it's just the faintest of sense that
comes from this product I've really got
to try to hone in on even smelling
anything at all it's just a slight
makeup be scent but that's not really
something that stands out to me I think
the packaging is just gorgeous so I love
that rose petal shade and then I went
out and got the nude shade called naked
petal and that's what I've been wearing
throughout the video and I think this is
stunning as well such a wearable nude
color not too light not too brownish if
you're looking for straight-up kind of
classic nude a little bit of a sandy
type nude this is awesome so basically
those are the newest things that I've
tried from the flower Beauty line I've
had some questions about it just wanted
to give you a little update again the
erase everything product I do think this
makes a nice primer just don't look for
a lot of coverage like skin tone evening
out coverage from this kind of thing but
I do like this product I really liked
the rollerball - that was different it
was really much better coverage than I
was expecting and these Hydra silk
lipsticks are just like a treat for your
mouth they feel incredible on they look
great nice shine to these products if
you're tired of matte dry lips go get
you some of these as I described the
concealer quad you know good but not
amazing the mascara is super innovative
just not my ideal mascara and as I said
please check out my past video where I
covered even more flower beauty products
but a couple things just off the top of
my head that I know I like from this
line was really impressed with their
blush bronzer duos these are SuperDuper
pigmented I am wearing this one today in
the shade gloriously golden I've had
this for a while and I believe the first
one that I got was Ready Set glow but
there are matte blushes in here they are
crazy pigmented so so good very
underrated and also their eyeshadow
quads this is the one called foxy
Brown's I know I've talked about how
wonderful these are there's a great
match
Brown and here's some shimmery shades
and they've got quite a few other shades
that they've come out with since but
that's a nice find from this line if
you're just kind of browsing but thank
you guys so much for your time I hope
this was useful and I will see you again
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
