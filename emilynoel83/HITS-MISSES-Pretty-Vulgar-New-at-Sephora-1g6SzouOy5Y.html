here today and the focus is a new brand
from Sephora called pretty vulgar and
this line I believe I first heard about
it on allure and they were saying like
the new line is going to change the face
with makeup at Sephora or something like
that and I think it actually is going to
be sold in Sephora stores and the
packaging is definitely eye-catching
maybe that's one reason why they think
this would sell well in a store because
everything from the outer boxes is
really adorable and then on the inside
it's just a really pretty packaging
design there's lots of little birds and
flowers and it almost looks a little
old-fashioned in some ways but it's
still really pretty and then the names
of products as you may notice as we go
along can be a little bit more edgy I
guess now there are three different eye
palettes in this line and I got all of
those that was one of the biggest points
of intrigue for me but there's also some
face products and lip products so I just
ordered a little sampling of what they
had to offer it's nearly a full face now
this is not a first impressions video I
have been trying this stuff out for a
while now so I wanted to apply it and
talk about it as I go so I can really
explain the application stuff but I'll
definitely touch on my past experiences
wearing this so you know a little bit
more about the way it wears first
product is this blurring Beauty mousse
and I have this in the shade walking on
eggshells it's kind of like the same
design as the it cosmetics CC cream only
you're getting a little bit less here
this is one fluid ounce and with it
cosmetics you get one point zero eight
fluid ounces and I've used this in a few
different ways I've used this just as a
like traditional foundation so you know
I'll apply a moisturizer and a primer
and stuff before hit and then put this
on but lately I've really been paying
attention to what the claims are here on
the box and it says that it works as an
all-in-one moisturizer primer and
lightweight foundation our face
perfecting blurring Beauty mousse is
incredibly blendable transcending from a
light coverage skin smoothing foundation
to featherweight second skin application
so this is not an
tended to be a real full-coverage
product here so keep that in mind but
when you think about what it says it
will do you know the moisturizer primer
lightweight foundation all-in-one it
kind of reminds me of a lot of the
reasons that I might reach for my it
cosmetics CC cream so I'll pump some out
here there's some little air bubbles
sometimes when I pump out so even though
I'm going for a full pump I don't always
get it now it's having trouble pumping
anything out at all oh there okay so
this shade when I got it in I thought oh
that might be you know a little bit dark
on my skin but for the fact that this is
so lightweight and has some definite
Sheerness to it it really it's not a
problem you know you'll notice as I
blend it out it just kind of blends
right back into my skin tone I've used a
beauty blender with this and I think
that takes away a lot of coverage so a
sigma f80 brush is what i found to work
better but no matter what I do it is
really pretty light coverage I mean you
see that one side blend it out and I can
see all my little freckles still through
this and I'm not saying it's really a
bad thing you know I don't think I'm in
a place right now with my skin where I
always need like the heaviest heaviest
coverage stuff but at the same time if
I'm going for this quick and easy
one-step thing I know that it cause
medics covers better plus it has a
fantastic SPF in it so it's kind of a
no-brainer for me that I would go for
the it cosmetics over this one I guess
the thing about this is that the texture
is a bit unique it is kind of like light
and mousse like but yet not as dry as
some mousse as you might typically think
of and whether I moisturize under this
or not I tend to get pretty oily around
my nose no matter what it just really
does not have great staying power and I
can see it a lot like as I'll wear it
throughout a day and look at myself
close up toward the end of the day I can
totally still see that I've got
concealer under my eyes but it looks
like everything else is kind of worn
that's kind of odd next thing is this
concealer and it looks like a totally
typical doe foot applicator type
concealer and this says our buildable
undercover gel serum concealer will
cover up your problem areas no matter
how big or small delicate formula keeps
skin moisturize now this I have in the
shade called veil of secrecy it's a
really good like skin tone match for me
it's not necessarily like going to
brighten me off-the-charts you know
because it's not a lot lighter than my
skin but it's more of a match and that's
okay and I have been applying this you
know pretty much all throughout my under
eye area and down the sides of the nose
kind of tackling some of the redness
that I have around my nose and just
anywhere else where I have any little
blemishes or whatever and I've been
using my Sigma P 80 brush to blend this
out and I find that the coverage is
really quite nice it's not quite as
thick as a Tarte shaped tape
but it honestly might kind of rival that
type of coverage like I've been really
pleased at the way that can tackle some
pretty dark under-eye circles right here
in my inner corner without reaching for
any sort of peachy corrector to go
alongside this
and the finished texture of it you know
once you get done blending it out it's
not like screaming to be set with
something you know it's not super sticky
concealer I don't think you absolutely
have to set it but it does have just
like a little bit of a tacky feel there
if you're one who likes to smooth
everything out with a setting powder you
might want to use a little setting
powder with this I kind of like to pull
in my foundation brush again just to
make sure that the cone of the concealer
gets all nicely blended in with the tone
of the foundation but what I'm going to
do is just pull in the lightest amount
of some setting powder here the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder just
with my little commercial expression
this is the number tank yeah this is
great for just a little bit of under eye
setting powder I just think that's
really locks in the concealer gives it
really nice staying power and then
because I know this foundation really
struggles to last if I don't set it I'm
going to just apply a little bit of that
same loose powder all over my skin
honestly it still wears down pretty
quick even if I do put some powder over
it but hey I tried right and I don't
know that I talked too much about the
finish on my skin with that foundation
on but it's just pretty natural it's not
super glowy it doesn't blow me away like
looking flat and matte and dry it's just
kind of a natural like middle ground now
the next thing I chose to get from this
line is a blush and the blush packaging
is like super gold and it's the make
them blush blush in the shade called
pretty witty and sometimes I really
enjoy just these neutral colored blushes
although this one looks exactly like a
bronzer like if you didn't tell me and
you just set this in my lap I'd say oh
okay I've got a bronzer it has maybe the
teeny as' bit of a like rosy tint to it
just a little bit in there and maybe a
little bit of a satin finish as well so
I'm going to just use my blush brush
here for Milani it is rather pigmented
so a little bit goes a long way I'm just
going to apply that here on like the
outer part of the apple of my cheek
because it sheers out you see how it
looks a little bit more rosy than you
would have expected
a nice natural flush I don't think it's
the most unique type of blush ever but
it does seem to be nice quality very
pigmented so it's the kind of thing I
want to just build up little by little
on my skin now I didn't get a brow
product from this line I just went ahead
and used my benefit precisely my brow
pencil number 4 applied some Milani
eyeshadow primer and I'm going to use
the pretty birdy palette here this is
the really colorful one and all of the
palettes while they all look different
on the outside they have this same kind
of birdcage design on the inside so
we're looking at 12 color eye palettes
no matter which one you pick this one
has 4 matte shades this one right up
here is matte these two really rich warm
shades here are met and then also
there's a dark teal so I think you could
go like about a zillion different
directions with this palette so I'm just
going to jump in and see where it takes
us first off I am going to take this
shade right here called
lay and that I'm just going to take all
over my lid up into the crease just get
a little bit of a base going here is
just like a nice creamy beige color
there is a nice mirror on these palettes
as well like you can see your entire
face in there so that's nice then I
think I'm going to lightly apply this
topi shade called songbird to my crease
it does have a little shimmer but I just
want something there to build up a
little depth to start out with
and the birds are singing outside my
window here is the Sun comes up the Sun
is starting to rise a little bit earlier
so I'm getting a little more light in my
room yeah you see right now it's 6:03
and there's already some light outside
and stuff I want to work with this
golden e shade up here called ego and
I'm going to Pat that right here on my
lid and kind of focus it in on the
center of the lid
these shadows in general are pretty nice
to work with I mean there's nice
pigmentation there's a little bit of I
don't know dried flakiness to some like
you have to be a little bit careful as
you're patting them on and don't be
surprised to see some fallout from them
even if you do tap the excess off your
brush and use a little bit of this shade
called free this seems to be really
shimmery and shiny right around the
inner corner and you're thinking all
right already use one of the fun colors
come
it's just tough because I've been using
my busy art theory palettes a lot lately
and busy art to me is just becoming like
the mother of all eye shadows and yeah
and ER quality is just impeccable
doesn't matter if it's matte or shimmer
or super metallic like they all apply so
consistently and so nicely so when I dip
into these shades and it's like well
it's kind of dry kind of flaky with some
of these shimmers I have to work sort of
hard at times to build it up exactly
where I wanted on the eyes this er is a
tough act to follow that's all I can say
I'm going to pull in this shade called
formation right here this is a matte
rusty color looks super rich and I'm
going to Pat this on the outer part of
my lid
they're just so many colors in this
palette I mean there are many many ways
you could you could go with this what I
think I want to do is use one of the
other colors as kind of a bright pop on
my lower lash line now I'm flipping my
brush a little bit and trying to get
some of that color in my crease
and a lot of times when I'm working with
shades in this way you know I first
focus on just getting the shadow where I
want it and then I'll come back and you
know soften the edges and blend it out
taking just a bear brush buffing out
over the edge but trying not to
interfere with any of the color that's
on my lid but that rusty color looks
really pretty as it sheers out and then
while I'm at it I'm going to take a
little bit more of this lay shade here
and just more deliberately place that
right under my brow and then you know
what I'm dying to use a little bit of
this color too this is called snitch
it's a nice like ruby red and I think I
will do that just right here in the
crease marking it up just little by
little because I know it can be bold
you know you might not glance at this
thing and think that's the warmest
pallet of all time but my goodness can
you come up with a really pretty warm
look just using some of these neutrals
you know with the gold and the the rest
in the red my eyes are on fire with this
look okay nice and then I think I just
want to Pat on a bit more of this color
called ego just because as I've blended
and applied the other shade I don't want
it to like overtake my whole lid
and some of these shimmers while they
can really pack a punch in a swatch they
don't necessarily blow me away in
application on the eyes but I mean still
pretty don't hang together quite as much
as like a good d'art shimmery shade does
now I want to give this look just a
really clean edge across the upper lash
line I'm going to use some black liquid
liner I'm using Jordana color Envy in
black Envy and I did not purchase an
eyeliner from this line I probably
should have I just um I recently have
gone through my drawers here in my room
and I've been redoing my storage and I
realized just how many eye products I
have that I need to use some try not to
bring a ton of new eyeliners and
mascaras into my life right now because
that is the kind of thing you know
mascaras eyeliner brow products I'll go
through that stuff faster than anything
but I still just have a lot of it one of
these days you're going to see an
empties video and be like dang I love it
there's such a bird theme with this
brand and you know you get up and use it
in the morning on a spring morning and
the birds are just chirping right
outside the window
there was a woodpecker on the roof a
couple of days ago and it was so funny
because it was like the moment I turned
my camera on to shoot a video
it's like done and I remember it must
have been like right above my head but
then it stopped
it's like it got it feels like this
isn't a tree okay I'll leave
a decent little weighing here
next up I'm going to work in the green
and I think some of the dark teal on the
lower lash line and I'm going to do my
waterline with a pretty bold green liner
I've got this one from colour-pop and
it's in the shade called TSP so I'm just
gently pulling down on the lower lid and
applying that to the waterline and I'm
going to get a little bit on my natural
lash line not a ton because I really
want you to see the way the shadow goes
on there and what kind of intensity it
has that I just want to blur the line of
it all
this heal right here called Nevermore
get a little bit of that and that's
going to be the first thing I do here in
terms of connecting down to my lower
lash line just a little bit just right
under the wing is where I'm taking that
move all the shadow good news no hmm my
new single coming out this summer this
shade here is called jealous so this
green I'm going to pick that up on my
angled brush as well and then this is
going to be our pretty lower lash line
pop and I'm going to take it just all
the way in first with this a stiff
angled brush
you guys I lost my pencil brush I don't
know where it is it's like I talked
about it in a favorites video a couple
months back can't find the thing for the
life of me I don't know where where it
went like did when I was downstairs
doing my makeup one day did Bell like
take it and put it into some secret
stash I don't know but I'm using the
smudge brush this is an a21 from Sigma
and same shade I'm just kind of
softening it and pulling it down and out
slightly sharing this color out kind of
helps you see it more you know really
like it alongside that particular liner
in the lower inner in
okay guys so there's the I look I added
some mascara and some false lashes false
lashes I can't remember the exact style
but they're very very similar to the red
cherry number 43 so I enjoy that I look
so much I think it's gorgeous I think
some shades you know applied a little
more strongly than others
I feel like within these palettes they
have like some shades with sort of a
metallic finish and then some shades
that have like a little bit of sparkle
and then those shapes seem to be looser
a little bit harder to control on the
eyes and even some of the shades that I
thought should have been like a
no-brainer
SuperDuper smooth judging by how they
swatched like this gold right here you
had to kind of pack that on and work
with it some so well it's not
necessarily my most dream palette you
know in terms of texture and formula of
all these shades I do really enjoy the
color variety because there are about a
zillion different ways you can go with
this I mean you could see before I even
put the green on I had this beautiful
warm kind of sunset vibe on the eyes and
I could have stopped there but then I
didn't even begin to go into the blues
or the purple and there's also a really
smoky purple down here so the variety
for this palette is just off the charts
and for its size to have that much
variety I think that's pretty cool for
lips I have a couple of different
products one that I'll just talk about
here first I got one of their lipsticks
and the packaging is just too cute
it's like rose gold and then you can see
this floral print but it's in like
little rings all the way around the tube
so that's gorgeous can't make anything
away from that you got the little brand
logo there it's probably so shiny you
can't even see it and then there's the
lipstick there's a little bitty bird
imprint on the lipstick itself this
shade is called blood flower and I did
wear this the other day I'll pop up a
picture it's super bold ultra pigmented
classic cream lipstick there's no
shimmer in this it's definitely a blue
based red makes your teeth look
SuperDuper white I like it I thought it
looked gorgeous on it does have that
little bit of shine but it doesn't take
long for the shine to wear down not the
whole color but just the shine from this
red wears
now as you would expect but this really
is the type of color that's going to
stain your lips you know it has a lot of
intensity it wore through most of the
day actually looking pretty decent I
need to make it look its freshest I'd
obviously want to reapply all that's
being said I've got a lot of red
lipsticks and once I get past the really
cute packaging you know do I like this
formula better than Besame are better
than bite let's say it's not as
moisturizing feeling as bite and the
Besame lipsticks what I like about those
is that they've got I think a little
more thickness to their formula than
just the average lipstick out there and
I just really like the way they feel on
my lips and the way they wear this is
good but I don't know like I said beyond
the packaging I'm not sure how much I'm
actually going to reach for this
particular lipstick the other lip
product that you'll be seeing in this
video is a little more neutral I got one
of their liquid lipsticks it's called my
lips are sealed and this shade gosh the
print is tiny this shade is called
secret sabotage and this is kind of like
their nude of the collection we've sort
of been taught that a lot of liquid
lipsticks set to a budge proof type
finish this is not like that it's kind
of like a very opaque lip cream it can
totally you know come off it's just not
going to completely set on your lips
but this is like totally metallic and
for it being such a light shade it looks
even more metallic on my lips okay I'm
going to throw this description at you
fans of the movie clueless didn't they
refer to people as a Monet at one point
like from a distance it looks great and
then you get it closer and kinda like
that movie I need to watch that again
sometimes but when I look up close at my
lips and I'm not like stretching my lips
out like that my god the lines you know
it's just I don't think metallic lip
colors are the most flattering thing has
just the feel if we're just talking feel
on the lips it feels really great like
it's totally creamy
I mean it's think of it as just a
thickened up gloss super opaque but can
definitely you know come right off your
lips I don't think it's doing anything
to really compliment this particular eye
look because of all the warmth here you
know I could have used something maybe a
little bit warmer on my lips I'm
actually going to pull in a little bit
of this bite crayon now that you've seen
this color on my lips this isn't a shade
called sable I'm going to add a little
bit of this kind of around the outside
for future use I may use it to kind of
like pop some looks in the center of the
lower lip but in terms of being worn
just solely on its own all over my lips
I'm not really a fan so yeah pretty
vulgar new brand at Sephora my overall
take here just real quick the foundation
is probably my least favorite thing that
I've tried I just it's so similar in
function to the cosmetics CC cream but
that product has way more going for it
it's got the SPF which if I'm going to
double up as my moisturiser for a
product like this I'm going to want the
SPS included and it's just better
coverage better staying power throughout
the day so on a lot of fronts I think it
beats this one out for sure the
concealer I actually like concealer is
one of my favorite things that I've used
it's nice coverage it is kind of
moisturizing feeling without being
sticky it doesn't like beg to be set but
I think a little setting powder does
help it as it goes throughout the day
and it doesn't like just have that
appearance of drying me out surprisingly
nice coverage so I am a fan of that well
I think the blush is
and I think I picked a shade that would
kind of universally work alongside any
of the eye palettes I got I think it's
nice its pigmented it's a good formula
but I don't see it as a total must-have
it's not like crazy unique maybe there
is another shade in their line that
would really knock my socks off but this
one isn't just like wow that's a total
must I didn't touch on the packaging at
the liquid lipstick but look at that I
mean you can't argue with the packaging
if you like the ultra feminine look to
things you know if you like birds and
flowers like you're going to love the
way these products well here's the way I
come away feeling after trying both of
these lip products it's like okay I've
had my fill I don't feel like I need to
go explore and try a bunch more of these
lipsticks I'm not really compelled to
buy a bunch more of these metallic like
liquid lipstick things but I see these
is good decent lip products but not
totally exceptional now the eye shadow
palettes I want to talk a little bit
more about all three of them pretty
birdy what's the one that you saw me use
in this video this is definitely my
favorite because it's the most unique
it's not an overall formula that I think
is completely flawless like I said visi
art is the tough act to follow
all of their shimmers are great their
mats are great it's just very much what
you see is what you get type brand and
it's a really impeccable formula and so
when I look at this stuff I want so much
to have that same consistency but don't
get me wrong I think these are really
good shadows they're just not the best
I've ever tried but this palette for all
of the fun color variety of this in here
all of the different looks you could get
like I could use this for week and turn
out a different look every day so that's
my favorite this is the one that I think
really sets itself apart then you got
this one called earlybird I really think
it's cool how they get a completely
different and you know design to the
packaging of each of these but then the
layout on the inside is the same now
this is beautiful okay I look at this
and I think yes that's a color scheme I
can get behind and enjoy wearing any day
of the week but if you went and got that
Too Faced natural love palette this is
so similar to that color scheme with the
mauve you know hint of pink type shades
a little bit peachy a variety of Browns
right down here there's
than wrong with that but it's also not
like sending me over the edge to be like
yes this is different unique and awesome
and I keep using this thing please let
me know if you're interested in seeing
further looks from this brand and I can
bust something out with this talking
about the eyeshadows just across all
palettes I think I've enjoyed the mess
that I've tried the most and the
shimmery shades can be a bit more hit
and miss some are like ultra smooth
metallic nice and then there are some
that just require more work more packing
on more carefulness as you're trying to
apply them and then the other eyeshadow
palette here is called nightingale and
this one's very cool and very smoky and
it reminds me in some ways of like a
Naked palette just what the certain
shades that happened to be matte here
there's kind of a dark borderline bluish
color a dark matte Brown I mean there
are some fantastic basics here and look
at all these rich dark shades here these
are intent and those can be really nice
used as eyeliner but I think in both the
nightingale palette and the earlybird
palette you're really confined to just
one certain kind of color scheme you
know this one's going to come off cool
and pretty smoky and this one's going to
have like your pinks as your accent type
color and then a lot of brown worked in
alongside everybody as I said total wild
card that could be a neutral look easily
and if you are traveling with this and
you got a work trip let's say you need a
neutral look you can completely do that
like the gold the creams this taupe but
then you want to play it up for night
time and do something wild like you are
completely equipped to do that also so
the two best things that I've tried
probably would be where is that
concealer and the pretty birdy palette
those are my two favorites but please
keep in mind I have not tried like
everything this brand has to offer I
didn't even dip into the eyeliners
mascaras brow products I can't even
remember if they had when they probably
did think quality wise they do have some
really good things going on the
packaging is spectacular I think it's
very easy to get sucked in by the look
of a lot of these products but for me
this line isn't like one
percent loaded with must-haves from what
I can tell so far so thank you guys so
