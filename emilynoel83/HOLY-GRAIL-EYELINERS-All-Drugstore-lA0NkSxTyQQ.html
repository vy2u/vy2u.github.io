weekend spent back at my parents place
celebrating their 50th wedding
anniversary so that was a lot of fun
and I am jumping into a new video here
that has been requested so I've been
thinking about this on and off trying to
group together my most favorite
eyeliners and it was kind of funny how
this worked out because I sort of went
category by category and I was mapping
out okay this one's my favorite here
this one's my favorite here and I wasn't
even trying to make this like a 100%
drugstore roundup but that is what it
turned out to be so many of my most top
top favorite eyeliners are from the
drugstores so yay and if you watch a lot
of my videos there may be certain ones
that you can predict I think what some
people were asking for was sort of this
one-stop shop all about eyeliners videos
so I'm just going to jump right in and
talk about liquid liner I love a good
black liquid liner I mean I think it's
so important for a clean crisp look it's
really great paired with false lashes
but my personal favorite it is
waterproof to the max and I was just
having a conversation with my mom the
other day she was needing a good
waterproof black liquid liner and I said
mom it's the Jordana color and you know
it's the one in the shape called black
envy I've used it so much in my videos
it's such a traditional eyeliner format
because you've got that sort of long
brush but it never gets funky and the
brush hairs always stay really nice and
tight together and I'm always able to
get a really easy line and a great win
with this also but very important
factors for me are that this dries down
matte it does not move it doesn't flake
off it doesn't smear off it will come
off you know when you wash your face at
the end of the day and work in some
makeup remover but it's just an awesome
long-wearing product my only complaint
would be just accessibility availability
of this product I don't know if any of
you live where you've got like full
selections of Jordana makeup maybe
Kmart's
are a little bit better about that but
for me I've just got like a snippet of
Jordana in my Walgreens store and I have
to order these off the Jordana website
which is not a big deal and then they're
just maybe two three dollars a pop and
I'll buy several at a time and
definitely going to pick
up an extra for my mom so she can try
this out but this is by far my favorite
black liquid liner my favorite that's in
a pen form is this Physicians Formula I
booster two-in-one lash boosting
eyeliner plus serum and it's not so much
about the added ingredients or the fact
that it might be you know providing some
sort of serum to improve the quality of
my eyelashes really for me the thing
that gets me going about this liner is
the ease of use just the design of the
product it's so so good and if you're
saying well do I go for this or the pen
I think the pen is a good place to start
if you've never used a liquid liner
before because it's just that much
easier to be able to hold a product and
hold it like you would you know a pen
that you write with and I love this so
much because the tip is actually a brush
tip that's not just one of those felt
tips it is a brush tip that goes down to
absolute nothingness at the end that's
the great thing about brush tips a lot
of times felt tips don't get quite fine
enough right at the tip so this really
hugs the lash line gets right in there
close very easily you can create a
winged liner with this very well I've
always had the best luck with this style
of liner whether it's a felt tip or a
brush tip storing them flat seems to
give them the best longevity this is a
great little tool to have if you wear
false lashes and sometimes you want to
let go over that lash band a little bit
like maybe your glue has dried but
you're still seeing a little bit of
excess glue somewhere you can easily go
over it with this and completely neaten
up your look but if you do get some
residue on this little brush tip it
cleans off so much easier and more fully
than a felt tip pen will so I can just
take you know a little makeup wipe or
even just a plain Kleenex and wipe over
this tip and feel like I am getting it
completely clean lots of people asking
about a good pencil for the waterline
and lately I have so been loving this
Maybelline master precise skinny I have
it in the shade I think it's called
defining black and then they also make I
think a charcoal color and a brown and
it's a super skinny skinny skinny liner
it's kind of like
the size of an Anastasia brow Wiz so it
stays super precise and I like using it
in the lower inner rim it can also reach
the upper inner rim with ease it never
feels dry to me I mean if you wanted to
go across your natural lash line with
this product you could certainly do it
but I do find it has really good staying
power for me in that inner rim it's very
very black I think everybody every I can
put eyeliners through a slightly
different test you know depending on how
watery your eyes might get how much you
touch or mess with your eyes you know
some people who could have a liner like
this lasting nearly the whole day like I
do maybe another person doesn't have
that same experience so all the stuff is
you know things that have definitely
worked well for me I can't guarantee
that it's going to be a one perfect for
you but this has been definitely one of
the better liners in lower inner rim
I've also liked the Milani supreme Kohl
Kajal liner that one's in the gold
packaging I just feel like this is even
creamier than that one and one quick
sidebar well we're talking about the
lower inner rim this L'Oreal so
kissimmee liner in black I have been
using this on and off in previous weeks
and I do love the intensity of this
liner like it goes on like super dark
but my one complaint about this is that
I do have kind of a transfer problem
when I wear this like product collecting
right around my inner corner it's like
it's so creamy and so much product
easily lays down that I get kind of a
mess happening in here and sometimes
even on my outer corner so this is not
my favorite for like a long wearing day
now for a nude liner in the inner rim I
know I use that technique often I did it
today you know using something lighter
there in your lower waterline that
totally disguises the look of any
redness pinkness anything that kind of
tends to make the eye look more tired
you can easily sweep a product like this
on and your eye is so much more
brightening and you could use white in
that spot too but I think you'll find
that nude liners do that job really
effectively but they don't look to start
if there is a newscaster a morning news
anchor out there who is not putting a
nice nude liner assuming it's a day when
you're not going real smoking you've
already got black in there but if you're
just going with nothing in that lower
inner rim I would highly encourage you
to put a new liner there you will notice
the eyes being totally waked up
male/female I don't care who you are it
will make a world of difference to the
aliveness the liveliness of your eyes I
talked about Milani shadow eyes and
almond cream a lot I reached for that a
lot I think it's a great tone just an
easy thing to put in there it's a jumbo
stick problem is that's getting harder
and harder to find
so I'm adjusting my recommendation here
to something that really does work just
as well and it's way more accessible and
it's the Rimmel scandaleyes in the shade
called mood so scandalizes the line of
eyeliners and this is a pencil that you
can sharpen and it's a great nude shade
you know you just pop it there right
there in the lower inner rim and it
extends the whites of your eyes and it
makes you look so much more awake this
is a matte pencil I was recently playing
around with a Maybelline nude liner and
it actually had kind of a pearlescent
shimmer in it and I didn't notice that
to be quite as effective this I feel
like I can go one swipe across have good
staying power these are really hardcore
staying power pencils and just really
good color intensity all around with
that couple of brands I wanted to
recommend if you're into fun colors like
branching out a little bit outside of
the box I love the next slide on liners
there are so many cool shades I've got
like a flat out silver here but there
are really pretty purples and so many
colors of the rainbow in these and I
feel like they are Nyx's answer to the
Urban Decay 24/7 liner pencils you know
they work just as well they set they
don't move but there is a really fun
color selection so great for that lower
lash line pop or these wear nicely in
the lower inner rim also another great
line for more varied shades is actually
Physicians Formula they sell these cool
little trios that'll give you several
shades usually they claim to be
complimentary to certain eye colors or
there's a certain theme behind it they
do so many things well they're
retractable they're very creamy and they
don't smudge for cream and gel liners
for whatever reason I cannot find my
essence Midnight in Paris that's my
favorite black gel eyeliner I don't know
where it is
I know I've got a tiny person in my
house who sometimes likes to come over
to this drawer I'm just not finding it
but it is my favorite it's from essence
it's so so cheap and they just have that
one shade and a bunch of people have
told me for a while like oh that's
getting discontinued or whatever well
it's still on ulties website if you want
to get it from there and it's just I
think the best black intense budge proof
gel liner also I like color pops liners
they've got a vast color selection of
these cream gel liners and they also set
they make fun bases for certain eye
lifts I've got this mint green called
Zulu here which is really fun and unique
I also love this one called get paid and
it's like a pretty copper type shade
that's gonna be great for fall so that
pretty much wraps up my favorite liners
drugstore price ranges hopefully
whatever you were needing liner wise
fell into one of those categories and
you're able to track one of those down
and try them out I just wanted to
mention a couple more things that I'm
sure you've seen me use on my channel
and I just wanted to reference here for
you in case you were wondering about
them the Smashbox always sharp liners
you know higher-end brand a little more
expensive but these are a very
innovative design and that you twist the
cap off and you always get a perfectly
sharpened tip right there at the end and
these wear well they come in a nice
color selection they're easy to get you
know just glide across your upper lash
line get right in there close to the
lashes now the Maybelline master precise
skinny I think is very easy to use too
and these stay with a nice fine tip also
but I think maybe what Smashbox has
going for it just a bit more is a few
more colors offered I would love to see
these master precise skinnies come out
in more shades and then not sure if
anybody really considers these more like
eyeshadows and less like eyeliners but
the smudgy jumbo type stick Malley has
some that I've always loved the ever
color shadow sticks or now they're being
called the shadow stick extras there's
been a little formulation change but
they really behaved for me just like the
older ones do they do set for total long
wear you don't have to apply eyeshadow
over them but these are fun is like
smudgy liner on the lower lash line a
lot of
great shades that also lend themselves
to a one shadow look like I've got this
color brownstone here and see how it's
just that kind of medium shimmery Brown
beautiful like all over the lid blend it
out with your finger it's such a nice
little one-step look and there are a lot
of brands that have nice shadow sticks
as well I think the balm has some good
ones the Laura Mercier caviar sticks are
really nice I've just fallen in love
with a lot of shades from Malley so I
guess that's why I'm giving them a
mention here to these Maybelline Color
tattoo jumbo sticks
I like these as well but they are not
quite as precise not quite as small as
the Malley pencils these do set and wear
a really long time I love the bronze
truffle I've also got lilac lusts
against smudgy liner all over the lid
whatever you want to do they're a nice
option thanks again guys for watching I
hope one of these works for you and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
