joining me get ready for a big long I
predict long video kind of getting
caught up on a bunch of new stuff that
I've gotten lately a couple things from
the Sephora vib sale we had an early
Christmas in my family so I've gotten a
few gifts there and then I wanted to
tell you about some things that came in
recently from like Black Friday and
Cyber Monday holes just a lot to discuss
a lot of these things I have gotten to
experiment at least a little bit with so
I thought maybe the feedback would be
helpful if you're still wondering
yourself if you're gonna purchase these
items now I will say my Sephora vib hold
that I got was really screwed up like it
took a long time to get in I got stuff
that I wasn't supposed to get I didn't
get stuff that I was supposed to get and
I'm still waiting for that to get all
worked out but I didn't get a couple of
correct items and some gifts that I
already gave away but one of the things
I did end up getting was the Bobbie to
glow shimmer brick palette and this is
really beautiful the products in here
you got a big mirror first off and then
you've got the shimmer bricks in gold
bronze and wild rose and they are so
super versatile many of you encouraged
me to get this when I was talking about
it in my like VIP wishlist video I
haven't yet like split up the individual
strips and worn them as eyeshadows yet
but I do plan to do that especially with
the bronze because this is the one so
far for the face I've gotten the least
use out of this one I think can totally
pass for a blush and I'm wearing it kind
of like a half and half split today I
have a peachy covergirl blush on and
then I put like equal parts that and
this on that so that's kind of a mix and
then I highlighted with the gold I've
been using the gold a lot lately this
might be my favorite part so far I just
think that's a glorious beautiful
highlight you know it is pretty glowy
you can wear it lightly but it's not
something I would say is by nature a
soft highlight like that can go you just
have a very metallic look and if you've
got fine lines or problematic skin
texture up in this zone it may not look
good there but these are said to be some
of Bobby Brown's like best selling
shimmer bricks so I'm excited too
have that think it's a good deal they
are a little bit smaller than a
full-size though cuz I only own one and
it's in the shape nectar and I notice
these are just a little bit smaller than
that and because I really have no place
else to go with this stuff I'm just
gonna start putting it right back over
here okay so if you see a pile growing
of stuff I've talked about that's where
that's going another thing that I
ordered from the Sephora vib sale was
this Clinique black honey what was the
official name of it here's the box that
came in 3250 very honey holiday palette
kind of cracks me up on the back of this
box because they've gotten very specific
with the shades that are in here and
where they come from for example ivory
bisque from bronze satin duo highlights
from going steady quads stormy from
where everywhere Gray's like everything
in this is coming from somewhere
specific and they have you know already
sorted that out for you palette is
really pretty it's kind of plumbing on
the back side light pink on the top it's
sort of us wishing a little bit it has a
little bit more of a fabric texture
there and then you just press that
button in nice big mirror and a lot of
applicators I've got to be careful every
time I open it because they want to just
fall right out one is a sponge tip one
is a really like sharply angled brush
there you've got a little brush that
could be a nice like crease color brush
like seriously good size nice taper soft
and then a little an angled brush that's
sort of you know I would say maybe it
could do some packing shadow on the lid
it could also wedge something up into
the crease this could be somewhat
versatile depending on what you need I
thought they looked really really pretty
on Sephora's website and I still feel
you know it's it's a beautiful color
selection if you're one who enjoys a
neutrals be things that verge a little
bit on plum and burgundy that's
definitely the kind of look you can
achieve with this I'm wearing it today
and I've got this beautiful like
champagne pink color I think that's one
of the really pretty shades in here I've
got that on the lid this shade in the
crease and a little bit of this Burgundy
in the crease as well you've got a itty
bitty purple down here that can
definitely take your look in a more like
prominently purple direction
but I've enjoyed it so far I like the
quality of Clinique shadows I don't know
that I necessarily like this palette
better than some of the ones that are
little you know rectangular shaped
palettes and one other small gripe might
be the fact that this circular shadow
format well it's cute at a glance I
don't always like it when brands like
figure out you're gonna need more of
this shade and less of this shade they
seem to be just really randomly thrown
into this pattern because it's not like
it's all your deep dark shades in the
little ones cuz you've got like a little
highlight there there's a mid-tone shade
that's been put in a small size so I
don't really know what the rhyme or
reason was with that then as a Christmas
gift I got another version of that type
of palette and this is the indulgent
color palette so this can give you kind
of a good glance without any glare at
the difference between the two the
indulgent color palette honestly not
that color falls out like a seafoam II
sort of green in here it's got a couple
of Purple's that are gonna stand out I
think as a little more purpley maybe
than some of the plums and the other
palette there is an absolute knockout
bronze in here but beyond that it's a
really a pretty neutral palette I would
say a lot of cool neutrals in here and
it's the same brush selection so I'm
gonna go ahead and take those out here
you go
there's the eyeshadow selection there's
that really great bronze that one is
just above and beyond for the entire
palette and of course that's only coming
to you in the tiniest size possible but
I enjoy and will use both of these
palettes I think Clinique eyeshadows are
hugely underrated I think they're nice
textures surprising pigmentation to work
with on a lot of things I just I don't
think this whole like format and layout
is my favorite and I would say I like
the black honey want a little bit better
I think it's a better color scheme
overall that I enjoy and then also it's
got more matte and shimmer mixed in this
one only has three maths and some of the
shimmers are like very very shimmery
we're not talking just like a borderline
satin finish but I feel like there's a
lot of shine on some of these so
certainly excited to have it but you
know me I like to point out you know
everything I'm thinking about it in case
it might be helpful to you while we're
talking Clinique another thing that I
got this is called the tiny temptation
set it's in a nice little tin here
and I just kind of keep the top
underneath but it's a bunch of their
itty-bitty chubby sticks okay and the
ones that I have turned upside down are
the chubby stick intense versions just
so at a glance I would be able to see
which ones those were but there are 20
lip products in here y'all and it's all
about sampling it's not about getting a
lot of product per thing because really
what you've got to work with is
basically the tip here because it's not
a twist up thing and as far as I can
tell it's not even a push up thing
either correct me if I'm wrong any of
you who have found a way to get more out
of these but to me it appears that is
just the tip but even so certain ones
that I feel like I've used a lot like
this curviest caramel I've used this
quite a bit and it seems like it's
barely worn down so if you really are
sampling through all of them I think
you've ultimately got quite a bit of
product here to work with it's like what
kind of person are you are you the type
who just you know give me one or two lip
colors and I'll be happy or do you
always like to bounce around if you're
constantly constantly bouncing around
you might have a lot of fun with this
now I only have a few chubby sticks
actually in my collection
and I'm going to show you the back side
here just because it's not catching the
light quite so much you can see it a bit
easier but there's quite a range color
wise you've got neutrals Reds a little
bit of a Coralie color selection getting
into pinks and berries and then some
plummy purpley tones the chubby sticks
themselves the regular ones are pretty
sheer they're kind of like just a sheer
tinted balm and a thing that I think
some people might really like about them
is that there's not a really pungent
scent like I don't feel like I smell
anything with them and so that may be
appealing to some people your chubby
sticks are overall sheer and then the
chubby stick intense variety is more
like a cream lipstick and they actually
don't give off a lot of shine on the
lips so I feel like with a little bit of
wear they're almost like a moisturizing
matte lipstick if that makes any sense
so I've really fallen in love with the
chubby stick intense variety mostly and
I've had this for a little while now and
I still haven't sampled everything but
if you guys are interested
in a more in depth likes watch them all
out try them all on I would be open to
doing that I think that actually would
be really fun but that's what that whole
thing looks like and that is a big part
of why I wanted to go ahead and do this
video because I figured you guys would
tell me you know what products you would
like to see more specifics on more
tutorials involving you know that type
of thing we're just adding to the day
core back here by the way do you like my
new reindeer
that's my new reindeer from Hobby Lobby
kind of a wooden rustic rustic reindeer
look there and then I got that little
tree as well this tree by the way
actually lights up
could you tell yeah it lights up but I
felt like maybe that's gonna mess with
my ultra sensitive camera so I'm gonna
just keep it back there so let it be
turned off and not bothering anybody
okay next gifty thing that I received is
from Tarte and it is the kissing squad
had a lot of questions about this
actually when I had reviewed a bunch of
Tarte gift sets but this was not one of
them many of you were asking how this
was and so first off what the heck is it
well they are double ended lip products
and this is a product that tart sells in
their line these lipstick and lip gloss
duos but every shade in this collection
is limited edition so the shade I'm
wearing today is kitten and that's this
one so it's the most nudie lipstick of
the bunch and then you get this creamy
lip gloss and as well and I will say I
like the formula very much these
lipsticks are super creamy bordering on
actually feeling moisturizing and really
nice on the lips and you're just gonna
get this glossy creamy appearance not
that you have to put the gloss on top
but if you do there's a lot of shine
that can be achieved with all of these
shades kitten is right here this is minx
just a little bit deeper alert is your
deepest berry shade and then pixie is
more of a soft berry my one complaint
about this set is just the color
selection they gave you because I feel
like these two nudes ultimately are very
close and these two pinky berries are
very close as well you know it would
have been great if one of them was a red
or one of these was like a light pink
they could have just made that a little
bit different I think it would have been
nice because once these are applied on
the lips I
feel like I've got almost identical
shades here and very close colors there
as well but I do like the formulas so
I'm happy for that again I gotta remind
myself not everybody is like insane like
me they're looking for variety looking
for 20 different colors you know maybe
you're like I wear a lot of berries I
also wear a lot of nudes so here that's
what I'm getting I think so many people
would be pleased with this like I said
they feel great I've been wearing this
one for probably like an hour before
even getting this video shot and while
the gloss has worn down some I still
feel like I've got plenty of color and
one of the berries I was wearing the
other day I thought that held up really
nicely too and the other thing that I
will just mention here because I have a
full video on it already
this Fiona Styles mistake-free makeup I
am face contouring palette overall I
really like this I think this is full of
good quality stuff and it's been
recently marked down like 10 bucks to I
think around $29 on altas website
everything in here is something
available as part of the regular lines
so when you kind of look at it that way
and you think about the price tag it's a
really good deal love this color scheme
and the eyeshadows you got a bronzer two
highlights and two blushes again i've
swatched everything out applied it in my
specific review video on this already a
lot of people myself included a little
bit put off by the fact that there's
some wasted space in this palette and it
could have been either scrunched in or
more product potentially added but I
don't know if they added a lot more
product they're probably not gonna give
it to you at the $29 price tag but if
you're a fan of all-in-one easy you know
don't make me tote around a whole bunch
of different products with me on the go
this is definitely one way to achieve
that now Friday night of Black Friday
and I did a little online shopping and I
picked up a few things from Ulta and
Sephora actually quite a few things I
got some gifts that I want to give and
just some random things here and there
that I thought I'd try out because the
price was right got a hair that's
floating through the sky that keeps
landing on my nose and it's just the
sorry long video of let's stay focused
here
one thing that I got from Ulta went
ahead and got this bareMinerals the
cashmeres palette I was back and forth
on this so much because I thought is
this to blah is it too bland I mean I
don't know you guys tell me it's all
matte I'm not sure what I think about it
yet I've only worn it once was very
pleased with the application and how
pigmented they were but as you can see
it's gonna be a soft palette and it's
not gonna be the kind of palette that
gives you like massive variety from day
to day like you're gonna bounce around
and get drastically different looks with
with different color combos everything
is just really soft and I thought this
shade right here your deepest color
looked darker um online and it's really
not that dark this color called cozy so
it's one of those things that's kind of
in limbo for me right now I think
quality again is good but is it really
worth it the shadows are humongous so if
you are one of my viewers who is in that
professional environment day in and day
out you want your eye looks to be kind
of barely there don't want to be too
overdone with shadow and you like your
Matt's this might be a good option
actually this might be something my mom
would love because she wears very little
eye shadow this shape called delightful
if your my skin tone or lighter I think
it will give you a little bit of depth
in your crease and then you can work in
one of the lighter colors and I really
do like this color called cozy I have
not worked with toasty yet which is this
little more yellowy toned one in the
center for the right person that palette
could be perfect but it's certainly not
gonna be for everyone another palette
that I got you know it's $15 and I
thought okay let's try it out it's from
pure I'm just not really feeling this
one I love the compact size it's called
the revolution eyeshadow palette and
they give you the fully charged mascara
which is nice I just feel all over the
place in this video what do I hold up
what do I show there's a good look at
the brush though it's a nice like
regular bristle brush and I thought it
lengthened out well I thought it's
separated pretty well not necessarily
better than my current like mascara top
5 but it's decent and then this is what
you're getting shadow wise it's a very
very smoky color selection I like this
shade at the end even though it's not
super intense this color called
about-face
is a pretty like dark rusty mat when
these shades start mixing around on your
eyes it honestly can very quickly and
easily become a muddy type of look
textures were kind of and I think pure
has some better products out there and
that was just kind of a Miss for me I
picked up something for bub I'm not too
worried about him watching this video
and finding out about it I got this best
of Jack set and it's a face lit body
they give you a turbo wash energizing
cleanser for hair and body he's probably
tried some of these things before
because I think he's reviewed them but
he's always going through stuff like
this so you know you can always use more
there's a clean break oil-free
moisturizer and then a mint lip balm
so let's actually get these out and see
what sizes were working like this was
1850 okay that's three fluid ounces for
the turbo wash and that's for hair and
body and then the lip balm I know bub
he's hooked on using that dang cocoa
butter in the yellow tube that he's been
using over and over for years before bed
and he swears that he can put it on
before bed and his lips are fine like
for the entire day I know that's a
magical product for him but a lot of
people love the Jack buck lip balms and
then this is the size of the moisturizer
again oil free clean break moisturizer
with organic white tea and niacinamide
feel big it'll be a nice little thing to
add on to his other gift which he's
getting a really nice like leather type
of satchel slash briefcase something
that he can use you know going into
court and he's got his documents and
stuff that he needs to tote around with
him he doesn't currently have the best
bag to do that with and so I got him a
really nice one from Samsonite and I
think it's gonna be great quality it
just came in the mail the other day I
was looking it over I'm so thrilled with
it and I feel like guys can be touchy
about bags you know so I definitely I
got his feedback on it I kind of got a
little seal of approval before I place
the order something I got for myself
from Ulta is this why don't brands do
this kind of thing more I love this it's
a lash look book from ardell Ulta
exclusive $24.99 and you're getting one
two three four five six seven eight
styles and you're just getting one so
you can just try it on one side no I'm
just kidding you're getting the whole
lash oh I didn't know this
in a little duo glue in there and that's
kind of cool too I thought there were a
lot of styles in here that I would like
to wear I'm really interested in this
one 13 right down here it's a nice range
of very natural to more lengthy and
dramatic and I just think more brands
need to do this especially drugstore
price range brands like this it's hard
to even for me to visualize how is that
gonna actually look on my lashline and
so here you're getting all these kinds
to play with I think that's fantastic
what a great gift idea
take note other brands do this oh my
gosh I feel like I'm yelling here to my
camera moving on to some things I got
from Sephora on Black Friday they had a
bunch of things like Martin down to ten
dollars I think a lot of this stuff was
in that category so I'm just gonna run
through it for you got this little tart
rainforest of the sea lip duo why I
really wanted to try this is because the
one thing in here is the lip facial and
that's their version of like the elf lip
exfoliator stick and so I had to see if
this Tarte one was as good and frankly I
do not like it nearly as well as the elf
it feels like it just kind of goes to
mush on my lips don't get me wrong it
does contain scrubbies it's kind of like
a sugar scrub going on in there and you
can get some exfoliation happening but I
feel like I've got pull in my finger and
kind of keep the stuff contained on my
lips it's like the stick is too soft you
know and elf's is really solid you can
apply a little pressure you can feel
like you're actually getting in there
some exfoliation going and this one just
not not up to par for me but you also
get this little guy which is very cute
it's not like little seashells on it and
it says nude what is it it says on the
back it's lip rescue and it's just like
a little stick here it smells really
minty and it's just a very sheer type of
bomb if you want to get a friend into
you know lip exfoliating and give a
great gift spend five bucks and get them
the elf lip exfoliator that comes with
the matte lip crayon thingy and skip
this you know ten dollar tart set I
would say another cool deal that I got I
can't remember if this was 10 or 15
bucks but it's the perfect and cleanse
sponge trio you get too many sponges so
the
is what I've been using then there's a
purple one there's a mini solid cleanser
down in the bottom which i think is
awesome because I can compare that and
see how it works compared to the
Beautyblender solid and then you get a
big one as well I thought wow those are
kind of interesting shapes I'm sort of
obsessed with trying different sponges
all the time
they're really soft they work
wonderfully well they feel so much like
the texture of the Real Techniques
sponges this shape is cool because it's
like you're getting two sponges in one
this side goes really well around the
eye area and then this I find myself
just using it from the side to kind of
bounce in the foundation this also nice
around the eyes or larger areas or
contour I think this is my first time
ever trying Sephora brand sponges and I
am very impressed the colors are fun I
promise we're getting toward the end
here I've got a few other things that I
got as little like add-on gifts for
people one of these is from is it toca
the little rollerball collection here I
heard good things about this it's the
spice collection they're giving you
Cleopatra Brigitte and Colette little
rollerball fragrance samplers I am kind
of convinced that roller balls are
awesome and so great for travel or the
purse after trying that clean set which
I'm having trouble finding that clean
set anywhere but these just sounded
really good so I've got gifting plans
for that also have gifting plans for
this neat little guy look at this I mean
come on
Clinique just has some really cute boxes
going on and this is called the sparkle
and glow set and you get the foaming
sonic facial soap and the dramatically
different moisturizing lotion plus I've
got a person on my list who's already
getting a few kind of beauty related
things and I know they have used a lot
of Clinique in the past so I thought you
know maybe they might like to try that
and then another $10 Black Friday thing
that I picked up the Sephora collection
essential rose skin trio I think this is
gonna make a fantastic gift to I know I
like their Rose face mask but here you
also get one sleeping pod whatever the
heck that is and then a little pack of
25 cleansing wipes so I'm not gonna bust
into this right now it's all nicely
sealed but I thought
that was an awesome deal and I love the
Rose scent by the way I know I had
mentioned getting the big Sephora sheet
mask set from the vib sale and I did get
that and I gave that as a gift to my
sister so I hope she's enjoying it I
also got her the Besame red lip
collection and a little Besame like
matchstick set have you seen those for
like five bucks they're little lipstick
matches and I got her one of those super
cool Besame brushes also but like I said
there's still some things from that
order that are being worked out that got
screwed up and then on Cyber Monday I
did manage to get this Kat Von D locket
brightening powder these are brand new I
believe and I got mine in the shade
petal they had various shades and I
remember going between petal and
something that looked like an even
deeper peach I'm glad I didn't go any
darker than this though it says less
weight no cake instant under-eye
brightening smooths under eye area I am
wearing that on my under eye area today
and I just used it lightly I didn't bake
with it yet I've just kind of swept it
on there first time trying it but I feel
like my lighting and the camera is
washing this out just a little bit more
than real life to me it looks like a
very light peach you truly can't come up
with a verdict on an under eye setting
powder until you've worn it like
throughout the entire day because a lot
of things look really nice at the onset
but you've got to keep an eye on it and
see how it actually goes but you guys
that is my mega haul I know it's been a
long haul because my butt hurts from
sitting in this chair and this chair is
even padded but thank you guys for
watching I hope you had fun and I will
talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
