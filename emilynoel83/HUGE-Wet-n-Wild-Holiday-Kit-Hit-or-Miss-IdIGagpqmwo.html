long review on a product you might have
run across in Walgreens
it's from wet and wild to the Fergie
collection specifically it says Fergie
centerstage limited edition beauty
University Palace so it is one of those
massive holiday palettes it's 30 bucks
and the reason why I got this my friend
David had texted me he's a makeup artist
at Bergdorf Goodman in New York and we
share a similar fascination with great
quality drugstore makeup and he said
wouldn't it be amazing if that big
palette actually was all the same
quality shadows as the wet and wild
color icon palettes like the 8 color
palettes and the trios you know the ones
I'm talking about the really good ones
and I kind of assumed it wouldn't be
that good I had gotten one of these
palettes I think it was 2 years back and
it really wasn't that great quality wise
but then I had what he said just sort of
in the back of my mind and I thought
next time I'm in Walgreens I've got to
go ahead and pick it up and just try it
for you guys so I got it and this is a
massive palette makeup-wise it's fitting
in kind of a stair-step fashion right
here and then two wings kind of come out
from the side the packaging is really
like my biggest complaint with this
because there's just so much excess like
this whole area right here has nothing
in it and you could maybe have done like
a flat palette with a tray underneath or
something like that that would have
taken up less space but I do think that
they're going for you know some majorly
impressive effect with this opening up
and you see all the shadows I get what
they're trying to do I just don't
appreciate it for the purposes of makeup
storage or travel this is absolutely
nothing I'm going to be taking with me
when you open up this top panel it does
fold back in kind of a nice way so you
do have a mirror that actually stands up
so if you were to set this on a desk in
front of you you would have a mirror at
eye level and then as I said there are
those rows and rows of shadows there's a
bunch of sponge tip applicator --zz for
different double-ended sponge tips down
here at the bottom and then you've got a
little hole so you can pull out each
side one side all the way down
you've got lip glosses and potentially
some that feel a bit more like a
lipstick a cream lipstick consistency
and then on this other side you've got a
bunch
of cream shadows glitter shadows glitter
over sprays just all sorts of things
happening there I'm gonna be showing a
ton of swatches throughout here of all
of the products in this palette also a
little eye shadow demo as well just kind
of cut to the chase as far as the
quality of these shadows no I don't feel
like they took the color icon shadows
like the kind in the comfort zone or the
walking on eggshells you know little
trios we're not talking about that good
of quality in this palette I mean those
are incredibly soft eye shadows those
are shadows that I think are amazing you
know for their price and what we're
seeing here I think would be a little
bit closer to the Fergie style
eyeshadows which aren't bad if you've
seen the Fergie collection you know
they've got those little like five color
palettes where there's one shade in the
middle I'm not saying those are bad
shadows but they are not that really
rich creamy incredibly impressive
quality that your color icon shadows
have from just the regular wet and wild
line but really I'm very surprised at
how good quality these shadows are as a
whole um there are some hit and miss
ones in there I feel like the lighter
more shimmery shades so any pastel type
shades just the lighter toned shimmers
seem to come off rather sheer but the
deeper mattes the colorful Matt's really
popped and there were some metallic
shades in here that were really
impressive as well before I show you
swatches I want you to know I did one
swipe swatches of these so I kind of did
it like a swirl in the product with my
finger just one time and then boom
swatched it on my arm I think it's
important to note that because I want
you to know that I consistently did all
of these the same way I also didn't
swatch these on top of any sort of
primer I never do that and what you
could take from this is perhaps if you
would build the product up more than
what you see here you could potentially
achieve more color but putting them all
on the same playing field with one swipe
this is what these products can do
looking across the top row yellows you
know very very soft with some of the
lighter shades and then boom you get
into some kind of pigmented metallic
colors your next couple of rows oranges
and reds again here's where you start to
see some very bold match
Jayde's that surprised me so much again
with the lighter shades not super
impressed with those there's a light
lilac that is really as close as you're
getting to any sort of purple in this
palette and that one was pretty flaky I
used it in my look today and wasn't very
impressed your next couple of rows
here's where color really really shines
with the lime green you've got kind of
like a couple deeper almost seafoam
green type colors really interesting
shades down to the next row a pretty
great metallic silver some turquoise
teal type blues getting into more royal
blues and then in your next couple of
rows lots of brownish neutrals we've got
metallics we've got mattes there is a
really great matte brown in here that I
think people are gonna like something I
notice an application when you stick
your brush in some of these matte shades
they can kick up some product be
prepared for that but in a lot of cases
I like to have more than I need and have
to tone it down a notch on application
than having to constantly scrub into the
product and build up and then your final
two rows Silver's Gray's metallic colors
shimmery charcoal shades matte blacks
some of the lightest silvery shades on
that second-to-last row not really doing
it for me but you definitely do have a
couple of great Silver's in this palette
and that blacks are good some of these
mats to the touch will feel a little bit
on the dry side but then you see the
swatch and you're like well they really
have a lot of pigment happening there
the metallic colors are probably where
the best feel is those are probably the
closest ones to having that feel of the
regular wet and wild color icon shadows
everything else you know the lighter
shimmery shades as I said are more the
weakness of the eyeshadows but as a
whole I was really shocked I was shocked
that there was so much pigment in some
of those bright shades and they really
turned out to be kind of like what you
see is what you get type eyes shadows
and again I only swatch these with one
swipe I was not building up the color
now let's talk about the lip products
you pull out this little side tray
you've got a bunch of little like
rectangular pans and then some circular
pans that are the same size as the
eyeshadows I feel like in the
rectangular ones we're seeing more sheer
glosses
overall and i've swatched all of those
together so many of these look similar
I've built up colors on my lips you will
see me try on some of these on the lips
and I feel like they're really looking a
lot alike with one exception and that is
the shade I've been wearing throughout
the video there's kind of a rest colored
shimmery gloss that really seems to be a
completely different formula that's kind
of opaque and different and it's so
interesting the inconsistencies that you
sometimes run into with large palettes
like this but something that these
glosses really showed me is just how
shallow these pans are filled for
example when I was just going into
swatch and I wasn't making a huge effort
to like scoop out product but just to
put my finger in there I was hitting pan
just with my fingers and the same
happened with some of these more
lipstick type formulas with the circular
ones I won't say these are all as opaque
as you would expect a lipstick to be but
some are some were really good just a
few here and there it seems like the
deeper the shade you know the better the
color would come off but I did try just
a string of random ones on my lips for
you so you could get an idea of what I'm
talking about deeper you go the more
chance for color there is getting into
the nudes though that one very sheer
just kind of like a milky wash of color
on the lips now let's talk about these
glitters I have been a huge critic of
glittery over sprays in my time here on
YouTube I think it's such like a cheat
there are definitely some over sprays
happening here but first off I'll talk
about the rectangular pans going down
the far side there are a couple of over
sprays with the pink and purple but most
of these are just straight-up creams the
greys I didn't find to be super
pigmented but like the green the blue
the gold and the kind of rusty brownish
shade those were really nice
those could make nice bases I think use
sparingly and you could pair them with
some of your powder shadows and you
might get a really good color punch
going on they're used alone they would
be pretty greasy I can just tell from
the consistency to touch them then you
look to the round shades to the right
and here's where we're talking glittery
over sprays varying textures of glitter
as you can see with the swatches in some
cases you're dealing with really thick
chunky glitter and the
where the glitter is more fine it seems
like those are not over sprays but more
so creamy shadows with glitter suspended
within the cream shadow but with like
the purple the pink the red those kinds
of shades I think you can see the thick
size of the glitter that you're working
with here and I think what makes these
shades a little more usable than most
glitter over sprays are that these pans
are so small they're also very shallow
as I said so when you put your finger in
there the simple act of doing that
almost mixes I think the overspray a bit
more with the gel underneath a lot of
these aren't going to be things I'm
gonna wear on a daily basis for more of
a costume play makeup type look you know
these might be fun I could see dabbing a
few of these maybe on top of your eye
look to give it that glittery effect but
keep in mind the more you use the more
gel is coming with it and the more that
could impact your staying power so as a
whole what do we think of this palette
it's $30 okay so I think you're getting
a lot of nice eyeshadows you're not
getting a lot of any one product be it i
shadow 's lip glosses the glitters that
the person who's going to enjoy this
most is one who really is looking to
experiment you know if you're just gonna
stick to your neutral shadow shades you
don't need this big palette of all these
colors but if you're wanting to branch
out and try some new things
shadow wise I think you've got a really
nice selection to work with not so good
on the lips and also the glittery stuff
that's gonna vary person to person I'm
sure there's someone out there who's
saying yes I want red glitter shadow
other people are thinking I wouldn't
touch that shade with a 10-foot Pole the
bulky packaging is really a deal-breaker
for me as far as how much I'm going to
use this so what I would say is this if
shadow is really your main focus and
you're into some of the brighter shades
and even the mix with the neutrals look
into you know those pallets from Coastal
Scents or I know BH Cosmetics makes them
to their flat pallets they've got tons
of different shades the pigmentation is
really good I can speak for the Coastal
Scents ones because that's what I have
most of I believe Coastal Scents also
has a big lip palette as well I mean you
could get something like that stack them
up and have you know something sort of
similar to this palette but something
that's much easier to take with you
before I leave you I want to show you a
quick eye look that I did using this
palette and I did put on a primer first
and then I used this really outstanding
brown shade in my crease I think it's
just a great classic brown crease color
it really just kind of gets the look
going I also want to buck the brown with
the light creamy shade in that same row
as my highlight and then I used a matte
blue so you can see how that goes on
pretty darn pigmented I must say all
over the lid and on the inner part of
the lid I use this shimmery lilac and so
in comparison I mean this is a pretty
flaky shade it's pretty light I also
smudged a little bit of blue on the
lower lash line and I finished off the
look with some black liner some light
liner in the lower inner rim and some
false lashes as well didn't incorporate
any of the glitters or creams into the
look just because my priority I thought
the thing people would be most
interested in or most concerned about
what this palette would be how the
powder shadows performs so I wanted to
stick to those for this look bottom line
with this palette surprisingly good
quality eyeshadows not so impressed with
the lip products and for my personal
preference I don't love the glitters
although I thought the creams the non
glittered creams were pretty good in
this set it's definitely not a dud
product by any means but I do think the
storage is not very practical you know
just the size of this pallet and if you
wanted to really save some space you
could get a flat palette from let's say
Coastal Scents and it would give you a
ton of color variety but be much easier
to house in your makeup storage so I
hope this helped you guys out thank you
for watching thank you David for
inspiring me to do this video and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
