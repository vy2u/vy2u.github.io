spyler he has more popular demand yeah
Tyler believe me I printed out all the
comments my motivation but I we got the
mountain any positive comments Tyler
just loves it so we shouldn't do the you
know hmm but anyway um yeah I thought
it'd be fun to bring tyler back for a
little cameo appearance in one of the
videos because i don't know you guys are
probably getting tired of just me
showing up all the time saying hey guys
so anyway this video is going to be just
some questions that i've compiled over
time and i thought all do a video on
that will do a video on that but then I
thought well just do a video on all of
it all things hair related so I just
compiled some frequently asked questions
and taught and Tyler's just going to be
kind of interviewing me about it based
on some of the questions you guys have
been asking he has a note part that's
from an old video on the back so anyway
okay let's get started so what is your
haircut okay well my haircut is actually
um my hair comes off I think a lot
shorter when it's done that actually is
because it's cold quite often so really
if my hair is not curled if I can show
you its down 20 long yeah um uh but I
have a like some long layers in my hair
and some of the shorter layers um no
they're probably like this this short so
the layers come down to about here and
then they just kind of go on from that
point I have sort of a side bang going
on here that is cut in that way so it's
sort of if you can tell by the lighting
here but it's shorter definitely shorter
layers kind of up around my face but the
funny thing is is that my
mom actually is one that cuts my hair
she was in cosmetology for years and so
I still have my mom cut my hair she
comes to visit me or we go back home uh
she cuts my hair where do you get your
hair cut Tyler I'll go to the same place
my mom gets Tyler's here too so if you
like Tyler's haircut yeah thank thank my
mom Jackie so um but anyway that's been
nice for me because I can really say
exactly what I want don't have to worry
about offending anybody but I mean
nothing I want to spend my mom but I can
kind of say what I want you know to her
as far as what exactly I like and we've
been able to mess with the style over
the years and get hella wanted so I've
caught like a long layered haircut with
this kind of tapered at both sides long
enough answer for you it was good feel
very well informed good alright you
color your well never is kind of
interesting thing requires a long
explanation um I Tyler you've known me
for a while is this pretty much my
natural hair color yes okay I do color
it though but I color it with what is
called a semi-permanent hair color that
is my natural color pretty much i use
the clairol natural instincts and the
color is nutmeg and that is dark brown
that's kind of its description and the
reason why I do that is this is
something my mom suggested me a while
back because I have very very fine hair
and using a color on it can actually
give it more texture so that's what i do
i do it every couple of months usually
and since it's semi opponent what that
means is you're not going to like your
hair is not going to grow out and show
color on the roots it just kind of fades
naturally over time and since it really
does match my color i never really know
when it's gone or not but i can feel the
difference when it's freshly colored and
that is a very good hair color with the
conditioner that comes with it it smells
like Tyler's commented at times like
your hair smells good or whatever it
it's a conditioner treatment that comes
with that you use once a week to help
with the color and it really makes it
shiny and very very healthy
that's a really good way to experiment
maybe with your hair colors I'm I'm
preaching to the choir is Tyler doesn't
tell her his hair but his hair is try
see if it comes off darker no I think
that's pretty much what hair color looks
like it's blond yeah little water in the
summertime it's all lighter yes you
would expect Hey yeah good point so what
shampoo do you use what shampoos mom you
are you implying that I rotate shampoos
what I do I kind of use a lot of
shampoos I was just using the Pantene
pro-v full and thick or something like
that I didn't get been discontinued
because I bought it at big wats but what
I've started using recently joe says of
a couple weeks ago is the generic
products you can get at sally beauty
supply only this is the matrix amplify
shampoo and conditioner it's the
volumizing stuff which actually costs
about fifteen dollars a bottle I got
both of these for ten dollars on a
special deal otherwise they would
probably total twelve dollars cuz
they're 599 each mm-hmm okay thank you
but um it's supposed to generate volume
with each use it's really hard to gauge
if the shampoo is really working because
obviously your hair dries you use other
things in it you don't know maybe what's
doing what but this is supposed to be
really good quality I've heard good
things about matrix amplify and you're
not going to be able to see this but it
lists the envy is it ingredient in Greek
I think of ingredients is just being in
food then no nevermind boom that's okay
and the the what is in this bottle is
the very same exact same stuff that's in
the major example if I like if you
compare the ingredients list it's the
very same stuff so you can feel good
about that if you try the generic
stuff that you're getting you know the
same thing basically I guess the
packaging isn't very pretty is it black
in the light not too stylish but you
know it's supposed to work good so
anyway that's available at sally beauty
supply they have a lot of different um
generic versions except moving along so
how do you style it i style it and say
for this style which is just kind of
like wavy kind of loose curls I like to
use these velcro rollers they come in a
lot of different sizes small 22 quite
large and i would say i'd go down to
maybe this medium size and i use this
one on the big one i use bigger ones up
top smaller ones towards the bottom to
make more curls you know so you want
more curls at the bottom and this to
just kind of keep that wave you would
want like a spiral curl right there for
example so i use those in the morning
I'll blow dry my hair use a curling iron
I use this Revlon one it's about that
big I don't know how big is that an inch
engine inch and a half are you measuring
by circumference diameter oh I just want
it it's this size no it's not haha but
it's i use this basically just put your
put that on your hair put a roller in
that from there and then i put some
hairspray on it i like to use the vo5
extreme styles like two dollars between
one and two dollars at walmart and that
locks in your car you leave them in for
maybe 10 15 minutes take them out and
you got volume used a are you Joe I was
just confused I was supposed to ask you
what styling products you use but you oh
I guess we're just going at it dippin
number five I use the full of comb um
that has the thick at the end so you can
tease your hair i usually backcombing up
in here in the crown I'll do a video on
this I am going to do a video
on this to explain it more but give it a
little more volume and then of course we
spray it with the hairspray at the end
so you just kind of want to pay
attention when you take out rulers you
want to try to rush it so you're not
like brushing brushing straight down
kitten but kind of brush with a stroke
like that or use a rounded brush it kind
of lets the hair wrap around it and keep
that curl so if you're confused like
okay I take it out of the rollers and
then then what you still want to brush
through it to get it blended but just do
it gently and you know kind of use that
same stroke as you're trying to you know
work that around here to work with your
side bangs because a lot of people use
those these days so anyway I know this
is going to leave a lot of questions and
probably well how exactly did you do
that so look for a video kind of on the
whole roll or technique coming up
alright last question okay people want
to know how do you make your hair shine
how do you make your hair shiny and I
don't know if this is this may not be
specifically directed toward my hair but
just how does a person you know help
their hair be shiny and i would say
conditioner is a big part of it that
aussie three minute miracle that i did a
video on not too long ago which I
actually just did that treatment last
night and it makes it makes your hair so
soft is it soft yes yes oh that's what I
use once a week at some kind of deep
conditioning thing like that especially
in the winter is a good idea because
your hair and your skin can get really
dry and it's getting cold here isn't it
Tyler friesen yeah and it's only gonna
get colder right it's what I hear what
he heard from watching the news this
morning usually yeah so you think this
is hey we're past ten minutes now I
guess I should probably wrap this thing
I know yeah good anything I wanted to
open for closing thoughts closing
thoughts about all here also good for
making it shine would be the omega-3
fatty acids like fruit
things like oh yeah like the fish oil
fish oil supplement or eat or eating
fish for eating fish are omega-3 fatty
acids pretty good for you your body all
around yeah they recommend them a lot
okay I take a supplement personally but
also that's much up for the day that's a
tip of the day something with you we
ought to try to leave you with a little
something extra in these videos so
that's right that's right alright well
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this answer to cleared up a few
things for you i hope you enjoyed seeing
tyler smiling face so once again so um
have a great day bye but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
