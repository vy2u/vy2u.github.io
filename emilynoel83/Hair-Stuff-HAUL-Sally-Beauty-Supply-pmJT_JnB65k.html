doing a beauty broadcast live we do it
for an hour and a half every Thursday
9:00 a.m. Central Time on beauty vlog
cast my other channel and you can go
back and watch it if you missed it but
we talked about old TV shows the hash
tag of the week is thank you for being a
friend it's a lot of fun and we talked
about also before we go we always talk
about what people have coming up next
week but they need prayers and good
vibes and love for so it's just a good
time it's a bonding experience and I
love makeup I love wearing my I love
makeup shirt I'm actually doing a video
about hair stuff because I went to Sally
Beauty Supply a few days ago I
instagrammed a pic of this bad boy and
you guys said yeah I'd like to see a
fall and so I said hey I'd like to do
one so this is my new curling iron I
decided I needed a larger sized curling
iron from what I've been using because
my other large one that I had this is
one and a quarter inch and my other one
from Revlon conked out on me stuff gets
loose the clip gets loose Revlon curling
irons just don't hold that for me but I
do have you know I'm all set on the wand
style curling irons I love the Remington
t Studio pearl for those I have a hot
tool tiny really compa to that with this
I like the hot tools smaller traditional
style curling curling iron that I got
from Sally's a long time ago still
working great but what these larger ones
are good for for me it's like when I'm
just styling my hair and I want to just
kind of turn it under at the ends or do
something very quickly to it I find I
can do it faster when I'm just taking
you know one of these and just going
through it like that um but this is the
one and only keratin curl it says so
it's purple and white it's real pretty
it has 40 heat settings I think I don't
know how who needs 40 heat settings but
it has a maximum temp is 430 degrees the
box looks like this if you're looking
for it but yeah one of them
Brazilian Tech is I guess the line and
it says consistent high heat for optimum
results I will say that my hair normally
does not last very well with big curling
irons like the curl just doesn't hold
that well but it seems to last longer
with this this is second day hair for me
and it's just got a little bit of a wave
to it but I mean really I can get
through a whole day and my curls I don't
feel like have fallen very much when I'm
using this might be the high heat I
don't know says protects and nourishes
hair strengthens and repairs enhances
shine smoothness and moisture so um
anyway I don't need all the fancy stuff
I just wanted a bigger curling iron so
this is again one and a quarter inch and
I got from Sally's and I am liking it so
far I got another one of these come love
this kind of comb this is great for
teasing and then here you've got this
little part here where you can lift it
up this is so handy for just getting a
little volume in your hair it's kind of
like two tools in one and I think this
was just like a buck ninety-nine this
curling iron by the way was like twenty
nine dollars I think and yeah I have the
Sally Card with the discount thingy so
I'm not sure if I maybe got a dollar two
off with that I so picked up a new hair
product this is main boost amplifying
cream it says lightweight cream that
creates texture adds dimension and heat
protection the way I've been using this
is it's and it's a very lightweight
cream I thought this was going to be a
dupe for something called I think angel
wings by Nick Chavez he does a lot of
volumizing stuff and that's like a real
paste type thing that you can put it on
your hands and like you go like this and
you clap your hands together and it gets
almost like stringy like and you're
supposed to work that into your hair and
it really creates volume I feel like I
just did like a the hand movements there
but this is lighter than that this is
not what that is and I just what I've
been doing is after I take my hair out
of rollers say I put some of this in my
hands tip my head over really work it
into my roofies and kind of scrunch up
the curls a little bit and it does seem
to have a little extra body is
worth the $9 I paid I'm not sure I need
to keep using this but it is I will say
it did not make my hair feel weighed
down or like oh I've got a you know
shower immediately and get this stuff
off my hair like it didn't it wasn't too
heavy so that's good um I got the wrong
color but I got these hot buns people
have been asking me do you know what hot
buns are have you tried hot buns and I'm
like a delicious breakfast pastry um yes
but no not this kind of hot bun which is
something you roll up in your hair and
then you snap it together so whereas
sometimes these little mesh donut things
are sold without snapping and you just
put it put it around and you wrap your
hair around this I guess eliminates the
need for wrapping your hair perfectly
around the bun and you just instead you
know put it around it when it's flat
roll roll roll snap it together and
you're good but I didn't realize there
was only one kind there and apparently
it was the light hair so I just thought
this was the way the box looked but
guess there should have been a brunette
on there it'll probably still be fine I
mean I think my hair I mean if your hair
is not covering this up entirely then it
wouldn't look good
whether it matches your hair or not you
know you don't want to see through it at
all so I'll try I don't care I mean I'm
sure my hair is gonna cover it but I
wanted to test it out for you if you
want to see this used in action let me
know I love a good bun so now I got a
hot bun the things by the way this is
how it comes oh you get a couple it
looks like one's okay one speaker and
one smaller and then they've got like
this little like toggle looking things
that it attaches to okay cool yeah set
of two small and large unexpectedly the
cashier lady gives me this this really
big bag with like faux leather sort of
detail on it tiger-stripe it says spring
Safari bag $29.99 value did not know
that
what's happening but this will be a nice
big bag for me to have hello just a
little haul thank you guys for watching
